<p>Have you ever wondered which pages people look at once they have landed on your site? How do they navigate? The same questions go for designing a new digital product. How do people click through your prototype? How do they navigate and interact with the designed solution? </p>



<p>If you are conducting a UX study, you can turn to <strong>Useberry </strong>for answers!</p>



<p>In this post, I want to show you a very cool feature called <strong>User Flow.</strong></p>



<p>With Useberry’s <strong>User Flow</strong> report you can learn about the path a visitor takes before reaching its destination while you are in the prototype phase of the design.</p>



<p>But, first things first.<br></p>



<h3>What is User Flow?</h3>



<p>User Flow visualizes the path a user follows from one screen to the next. It helps you understand the behavior of your users, how they interact with your prototype, and create a conversion funnel for it.</p>



<p>In other words, it is a graphical representation of which screens users utilize to complete a specific task, how they move around your prototype, and, most importantly, which screens they’re on when they decide to leave.</p>



<p>Let’s say a user lands on the “Home” screen, goes to the “About” screen, and then to “Contact Us” before leaving.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>The user path would then be <strong>Home -&gt; About -&gt; Contact Us.</strong></p></div>



<h3>Why is this important?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The User Flow report can indicate specific points where testers remained longer or got stuck perhaps and help you make changes to enhance the user experience. The easier testers can navigate through your prototype and complete your task, the happier visitors to your final product they’ll become.</p>



<p>Gaining a deeper understanding of how testers are interacting with your prototype can help you optimize your screens for maximum conversions.</p>



<p>This means that you’ll be able to see if there are any specific screens that made users leave your test/prototype. Once these screens have been recognized and then altered with more appropriate or engaging content, you can go back to the User Flow report to check if the number of drop-offs has declined.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>You know what you want and like, but to be effective in the UX industry you need to understand the desires of your prospective users.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Understanding the preferences of your target audience is the first step in optimizing your design for conversions. Your aim is to make it easy for your target audience to find and purchase your products and services.<br></p>



<p>Here are just a few of the user behaviors you can learn about with the User Flow report:</p>



<ul><li>Which paths do your testers favor?&nbsp;</li><li>Which screens have the highest drop-off rate?</li></ul>







<h2>What do they look like?</h2>



<p>If you are familiar with the Google Analytics User Flows then you have an idea of how complex (or simple) a User Flow might look.</p>

<h2>How to use User Flow Report in Useberry</h2>



<p>Now that you know what User Flow is and why it’s important, let’s see how you can find and use the report in Useberry and in your designs.</p>



<p>The best way to explain something is with an <strong>example</strong>.</p>



<p>So, let’s create a simple prototype of a music app and monitor how our potential users interact with/navigate through it in order to complete a simple task.</p>



<p>In the following example, we have a “simple” scenario.</p>



<p>We asked 10 testers to “<strong>Add a track to their wish list</strong>”.</p>



<p>The path that the users “should” take and where they “should” click in order to complete the task appears in the screenshot.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-1024x267.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-1024x267.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-300x78.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/expected-path-768x200.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Expected path users must follow to complete the task</figcaption></figure>



<p>The whole prototype that we are using appears in the following screenshot:</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-1024x573.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-1024x573.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-300x168.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/all-flow-768x430.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>For the purposes of this example, we created the prototype with <strong>Figma</strong> for which we used the <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Useberry plugin (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/788799088384104964/Useberry" target="_blank">Useberry plugin</a></strong>.<br></p>



<p><strong>Let’s start our test:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Task</strong>: Add a track to your favorites list&nbsp;<br><strong>Instructions</strong>: Navigate through the prototype and add a track to your wish list.<br><strong>Type of test:</strong> Single task<br><strong>Number of blocks used in Useberry</strong>: 2 (Single Task, Thank you)<br><strong>Audience</strong>: People from a Facebook group of music fans<br><strong>Number of testers</strong>: 10<br><strong>Time to get back results:</strong> 4 minutes<br><strong>Link to the test</strong>: <a href="https://app.useberry.com/preview/XT84tChQ/">https://app.useberry.com/preview/XT84tChQ/</a><br></p>



<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results.png 865w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results-300x162.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/test-results-768x415.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px"></a></figure></div>



<p>OK, we have 60% success in the single task which means that 4 of our users couldn’t complete the task successfully.</p>



<p><strong>But WHY is this the case? </strong></p>



<p><strong>It was so obvious what they had to do, you might think.<br></strong></p>



<p>Let’s focus on the single task now and look at the results:<br></p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results.png 872w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results-300x243.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/single-task-results-768x623.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 872px) 100vw, 872px"></a></figure>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats.png 891w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats-300x106.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/stats-768x272.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Ok, we can see that 4 users skipped the task.<br></p>



<p>Now, we have 2 options:</p>



<ul><li>Filter the results and watch the session recording of the specific users</li><li>View the user flow and find the pain area </li></ul>



<p>With 10 testers it’s easy to monitor the session recording of 4 users but <strong>on a larger scale</strong> – what would happen if we had more than 100 users?</p>



<p>So, let’s examine the User Flow in order to better understand what happened.</p>



<p>And the results are…</p>



<p>Lines and Curves.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Useberry’s User Flow of the test</figcaption></figure>



<p>This looks a bit complex (or not!) but let’s analyze it anyhow.</p>



<p>Let’s <strong>zoom in</strong> a little bit and explain what we can see here.</p>



<figure><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-1024x713.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-1024x713.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-300x209.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM-768x535.png 768w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-19-at-4.29.52-PM.png 1106w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Think of the User Flow as a table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Every <strong>cell</strong> is an <strong>incremental navigation</strong> <strong>step</strong> and every <strong>row</strong> is a <strong>screen that appeared</strong> on the specific navigation step.</p>



<p>We then <strong>group unique screens with unique navigation steps</strong> and we create the User Flow.</p>



<p>Next to every screen, you will notice a number, and some screens may have a colored number below them. </p>



<p>The number next to the screen is the number of unique users who landed on the specific screen and the number below the screen is an event. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation.png 662w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/event-explanation-300x235.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Here at Useberry, we capture 3 different events:</p>



<p><strong>Yellow event (Skip):</strong> Number of users who skipped the task on the specific step.<br><strong>Blue event (Success):</strong> Number of users who completed the task on the specific step.<br><strong>Red event (Drop-off):</strong> Number of users who dropped-off (totally closed) the test on the specific step.</p>







<p>Now, let’s go back to our example and the results that we have obtained.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/figma-all-flow-1-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Click the image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p>In our User Flow example, we can see that we have <strong>multiple paths</strong> that users followed to complete their task.</p>



<p>(In this specific example, we don’t have users that closed the test before it ended which is why we don’t have red events.)</p>



<p>If we look carefully at the User Flow, we realize that we have 4 different screens that have events under them, which means that we have 4 different flows.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-1024x309.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-1024x309.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-300x91.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/flow-with-paths-768x232.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>click image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Optimal Path</strong></p>



<p>Clicking the”Optimal path” button we can see the most common flow that users took in order to complete their task.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-1024x495.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-1024x495.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-300x145.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/optimal-768x371.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Optimal path</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Oh, wait…</strong></p>



<p>Those are the users that skipped the task!</p>



<blockquote><p>The “top path” is the most common user flow. It’s the series of screens seen by your typical tester. Every app has one. But not every designer knows what it is.</p></blockquote>



<p>Namely,  4 users took the <strong>exact specific path</strong> and these users skipped the task after they landed on a specific screen.</p>



<p>Bearing in mind the expected path and seeing that the optimal path is not the same as the expected path, we can <strong>quickly</strong> figure out that we need to modify our design in order to increase the success of the test.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s go a little deeper, though</strong>.</p>



<p>If we look carefully at the screen where testers split, we can see that that’s where we need to focus.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles.png 668w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/spllited-titles-274x300.png 274w" sizes="(max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px"></a><figcaption>Click on the image to enlarge</figcaption></figure>



<p>We have 8 users who landed on <strong>screen A</strong> and 2 users who landed on <strong>screen B</strong>. On our expected path, the <strong>screen B</strong> is the “expected” screen. The users <strong>MUST</strong> go there in order to complete the task. </p>



<p>So, we have two options – change our design in order to lead these 8 users to <strong>screen B</strong> or design “something” on <strong>screen A</strong> to satisfy our users.</p>



<p>Now let’s see where the users clicked and <strong>why they split</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>How?</strong> </p>



<p>Just click “View Heatmaps” on the specific screen.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2.png" alt="" width="603" height="680" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2.png 603w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/splitted-heatmaps-2-266x300.png 266w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px"><figcaption><br>By clicking heatmaps on a screen you will see where the users clicked when they were on the specific screen and the specific path step</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>And the results are…</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1.png 400w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/heatmap-1-156x300.png 156w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></a></figure></div>



<p><strong>Aha… Interesting! </strong></p>



<p>It seems that our testers and our potential users, in order to add a track to their wish list, first navigate through the specific track. (makes sense!)</p>



<p>Well, a possible solution to this is to satisfy our users when they land on <strong>screen B</strong>. That’s why we changed the design and added a bar with the “add to wishlist” button on the specific screen and run a new test again.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-1024x851.png" alt="" width="580" height="482" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-1024x851.png 1024w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-300x249.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution-768x638.png 768w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/new-solution.png 1063w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px"></a><figcaption>Before – After</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Task</strong>: Add a track to your favorite list&nbsp;<br><strong>Instructions</strong>: Navigate through the prototype and add a track to your wish list.<br><strong>Type of test:</strong> Single task<br><strong>Number of blocks used in useberry</strong>: 2 (Single Task, Thank you)<br><strong>Audience</strong>: From a Facebook group of music fans<br><strong>Number of testers</strong>: 10<br><strong>Time to get back results:</strong> 4 minutes<br><strong>Link to the test</strong>: <a href="https://app.useberry.com/preview/hbtk48wW/">https://app.useberry.com/preview/hbtk48wW/</a></p>



<p>And the results of the <strong>new </strong>test are…</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png"><img src="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results.png 866w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results-300x249.png 300w, https://blog.useberry.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alt-version-results-768x637.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 866px) 100vw, 866px"></a></figure></div>

<p><strong>Amazing!</strong> We actually increased our conversions!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>We managed to find an issue in something we thought was obvious and we resolved it quickly with the help of the user-flows. </p>



<p>Running tests in the design phase helps you save time and effort and solve UX issues that never even occurred to you before.</p>



<p>Maybe the results of the test are obvious but this is just a demo and an example in order to explain what user-flow looks like and how it can help you resolve UX issues.</p>



<p>With more complex prototypes and more testers, the user-flow becomes more complex, too, but we are trying to add features to make it as friendly as we possibly can – it’s up to you if you want to dig into it.</p>



<p>So, happy designing and feel free to come forward with any suggestions!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/vedikaja_in">Vedika Jain</a> on Jan 26, 2021</p><figure id="w-node-171a34cb3a83-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600efa2918ec99dd6420c81a_Screenshot%202021-01-25%20at%2017.01.51.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Weekend Fund is a two-person distributed team. Ryan is based in LA. I’m based in London. We work on the internet. </p><p>There has been a lot of “micro fund” chat on the internet: <a href="https://blogofjake.com/2020/08/24/how-rolling-funds-could-rock-vc/">The rise of rolling funds</a>, <a href="https://thecuriousinvestor.substack.com/p/rolling-funds-and-the-rise-of-the">the rise of Micro LPs</a>, <a href="https://nbt.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-solo-capitalists">The Rise of the Solo Capitalists</a>…</p><p>But little has been shared about how funds like ours operate, and how we aim to: </p><ul role="list"><li>Be the highest helpfulness to check-size ratio investor to our portfolio founders. One of our portfolio founders Harry Hurst tweeted about the concept <a href="https://twitter.com/harryhurst/status/1280165358255538179">here</a>. </li><li>Invest in the best early-stage deals partnering with founders early and driving returns </li><li>Be the best possible fund manager to our LPs: trusted, communicative and high-performing</li></ul><p>‍</p><p>Jeff Lawson, the founder and CEO of Twilio, said this about strategy on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2VHi9azzFenfH4R9SlBHqT?si=nsqv1LKhRa64c5vr1Lqs4Q">Bessemer Venture Partners Cloud Giants Podcast</a>:</p><blockquote>I often say that strategy is a dirty word in business; it should be struck. Any time you find yourself talking about strategy, you’re probably off-course, actually. There’s only one business strategy: serve your customers.</blockquote><p>I agree with that. In venture, I think there’s only one core strategy: serving founders in a differentiated way. We’ve implemented workflows made up of tools, automations and habits to optimize our limited time to create leverage to serve founders.</p><p>Let’s break this down.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Spark</h3><p>Investors spend a lot of time in their inbox. 😅 </p><p>Here’s what makes Spark the best email tool for us:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Shared drafts:</strong> We use each other as a second pair of eyes to review email drafts including offers to invest in companies, deal-flow sharing with other investors and diligence follow-ups. Spark has a collaborative real-time editor that speeds up making edits before sending a draft. </li><li><strong>Spark templates:</strong> We use Spark templates to quickly share details about portfolio companies with other investors when helping founders with their fundraise.</li><li><strong>In-email private chat:</strong> We use this to make quick decisions about the email we receive. This includes cold email, deal-flow from other investors and admin/scheduling.</li></ul><figure id="w-node-37c75a60536c-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600dfe86a1d3df2e88f92e31_spark-chat.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>Airtable</h3><p>Airtable is the central storage for all information on deal flow, investments, and people in our network.</p><p>Here’s what makes Airtable the best tool for us:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Flexible:</strong> It’s flexible enough for us to store anything. We store a lot. </li><li><strong>Relational:</strong> You’ve probably heard that investors are in the relationship business. Relational databases like Airtable aren’t just about storing data, they store relationships between data. This helps us see links between the companies, deals, founders, investors, funds, and more in the WF universe. </li><li><strong>Integration friendly:</strong> It integrates with other tools to make all types of workflows that power the fund.</li></ul><p>Our Airtable “base” includes three primary tables:</p><p><strong>Companies</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>We manage our Pipeline through an “Active Pipeline” view which filters companies we are meeting, diligencing or going to pass on. We also have a Missed view, a Tracking view, a Markups view and more to help us sort through companies. </li><li>We automatically capture pipeline entry and exit dates to track how fast we’re responding to founders. We try to get back to founders with a 7 day “SLA”. </li><li>We also record who introduced us to every deal sourced through an introduction. This links to our People table enriching our CRM. &nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>People</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>This includes founders, investors and others who have introduced us to companies. The table is designed to surface the context of our relationship: i.e for investors, it would surface which deals we’ve co-invested in, which deals they introduced us to, etc. </li><li>We have a “Warm Angel and Small Fund” view we use to share deals with angels + small funds we’re collaborating most with. </li><li>We also have a “Top Introducers” view that filters top introducers based on the # of deals + portfolio companies they’ve introduced us to.</li></ul><p><strong>VC Firms</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>We use this table to capture who is investing at VC firms (linked of course to the People table), and what stages, categories, check sizes they invest in, and if they lead rounds. </li><li>Like our People table, we have a “Warm VC Firms” table we use to share deals with the firms that are most collaborative. It’s also helpful for identifying firms that might be best suited for a particular company based on their stage and market focus. </li><li>What makes this table especially useful for deal-sharing is the subjective context we capture in notes and often share with founders before making introductions. Here’s what a note would look like “Coatue is one of the most data-driven firms and Mazzeo’s one of the most energetic, product-minded investors I know.” Yes, that is a real example.</li></ul><p>🎁 Here’s a digital goodie: <a href="https://airtable.com/shr5i9tJSUl7ob7CY/tblbr0WwfLMZ1a9Mc/viwZ1sYZ9ripf5Ft4?blocks=hide">Template from our Airtable</a></p><figure id="w-node-0a3d187f3df2-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600ee65b3b6b23278218888b_Screenshot%202021-01-25%20at%2015.40.25.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Zapier</h3><p>We automate as much as possible not just to save time, but also to not miss any steps in our processes. We want to be working on the right things, the right way. &nbsp;</p><p>Zaps we have running right now:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Deal channel creation zap: </strong>We have a Zap that automatically creates a deal channel in Slack for every deal we’re meeting from Airtable. More on that below. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/f9ccfed550a2def74cd37da38aab2d00f0780118">Template here</a></li><li><strong>7-day SLA zap:</strong> We have a Zap that sets up a reminder to follow up 7 days after the deal entered our pipeline. This helps us ensure that we get back to every founder in a reasonable time. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/f9ccfed550a2def74cd37da38aab2d00f0780118">Template here</a> (last 2 steps in template)</li><li><strong>Tracking zap:</strong> We have another Zap to follow up on companies we’re tracking. 🎁 <a href="https://zapier.com/shared/71703611e82231e90d81e13e60cd722dc5aad259">Template here</a></li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>Slack</h3><p>Slack works well for our working style at Weekend Fund. Here’s how we use it for deals:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>Our deal creation Zap (as mentioned above) automatically creates a Slack channel for every company we’re meeting</li><li>We consolidate materials/context in the channel before every pitch call </li><li>We share questions for the founder in the channel before every pitch to ensure we’re well prepared </li><li>Debrief + decide next steps immediately after call </li><li>The 7 day SLA Zap goes off in the channel 7 days after the deal entered our pipeline </li><li>We close the channel only after we close the investment or send the pass email + “close the loop” email updating the person who introduced us to the deal</li></ol><p>In addition to deal channels, we have a few more to organize our communications:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>#deal-outbound:</strong> Vedika is using this channel to build a habit of outbound deal sourcing starting with 1x deal a day </li><li><strong>#experiments:</strong> As early stage becomes even more competitive, it feels even more important for us to run experiments. We’ve run experiments like Weekend Build, Fundraise From Home, and are working on our next one. This is the channel we use for experiments related chat. <strong>‍</strong></li><li><strong>#shower-thoughts:</strong> This is a creative safe space where we discuss “What if we tried this?” ideas.</li></ul><p>At the time of this post, we have 25 Slack channels open. This might sound silly for a two-person team, but we’ve found this organization helpful in our communications. Our slack history is a searchable artifact for the years to come.</p><p>‍</p><h3>Vimcal</h3><p>The newest tool in our stack is Vimcal, the calendar app we use for scheduling. Here’s why we use it:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Timezone juggling: </strong>As a distributed team jumping on calls with founders around the world, we do a lot of scheduling across timezones. Vimcal is the best tool we’ve found for this.</li><li><strong>Efficient, but still personal:</strong> Gets us the efficiency of booking links without the risk of it coming off as transactional</li></ul><figure id="w-node-501f9f458622-cdb40311"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f95adbd8f997f228751ac9f/600e0104afcfe91478eedf7c_vimcal-gif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><h3>AngelList Venture Funds</h3><p>AngelList makes it possible for a small team (or single person) to run a venture fund. They provide:</p><ul role="list"><li>Operational support to execute deals - reviewing + signing legal docs and wiring funds</li><li>Tax reporting and accounting overhead </li><li>Capital calls and other LP management </li><li>A dashboard with investment and fund performance data (use <a href="https://angel.co/v/venture/calculator">this calculator</a> to see how your fund performs in comparison to others)</li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>Share Your Stack</h3><p>This is our stack at a high level. There’s a lot more we do behind the scenes, and we’re always thinking about ways to improve our workflows, automations and habits. </p><p>While we don’t expect other fund managers to copy our way of working 100%, we’re hoping that sharing our stack and workflows will be useful for other emerging fund managers. </p><p>If you’re a fund manger, we’d love to see the stack powering your fund on Twitter. Tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/vedikaja_in">@vedikaja_in</a>.</p><p>‍</p><p><em>Thanks to Ryan Hoover, Varadh Jain and Liam Moore for reading drafts of this.</em></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/bytedance">ByteDance</a> is reduces the size and number of its TikTok team in India few months after its was banned by the Indian government.</p>
<p><a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/india">India</a> is one of TikTok’s most prominent markets.</p>
<p>In June, India’s Ministry of Information Technology had blocked 59 Chinese apps claiming they were “engaged in activities prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defense of India, security of state and public order.”</p>
<p>TikTok was part of them. Since that period, the apps have been blocked, this had led <a href="https://relayvibes.co/tag/tiktok">TikTok</a> parent, ByteDance, to announce workforce reduction on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tiktok claimed they have steadfastly worked to adhere to the Indian order from June, saying there is lack of feedback from the government on how the issue is to be resolved in the subsequent 7 months.</p>
<p>Interim head of TikTok, Vanessa Pappas, said the company has “worked tirelessly to prevent having to separate anyone from the company,” from the internal memo sent to employees in India as stated by <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/tiktok-reduces-workforce-in-india-but-no-plans-of-shutting-down-1763184-2021-01-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">India Today</a>.</p>
<p>They lamented that they simply cannot responsibly operate with full staff while their apps remain un-operational</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tiktok-1-300x168.jpg" alt="Tiktok Reduces Staff In India" width="371" height="208" srcset="https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tiktok-1-300x168.jpg 300w, https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tiktok-1-768x430.jpg 768w, https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tiktok-1-678x381.jpg 678w, https://relayvibes.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/tiktok-1.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px"><br>
TikTok will “only retain a small number of key roles in India,” as stated in a separate internal memo which was sent to global employees by Pappas.</p>
<p>Pappas said prospects in other countries has remained absolutely rigid — these issues were pertaining to political challenge in India.”</p>
<p>In September, India had banned another set of 118 Chinese apps. All the apps have remained blocked and the Times of India had reported on Tuesday that many more, with the possibilty of TikTok too, will be totally banned.</p>
<p>The app bans were viewed as a retaliation to flaring tensions with China over their disputed Himalayan mountain border in Ladakh, which had resulted the deaths of not less than 20 Indian soldiers.</p>
<p>Ji Rong, the spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in India, has alleged that the Indian govt’s intent to totally ban the apps violates the WTO’s “non-discriminatory principles and fair competition principles of market economy.” and hopes that the Indian side will abruptly correct its discriminatory measures and prevent cause of more damage to bilateral cooperation.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> Scientists at EPFL have discovered that Alzheimer’s-like protein aggregates underly the muscle deterioration seen in aging. But the aggregates can be reversed by boosting the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), which turns on the defense systems of mitochondria in cells and restores muscle function.<br></p><div id="news-content-text" itemprop="description"><p>The older we grow, the weaker our muscles get, riddling old age with frailty and physical disability. But this doesn’t only affect the individual, it also creates a significant burden on public healthcare. And yet, research efforts into the biological processes and biomarkers that define muscle aging have not yet defined the underlying causes.</p><p>Now, a team of scientists from lab of Johan Auwerx at EPFL’s School of Life Sciences looked at the issue through a different angle: the similarities between muscle aging and degenerative muscle diseases. They have discovered protein aggregates that deposit in skeletal muscles during natural aging, and that blocking this can prevent the detrimental features of muscle aging. The study is <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31649-1">published in <em>Cell Reports</em></a>.</p><p>“During age-associated muscle diseases, such as inclusion body myositis (IBM), our cells struggle to maintain correct protein folding, leading these misfolded proteins to precipitate and forming toxic protein aggregates within the muscles,” explains Auwerx. “The most prominent component of these protein aggregates is beta-amyloid, just like in the amyloid plaques in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease.”</p><p>In the study, the scientists identify amyloid-like protein aggregates in aged muscles from different species, from the nematode <em>C. elegans</em> all the way to humans. In addition, they also found that these aggregates also impair mitochondrial function. Although aggregated proteins have been suggested to contribute to brain aging, this is the first time that they have been shown to contribute to muscle aging and to directly damage mitochondria. “These abnormal proteotoxic aggregates could serve as novel biomarkers for the aging process, beyond the brain and muscle,” says Auwerx.</p><p>But can the formation of the protein aggregates be reversed? To answer this, the researchers fed worms the vitamin nicotinamide riboside and the antitumor agent Olaparib, both of which boost the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>), a biomolecule that is essential for maintaining mitochondrial function, and whose levels decline during aging.</p><p>In the worms, the two compounds turned on the defense systems of the mitochondria, even when provided at advanced age. Turning on the so-called “mitochondrial quality control system” reduced the age-related amyloid protein aggregates and improved the worms’ fitness and lifespan.</p><p>The scientists then moved on to human muscle tissue, taken from aged subjects and IBM patients. Turning on the same mitochondrial quality control systems produced similar improvements in protein and mitochondrial homeostasis. The encouraging results led the researchers to test nicotinamide riboside in aged mice. The treatment also activated the mitochondrial defense systems and reduced the number and size of amyloid aggregates in different skeletal muscle tissues.</p><p>“Drugs that boost mitochondrial quality control could therefore be tested in the clinic to reverse these age-related proteotoxic aggregates and rejuvenate tissues,” says Mario Romani, the first author of the study.</p><p><strong>Other contributors</strong></p><ul><li>CHA University</li><li>Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology</li><li>Chungnam National University School of Medicine</li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>This post will might be the post that will roast me the most. But before triggering your fingers just by reading the title I would like everyone to read my post, and read my argument before jumping in to conclusions.</p>
<h2>As developers, techies we all hate ads but…</h2>
<p>Yes, developers like you and me love user privacy, we like to use only usernames on forums, we don’t like services making it mandatory to give our real names, photos etc. </p>
<p>Same goes for advertising, we all hate to see ads, we all dislike the experience of seeing lots of ads on a website, ads make websites load slow, use our data/bandwidth. </p>
<p>We just want to go to a website, get what we came there, and get out. Trust me I’m no different from you, I also hate annoying ads, I also hate ads as much as you do. </p>
<p>But most average users don’t mind to see an ad or two on a website, they don’t mind services like Facebook and its companies, Google, and other advertising networking tracking them throughout the internet. They are happy to get a free service, in exchange of their data, tracking, and some ads in between.</p>
<h2>As a developer, marketer</h2>
<p>We all love making new things, we all want to see our tools and products to be used by as many people as possible. <a href="https://ruky.me/2021/01/26/do-you-believe-in-fail-fast-and-fail-quickly/" data-type="post" data-id="236">No one likes to start a failed startup, or launch a failed product.</a></p>
<p>Advertising is a great way to get the word out about your product to the internet. You can reach more people through online advertising, by spending the same amount than posting an ad on the a newspaper or TV.</p>
<p>Not only that targeted online advertising ads more value to the money you spend. A newspaper ad or a TV ad is like firing randomly hoping you will hit as many targets as possible. </p>
<p>But a targeted online ad is more likely to get impressions of people who are most likely to use your product (Facebook), or more likely potential users searching for a product like yours (Google).So you get more value to the money you spend as an advertiser or creator.</p>
<p>Even if your product is a premium product that doesn’t require advertising, you will still have to rely on advertisements to get the word out about your product.</p>
<h2>As a publisher</h2>
<p>Running a website, or app can be expensive, you need to pay for the servers, you need to pay for the developer tools (Apple developer license), even if it’s an open source tool, you spend you time </p>
<p>If you are providing a free service, advertising is a great way to cover development cost, server costs. Yes you can depend on donations, but still that may not make enough money, or users might use the product more than they donate. </p>
<p>For example, how many people would be willing to pay $50 USD per month? Do people think Facebook is providing them a value of $50 USD per month? Most people will say no, even I don’t think Facebook is giving me a value around $50 USD per month.</p>
<p>But people like using Facebook, and use Facebook for free, but Facebook will have to pay for their data centres, their developers, and other costs.</p>
<p>And also even though there will be some people who will donate some amount for the development of Facebook, the amount of donations will not be able to cover development costs.</p>
<p>So even though as annoying as it can be, some services will have to depend on ad revenue to cover their costs and make a profit in return.</p>
<h2>As a user</h2>
<p>Imagine you go to a website, you will be shown an ad that is something totally unrelated to you? Ever visited a torrent website, and you are greeted with an ad to an adult website? Isn’t that annoying? </p>
<p>Won’t you rather enjoy a high quality targeted ad on Facebook, rather than seeing some non targeted random ad, totally unrelated. A targeted ad can give a better experience for the user, and also a money well spent for the advertiser.</p>
<h2>Why we need minimally invasive tracking</h2>
<p>In order to do this, there has to have some level tracking for ad services, let that be cookies, pixels, super-cookies, there needs to be some sort of minimally invasive tracking to serve targeted, and therefore a good ad experience.</p>
<p>As developers, startup creators, won’t you like to spend money to get the word out about your startup or product to the most relevant people? or spend that money to getting your product to random set of users.</p>
<p>Isn’t that the same reason why we share our creations on HackerNews, ProductHunt than some unrelated cooking subreddit? Because we all understand the value of a good audience.</p>
<p>A targeted ad is a method where all parties, publishers, advertisers, users all will benefit.</p>
<p>So next time when you criticise targeting, and privacy, we all need to remember that we won’t be able to get out word out, publishers and some services won’t be able to make revenue without advertising. </p>
<p>Now roast me with your opinions.</p>

<p>Everyone wants pepperoni except for the one person who hates pepperoni. So you don’t get pepperoni, because nobody else cares enough to tell that one person to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">shove it</a>.</p>



<p>Everyone wants to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/26/you-cant-fail-at-experiments/">try</a> switching to 3-week sprints except for that one person who thinks 3 weeks is way too long. So you stick with 2-week <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">sprints</a>, because nobody else cares enough to tell that one person to shove it.</p>



<p>Interesting how we give that one noisy dissenter so much power. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/21/when-and-why-do-you-concede/">Human politeness</a> is a powerful motivator. We choose to make a large group of people slightly unhappier to prevent a small group (or even a single person) from being <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/08/the-key-to-happiness-is-to-stop-getting-upset-all-the-dang-time/">significantly unhappier</a>. </p>



<p>The majority <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/24/intense-intervention-or-acceptance-pick-one/">doesn’t care enough</a> to tell the minority to deal with it, so the minority gets veto power. I recently heard this called <em>the tyranny of the minority</em>, but that seems harsh. It reminds me of one of my all-time favorite quotes:</p>



<blockquote><p>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.</p><cite>George Bernard Shaw</cite></blockquote>



<p>Is it tyranny to be “unreasonable”? No. It’s necessary. The <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/17/values-pick-2/">quality</a> that makes a person put their foot down about pizza toppings is the same quality that drives progress. </p>



<p>What is that <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/22/blind-spots-and-bright-spots/">quality</a>? Grit? Stubbornness? Determination? Vision? <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/30/2021-the-year-of-courage/">Courage</a>? All of those?</p>

<p>Don't be afraid.</p>


<p>One thing I'm known for at work is reading research papers, and referring to results in technical conversations. People ask me if, and how, they should read papers themselves. This post is a long-form answer to that question. The intended audience is working software engineers.</p>

<p><strong>Why read research?</strong></p>

<p>I read research in one of three mental modes.</p>

<p>The first mode is <em>solution finding</em>: I’m faced with a particular problem, and am looking for solutions. This isn’t too different from the way that you probably use Stack Overflow, but for more esoteric or systemic problems. Solution finding can work directly from papers, but I tend to find books more useful in this mode, unless I know an area well and am looking for something specific.</p>

<p>A more productive mode is what I call <em>discovery</em>. In this case, I’ve been working on a problem or in a space, and know something about it. In discovery mode, I want to explore around the space I know and see if there are better solutions. For example, when I was building a system using Paxos, I read a lot of literature about consensus protocols in general (including classics like <a href="http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf">Viewstamped Replication</a><sup><a href="#foot1">1</a></sup>, and newer papers like Raft). The goal in discovery mode is to find alternative solutions, opportunities for optimization, or new ways to think about a problem.</p>

<p>The most intellectually gratifying mode for me is <em>curiosity</em> mode. Here, I’ll read papers that just seem interesting to me, but aren’t related to anything I’m currently working on. I’m constantly surprised by how reading broadly has helped me solve problems, or just informed by approach. For example, reading about misuse-resistant cryptography primitives like <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8452">GCM-SIV</a> has deeply informed my approach to API design. Similarly, reading about erasure codes around 2005 helped me solve an important problem for my team just this year.</p>

<p>I’ve found reading for discovery and curiosity very helpful to my career. It has also given me tools that makes reading for solution finding more efficient. Sometimes, reading for curiosity leads to new paths. About five years ago I completely changed what I was working on after reading <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1022594.1022596">Latency lags bandwidth</a>, which I believe is one of the most important trends in computing.</p>

<p><strong>Do I need a degree to read research papers?</strong></p>

<p>No. Don’t expect to be able to pick up every paper and understand it completely. You do need a certain amount of background knowledge, but no credentials. Try to avoid being discouraged when you don't understand a paper, or sections of a paper. I'm often surprised when I revisit something after a couple years and find I now understand it.</p>

<p>Learning a new field from primary research can be very difficult. When tackling a new area, books, blogs, talks, and courses are better options.</p>

<p><strong>How do I find papers worth reading?</strong></p>

<p>That depends on the mode you’re in. In <em>solution finding</em> and <em>discovery</em> modes, search engines like Google Scholar are a great place to start. One challenge with searching is that you might not even know the right things to search for: it’s not unusual for researchers to use different terms from the ones you are used to. If you run into this problem, picking up a book on the topic can often help bridge the gap, and the references in books are a great way to discover papers.</p>

<p>Following particular authors and researchers can be great for <em>discovery</em> and <em>curiosity</em> modes. If there’s a researcher who’s working in a space I’m interested in, I’ll follow them on Twitter or add search alerts to see when they’ve published something new.</p>

<p>Conferences and journals are another great place to go. Most of the computer science research you’ll read is probably published at conferences. There are some exceptions. For example, I followed <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/tos">ACM Transactions on Storage</a> when I was working in that area. Pick a couple of conferences in areas that you’re interested in, and read through their programs when they come out. In my area, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/technical-sessions">NSDI</a> and <a href="https://www.eurosys2020.org/program/">Eurosys</a> happened earlier this year, and OSDI is coming up. Jeff Huang has a <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/best_paper_awards.html">nice list of best paper winners</a> at a wide range of CS conferences.</p>

<p>A lot of research involves going through the graph of references. Most papers include a list of references, and as I read I note down which ones I’d like to follow up on and add them to my reading list. References form a directed (mostly) acyclic graph of research going into the past.</p>

<p>Finally, some research bloggers are worth following. <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/">Adrian Colyer's blog</a> is worth its weight in gold. I’ve written about research from researchers from <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2014/03/30/lamport-pub.html">Leslie Lamport</a>, <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2014/05/10/lynch-pub.html">Nancy Lynch</a> and others, too.</p>

<p><strong>That’s quite a fire hose! How do I avoid drowning?</strong></p>

<p>You don’t have to drink that whole fire hose. I know I can’t. Titles and abstracts can be a good way to filter out papers you want to read. Don’t be afraid to scan down a list of titles and pick out one or two papers to read.</p>

<p>Another approach is to avoid reading new papers at all. Focus on the classics, and let time filter out papers that are worth reading. For example, I often find myself recommending Jim Gray's 1986 paper on <a href="https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/tandem/TR-86.1.pdf">The 5 Minute Rule</a> and Lisanne Bainbridge's 1983 paper on <a href="https://www.ise.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bainbridge_1983_Automatica.pdf">Ironies of Automation</a><sup><a href="#foot2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Who writes research papers?</strong></p>

<p>Research papers in the areas of computer science I work in are generally written by one of three groups. First, researchers at universities, including professors, post docs, and graduate students. These are people who’s job it is to do research. They have a lot of freedom to explore quite broadly, and do foundational and theoretical work.</p>

<p>Second, engineering teams at companies publish their work. Amazon’s <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">Dynamo</a>, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/agache">Firecracker</a>, <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/p1041-verbitski.pdf">Aurora</a> and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/brooker">Physalia</a> papers are examples. Here, work is typically more directly aimed at a problem to be solved in a particular context. The strength of industry research is that it’s often been proven in the real world, at scale.</p>

<p>In the middle are industrial research labs. Bell Labs was home to some of the foundational work in computing and communications. Microsoft Research do a great deal of impressive work. Industry labs, as a broad generalization, also tend to focus on concrete problems, but can operate over longer time horizons.</p>

<p><strong>Should I trust the results in research papers?</strong></p>

<p>The right answer to this question is <em>no</em>. Nothing about being in a research paper guarantees that a result is right. Results can range from simply wrong, to flawed in more subtle ways<sup><a href="#foot3">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the process of peer review does help set a bar of quality for published results, and results published in reputable conferences and journals are generally trustworthy. Reviewers and editors put a great deal of effort into this, and it’s a real strength of scientific papers over informal publishing.</p>

<p>My general advice is to read methods carefully, and verify results for yourself if you’re going to make critical decisions based on them. A common mistake is to apply a correct result too broadly, and assume it applies to contexts or systems it wasn’t tested on.</p>

<p><strong>Should I distrust results that aren’t in research papers?</strong></p>

<p>No. The process of peer review is helpful, but not magical. Results that haven’t been peer reviewed, or rejected from peer review aren’t necessarily wrong. Some important papers have been rejected from traditional publishing, and were published in other ways. This <a href="http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/pubs.html#lamport-paxos">happened</a> to Leslie Lamport's classic paper introducing Paxos:</p>

<blockquote><p>I submitted the paper to TOCS in 1990.  All three referees said that the paper was mildly interesting, though not very important, but that all the Paxos stuff had to be removed.  I was quite annoyed at how humorless everyone working in the field seemed to be, so I did nothing with the paper.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was eventually published 8 years later, and quite well received:</p>

<blockquote><p>This paper won an ACM SIGOPS Hall of Fame Award in 2012.</p></blockquote>

<p>There's a certain dance one needs to know, and follow, to get published in a top conference or journal. Some of the steps are necessary, and lead to better research and better communities. Others are just for show.</p>

<p><strong>What should I look out for in the methods section?</strong></p>

<p>That depends on the field. In distributed systems, one thing to look out for is scale. Due to the constraints of research, systems may be tested and validated at a scale below what you’ll need to run in production. Think carefully about how the scale assumptions in the paper might impact the results. Both academic and industry authors have an incentive to talk up the strengths of their approach, and avoid highlighting the weaknesses. This is very seldom done to the point of dishonesty, but worth paying attention to as you read.</p>

<p><strong>How do I get time to read?</strong></p>

<p>This is going to depend on your personal circumstances, and your job. It's not always easy. Long-term learning is one of the keys to a sustainable and successful career, so it's worth making time to learn. One of the ways I like to learn is by reading research papers. You might find other ways more efficient, effective or enjoyable. That's OK too.</p>

<p><strong>Updates</strong></p>

<p> <a href="https://twitter.com/penberg">Pekka Enberg</a> pointed me at <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf">How to Read a Paper</a> by Srinivasan Keshav. It describes a three-pass approach to reading a paper that I like very much:</p>

<blockquote><p>The first pass gives you a general idea about the paper. The second pass lets you grasp the paper’s content, but not its details. The third pass helps you understand the paper in depth.</p></blockquote>

<p>Murat Demirbas shared his post <a href="http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2013/07/how-i-read-research-paper.html">How I Read a Research Paper</a> which contains a lot of great advice. Like Murat, I like to read on paper, although I have taken to doing my lighter-weight reading using <a href="https://www.liquidtext.net/">LiquidText</a></p>

<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a name="foot1"></a> I wrote a <a href="https://brooker.co.za/blog/2014/05/19/vr.html">blog post about Viewstamped Replication</a> back in 2014. It's a pity VR isn't more famous, because it's an interestingly different framing that helped me make sense of a lot of what Paxos does.</li>
<li><a name="foot2"></a> Obviously stuff like maths is timeless, but even in fast-moving fields like systems there are papers worth reading from the 50s and 60s. I think about Sayre's 1969 paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/363626.363629">Is automatic “folding” of programs efficient enough to displace manual?</a> when people talk about how modern programmers …</li></ol></div></div>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>
<pre><code>@bp.route("/author", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def author():
    """View all authors, or create a new one."""

    if request.method == "GET":
        args = validate_get(marshallers.LimitOffsetSchema())
        limit = args["limit"]
        offset = args["offset"]

        authors = Author.query.limit(limit).offset(offset).all()
        return jsonify(marshallers.authors.dump(authors))

    if request.method == "POST":
        author = Author(**validate_post(marshallers.author))

        db.session.add(author)
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({"id": author.id})
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/olliemath/async_python">GitHub repo</a>. Here, the thing to note is that <code>marshallers.foo</code> is an instance of a <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a> schema, which can be used both to validate a Foo input, for instance in a POST request, as well as to marshal Foo instances ready for returning as JSON.</p>
<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use. SQLAlchemy does not support this out of the box, and in fact its primary developer has a great post arguing that <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/">an async ORM is not always a great idea</a>. Juicy technical details in addenda [5], but beware that just using a Gunicorn gevent worker will not necessarily get you what you want.</p><p>PyPy tends to suffer a performance hit when using C-extensions and libraries instead of pure python, conversely CPython should get a performance boost from the C-based libs. To take account of this I tested two different underlying database connectors: both <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">psycopg2</a> and a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

    <div><div><p>The intensification of dairy farming has been a concern of ours for many years, so we’ve been working hard to come up with a different solution. Our big idea? A new method of dairy farming that keeps the calves with their mothers to suckle. Our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/ethical-dairy-system">ethical dairy model</a> is based around treating the animals, the land, our environment and the people who work here with respect and kindness.</p></div></div>
<div>
  <div><div><div><div about="" typeof="">
  <div>
    <div><div><div><p>In traditional dairy farms calves are removed from their mothers within a few hours of their birth - the stress this places on the cow is clear. So we wanted to find a way to keep calves with the cows and still have a financially viable farm. Put simply, we don’t want to have to choose between doing what’s right and staying in business.</p>
<p>As an organic dairy farm for more than twenty years our cows have already benefitted from some of the highest welfare standards in the UK, but we knew we could do even better. We built a new dairy, specially designed to house calves with their mothers, and we trialled the full cow with calf system for the first time in 2012. It taught us a lot, but financially cost us an awful lot.</p>
<p><span>However, the impact it made on cow contentment was staggering. All the animals were noticeably calmer and far more confident. <span>&nbsp;</span>After two to three months the calves became like teenagers, they loved playing with their pals and really only came back to mum when they wanted food!</span></p>
<p><span></span>We are determined to make our radical new model of dairy farming work, and by purchasing cheese from The Ethical Dairy you are helping to support it.</p>

    <div><div><div><p>Since October 2016 our calves have stayed with their mothers for 5 to 6 months. We still milk them in that period, but only once a day.</p>
<p>We are still at the early stages of The Ethical Dairy project, but our new approach to dairy farming has already led to huge reductions in the use of <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/power-nature">antibiotics</a>, increases in <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> and <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/healthier-winter">healthier</a>, happier cows. Compared to an average dairy farm, already The Ethical Dairy has:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than half</li>
<li>Reduced <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/coo-poo-power">energy</a> use by more than half</li>

<li>Doubled the productive life of cows</li>
<li>Increased our farm <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/biodiversity-ethical-dairy">biodiversity</a> five-fold</li>
<li>Increased the net amount of food in our <a href="http://www.theethicaldairy.co.uk/blog/politics-food-production">food system</a> by 80%</li>
<li>Exceeded the highest standards of animal welfare</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ethical Dairy has been supported in its journey by many individuals through our crowdfunding campaign in the autumn of 2018, and by public funding, such as Dumfries and Galloway LEADER which is helping us to attend trade shows, events, and to market and promote our products. We are also grateful for support from the Food Processing, Manufacturing and Cooperation grant which has supported the development of our new cheese dairy.&nbsp;</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p><a href="https://console.dev/">Console</a> is starting as a free weekly newsletter highlighting the best tools for developers. We want to know how our list is performing, which means keeping an eye on some key metrics like active subscribers and unsubscribe rates. We can log into Mailchimp to see this data, but I wanted to get a quick daily update rather than forming a habit of constantly logging in.</p><p>We <a href="https://basecamp.com/guides/group-chat-problems">default to asynchronous communication</a> and use the chat room built into <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> for informal socialising or posting non-critical links and comments. I check it each morning, so it seemed like a good place to post a status update.</p><p>Like most chat products <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/bc3-api/blob/master/sections/chatbots.md#create-a-line">Basecamp has a bot API</a> to send arbitrary messages into the chat. It is therefore easy to use <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/docs/fundamentals/">the Mailchimp API</a> to <a href="https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/lists/get-list-info/">pull the stats</a> and post them into Basecamp. This code just needs to run every morning.</p><p>Keeping <a href="https://blog.console.dev/console-tech-stack-2021/">our tech stack</a> as simple as possible is a priority. We don't have a complex product and dealing with servers, OS updates, database replication, etc is something we will put off as long as possible! However, a chat bot has to run somewhere. This is the perfect use-case for a serverless function - just write the code and let the platform deal with the infrastructure maintenance.</p><h2 id="azure-vs-google-vs-aws">Azure vs Google vs AWS</h2><p>I have <a href="https://davidmytton.blog/who-has-the-best-serverless-platform/">tried AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions</a>, and have several personal utility functions running on both Google and Azure. Whilst I have been impressed with Google Cloud's database products, they are still behind when it comes to the breadth of functionality in their serverless functions product. Google doesn't support Rust and has no concept of custom runtimes like AWS and Azure do.</p><p>This meant it was down to AWS vs Azure. Both have excellent documentation, lots of language SDKs, and a large ecosystem of developers. However, I prefer the Azure web portal, like how they build in public on GitHub, and <a href="https://davidmytton.blog/fighting-over-who-has-the-greenest-public-cloud/">rate them best for environmental sustainability</a>. AWS is the more popular platform and Lambda/Azure Functions are competitive. I just prefer Azure.</p><h2 id="creating-a-python-serverless-bot">Creating a Python serverless bot</h2><p>I have been writing Python for over 10 years, so it was the default choice to create a simple serverless bot. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-python">Azure has native Python support</a>, the Basecamp API takes a simple HTTP POST, and <a href="https://github.com/mailchimp/mailchimp-marketing-python">Mailchimp has an official Python SDK</a>. </p><p>This meant that within a few hours I had written a function, created the Azure Resource Manager template, and configured GitHub Actions to automatically deploy on push. The bot was running and delivering us stats each morning.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/campfire-totorobot-python.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/campfire-totorobot-python.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/campfire-totorobot-python.png 825w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Python bot posting our daily Mailchimp stats into Basecamp.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-port-to-rust">Why port to Rust?</h2><p>Over Christmas I usually leave London to visit my family, however <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-55380644">the change in COVID-19 rules</a> meant that I could no longer leave the city. With some extra time, particularly in the quiet period between Christmas and New Year, I ended up spending several days playing around with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>.</p><p>Although it has been around since 2010, Rust has become particularly popular in the last few years. <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted">Stack Overflow have listed it as the most loved language</a> since 2016.</p><p>I won't go into the standard Rust pitch of "better safety, concurrency, performance" - you can find detailed Rust <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03382-2">vs</a> Language X <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2015/5/27/rust-for-pythonistas/">posts</a> <a href="https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/rust-vs-go">elsewhere</a> - but I did want to write up my experience as a Rust newbie.</p><h3 id="reason-1-fun-and-interesting">Reason 1: Fun and interesting</h3><p>My main reason for porting from Python to Rust was that it was fun and interesting! I like Python (which sits at #3 in the "most loved" 2020 ranking) because it is easy to start writing code and you can get things done quickly. It also enforces a particular coding style which means more consistent layout, spacing, indenting, etc.</p><p>Python doesn't make you think about concepts like static typing and memory management because it handles it for you. Rust is very different. It forces you to consider types, ensure all return cases are handled consistently, understand scoping, and many other things which are absent in Python. This is by design because it makes the resulting code much more robust.</p><p>Rust uses the concept of "<a href="https://sled.rs/errors">correctness</a>". It's not that Rust is "right" and Python is "wrong", but forcing you think about these concepts, and enforcing them before code will compile, helps to avoid errors:</p><blockquote>almost all (92%) of the catastrophic system failures are the result of incorrect handling of non-fatal errors explicitly signaled in software.<p>- <a href="http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~yuan/papers/failure_analysis_osdi14.pdf">Simple Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures: An Analysis of Production Failures in Distributed Data-intensive Systems</a></p></blockquote><p>The number of times I have found bugs in my Python code due to silly mistakes like typos or not handling a particular error case makes me appreciate Rust's approach. Better to invest more time in development rather than finding bugs and errors once code has been shipped to production. </p><p>I still need to write more extensive unit tests and mock the external API calls but tests are a core language feature. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html">Developers are encourged</a> to write tests inside the source that is being tested, with integration tests in a "tests" directory.</p><h3 id="reason-2-portability">Reason 2: Portability</h3><p>Neither AWS Lambda nor Azure Functions have native support for Rust, but they both support Custom <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html">Runtimes</a>/<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-other">Handlers</a>. This allows you to build a generic web endpoint which, if it can handle to standard HTTP requests and return a standard HTTP response, can be executed by the platform.</p><p>(This is true for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-custom-handlers#http-only-function">an HTTP triggered function on Azure</a>. Getting into more platform-specific function types, like a Timer or Queue trigger, means relying more on the platform features. This makes it more difficult to port away, but not impossible).</p><p>All languages have a range of frameworks that help building web endpoints, often with an embedded web server. Rust has <a href="https://actix.rs/">Actix</a> and <a href="https://rocket.rs/">Rocket</a>, <a href="https://www.lpalmieri.com/posts/2020-07-04-choosing-a-rust-web-framework-2020-edition/">amongst others</a>. By creating generic HTTP endpoints, the application can be run anywhere. AWS Lambda has <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-rust-runtime">some experimental Rust language bindings</a>, but creating a set of generic web endpoints is better because it is not then tied to a specific platform.</p><p>This is not unique to Rust. Python has <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> (or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, for a more "batteries included" approach). However, Rust differs because it is a statically compiled language. This means the output is a binary that runs entirely independently, only requiring the system libc implementation. If you <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html">compile it with a musl target</a> it becomes 100% static and will therefore run on any Linux OS. </p><p>Statically compiled binaries have all their dependencies included executable. This means the binary should continue to run "forever", even if the platform changes. Indeed, because the application is completely isolated and separate from the platform, there is no reliance on specific system-installed packages. Both can be updated independent of each other. This can be partly achieved using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">Python Virtual Environments</a>, but they are complex and have developer overhead (<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP-0582</a> aims to fix that). Static compilation is a more robust approach.</p><p>It is currently convenient to run this bot on Azure, but it would be trivial to move it to AWS or a generic web server. Using <a href="https://upx.github.io/">upx</a> to <a href="https://github.com/svenstaro/upx-action">compress the executable</a> means the final binary with a full embedded web server is just 2.5MB. This application is so lightweight it could even run on a Raspberry Pi in the office - I'd just need to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html">compile it for ARM</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/compressed-binary.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.console.dev/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/compressed-binary.png 600w, https://blog.console.dev/content/images/2021/01/compressed-binary.png 670w"><figcaption>The final 100% static, upx compressed binary. Only 2.5MB.</figcaption></figure><p>This is definitely overkill for a chatbot project. There is no tangible benefit to statically compiling a few hundred lines of Rust vs deploying the same length Python code to Azure Functions. There are only a couple of dependencies! </p><p>But this is a great test project to learn how it works (see Reason #1 above). Internal tools tend to be built quickly and with less polish than software you intend to ship to customers. Yet they often last the longest in production because of how widely used they become. In some organizations it can be hard to justify spending expensive developer time on such projects, so investing in maintainabilty upfront is worth it.</p><h3 id="reason-3-developer-tooling">Reason 3: Developer tooling</h3><p>The overall experience of writing Rust is made much more enjoyable because of the developer tooling. Everything revolves around <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">Cargo</a> which makes documentation, dependency management, linting, testing, and builds all part of the core language. Installing Rust using the standard rustup command also includes Cargo and there are several useful extras like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RustSec/cargo-audit">Audit</a>.</p><p>This is a big win for developers because everything you need is available out of the box. Third-party packages can be found in the <a href="https://crates.io/">Crate registry</a>. The equivalent in Python, <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#pip">pip</a>, does not feel as slick and wasn't even included with Python when I first started coding it (when setuptools/easy_install were the primary method of package management). You also have to be careful to use a Python virtual environment if you have a system managed installation of Python, otherwise you will end up installing system-level dependencies.</p><p>I'm a vim user so the official <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.vim">rust.vim plugin</a> gives me autocomplete and in-editor checks, but the output from Cargo (warnings and errors) is very helpful and pinpointing problems. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">rust-clippy</a> is fun, too.</p><p>Where Python has an advantage is the number of libraries. PyPI has over 280,000 packages whereas Cargo has 53,000. Quantity is not an indication of quality, and Python has been stable longer, but it is reasonable to expect vendors to provide official Python SDKs. That is less common with Rust.</p><h2 id="challenges-learning-rust">Challenges learning Rust</h2><p>I wrote the Python bot in a few hours but it took me several days to get the Rust port working. This would be hard to justify if it wasn't a learning project, but everyone gets faster with experience. I had to learn not just a new language but also how to properly cross-compile for a different platform. Here are my notes on some of those challenges:</p><h3 id="language-challenges">Language challenges</h3><p>There are several features which make Rust robust, safe, and correct, but require a shift in mindset if you're used to other languages.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <div>
              <p><img src="https://danielpecos.com/assets/2021/01/27/SES-MJML.png" alt="SES templates with MJML"></p>
<p>If you are a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses">AWS SES</a> user (AWS’ email system) you probably know that working with its JSON based templates is not a user-friendly task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text and HTML content are defined as properties of a JSON object</li>
<li>It’s a JSON file, meaning that you have to escape some characters, like <code>"</code> in the HTML</li>
<li>It’s quite hard to find the content to change in the HTML being stored in a single line</li>
</ul>
<p>But still, is a quite convenient system, as hosting your own email server is quite an effort, and you want it to be reliable.</p>
<p>That’s why I decided to use it, despite the not so friendly interface. Together with a Lambda function triggered by SNS messages, I have managed to build a quite robust mail gateway solution for <a href="https://app.papyro.dplabs.tech/">Papyro</a> (let me know if you are interested in knowing how theses pieces fit together and I’ll write a future post about it).</p>
<p>But the pain of creating some nice looking emails using this system is way too much from the moment that you have to manage more than 3 or 4 email templates.</p>
<p>That’s when I started looking into <a href="https://mjml.io/">MJML</a>. MJML is a responsive email library that allows you to create rich emails using a syntax similar to HTML. It also offers a CLI to convert the MJML files into (minimized, and this is important) HTML.</p>
<p>So in order to use MJML for SES templates, two issues needed to be adressed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate plain text from MJML - not supported directly by MJML</li>
<li>All generated output must be valid when expressed in a single line - because still, the output must be part of a JSON property in the SES template</li>
</ol>
<p>For 1, and given an already minimized HTML, it’s just a matter of removing all the <code>\n</code> and making sure that the generated CSS does not contain any problematic comment (which by default, is the case, phew).</p>
<p>For 2, I decided to use <code>html-to-text</code> (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-text">https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-text</a>) node package (specifically its CLI) and some <code>bash</code> magic to properly format the contents in the format that AWS expects (using <code>\r\n</code> for line breaks).</p>
<p>So this is what my solution looks like:</p>
<pre><code>├── bin
│   └── upload-ses-template.sh
├── build
│   └── welcome.json
└── templates
    ├── welcome.json
    └── welcome.mjml
</code></pre><p>This bash script is driving all the process (<code>upload-ses-template.sh</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash
</span><span></span>
TEMPLATE<span>=</span>$1

RAW_HTML<span>=</span><span>$(</span>mjml ./templates/$TEMPLATE.mjml --config.minify true<span>)</span>

HTML<span>=</span><span>$(</span>echo $RAW_HTML | sed -e <span>'s/"/\\\\"/g'</span><span>)</span>

TEXT<span>=</span><span>$(</span>echo $RAW_HTML | html-to-text --ignore-image --noLinkBrackets | sed -e <span>'s/"/\\\\"/g'</span><span>)</span>
TEXT<span>=</span><span>$(while</span> IFS<span>=</span> read -r line; <span>do</span> echo <span>"</span>$line<span>\\\\r\\\\n"</span>; <span>done</span> <span>&lt;&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"</span>$TEXT<span>"</span> | tr -d <span>'\n'</span><span>)</span>

mkdir -p ./build
cat ./templates/$TEMPLATE.json | sed -e <span>"s~%html%~</span>$HTML<span>~"</span> -e <span>'s/%html%/\&amp;/g'</span> -e <span>"s~%text%~</span>$TEXT<span>~"</span> -e <span>'s/%text%/\&amp;/g'</span> &gt; ./build/$TEMPLATE.json

cat ./build/$TEMPLATE.json

set -x

aws ses delete-template --template-name papyro-$TEMPLATE
aws ses create-template --cli-input-json file://build/$TEMPLATE.jso
</code></pre></div><p>(BTW, if you know a better way of joining a multiline text using <code>\r\n</code>, please let me know, I did struggle quite a bit and the solution is not that nice as you may have noticed)</p>
<p>So given a wireframe (note the <code>%text%</code> and <code>%html%</code> placeholders) of SES template (<code>templates/welcome.json</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
  <span>"Template"</span>: {
    <span>"TemplateName"</span>: <span>"papyro-welcome"</span>,
    <span>"SubjectPart"</span>: <span>"Welcome to Papyro!"</span>,
    <span>"TextPart"</span>: <span>"%text%"</span>,
    <span>"HtmlPart"</span>: <span>"%html%"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>and its MJML template (<code>templates/welcome.mjml</code>):</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>mjml</span>&gt;
  &lt;<span>mj-head</span>&gt;

</a></p><h3>Residency Status</h3>
</div>
<p>For the survey, we were intentionally vague as to what defines an international developer, as we didn’t want to exclude anyone who considers themselves to be one. 7% of respondents were Japanese citizens. However, having Japanese citizenship doesn’t preclude someone from being international, as they could have obtained citizenship by naturalizing or be a citizen who grew up outside the country.</p>

</div>
<p>The Greater Tokyo Area, consisting of Tokyo itself, along with the neighboring prefectures of Saitama, Chiba, and Kanagawa, remains the hub for international developers, with 86% of respondents living there.</p>

<p>Outside of the Greater Tokyo Area, the other prefectures that had more than a couple of responses were Aichi (4), Fukuoka (6), Hyogo (4), Ibaraki (5),  Kyoto (7), Okinawa (5), and Osaka (5).</p>

</a></p><h3>Swift developers most satisfied, PHP developers least satisfied</h3>
</div>
<p>With the exception of a few outliers, programming languages didn’t strongly correlate with job satisfaction. As respondents who used PHP also had the <a href="#salary-by-programming-language">lowest salaries</a>, this could in part explain their low satisfaction. On the other hand, neither Swift nor Objective-C correlated with exceptionally high salaries, indicating that there is more to this correlation than it just being a proxy for salary.</p>

			<p>GameStop Corp (GME) continues to rally today and is now up over +370% in 2021. GME shorts and longs are in a knockout battle being waged in the stock market as well asocial media platforms. Both sides are holding their ground with strong conviction, but in the end, one side will be the outright winner, and in the later rounds of this prize fight the long shareholders are way ahead on points.</p>
<p>GME short interest is $5.51 billion; 71.79 million shares shorted; 139.57% SI % Float; 58.26% S3 SI % Float; 31% stock borrow fee on existing shorts and new shorts are paying over 80% fee.</p>
<p>GME has now climbed to #12 in the short interest league table:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9.png" alt="" width="641" height="465" srcset="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9.png 641w, https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-9-585x424.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px"></p>
<p>A year ago, GME short interest was $276 million; 63.98 million shares shorted (stock price was $4.32); 104.01% SI % Float; 50.98% S3 SI % Float. While shares shorted only increased by +12%, total dollars as risk have risen by +1,900%. A scarcity in stock borrow availability has limited the increase in shares shorted, but even as mark-to market losses we are not seeing a decrease in overall shares shorted. In fact, GME has the highest level of SI % Float for any equity worldwide (with short interest over $100 million).</p>
<p>GME is #1 in highest Short Interest % of Float:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10.png" alt="" width="640" height="254" srcset="https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10.png 640w, https://www.shortsight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Capture-10-585x232.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></p>
<p>GME’s SI % of float is over 100%, which is illogical as you cannot get five quarts of milk out of a gallon jug. In actuality, GME’s short interest is 58.26% if we include the “synthetic longs” that are created by short sales in the float calculation. A portion of these “synthetic longs” become lendable shares as they settle in&nbsp; lending programs (mutual funds and ETF providers), marginable retail accounts and rehypothicatable hedge fund accounts. Short selling therefore not only provides added daily trading liquidity but also stock loan liquidity which supports not only the ability to execute Alpha generating short trades but also liquidity for portfolio hedging strategies and derivative (option\swap) hedging.</p>
<p>Over the last 30 days we saw shares shorted increase by +1.53 million shares, worth $117 million, an increase of +2.18% as its stock price rose +281%. Over the last 7 days we saw shares shorted increase by +900 thousand shares, worth $69 million, an increase of +1.27% as its stock price rose +116%.</p>
<p>We are still seeing a short squeeze on existing older shorts, with these more value-based short sellers trimming or closing their positions due to large mark-to-market losses. But, for every short position that is closed, and stock borrow returned we are seeing extremely strong demand from new short sellers looking to initiate new short positions and capitalize on an Icarus like fall for a stock price that has soared too high. Brokers and Prime Brokers are looking into every nook and cranny to satisfy short selling demand.</p>
<p>Shorting GME has not been a profitable trade for short sellers. Shorts were down -$968 million in net-of-financing mark-to-market losses in 2020 and are already down -$5.05 billion in 2021, which includes a loss of -$876 million on today’s +16% intraday move (stock price $89.00).</p>
<p>At the moment, the prize fight is between momentum longs and momentum shorts, with the longs way ahead on points but shorts are looking for a knock-out in the later rounds. While long buyers are continuing to throw punches by continuing to bid up stock prices, short sellers do not have many haymakers left to throw as stock borrow supply curtails new short selling activity in size.</p>

<p>If GME’s stock price remains at these levels or continues to rise, both value and momentum shorts will be squeezed out of their positions and GME’s stock price will get the added boost of short buy-to-covers standing shoulder to shoulder with long buyers in driving up GME’s stock price. But if GME’s stock price faulters, shorts will hold on to their positions and scramble for any slivers of stock loan borrows they can garner as long buyers begin exiting their positions in order to lock in their recent outsized mark-to-market profits. If long shareholders do begin selling, there may be an avalanche of long sellers hitting the tape since no-one wants to see their mark-to-market profits melt away and be the last ones holding the bag. Either way, this is a heavy weight fight worth watching.</p>

<p><em>The year of the Linux desktop is coming</em>, and it looks like a piñata of
micro-services. Let’s break it and see the candies inside.</p>

<ul>
  <li>systemd core — the building block framework abstracting basic functionalities</li>
  <li>A universal package manager with a single reposotiry where anyone can push</li>
  <li>flatpak/appimage/snap — containarized applications</li>
  <li>polkit and apparmor — granular security</li>
  <li>systemd-homed — movable home with an immutable base system</li>
  <li>wayland compositors — the graphical environment</li>
  <li>pipewire — media pipeline</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re bored you can leave now, that’s it. Otherwise, let me get more
ideas out, but nothing surprising to anyone that has been following RedHat,
the freedesktop.org, and systemd.</p>

<p>The key innovation of the picture I lay above is that every
layer in the system is now isolated and communicate with one
another through d-bus services. D-bus is <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/07/06/dbus-polkit.html">fantastic in its own
right</a> and good at
abstracting functionalities.</p>

<p>All of these pieces need one another. Wayland compositors need pipewire
to be able to access media hardware, and pipewire needs polkit (or
similar mechanism) to select who can do that. Similarly, containarized
applications access the rest of the system through systemd services,
polkit, and pipewire.</p>

<p>What this leads to is a base system that is stable, a solid framework
to build on. The home is transportable inside a systemd-homed, along
with the containarized apps, proprietary or not.</p>

<p>The deep secret insider info I got tells me that this is a giant scheme
to get us all in a vendor lock-in. I can lie, this is the internet.<br>
Or better (or worse?), this is a new Android ecosystem.</p>

<p>Who’s going to nag when this is all done in the open; when the open
source movers are the implementers of the de-facto implementations;
when they keep piling the standards until nobody can follow them.</p>

<p>I believe the direction the Linux desktop is going towards will
bring more incentives for investments. Distributions uniqueness
won’t matter anymore as they’ll be centralized around a “store”
where devs will push directly. (<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/03/29/distro-pkgs.html">see previous post about distros
roles</a>)</p>

<p>Leave a comment if you weren’t aware of this vision of how distros will
look in the future.</p>

</p>
<p>This is an update of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/28.html">the popular 2018 FAQ</a>.  Details
have changed, but the spirit of the project is the same.  If you've already
read this, see <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's post</a> for more color.</p>
<p>Whenever I announce a new <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/tags.html?tag=oil-release#oil-release">Oil release</a>, some readers are confused
by the project.</p>
<p>This post explains the project's motivation from several perspectives.  Because
Unix shell is an old and successful technology, there are many ways of looking
at it.</p>
 
<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before explaining <em>why</em> I created Oil, let's review <em>what</em> it is.  You can
think of a Unix shell in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>As a text-based <strong>user interface</strong>.  You communicate with the operating
system by typing commands.</li>
<li>As a <strong>language</strong>.  It has variables, functions, and loops.  Shell programs
are text files that start with <code>#!/bin/sh</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In this document, we'll think of Unix shells as languages.  The Oil project
actually has <strong>two languages</strong>: OSH and Oil.  Let's define these terms, along with
two others for context:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-shell-spec#posix-shell-spec">POSIX shell</a> is a language defined by a standards body.
For example, Debian Linux and FreeBSD are both Unix operating systems that
provide POSIX shells.  Nearly all shells are POSIX-compatible: <code>bash</code>,
<code>dash</code>, <code>ksh</code>, etc.</li>
<li>GNU <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> is the most popular shell implementation in the world.
It was first released in 1989, and implements the POSIX standard plus many
extensions.  It's the default shell on most Linux distributions, runs on BSD
Unix variants, <a href="https://scriptingosx.com/2019/06/moving-to-zsh/">used to ship on Mac OS X</a>, and <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/">runs on
Windows</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=osh-language#osh-language">OSH</a> is a shell implementation that's part of the Oil project.
It's compatible with both POSIX and <code>bash</code>.  The goal is to run <strong>existing
shell scripts</strong>.  It's done so <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2018/01/15.html">since January 2018</a>, and has matured
in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/releases.html">many regular releases</a> since then.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=oil-language#oil-language">Oil language</a> is a brand new, incompatible, shell
language.  The idea is to fix more than four decades of accumulated warts in
the Unix shell.  Many Unix users are angry that shell is so difficult, and
Oil aims to fix that.  (Example: Why is <code>x=1</code> different than <code>x = 1</code>?)</li>
</ul>
<p>More about the Oil language:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compared to POSIX shell and bash, Oil is <strong>easier to learn, write, and
debug</strong>.  It's designed for programmers who know Python, JavaScript, or Ruby,
but avoid shell.</li>
<li>Oil will do everything bash can, <strong>and more</strong>.  For example, it will have
dynamic types and structured data, not just strings.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2020/01/simplest-explanation.html">The Simplest Explanation of Oil</a>
shows examples of the language.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/latest/doc/idioms.html">Oil Language Idioms</a> compares
old shell code and new Oil code.  Importantly, the same interpreter runs both
styles.  It's useful to think of OSH and Oil separately, but there's a
<strong>gradual transition</strong> between the two.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best description of the project is on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/">the home page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oil is our upgrade path from <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> to a better language and runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="frequently-asked-questions"></a>
<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p>This section paraphrases questions I've received and summarizes the answers.
In most cases, I link to the original comment thread, which you can read for
details.</p>
<a name="how-is-oil-different-than-bash-or-zsh"></a>
<h3>How is Oil different than <code>bash</code> or <code>zsh</code>?</h3>
<p>Oil is taking shell seriously as a <strong>programming language</strong>, rather than
treating it as a text-based UI that can be abused to write programs.</p>
<p>To see why this is valuable, consider these two groups of shell users:</p>
<ol>
<li>People who use shell to type a few commands here and there.</li>
<li>People who write scripts, which may get into the hundreds or even thousands
of lines.</li>
</ol>
<p>Oil is aimed at group 2.  If you're in group 1, there's admittedly <strong>no
reason</strong> to use it right now.</p>
<p>However, group 2 writes scripts for group 1 to use!  So I believe the benefits
of Oil will eventually bubble up.</p>
<p>In other words, I'm building a <strong>solid foundation</strong> for a few more decades of
shell usage.</p>

<a name="i-dont-understand-why-not-use-a-different-a-programming-language"></a>
<h3>I don't understand.  Why not use a different a programming language?</h3>
<p>It's important to be compatible with existing code.  You might not personally
use shell as a programming language, but all Unix users still rely on big shell
programs.  It's often used at build time, but it's still used at runtime too,
e.g. on embedded Linux devices.</p>
<p>Some of this code is old, but much of it is <strong>new</strong>.  It's not a small amount
of code, either.  Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, a popular cluster manager from Google (released around 2014),
has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/cloud/kubernetes/index.html">48,000+ lines</a> of shell in its repo.</li>
<li>Many distros use the <a href="https://github.com/scop/bash-completion">bash-completion</a> project for interactive completions,
and it has <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.3.0/test/wild.wwz/shell/bash-completion/index.html">26,000 lines</a> of shell.</li>

World</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/7lsajn/oil_shell_03_release/drom6q4/">Original question and answer</a> (reddit.com)</p>
<a name="shouldnt-we-discourage-people-from-writing-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't we discourage people from writing shell scripts?</h3>
<p>There are three problems with that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It won't work</strong>.  It would be like trying to convince people who are paid
to write PHP not to write PHP.  Many people have wasted breath on that, but
important sites like Wikipedia are still written in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">hundreds of thousands
of lines of PHP</a>.</li>
<li>Even if a new line of shell never gets written, there will still be a <strong>huge
installed base</strong> of shell scripts that you may need to understand (e.g. when
they don't work).</li>
<li>Shell is <strong>still the best tool</strong> for many jobs.  Most new "cloud" projects
rely on Linux system images, in VMs or containers, and shell is the ideal
language for creating such images.   Even if you use a framework like Chef
or Docker, you're still using bits of shell.</li>
</ol>
<a name="shouldnt-scripts-over-100-lines-be-rewritten-in-python-or-ruby"></a>
<h3>Shouldn't scripts over 100 lines be rewritten in Python or Ruby?</h3>
<p>That's a reasonable choice in some circumstances.  If everyone on your dev team
knows Python, maintaining a shell script can be more costly than maintaining a
Python script.</p>
<p>However, Python and Ruby aren't good shell replacements in general.  Shell is a
domain-specific language for dealing with <strong>concurrent processes</strong> and the
<strong>file system</strong>.  But Python and Ruby have too much abstraction over these
concepts, sometimes in the name of portability (e.g. to Windows).  They hide
what's really going on.</p>
<p>I encountered a nice blog post, <a href="https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/bashing-the-bash-replacing-shell-scripts-with-python-d8d201bc0989">Replacing Shell Scripts with
Python</a>, which, in my opinion, inadvertently proves the
opposite point.  The Python version is longer and has more dependencies.  In
other words, it's more difficult to write and maintain.</p>
<p>Also see the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html#the-biggest-misconception-shell-xor-python">The Biggest Misconception: Shell XOR Python</a> in <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/01/philosophy-design.html">yesterday's
post</a>.</p>

<a name="are-you-reinventing-perl"></a>
<h3>Are you reinventing Perl?</h3>
<p>It's true that Perl is closer to shell than Python and Ruby are.  For example,
the <code>perl -pie</code> idiom can take the place of <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code>.  However, Perl isn't
an acceptable shell either:</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't have true pipelines (of processes).  I believe you have to "shell
out" for this.</li>
<li>It doesn't have a concept of file descriptor state.  How do you write the
equivalent of <code>my_shell_func 2&gt; err.txt</code>, where <code>my_shell_func</code> can invoke
both functions and external commands?</li>
<li>Perl has a function called <code>grep()</code>, but the real <code>grep</code> is better for many
problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perl has been around for more than 30 years, and hasn't replaced shell.  It
hasn't replaced <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> either.</li>
<li>Perl 6 and Python 3 are both less-suited to shell-like problems than their
predecessors.  In other words, we still need a new shell.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it's true that, in some respects, Oil is retreading the same ground as
Perl.  But Oil is more faithful to shell, and its syntax uses fewer punctuation
characters.  In other words, it's less like "line noise".</p>
<p>Threads:</p>

</ul>
<a name="im-still-angry-and-i-dont-want-you-to-create-a-new-shell"></a>
<h3>I'm still angry, and I don't want you to create a new shell.</h3>
<p>You might be angry because you had to maintain a nasty shell script written by
a coworker.</p>
<p>If that's the case, you should be helping Oil succeed!  The only way to "kill
bash" is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reimplement it, then</li>
<li>Gradually migrate away from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is analogous to how Facebook is moving away from PHP by developing a
similar, but cleaner, language called <a href="http://hacklang.org/">Hack</a>.</p>
<p>Perl, Python, and Ruby have all existed for over 25 years, but they haven't
replaced shell.  New shell scripts are being written every day.</p>

</ul>
<p>(Oil also has some similarity to <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, which smoothed over some of
JavaScript's rough edges and added syntactic sugar, but didn't stray from its
core execution model.  CoffeeScript was a success because it influenced
subsequent versions of JavaScript.)</p>
<a name="should-i-limit-myself-to-posix-shell-scripts"></a>
<h3 id="limit-to-posix">Should I limit myself to POSIX shell scripts?</h3>
<p>I've seen this suggestion a lot, and there are entire books devoted to it.  If
your script is <strong>small</strong>, it may be a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>For bigger programs, limiting yourself to POSIX is not just inconvenient, it's
also an ill-defined and virtually untestable concept.  Evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Debian project created a minimal shell variant called <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, which
replaced <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>.  However, <code>dash</code> and the <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#scripts">Debian Policy on Shell
Scripts</a> both allow non-POSIX features, like <code>local</code>.  Local
variables are essential for writing maintainable shell scripts, but POSIX
doesn't mention them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most shells <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00000.html">parse assignment builtins differently than other
builtins</a>, but the <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=posix-grammar#posix-grammar">POSIX shell grammar</a>
has no notion of an assignment.  This issue surfaced as early as 2010, but as
of 2018, it's not in a published spec.</p>
<p>This issue <strong>isn't theoretical</strong> — <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a> differ in
practice, but POSIX doesn't specify which is correct.</p>
<p>In other words, POSIX is incomplete and out of date.  (However, I've
discovered that shells are highly conformant with respect to things the
standard <strong>does</strong> specify.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As of 2021, I believe that OSH is a "better POSIX".  POSIX is a <strong>descriptive</strong>
specification and not a <strong>normative</strong> one. That means that it's an observation
of how popular shells like <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=ksh#ksh">ksh</a> and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> happened to behave at a certain
time.  In other words, it's a compromise.</p>
<p>Similarly, OSH is based on <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2017/06/22.html">extensive testing</a> of the behavior of <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a>,
<a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=dash#dash">dash</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=mksh#mksh">mksh</a>, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=zsh#zsh">zsh</a>, and <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=busybox#busybox">busybox</a> <code>ash</code>.  That is, it uses the
same philosophy as POSIX, but it specifies more of the language.  Roughly
speaking, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=spec-test#spec-test">spec tests</a> are an <strong>executable specification</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-bash/2018-01/msg00002.html">Tilde Expansion</a>: Another case where shells diverge in practice, but
POSIX is silent.</li>
</ul>

<a name="how-can-you-design-a-good-language-on-top-of-shell"></a>
<h3>How can you design a good language on top of shell?</h3>
<p>POSIX shell has global options that affect parsing and execution like <code>set -o noglob</code>.  And <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html?tag=bash#bash">bash</a> extends them with options like <code>shopt -s lastpipe</code>.</p>
<p>Oil continues in the same vein, adding several shell options under <code>s…</code></p></div>

            The Culture War: Iain M. Banks’s Billionaire Fans    </h3>                    
<h4><strong>Why Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos love Iain M. Banks’ anarcho-communist space opera</strong>.</h4>



<p><strong>by Kurt Schiller</strong></p>



<p>Explicitly ideological fiction is as old as fiction itself. From ancient steles that boasted unconvincingly of the glorious defeat of the Sea Peoples to the biased histories of that ancient greek fabulist Herodotus, humans have always had a tendency to entangle ideology and entertainment.</p>



<p>And if anything, the last hundred years have only seen this tendency grow. Fiction—whether the written word or newer mediums—has remained a popular standard-bearer for ideologies as diverse as technocratic liberalism (<em>The West Wing</em>), free market right-libertarianism (<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, <em>The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress</em>), socialism (<em>The Jungle</em>, <em>The Iron Heel</em>), and even violent white supremacy (<em>The Turner Diaries</em>, <em>The Camp of the Saints</em>). And in the 21st century, the ideological implications of media consumption have become as micro-targeted as the media themselves: if you are a “true American patriot”, you might consume such jingoistic potboilers as <em>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi </em>or the suburbs-vs-antifa thriller <em>The Reliant</em>. If you are a god-fearing evangelical, perhaps <em>Assassin 33 A.D.</em> or the Kevin Sorbo-fronted <em>God’s Not Dead </em>series are more your speed. Seeking to seize the means? Perhaps you can first seize a controller and dig into <em>Tonight We Riot</em> or Disco Elysium.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="460" height="276" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks.jpg 460w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iain-banks-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"></figure></div>



<p>Meanwhile, the reverse has also become true: “If a particular piece of media reeks of ideological impurity,” the conventional wisdom seems to go, “why bother? Why would you let those toxic ideas into your head?”</p>



<p>For all that these notions of ideological contagion and symbology are hilariously overblown, there’s some truth to the matter. At times, reading or watching long-form fiction from someone to whom you are ideologically opposed can feel exhausting, draining, aggravating, and ultimately a bit futile—like being at a party where you simply don’t like anyone, don’t care about the discussions, and are annoyed at the food. There’s much to be gained by engaging with our rhetorical opponents… but, frankly, only up to a point.</p>



<p>What then are we to take from the distinct and quite public fascination of the two richest men in the world—Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, together worth more than $375 billion—with the sci-fi works of Iain M. Banks, an avowedly socialist author who set his far-future fiction in what might best be described as a post-scarcity, anarcho-communist utopia; a world where your Bezoses and your Musks are not just irrelevant, but actively sought out and disempowered by a society comprised of property-less workers and all-caring, mostly-benevolent A.I.s?</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>Iain M. Banks’s <em>Culture </em>series—consisting of 10 largely standalone novels and a handful of short stories published between 1987 and the author’s death in 2013—charts the intrigues, impacts, and subterfuges of a group of space-faring, far-future transhumans called The Culture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some ways, it’s an almost archetypal space opera. Tough-as-nails soldiers and shady sci-fi diplomats wage war across a variety of fantastical planets and megastructures. Massive, high-tech ships piloted by ultra-powerful self-aware A.I. called Minds have super-science duels among the stars. There are assassinations, revolutions, mass battles with hundreds of ships that play out on a grand scale (while taking only a fraction of a second in objective time).</p>



<p>At first glance, it seems like exactly what you’re imagining when you hear the phrase “space opera,” and so of course two super-wealthy spaceflight-and-sci-fi aficionados would be fans, right? After all, both men own private spaceflight contractors (Musk’s SpaceX and Bezos’s Blue Origin) and speak often of mankind’s future among the stars, with Musk <a href="https://www.spacex.com/human-spaceflight/mars/"><strong>proposing a mission to Mars</strong></a> and Bezos <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/11/18564655/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-moon-new-glenn"><strong>pitching a return to the moon and other intrasystem exploration</strong></a>. Seeking the stars seems to be in their blood (assuming it hasn’t been completely replaced with <a href="https://bloodknife.com/buy-happiness-here/"><strong>Soylent and whatever nootropics billionaires get</strong></a>).</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png" alt="" width="438" height="576" srcset="https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM.png 536w, https://bloodknife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-22-at-12.01.23-AM-228x300.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px"></figure></div>



<p>Both men have found ways to conspicuously show their fandom: Musk by <a href="https://www.tor.com/2015/01/23/elon-musk-iain-m-banks-just-read-the-instructions/"><strong>naming SpaceX rockets after Banks’s tongue-in-cheek Culture ships</strong></a> (“Just Read The Instructions,” “Of Course I Still Love You”) and a “brain interface” loosely patterned after the Culture’s neural laces; Bezos by attempting to bankroll a big-budget TV series based on the books, although this latter effort was unceremoniously canceled after Banks’s estate abruptly backed out. (Probably a wise decision, given both the challenge of adapting the material and the absurdity of one of the most exploitative corporations in the world attempting to adapt proudly far-left sci-fi.)</p>



<p>Apart from official projects, both men have made public references to Banks’s work as well—not much, but enough to know that they either really have read it, or that they were well-briefed by their PR teams.</p>



<p>“The Culture series is certainly, in terms of more modern science fiction, one of my absolute favorites,” Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/jeff-bezos-isdc-space-vision/"><strong>told GeekWire in 2018</strong></a>, when asked about his love for the series. ”We’re not quite at that level technologically, we’ve a lot of work to do before we get there, but there’s a utopian element to it that I find very attractive.”</p>



<p>*  *  *  *  *</p>



<p>There are ultimately two things that set the <em>Culture </em>series apart from many of its peers.</p>



<p>The first is the literary bent of the prose. Space opera (and genre fiction in general) has never <em>actually</em> looked like the “lasers and explosions” stereotype it was saddled with, but it’s worth emphasizing the depth of Banks’s characterization and strange depictions of an uncanny future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Characters grapple with trauma, identity, and crisis, and they do so without losing sight of the visceral and pulpy thrill of space opera’s inherent adventure and intrigue. Moments of quiet contemplation and deep metaphysical quandaries abound, coupled with strange literary pretensions that wouldn’t seem out of place in magical realism or literary fiction—a vast machine the size of a planet made of interlocking, nested globes, each holding a separate society; a grief-sick partner who holds their pregnancy in stasis for the better part of a century in a strange act of penance and passive-aggression; a vast extra-dimensional object that resists all attempts to analyze, communicate, or attack it, nearly sparking an interstellar war. The stories of the Culture simultaneously have a very real sense of strangeness and a deep, complex humanist bent, as if picking the best bit from multiple genres without losing the sense and feel of each constituent part.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><span><strong>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist.&nbsp;</strong></span></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Perhaps this savvy genre-bending should come as no surprise, considering Banks was an established author of literary fiction before he broke through as a sci-fi writer. While he had always dreamed of writing sci-fi (and indeed wrote at least one Culture novel before breaking through as a lit-fic author), it wasn’t until his break-out literary novel <em>The Wasp Factory</em> (1984) that he was able to start selling his sci-fi manuscripts, eventually settling into a rhythm where he danced more-or-less annually between mind-bending literary fiction published under the name Iain Banks and epic sci-fi novels published under the name “Iain <em>M.</em> Banks.” (His family, Banks explained, was offended he hadn’t used his middle name—Menzies—on <em>The Wasp Factory</em>.)</p>



<p>The other thing that sets both Banks and his <em>Culture </em>books apart is their overt and uncompromising politics.</p>



<p>Since he first came onto the literary scene in the mid-Eighties, Banks was an avowed and rather public socialist. He was a member of the Scottish Socialist Party and a frequent interviewee for magazines like <em>Socialist Worker</em>, as well as an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War who campaigned for the impeachment of Tony Blair and, when that failed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/25/hayfestival2007.hayfestival"><strong>shredded his passport and mailed the remains to 10 Downing Street</strong>.</a> He spoke openly, and passionately, about labor exploitation, anti-imperialism, the environment, and a host of other now-popular issues, most of which still languished on the edge of the discourse when Banks first hit the scene.</p>



<p>He was also never shy about intermingling his politics and his work. Indeed, he saw them as being one and the same. Nowhere is this more clear than in a <a href="http://www.vavatch.co.uk/books/banks/cultnote.htm"><strong>1994 essay titled “A Few Notes on the Culture,”</strong></a> which Banks posted to the Usenet group rec.arts.sf.written. The sprawling document is both an overview of the Culture and an exegesis on Banks’s own worldview; between paragraphs delving into the society’s naming conventions, technology, and democratic apparatuses, Banks waxed poetic about the deleterious moral impact of capitalism and market forces:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“The market, for all its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially blind system, and is – without the sort of drastic amendments liable to cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset – intrinsically incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering of conscious beings.</em></p><p><em>It is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] – through grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others – a kind of synthetic evil.”</em></p><cite>Iain M. Banks, “A Few Notes on the Culture”</cite></blockquote>



<p>These same politics have been front and center in Banks’s conception of the Culture, a group he affectionately described as “hippie commies with hyper-weapons and a deep distrust of both Marketolatry and Greedism.”</p></div></div>

<p>Not-forking avoids duplicating the source code of one project within another
project, where the projects are external to each other. </p>

<p>Not-forking <strong>avoids project-level forking</strong> by largely automating change management in ways that 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control">version control systems</a> such as 
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/">Fossil</a>, <a href="https://git-scm.org/">Git</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> cannot.</p>

<p>This following diagram shows the simplest case of the problem Not-Forking solves. 
An external piece of software, here called
<em>Upstream</em>, forms a part of a new project called <em>Combined Project</em>.
<em>Upstream</em> is not a library provided on your system, because then you could simply
link to <em>libupstream</em>. Instead, <em>Upstream</em> is source code that you copy into the <em>Combined Project</em>
directory tree like this:</p>

<p>Some questions immediately arise:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should you import <em>Upstream</em> into your source code management system? All
source code should be under version management, but having a checkout of an
external repository within your local repository feels wrong... and do we want
to lose upstream project history?</li>
<li>If <em>Upstream</em> makes modifications, how can you pull those modifications into
<em>Combined Project</em> safely?</li>
<li>If <em>Combined Project</em> has changed files in <em>Upstream</em>, how can you then merge
the changes and any new changes made in <em>Upstream</em>?</li>
</ul>

<p>The developer now has good reasons to separate <em>Upstream</em> project code from its
repository and maintain it within the <em>Combined Project</em> tree, because in the
short term it is just simpler. But that brings the very big problem of the
Reluctant Project Fork. A Reluctant Project Fork, or "vendoring" as the <a href="https://debian.org/">Debian
Project</a> calls it, is where <em>Combined Project's</em> version of
<em>Upstream</em> starts to drift from the original <em>Upstream</em>.  Nobody wants to
maintain code that is currently being maintained by its original authors,
but it can become complicated to avoid that. Not-Forking makes
this a much easier problem to solve.</p>

<p>Not-forking also addresses more complicated scenarios, such as when two
unrelated projects are upstream of <em>Combined Project</em>:</p>

<p>In more detail, the problem of project forking includes these cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tracking multiple upstreams, each with a different release schedule and version control system. Manual merging is difficult, but failing to merge or only occasionally merging will often result in a hard fork. LumoSQL tracks <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/lumosql/dir?ci=tip&amp;name=not-fork.d">three upstreams</a> that differ in all these ways</li>
<li>Tracking an upstream to which you wish to make changes that are not mergable. Without Not-Forking a manual merge is the only option even if there is only one upstream and even if the patch set is not complicated. An obvious case of this is replacing, deleting or creating whole files</li>
<li><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/836911/">Vendoring</a>, where a package copies a library or module into its own tree, avoiding the versioning problems that arise when using system-provided libraries. This then becomes a standalone fork until the next copy is done, which often involves a manual porting task. Not-Forking can stop this problem arising at all</li>
<li>Vendoring with version control, for example some of the <a href="https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/network/members">132 forks of LibVNC on GitHub</a> are for maintained, shipping products which are up to hundreds of commits behind the original. Seemingly they are manually synced with the original every year or two, but potentially Not-Forking could remove most of this manual work</li>
</ul>

<p>The following diagram indicates how even more complex scenarios are managed with
Not-Forking. Any of the version control systems could be swapped with any
other, and production use of Not-Forking today handles up to 50 versions of
three upstreams with ease. </p>

<p>If you are reading this on Github, you are looking at a read-only mirror.
The official home is the <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/not-forking">Fossil repository</a>,
and that is the best way to contribute and interact with the community. You 
may raise PRs on Github, but they will end up being pushed through Fossil anyway.</p>

<p>Here you will find the tool and its libraries, and the <a href="https://lumosql.org/src/not-forking/doc/trunk/doc/not-forking.md">full documentation</a>.
It also contains an example configuration (in directory doc/examples) which can
be used for testing.</p>

<p>To install the tool:</p>
<pre><code>perl Makefile.PL
make
make install     &lt;== you will likely need root for this
</code></pre>
<p>At which point the <code>not-fork</code> command is installed in the system and its
required modules are available where your perl installation expects to
find them.</p>

<p>You might be wondering about runtime dependencies. That is covered in the
full documentation, but in brief, not-fork knows what is needed for each of
many different scenarios and it does not need to be addressed now. That 
means you don't need to worry about what not-fork might be used for when
you install it. Currently not-fork can use access methods including 
Git, Fossil, wget/tar and ftp. Modules will likely be added, for example for
Mercurial.</p>

<p>It is also possible to use the tool without installing by using the
following commands:</p>
<pre><code>perl Makefile.PL
make
perl -Iblib/lib bin/not-fork [options] ...
</code></pre>
<p>To try the tools using the included example configuration, use:</p>
<pre><code>perl -Iblib/lib bin/not-fork -idoc/examples [other_options] ...
</code></pre>

<p>Git <code>rebase</code> cannot solve the Not-Forking problem space. Neither can Git
submodules. Nor Fossil's <code>merge</code>, nor the <code>quilt</code> approach to combining
patches.</p>

<p>A VCS cannot address the Not-Forking class of problems because the decisions
required are typically made by humans doing …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Searching through a system to find files or folders can be complex and time consuming, even with a graphical user interface. In this chapter we'll look at how to use the shell to search for files and folders and some quick ways to accomplish common tasks.</p><h2 id="introducing-the-find-command">Introducing the Find Command</h2><p>The <code>find</code> (search for files) command is used to search for files and folders and to perform operations on the results. Let's see it in action by running it in the <code>~/effective-shell</code> folder.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Running the Samples</strong></p><p>Each of these samples assumes you are in the <code>effective-shell</code> samples folder. If you don't have this folder, just run:</p><pre><code>mkdir -p ~/effective-shell
curl -s -L https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-playground.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C ~/effective-shell
cd ~/effective-shell
</code></pre><p>This command will download and extract the samples folder in your home directory and then set it as your working directory.</p></blockquote><p>Let's set the current working directory to the <code>effective-shell</code> folder and run the <code>find</code> command:</p><pre><code>$ cd ~/effective-shell
$ find
.
./text
./text/simpsons-characters.txt
./scripts
./scripts/show-info.sh
./websites
./websites/simple
./websites/simple/index.html
./websites/simple/styles.css
./websites/simple/code.js
...
</code></pre><p>By default, <code>find</code> will list all of the files and folders which are present in the current working directory. It will also show the <em>children</em> of any folders it finds, meaning that it shows the full hierarchy of files and folders.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Find not working on MacOS</strong></p><p>If you are running these samples on MacOS, you will probably see the following output:</p><pre><code>$ find
usage: find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] [-f path] path ... [expression]
</code></pre><p>This is the <code>find</code> command telling you what parameters can be used. On MacOS the default <code>find</code> command does <em>not</em> assume the current working directory.</p><p>This is because there is a difference between the MacOS and GNU versions of <code>find</code> and in this book I will use GNU wherever possible as it will be more compatible (MacOS is based on the BSD operating system, most Linux distributions use a set of tools which are part of the GNU project - there are sometimes differences).</p><p>To run the equivalent command on MacOS, just provide the current directory as a parameter:</p><pre><code>$ find .
</code></pre><p>A better solution is to install the <code>findtools</code> package, which will install the GNU versions of the tools we'll be using:</p><pre><code>$ brew install findtools
$ gfind
</code></pre><p>If you do install <code>findtools</code>, remember that all of the GNU versions of the tools start with <code>g</code> - so when reading this chapter substitute <code>find</code> with <code>gfind</code>.</p><p>For more details on what BSD and GNU are, you can check <a href="https://effective-shell.com/docs/work-in-progress/">Chapter - Unix, Linux, GNU and POSIX</a>, which covers these concepts in detail.</p></blockquote><p>So this is the <code>find</code> command - you can provide it a directory (or let it use the current directory) and the command will list all of files and folders in the given directory, including all children.</p><p>You can also provide multiple directories:</p><pre><code>$ find /usr/bin /usr/sbin
/usr/bin
/usr/bin/fwupdtool
/usr/bin/gnome-keyring
...
/usr/sbin
/usr/sbin/cupsd
/usr/sbin/pppdump
...
</code></pre><p>This is the most basic use of <code>find</code> - showing a file and folder hierarchy. Now let's look at how to search using this command.</p><p>Perhaps the most common use for <code>find</code> is to search for files. There are a number of options which can be used to filter the results shown, which allow us to search for files. Let's look at some common ways to refine our searches, using the <code>~/effective-shell</code> folder as a playground to search in.</p><h2 id="searching-for-files-or-folders-only">Searching for Files or Folders only</h2><p>The <code>-type</code> parameter can be used to search either for files or folders. Let's see both in action. First, we'll search for files only, using <code>-type f</code>:</p><pre><code>$ find . -type f
./text/simpsons-characters.txt
./scripts/show-info.sh
./websites/simple/index.html
./websites/simple/styles.css
./websites/simple/code.js
...
</code></pre><p>And for folders, using <code>-type d</code> (remember, <code>d</code> is for directory!):</p><pre><code>$ find . -type d
.
./text
./scripts
./websites
./websites/simple
...
</code></pre><p>It's important to note that when searching for folders, the <code>find</code> command shows folders which are normally hidden, such as the special ‘dot’ folder<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><p>In both commands, I specified the ‘dot’ folder as the place to search. I could omit this parameter; I just think it makes it a little more readable.</p><h2 id="searching-by-name">Searching by Name</h2><p>We can use the <code>-name</code> parameter to search for files and folders by name. For example, this is how we would search for anything with the letters <code>log</code> in the name:</p><pre><code>$ find . -name "*log*"
./logs
./logs/web-server-logs.txt
./logs/apm-logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm05.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm02.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm03.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm00.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm01.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm04.logs
</code></pre><p>You can see I've used a <code>*</code> wildcard before and after the letters <code>log</code> - this means that I have actually supplied a <em>pattern</em>, which could be read as ‘any characters (including nothing), followed by the characters <code>log</code>, followed by any other characters (including no characters)'.</p><p>If I don't use a wildcard, the <code>logs</code> folder will not be found - because it doesn't match the <em>pattern</em> <code>log</code> - without using a wildcard, the pattern is explicitly looking for an <em>exact</em> match:</p><pre><code>$ find . -name "log"
</code></pre><p>Note the output - no files or folders were found, as none have the <em>exact</em> name <code>log</code>. The <code>-name</code> parameter is very specific - it will only match files or folders with the <em>name</em> provided. Here's an example:</p><pre><code>$ find . -name "apm00.logs"
./logs/apm-logs/apm00.logs
</code></pre><p>Here I have used <code>-name</code> to search for an <em>exact</em> name. What about if I search for <code>apm-logs</code>?</p><pre><code>$ find . -name "apm-logs"
./logs/apm-logs
</code></pre><p>The <em>folder</em> named <code>apm-logs</code> is found, but not the <em>files</em> in the folder - the names of those files don't match the pattern <code>apm-logs</code>. What if we make it a wildcard pattern?</p><pre><code>$ find . -name "*apm-logs*"
./logs/apm-logs
</code></pre><p>The same results! This is because for the <em>files</em> in the <code>apm-logs</code> folder they don't have <code>apm-logs</code> in their name anywhere - that is in their <em>path</em>, i.e. the full address of the file including its folder. So let's look at how to search by path next!</p><blockquote><p><strong>An Important Note on Quotes</strong></p><p>Make sure you use quotes when building your patterns. This command:</p><pre><code>$ find . -name "*log*"
</code></pre><p>Will give different output to this command:</p><pre><code>$ find . -name *log*
</code></pre><p>Why is this? In the first case, we explicitly pass the text <code>*log*</code> to the <code>find</code> command and let it deal with it. It uses the wildcards to build a pattern. Because we've surrounded the parameter with quotes, the shell itself doesn't try to do anything clever with the wildcard.</p><p>In the second case, <em>the shell itself</em> tries to deal with the wildcards, then passes the results to <code>find</code>. And the shell deals with them differently. You can see exactly what the shell expands them to with this snippet:</p><pre><code>$ parameter=(*log*)
$ echo $parameter
logs
</code></pre><p>In the second case the shell is performing its own expansion of the wildcard and not searching through all of the child directories. We need to wrap the parameter with quotes so that the shell knows <em>not</em> to interfere with the text and instead pass it to <code>find</code>, so that find can deal with the wildcard.</p><p>The shell is using <em>globbing</em> in the second case, which is covered in a later chapter.</p></blockquote><h2 id="searching-by-path">Searching by Path</h2><p>The <code>-path</code> parameter can be used to filter the results based on a pattern in the <em>path</em> of the file:</p><pre><code>$ find . -path "*apm-logs*"
./logs/apm-logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm05.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm02.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm03.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm00.logs
./logs/apm-logs/apm01.logs

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>What are amulets? How are they situated in the larger narrative of European healing? Varied and complex objects, amulets present both challenges and opportunities for historians and museums alike. Yet an examination of these often-overlooked items within a medical context can provide significant information about cure and protection over different times and geographies. This article analyses ten amulets from the Science Museum collections, and asks what we can learn from exploring these objects’ material features and varying functions. It argues for a re-consideration of amulets from their categorisation by nineteenth- and twentieth-century collectors and classification by modern museums, to their recognition as a significant part of the history of healing.</p>

<h2>Introduction – a hare’s foot and a Billiken</h2>


<p>On his way home from running errands one morning in January 1665, Samuel Pepys stopped to buy a hare. Pepys was a Member of Parliament and administrator of the Navy, and is perhaps most famous for keeping a diary for almost a decade during his younger life. A few weeks earlier, despite ‘very cold weather’ he had celebrated a phase of good health, unsure whether to attribute it to his daily pill of turpentine, the fact that he had ‘left off the wearing of a gowne’, or simply his ‘hare’s foote’. Yet this good health did not last. The new year brought burning, pimples and pricks, bladder problems, headaches and ‘a great deal of pain’ to Pepys’ body (<a href="#reference-60">Pepys; Wheatley (ed), 1893</a>).<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> On this January morning, however, he had run into an acquaintance at Westminster Hall – Sir William Batten, Member of Parliament and surveyor to the Navy (<a href="#reference-59">Pepys, Latham (ed), 2003, p xlv</a>).<a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a> Batten had given Pepys medical advice regarding his latest ailment, a most painful bout of colic, for which he showed Pepys the mistake he had made with the hare’s foot and guaranteed the perfect modification to his remedy. Originally, the foot had not been cut properly, and ‘hath not the joynt to it’; this was where the problem lay.<a href="#footnote-3">[3]</a> Eager to try anything to alleviate his swollen belly and ‘grudgings of wind’, Pepys handled Batten’s correctly cut hare’s foot, and noted in wonder:</p>
<p>[Batten] assures me he never had his cholique since he carried it about him: and it is a strange thing how fancy works, for I no sooner almost handled his foote but my belly began to be loose and to break wind, and whereas I was in some pain yesterday and t’other day and in fear of more to-day, I became very well, and so continue.<a href="#footnote-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The next day, having obtained a new animal and taken Batten’s advice, Pepys was finally convinced: ‘To my office till past 12, and then home to supper and to bed, being now mighty well, and truly I cannot but impute it to my fresh hare’s foote.’<a href="#footnote-5">[5]</a> One thing was clear; the hare’s foot had worked. Pepys was cured of colic.</p>

        <p>Amulet One – Hare’s foot, object number A666124</p>
        
    
    
</section>
<p>This object is not unfamiliar to us. This particular hare’s foot, which forms part of the Science Museum’s amulet collection, is originally from Norfolk and dated 1870–1920, but hares’ and rabbits’ feet can still be bought as ‘lucky charms’ and are widely available on the internet.<a href="#footnote-6">[6]</a>&nbsp; Populist literature similarly continues to reference the use of these items; <em>Scientific American</em> published an article on ‘What Makes a Rabbit’s Foot Lucky’ in 2011 (<a href="#reference-19">D’Costa, 2011</a>). Such objects remain a part of popular culture – that is, part of recognised cultural traditions – over three hundred years after being employed by Pepys. Yet we can observe a shift in function. In Pepys’ world, the various elements that constituted sickness and health were broad and wide-ranging. Illness, like health, could be affected by an extensive range of things from an imbalance of the bodily humours, environmental factors such as sleep, food, emotions and exercise, supernatural or preternatural forces, and even the stars.<a href="#footnote-7">[7]</a> Whilst Pepys sometimes consulted learned medical practitioners, the variety of people from whom he could seek counsel was extensive. In this case, he took the advice of his friend Sir William Batten.<a href="#footnote-8">[8]</a> Pepys’ story is part of a larger narrative of healing in which learned medicine, religion, astrology, magic, fate and fortune all played a role. As part of healing, objects could be invested with power from any one or more of these various sources, and employed to cure or protect. These objects have often been called amulets, both historically and today, although our interpretation of them has changed over time. The healing potency of amulets has not always been entirely understood, and their means of operation often hidden from comprehension. Yet within their own contexts, this functional complexity has not detracted from the items’ curative or protective effects. The narrative of healing that included amulets continued throughout the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and only when modern medicine necessitated ‘scientific’, empiric evidence of the mechanisms of objects’ efficacy did this change. In other words, amulets were relegated from the domain of authorised healing once it became a requirement to know and explain <em>how</em> cures worked, not just that they <em>did</em> work.</p>
<div><p>The word ‘amulet’ originates from the Latin ‘amulētum’, and was used by Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) to denote an item worn on the body for therapeutic, apotropaic or exorcistic benefit (Skemer, 2006, pp 6–7). Whilst many have noted the belief that the word can be traced back to Arabic, the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) has refuted this (<a href="#reference-56">OED, 2018, ‘amulet’</a>). Whilst definitions vary, ‘charm’ is often used synonymously with ‘amulet’, whilst ‘talisman’ features less frequently. For instance, the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford has implied a semantic similarity between ‘amulets’ and ‘charms’, noting that an amulet is defined by the OED as: ‘Anything worn about the person as a charm preventative against evil, mischief, disease, witchcraft, etc.’, whilst a charm is described as ‘Anything worn about the person to avert evil or ensure prosperity’ – ‘though a charm may also be a spell or incantation believed to have a magical power’ (<a href="#reference-61">Pitt Rivers Museum, 2017</a>). ‘Amulets’ and ‘charms’ are also used synonymously by the Horniman Museum in London, and the Oxford English Dictionary’s definitions further allude to this; one entry noting that a charm is ‘Anything worn about the person to avert evil or ensure prosperity; an amulet’ (<a href="#reference-39">Horniman Museum, 2017</a>).<a href="#footnote-9">[9]</a></p><p>Evidently, amulets cannot be easily and simply defined, in part because the ways in which they have been used and understood have changed from antiquity to today. What, then, is the defining feature which makes an object an amulet? The answer to this is, its power. In the most basic and fundamental way, amulets are invested with the potency to heal. Healing centres around cure and protection, but where once these two actions were closely related, now they are more distinct. Historically, healing has not been monolithic and has taken many forms, relating to and deriving from faculties of fortune, fate, astrology, religion, magic, luck and more. Healing could therefore constitute anything from curing a specific disease, to averting a malevolent force, or fostering good fortune. This functional variation is valuable, as it can tell us a great deal about the practices and cultures in which objects are situated, as well as the objects themselves. For instance, around 250 years after Pepys cured his colic with our first amulet, the hare’s foot, an amusement park opened in Paris. As part of their brand <em>Luna Park</em> adopted a mascot known as a ‘Billiken’, a creature devised by an American artist who reportedly saw the mysterious figure in a dream and patented it in 1908. The Billiken, known as ‘God of Things as They Ought To Be’ was said to bring the customer luck, indicated by the inscription upon our second object, the park’s token: <em>Si tu me gardes je te porterai bonheur</em> (‘If you keep me I will bring you good luck/happiness’) / ‘I smile at you bad luck can’t harm you’.<a href="#footnote-10">[10]</a> This amulet offered protection and generated auspicious effects to the person who possessed it. Evidently, it had been considered important enough to be kept. Thus whilst culturally, temporally and materially distinct, the hare’s foot and the Luna Park Billiken are nevertheless united by their curative and protective potency, and demonstrate the wide spectrum of healing.</p></div>

</section>
<div><p>Yet where once healing and amulets went hand in hand, modern discussions tend to treat them as distinct. Labelling certain objects as ‘amulets’ questions their power to work, and when these items and their potency are challenged, they are ‘othered’, relegated and disassociated from the realms of healing. The hare’s foot provides an example of this. Whether situated in museum collections or referred to in common parlance, this amulet is not commonly recognised today as a curative object, nor regarded as an effective remedy for the colic. Instead, the feet of rabbits and hares are now bought, used and regarded often merely as ‘lucky’ items. This hare’s foot from the Science Museum’s collections is recorded as an amulet employed ‘for protection against cramp’.<a href="#footnote-11">[11]</a> To label something as prophylactic, an item ‘against’ a particular affliction exemplifies …</p></div></div></section></article></div>

<p>I like poker, but I’m better at chess.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png" alt="Poker vs chess" width="499" height="451" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-347x314.png 347w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-694x628.png 694w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-768x695.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-1536x1389.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></a></p>
<p>Poker can be a lot of fun if you have a witty enough group of friends and a generous snack budget. There’s nothing worse than playing poker with a bunch of serious gamblers who think conversation and choice of hot wing spiciness are potential tells.</p>
<p>I like chess because nothing is hidden. I don’t like leaving things to chance, and I’m often foolish enough to believe I can figure out how to win if I have all the information.</p>
<p>In chess, there are no missing pieces. There isn’t a sneaky queen that your opponent can place on the board when you least expect it. Everything is in the open. The strategy and tactics are entirely determined by what is sitting in front of you in plain sight.</p>
<p>If I try to play poker the way I play chess, I’m going to lose. I can’t see all the cards. Information is hidden from me, and it’s information I need to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>If you can’t stand the uncertainty of poker, don’t do a startup. Don’t do an innovation project.</p>
<p>Innovation is like poker.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png" alt="A group of people playing poker" width="599" height="441" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image11-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>

<h2>The Rules of Startup Poker</h2>
<p>This is not an ordinary game of poker. (So don’t worry if you’re not a poker player, this will still make sense.) I will stretch the analogy of Texas Hold ‘Em as far as I can in this special variation of Startup Poker.</p>
<p>Each player needs to pay the ante to play. This is a cheap game, so we’ll keep the ante at $1. Those are the costs of running an innovation project.</p>
<p>Each player gets dealt two cards that they can keep hidden. These cards represent the organization’s unique capabilities and business model — what they already have when they start.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png" alt="A group of people playing poker part 2" width="599" height="450" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-418x314.png 418w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-836x628.png 836w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-768x577.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-1536x1154.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>As a normal Texas Hold ‘Em game progresses, the dealer will turn over additional cards in the middle of the table, which each player can use as part of their hand. First there are the three cards called “the Flop,” which are turned over at the same time. Then a fourth card is turned, which is called “Fourth Street” or “The Turn.” The last card is “the River.” Players can place bets before each of these rounds, trying to raise the stakes and force other players to fold.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png" alt="Texas Hold ‘Em startup poker" width="484" height="817" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png 1184w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-186x314.png 186w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-372x628.png 372w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-768x1297.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-910x1536.png 910w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px"></a></p>
<p>In Startup Poker, all these shared cards represent the Market. The first three cards are “the Early Adopters.” The fourth card is “the Early Majority” and the last is “the Late Majority.” As the game goes on, the Market matures and players discover if they hold the winning hand.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the person who has the best fit between the cards in their hand (which represents their business model) and the cards on the table (the Market). We can think of this as Product / Market fit or Business Model / Market fit.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png" alt="Market vs business model" width="599" height="472" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-399x314.png 399w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-797x628.png 797w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-768x605.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-1536x1210.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>The basic setup is the same, but remember, we are not playing regular Texas Hold ‘Em. Our rules are a bit different.</p>
<h2>Information Costs Money</h2>
<p>In Startup Poker, players have to ante another $1 every round to stay in. This is the cost of product development. (For our purposes, we are eliminating the standard Hold’em practice of “blinds,” which is a form of uneven antes.).</p>
<p>Additionally, instead of every round beginning by flipping over Market cards, players can get a preview by paying an additional $1 for each card. (In real poker, everyone sees the flipped card, but in our version you’re paying for a sneak peek.)</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png" alt="A poker player peeking at a flipped card" width="699" height="514" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of funding an <a href="https://kromatic.com/workshops/building-and-resourcing-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="innovation team" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">innovation team</a> to gather Market information. This investment isn’t really just money, it’s blood, sweat, and tears. But since people * time = money, we’ll just use our poker chips to represent this investment. The team is really going out into the real world, talking to customers, putting up a landing page, or running some other form of experiment or research to gather information.</p>
<p>At that point, they have the option to kill the idea (fold) or persevere before a round of betting.</p>
<p>Should we go straight ahead and bet on our hand? Or should we buy a peek at the Market first?</p>
<h2>Bet It All in Waterfall</h2>
<p>We could just close our eyes and bet it all on our pair of jacks. This is the equivalent of <a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/lean-startup-in-the-enterprise-anti-pattern-the-lean-waterfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall development</a>, where we place our bets and literally let the cards fall where they may.</p>
<p>We believe our cards are the correct ones for the Market, despite having not seen a single card from that Market. So we are placing a lot of faith in our business model and capabilities — our pair of jacks — and to be fair, that is a formidable hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png" alt="A player risking it all to bet in a poker game" width="599" height="405" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-465x314.png 465w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-929x628.png 929w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-768x519.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-1536x1038.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>But we’ve invested for the long hall, so we push it all in and check the snack bar while the hand plays out. But the Market isn’t kind. Our opponent starts with a 2 and a 4, but winds up closing a 2-6 straight with the 3, 5 and 6 from the Market. We lose to a weaker starting hand that ended up being better for that Market. We end up sitting in the corner binging on Pringles and lukewarm beer for the rest of the night while everyone else keeps playing, but that’s a risk of Waterfall.</p>
<h2>Information Has Value</h2>
<p>So instead of going all-in based on our business model and capabilities, should we buy that peek at the Market if we’re holding a pair of jacks?</p>
<p>The answer here is yes. Obviously so.</p>
<p>If everyone is sneaking a peek at the next card except you, you are at a huge disadvantage. Now they are playing chess because they can see more of the board. Meanwhile, you think you are still playing poker.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png" alt="A player playing chess blindfolded" width="512" height="565" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png 1812w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-285x314.png 285w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-569x628.png 569w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-768x847.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-1392x1536.png 1392w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>True, they still can’t see their opponents’ hole cards, so they don’t have all the information, but they have more than you.</p>
<p>So should you pay for the peek no matter what you are holding in your hand? Well, that depends on the cost.</p>
<h2>Don’t Play Every Hand</h2>
<p>If you start the game with a 2 of spades and a 9 of hearts, you have a bad hand. It’s not worth getting Market information because you are woefully unprepared for any Market. You might get lucky and find three twos on the board, but that’s a longshot. The odds are that someone else has a better hand. Just fold and play the next hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png" alt="2 Of spades and 9 of hearts" width="399" height="354" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-354x314.png 354w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-708x628.png 708w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-768x682.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-1536x1363.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px"></a></p>
<p>For large organizations, this is the equivalent of having an idea that is fundamentally mismatched with the company.</p>
<p>“Let’s make vegan hamburgers,” says the mining company.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is the 2/9 offsuit of business ideas. Let’s skip this idea and work on something with a little more promise.</p>
<h2>Pivoting</h2>
<p>In the real world, startups aren’t stuck with the cards that they are dealt. If something isn’t working with their business model, they can pivot.</p>
<p>You can also alter your product in Startup Poker, because after you peek at the cards on the board, we let you trade the cards in your hand — for a price. Each round, each player has the opportunity to trade in one card at a cost of $1. It’s an option to change your product / business model after you’ve gotten a taste of the market.</p>
<p>So let’s say you start with a pair of twos — one heart and one spade. You pay $3 to peek at three cards. They are the three, four, and five of hearts.</p>
<p>You might want to trade in your two of spades and get a new card from the deck, giving yourself a shot at a flush, a straight, or a straight flush.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png" alt="Early adopters vs business model" width="599" height="585" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-321x314.png 321w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-643x628.png 643w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-768x750.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-1536x1501.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>You are exercising an option to find a better fit with the Market. It’s only the information that you’ve gained by buying a peek at the Market that makes this pivot worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Arrogance</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, arrogance never helps in chess or in poker. Everytime I get cocky in chess, I lose.</p>
<p>Chess rankings are highly visible when playing. So when I relax for my lunchtime game and see that I’m playing someone with a rating 200 points below me, I know I’m going to win. Which is of course exactly when I’m going to lose.</p>
<p>I’m so confident in winning that I start checking my Slack messages while playing. Then I draft an email. Then I make some tea. I get distracted, forget my plan, and generally make a stupid mistake.</p>
<p>“Bad luck!” But there is no luck in chess — this is the folly of arrogance.</p>
<p>If we really wanted to make Startup Poker realistic, every player would be forced to drink 5 shots of bourbon before playing, then when they look at the two cards in their hand they’ll be convinced they have three of a kind. Every entrepreneur thinks they are the second coming of Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Confidence is great. Good entrepreneurs don’t go into a market without some level of confidence. But arrogance allows your confidence to overrule your judgement.</p>
<h2>The Size of the Pot</h2>
<p>There’s another oddity to Startup Poker in that no one knows exactly how big the pot is. It is somewhat determined by the antes that people are paying in and the bets being made, but mostly it’s determined by the Market.</p>
<p>Of course, people can bet up the pot and force players to invest more to keep up. It’s the same as startups competing against each other. When one buys advertising, the others better match it or have a better strategy.</p>
<p>To calculate the value of the Market, we add up the value of the cards to determine the size of the pot (numbered cards are worth their face value, royal cards are worth $10, and aces are worth $15). So this makes buying Market information even more important.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png" alt="The size of the pot" width="699" height="356" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-600x306.png 600w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1200x612.png 1200w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1536x783.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Don’t waste your money and time playing for a small pot.</p>
<h2>Crowded Markets</h2>
<p>Lastly, look at who is competing. It can be very compelling to play in a game with fewer people. Remember, the size of the prize is mostly determined by the Market, not the amount of competition. Unfortunately, in Startup Poker, players can join the game at any time.</p>
<p>When the dealer starts turning over Market cards, players who have not anteed up to that point can opt in. Of course at first they are at a disadvantage. They have missed at least one opportunity to get advanced information, and they’ve lost at least one opportunity to pivot. But they can still get into the Market — a Market that you’ve already invested in.</p>
<p>So if the first two cards the Market shows are a King and Jack, that’s $20 already in the pot. That might attract some latecomers to the game, and the competition might increase quickly.</p>

<p>Players who find themselves alone in a game at the early stages should still take advantage of the opportunity to get more information early, and to pivot if necessary. Even if …</p></div></div>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><strong>I</strong></p><p>I was born and raised in Venezuela. Twenty-plus years of Hugo Chavez’s Chavismo left me with a deep suspicion of power.</p><p>Add to that Trump’s presidency (and the constant parade of politicians consumed by power before that), the myriad of corrupt and extractive corporate and financial tycoons, and the yearly news of disingenuous religious leaders and the suspicion only grows stronger.</p><p>I used to deeply wish for good men to take positions of power - to some degree I still do. For the longest time, I personally wanted to take on roles of power because, naturally, I think of myself as a good person and thought I could do good.</p><p>As time passes, I find myself increasingly uninterested by the idea of having power and, more broadly, wishing for all these power positions to concentrate less power. I am increasingly interested in diffusing power, as I believe it to be a very effective way to do good.</p><p>In a<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/vl/notes/havel.html"> beautiful brief speech</a> (which I strongly recommend you read) given upon accepting the Sonning Prize, Václav Havel meditated on what drives people to seek power. He identifies three main reasons: their ideas on how to better organize society, the longing for self-affirmation, and the perks.</p><p>Havel reflects on how the last two tend to overcrowd the first. He was trying to understand how power slowly becomes a goal in itself and how as power concentrates and tends to the absolute, it ends up corrupting absolutely, as Lord Acton famously said.</p><p>As president of Czechoslovakia, every day afforded Havel the opportunity to change the world for the better, affirming his identity as useful and loved by many.</p><p>Havel was indeed an essential man: he did not sit in waiting rooms or traffic waiting for the red light to change; he did not cook his meals or place his own calls. None of these things were more important than his daily work of running an entire nation.</p><p>These privileges are all fine and well. The challenge is: can we tell when someone crosses the line, from sensical privileges to abusive? There isn’t a straightforward, hard-line. More importantly, can the person in power tell? Well, that’s even harder.</p><p>Havel realized that while power affords self-affirmation, in the process, it robs people of their identity. The person who first wanted to limit the influence of power was changed by power. As he sees it: “Someone who forgets how to drive a car, do the shopping, make himself a coffee, and place a telephone call is not the same person who had known how to do those things all his life.”</p><p>For Havel, the conclusion is that power is a “job for modest people, for people who cannot be deceived”.</p><p>I think this is true, yet it is not nearly enough.</p><p><strong>II</strong></p><p>How do people accumulate power?</p><p>The first way is physical violence, the oldest and most enduring reason, yet decreasingly important, as physical threats are easier to ascertain and economic interdependence lower the payout of violence.</p><p>Persuasion and narrative control are also as old as power and growing in importance as new forms of communication provide a global audience.</p><p>And then there are economies of scale and network effects, or the benefits of being big.</p><p>As with the motivations for getting power, the methods for getting it are also deeply interconnected. And in this case, I believe it is the size and scale that subsumes and overcrowds everything else.</p><p>The best explanation I can find for why institutions get big is Coase’s theory of the firm. Coarse argues that firms grow when internal coordination is easier and cheaper than transacting amongst different entities in the open market.</p><p>In imperfect markets, there is a cost associated with price discovery (benchmarking, negotiating, agreeing on terms). Inside a firm, prices and contracts are easier to set, so functions and products get internalized. As more things come inside the firm, it gets bigger. The bigger it gets, the easier it is to compete with others because costs go down and margins go up. The bigger firms get so does their market share, which reduces the cost of marketing and distribution.</p><p>As firms, parties and religious groups get too big, they fail to serve well smaller niches of their markets. This opens the door for smaller competitors, who can thrive caring for a smaller market, or grow to replace the incumbent if the market they serve overshadows the rest.</p><p>Yet, when companies get too big, they can cut out the basic supplies needed for smaller competitors to serve niche markets. When that happens, antitrust laws are enacted to limit their power. In politics, voting and election rules can be tinkered with to curtail the most powerful.</p><p>Yet laws and regulation are not always as effective as we would like.</p><p>In Judaism, there is this idea of building a fence around the Torah.</p><p>Following the law of the Torah is at times challenging and yet always so important that more laws are created to keep you from breaking the core laws. That’s the fence: laws designed to protect laws. For the layman, such fences are also built, to keep men from abusing positions of power.</p><p>Unfortunately, the more laws are created, the harder they are to follow, which makes it harder to know if you are drawing inside the lines or outside. As complexity increases, laws tend to become harder to follow, and hence more unfair (for how can a law be fair if people can’t understand it).</p><p>As anyone who has kids knows, few and simple rules, which are easy to follow and enforce, do better. The challenge tends to be that, in big and complex legal systems, those who make the laws have the most power (that’s how the system got big and complex in the first place). And as power moves from doers to rule-makers, things end up worse off.</p><p><strong>III</strong></p><p>The right amount of power is like water. Too much concerntration of power and we get ice; a static system that can’t change. Complete dissipation of power and we get a gas; the random bouncing of particles that can’t coordinate. We want power to be, as the Santa Fe Institute crew says, at the edge of chaos; sufficiently well structured that organization and coordination is possible, but suffictly loose that change and learning is constantly happening.</p><p>I think we are coming out of an ice age of power. My fellow countryman Moises Naim calls this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/End-Power-Boardrooms-Battlefields-Churches/dp/1469031205">the end of power</a>. Big nations-states are breaking; since WWII, the number of nation-states tripled. Minority parties continue to grow in number and representation in Europe. We have more primaries than ever in the U.S. Around the globe, there are very few dictators left .</p><p>The role of government is being unbundled: Bitcoin is disrupting monetary policy, Gofundme, Khan Academy and the kickstarters of the world are complementing fiscal policy. SpaceX is privatizing NASA.</p><p>And yet, executive power is ever expanding in the US, state surveillance continues to increase, and the rise of China represents a massive black hole of power.</p><p>Companies stay less time on the S&amp;P 500, CEOs last less on their tenure, popular brands have more dramatic arcs and new technologies are constantly redefining how we do basic things like communicating, eating and moving.</p><p>Still, the gap between CEO compensation and average employees is rapidly rising, real wages are stagnant, and inflation in essentials like education and healthcare is rampant.</p><p>Tiktokers, youtubers and podcasters are creating one-person media empires, while NYT and the likes are turning into technology companies to better serve (and better ad target) their audience.</p><p>As power thaws, some are trying to keep it cool, while others want it to evaporate.</p><p>There are jobs to be done in each of these camps. I for one, want to contribute to a productive diffusion of power. To do that, power certainly cannot be overly concentrated, but neither can there be total chaos.</p><p><strong>IV</strong></p><p>To keep power at the edge of chaos, we need some things to be very stable and dependable, so that other things can be very surprising and unpredictable. Is like life: we need the DNA to be super stable, so evolution can run its experiments, environment and randomness conditioning individuals in all sorts of weird and unexpected ways. There is no individualism in biology without stable foundations. I think this is also true in society, and specifically as it relates to power.</p><p>This means that we need a hierarchy: stability, predictability and trust at the foundation vs. change, surprise and competition at the surface.</p><p>There are many projects out there today trying to build foundations that allow for the diffusion of power, or supporting agents that diffuse power via competitive means.</p><p>Here is a list of some interesting examples:</p><p><span>Financial</span></p><p>Stable foundation: <a href="https://squarecrypto.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin</a>. I believe Hayek when he said prices transmit information. For an economy to work we need prices to do their work. The concentration of monetary policy power in the hand of a selected few nations had led to the abuse of money via debasing. BTC solves for trust and predictability, taking control from the few, and giving it to anyone who wants to participate.</p><p>Surprising surface: Fintech generally is an example here. In particular, <a href="https://aven.com/">Aven</a> invented the first asset-backed credit card. Wealth is a virtuous cycle: it accumulates, protecting against inflation, and bringing access to the debt via collateralizing the assets. People without assets are left out. With Aven, people can use a house or a car to get competitive credit terms, leveling the playing field.</p><p><span>Commerce</span></p><p>Foundation: The best counterbalance to the increasing concentration of power of Amazon is not legislation, and is not going back to the past; is <a href="https://www.gheller.co/2021/01/23/shopify.com">Shopify</a>. Allowing more sellers to go independent with a business model that is transparent and aligned helps diffuse power in ecommerce. Shopify is the main component, but there are many more: there are many other pieces where it is hard for an independent seller to compete with Amazon and where other companies can help by setting the right foundations: for example, <a href="https://returnly.com/">Returnly</a> provides an Amazon level platform for returning products to any seller.</p><p>Surface: Beauty is probably the commerce category that …</p></section></div>

<p><strong>Review</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I’ll admit it—I’m a bit of a sex toy elitist. Both in starting this blog and in my own bedroom, I tend toward stronger, fancier, longer-lasting toys with price tags to match. If I’m going to buy something, I’d rather wait to save up than make compromises—which is why Womanizer’s “The One” and Satisfyer’s “One Night Stand” pulsating air toys caught me off-guard. These very similar toys cost only ten dollars each and are positioned as tasters, giving users a chance to try this relatively new type of stimulation without shelling out the roughly $60+ for a fully-featured model.</p>
<p>The catch? They’re completely disposable, with the Satisfyer lasting 90 minutes and the Womanizer tapping out after a mere half hour. That’s it. There’s no recharging or replacing batteries unless you can hack the device (read on…). Both toys are programmed to brick themselves after the allotted time, even before the sealed AAA batteries are completely dead.</p>
<p>This seems like a bad idea. Let’s give it a go!</p>
<figure><ul><li><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="748" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-1024x748.jpg" alt="" data-id="139" data-full-url="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://insidesextoys.com/2021/01/disposable-waves/packaging-1/" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-1024x748.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-300x219.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-768x561.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-1536x1122.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-2048x1495.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Packaging-1-1200x876.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></figure></li></ul><figcaption>From left to right, the strikingly similar packaging for the Satisfyer One Night Stand and Womanizer The One</figcaption></figure>
<p>When the toys arrived (in suspiciously similar packaging), I enlisted my girlfriend, an established pulse toy fan, to lend me a hand in testing them out. While both feel robust for their price point, we agreed that the Satisfier distinguished itself with a slightly more solid and streamlined feeling in the hand. Only the Womanizer’s removable silicone head makes it possible to clean between sessions or users, if that matters given its 30-minutes service life. Initial impressions made, we started a timer, set both toys on their most powerful settings, and settled in for some playtime.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with air pulse toys, they basically use a small, oscillating silicone cup to stimulate through light, pulsing suction, usually on the clit. They create a sensation slightly different from a traditional vibrator, and they can often be much quieter.</p>
<p>The Womanizer feels rumblier, while the Satisfier is buzzier and more powerful, as if the Satisfier has a higher pulse frequency but the Womanizer has a slightly greater amplitude. Especially when used on my frenulum, the Womanizer’s protruding, soft silicone head makes it easier to create a comfortable suction seal for strong, focused stimulation where the Satisfyer’s more plastic-y head cannot. Both toys fit to my girlfriend’s clit well and created nice gentle stimulation, especially when stronger settings were paired with a bit of lube to enhance the seal. We both would have preferred more intense stimulation from both toys, and the finer control offered by the Satisfyer’s four power settings compared to the Womanizer’s three didn’t make much difference.</p>
<p>While neither toy is quite as strong or comfortable in the hand as their multi-use siblings like the Satisfyer Pro 2, my girlfriend and I agreed that they are generally pleasant to use. They stayed true to their stated time limits with no noticeable change in power, diligently shutting off at exactly 30 and 90 minutes, respectively.</p>
<p>But, when the Satisfyer shut itself off and the dust settled, neither of us had even gotten close to cumming.</p>
<p>Both toys disappoint for one simple reason: it’s hard to get off when you can’t stop watching the clock. Even with the Satisfyer’s more generous 90-minute timer, knowing that your sex toy is counting down the seconds to oblivion like a masturbatory time-bomb is just not sexy, a flaw only exacerbated by the fact that, unlike vibrating dildos, air pulse toys are truly useless without their powered functions. These factors combine to create a sense of designed hostility; these toys are literally designed to let you down.</p>
<p>And that’s not even the worst part.</p>
<p>To put it mildly, selling an item designed to turn itself into e-waste in the course of an evening is wildly unethical, especially without so much as a recycling program or pay-to-unlock system to lessen the environmental impact. Both the Satisfyer and Womanizer utilize a sealed clamshell design and mix of plastics that will make them hard for electronics recyclers to deal with, and, as shown in the Teardown section of this post, the disposable nature of both toys is purely profit- rather than design-driven. Womanizer’s parent Wow Tech and Satisfyer should seriously reconsider this product category.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Teardown</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Now that both toys’ timers have run out, it’s time to dive in, see what makes them tick, and find out if we can hack our way around that pesky self-bricking “feature.”</p>
<figure><ul><li><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SatisfyerExtTriptych-1024x341.jpg" alt="" data-id="119" data-full-url="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SatisfyerExtTriptych-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://insidesextoys.com/2021/01/disposable-waves/satisfyerexttriptych/" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SatisfyerExtTriptych-1024x341.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SatisfyerExtTriptych-300x100.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SatisfyerExtTriptych-768x256.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SatisfyerExtTriptych-1536x512.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SatisfyerExtTriptych-2048x683.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SatisfyerExtTriptych-1200x400.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></figure></li></ul><figcaption>Side, head, and bottom views of the Satisfyer One Night Stand</figcaption></figure>
<p>Beginning with the Satisfyer, pulling the rather beefy two-piece ABS clamshell apart reveals the mysteries within. The injection-molded halves of the case are impressively designed, with neat alignment pins to keep the two sections together and tight tolerances on interior features that hold components in place with a friction fit. Often a surprisingly hard thing to get right, this mold has clearly been made with care.</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the device sits a lone, small PCB with control circuitry powered by two standard AAA batteries, which largely account for the toy’s weight and robust feeling. Towards the top left sits a small DC motor, which rotates a lubricated semi-flexible linkage to oscillate the toy’s silicone diaphragm and create air pulses. Even after 90 minutes of use, the batteries were far from flat, and the diaphragm linkage assembly rotated smoothly, confirming my suspicion that the toy’s time limit is enforced in firmware rather than the result of some hardware limitation.</p>

<p>A closer look at the two-layer PCB doesn’t reveal much. The circuit consists of just one unmarked IC, two ceramic capacitors, a diode, a resistor, and a pushbutton for user input. The IC is almost certainly a very simple microcontroller, but, without any further clues as to its provenance or an immediately responsive reset pin, I decided to save my hacking efforts for the Womanizer.</p>

<p>The Womanizer’s ABS case stubbornly resists prying, but cutting some of its internal pins with a rotary tool allows for easy access. While this toy’s outer ABS case is slightly simpler, it contains two other plastic parts that clip the components together.</p>

<p>The toy operates on the same principle as the Satisfier, using a small DC motor to oscillate a silicone diaphragm, this time with a slightly tighter, better-made linkage. However, the Womanizer uses just one AAA battery and is controlled by a significantly more complicated circuit.</p>
<figure><ul><li><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-1024x576.jpg" alt="" data-id="126" data-full-url="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-scaled.jpg" data-link="https://insidesextoys.com/2021/01/disposable-waves/womanizerelecsep/" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-300x169.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-768x432.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerElecSep-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></figure></li></ul><figcaption>The Womanizer The One’s purple ABS battery clip alongside its PCB and motor/diaphragm subassembly.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The two-layer PCB has a discrete transistor that switches current to the motor, a four-position DIP switch for user input, a bunch of passives, and four IC’s. Voltage regulators boost the single battery’s voltage to a suitable level for driving the motor while another small microcontroller, this time an A262AFB, provides the brains of the operation. I couldn’t find any information on this particular chip, but the board’s silkscreen provides some clues. Most notably, the via marked “CLEAR” creates the tantalizing suggestion of a way to reset the chip, hopefully allowing for another 30 minutes of play time.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after significant experimenting and poking around, it does not seem that either of vias near the “CLEAR” label is a true reset line, although all is not lost. Connecting both via’s simultaneously to the base of transistor T1 often (though not always) seems to glitch and reset the device. Just like that, the Womanizer is back in action for another 30 minutes.</p>
<figure><ul><li><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="616" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych-1024x616.jpg" alt="" data-id="128" data-full-url="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych.jpg" data-link="https://insidesextoys.com/2021/01/disposable-waves/womanizerhackdiptych/" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych-1024x616.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych-300x181.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych-768x462.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych-1536x925.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych-2048x1233.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/WomanizerHackDiptych-1200x722.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"></figure></li></ul><figcaption>Interior of the Womanizer The One with my hacked-in glitch switch ;P</figcaption></figure>
<p>A small switch between these two points allows for easy glitching by rapidly disconnecting and reconnecting them, and it even conveniently fits into the little access hole I cut to open the Womanizer in the first place. Now I can glitch the microcontroller for effectively unlimited 30-minute cycles.</p>
<p>Sketchy? Yes! Beautiful? Also yes!</p>
<p>All things considered, both the Womanizer’s The One and the Satisfyer One Night Stand are examples of good technical design applied to a terrible product strategy. They feel good in the hand, are mechanically solid enough to survive a few drops and run far longer than their intended service life, and create air pulse stimulation that, while far from earth-shattering, is impressive for their $10 price point. Without the lines of code make them useless after little more than one play session, I’d be buying them as gifts and recommending them to everyone I know. </p>
<p>Sometimes, hackable sex toys are fun, encouraging me to explore and think up quirky new features to make them truly feel like <em>mine</em>. But the fact remains that very few people have the tools, skills, or time to cut and solder a bricked Womanizer into a real, semi-usable sex toy. Instead, both The One and The One Night Stand leave me with a bad taste in my mouth, teasing the nice, affordable products they <em>could have been</em> before being undermined by environmentally ruinous programmed disposability.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before we get into it this week, <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/pirate-waves">a quick note on Pirate Waves</a>, a private, voice-based group chat for the ELITE, for the BRILLIANT, for the absolutely based and pirate-pilled. In other words, welcome to the official Pirate Wires live chat for paying subscribers, contributors, and various other people I find interesting, funny, or cute. Henceforth, we’ll be hosting a private Clubhouse chat every first and third Tuesday of the month. If you’d like to join, but haven’t yet become a paying member of the Pirate Nation, you’re in luck: it is —&nbsp;<em>for now</em> — still technically legal to subscribe my budding media empire. </p><p>Another quick note, I’ve decided to experiment with a brief library of links at the bottom of each week’s wire. I’ll be including noteworthy tweets, longer form pieces, and news stories I find interesting or important. In the future, feel free to scroll straight down for the links, or read the wire and ignore the links, or unsubscribe and send me hate mail. I don’t care what you call me, baby.<em> Just call me. </em></p><p>As ever, feel free to comment on this week’s wire below, or let me know what you think about the link library, Pirate Waves, or whatever else is going on inside that beautiful mind of yours. </p><p>Okay, back to regularly scheduled programming. </p><p><strong>The shape of things.</strong> Last week, I took another look at the anti-tech ‘extraction’ meme that’s been gaining traction among local government apologists who, we have improbably discovered, somehow exist in this country. But, in the context of Clubhouse, the aforementioned voice-based social media app, I also briefly touched on a dynamic I’d like to expand on today: new communication platforms, operating at scale, shape an entirely new kind of politician. </p><p><a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/extraction-intensifies">Via ‘Extraction Intensifies’:</a></p><blockquote><p>This particular instantiation of voice chat has unlocked something powerful, and a new dimension of social media is emerging. Five years from now, it’s possible Clubhouse, or a similar application, will be something political leaders actually have to engage with in order to succeed. Were such a shift to happen, voice chat would have as dramatic an impact on the shape of politics as Twitter, without which, for example, neither the Republican presidency of Donald Trump nor the domination of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the Democratic Party would be possible. In a Clubhouse world, we would see an entirely new kind of politician emerge. </p><p>Rogan for president? I’m not even joking.</p></blockquote><p>Geoff Lewis recently raised an interesting point on the topic:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>That a technology as newly-dominant as social media must necessarily present new, and potentially-calamitous challenges for human civilization is something I’ve written about at length. Last year, <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/jump-23d06adb4cb7">in </a><em><a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/jump-23d06adb4cb7">Jump</a>, </em>I took a look at the potential for social media-induced information disaster, an entirely new class of catastrophe. We haven’t yet seen ‘The Big One,’ but there are warning signs everywhere, including one this week <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/25/investing/gamestop-stock-reddit-wsb/index.html">in the GameStop stock rally</a>. In <em>Tether</em>, <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/tether-part-i">I explored our increasingly-warped sense of shared reality</a>, the inherent malleability of information in the digital age, and the dramatic erosion of large-scale group identity endemic of a digital world. But what about the narrow question of politics, and politicians? </p><p>Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok: each of these apps has been designed to keep people engaged for as long as possible. Capturing attention was also the goal of print, radio, and television, but the Twentieth Century was an age before machine learning, which greatly amplified our ability to give people what they really want —&nbsp;or, at least, what they really want <em>right now</em>. The progression was natural, but inevitable. Social media companies replaced a small, elitist cabal of mass media truth arbiters (who have by the way never forgiven them) with the seething, chaotic human Id, individual by individual, at the scale of hundreds of millions or even billions. In aggregate, this tends to present as a ravenous, drug-addicted digital mob. </p><p>Basic human impulses have always shaped culture, but now artificially-intelligent algorithms directly reward positive social stimulus in the form of “likes” and “retweets” <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/">with frequent, daily dopamine hits to the brain</a>. What people “like” and “retweet” in the greatest numbers tend to cluster into our most immediate, and animalistic desires: status, sex, and war, or conflict, itself the realm of fear and anger. We also get a lot of humor, a kind of pressure release (thank God). The dopamine reward naturally drives content creators, from journalists and performance artists to politicians, in subtle ways they themselves may not even be able to perceive. Without our daily (hourly?) dose of attention, many of us, and certainly most compulsive creators, start to feel the pangs of dopamine thirst. We reach for our phone. We post. </p><p>This is classically-presenting addiction shit. Do you really want that cigarette, or are you literally out of control right now? </p><p>In the narrow context of politicians, it’s important to remember that social media does not incentivize people to say what they think, it incentivizes people to say what they think is <em>working</em>. To some extent, this has probably always been true, and not only in politics. But the dopamine delivery device for social validation has not always lived in our pocket. Proximity to the drug has catalyzed frequent use, frequent use has led to dependence, and now this addiction —&nbsp;to attention, essentially — is shaping the political world. Have you ever scrolled to the beginning of an Instagram celebrity’s photos and noticed a jarring evolution from grainy pictures of food, sunsets, and laughing friends to a near-exclusive library of selfies and well-oiled abs by the pool? Well, the final boss Twitter version of the Instafamous professionally-pretty person appears to be a highly-polarizing populist demagogue, and politicians like this are now winning elections that once seemed impossible. </p><p>A lot of ink is spilled on the dangerous rhetoric of politicians like Trump and Bernie Sanders. But social media, a reward system and delivery device for our most impulsive, immediate desires, mainlined these people into culture. These politicians aren’t our greatest danger, and neither is their rhetoric. The system of rewards and delivery driving these politicians into existence is the problem we need to address, and given the realities of virality I think this problem, if left <em>unaddressed</em>, could be existential. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technically true.</strong> Much has been said of the media’s political bias, but I’m beginning to wonder if some journalists might simply be suffering from extreme dopamine thirst. As is now evidenced beyond all doubt, a significantly thirsty writer will tweet just about anything for a hit of attention. This is sort of the implied meaning of “hot take,” a brief argument that may be correct, or interesting, but that is clearly written in a way intended to polarize. The hot take, however, is the stuff of opinion. The version of this we sometimes see in reporting is framed as “truth,” which is much more serious. As with almost everything on the internet, misleading headlines are not a new phenomenon. What’s new, and notable, is the scale of our exposure to the phenomenon. Today, on Twitter, many of us&nbsp;now spend a significant portion of our lives inside a virtual world of headlines. </p><p>This week, a piece of what was meant to be sober tech reporting was framed in a way that absolutely blew my mind: “Instacart is firing every employee who voted to unionize,” <a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1352333971514937344?s=20">tweeted </a><em><a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1352333971514937344?s=20">the Verge</a></em><a href="https://twitter.com/verge/status/1352333971514937344?s=20">.</a> The obvious read, here, is Instacart fired employees for unionizing, which was the sentiment shared by hundreds of comments on the story, many of which were themselves widely shared. This is how the internet works, which every reporter knows. Indeed, reporters often lament the fact: no one reads the actual story. The tweet, for most people exposed, <em>is</em> the story. </p><p>This all begs the question: if we understand the tweet and headline framing a story are of such dramatic consequence to public discourse, how can anyone justify a dishonest tweet or headline? </p><p>As it isn’t legal to fire employees for organizing a union, a move like this from Instacart would be extremely dangerous. In fact, the story seemed so insane I found myself compelled to do something truly rare: I briefly paid attention to <em>the Verge</em>, and clicked. After the headline, the subhead, and the first three paragraphs, what I finally learned was this: </p><p>Instacart did<em> </em>lay off ten grocery workers who voted to unionize. But these workers comprised a fraction of a percent of <em>two thousand</em> lay offs. The total number of grocery workers? <em>Ten thousand</em>. I also learned this story <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9deg/instacart-says-it-will-lay-off-all-of-its-unionized-workers">was basically a re-hash of a </a><em><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9deg/instacart-says-it-will-lay-off-all-of-its-unionized-workers">Motherboard</a></em><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9deg/instacart-says-it-will-lay-off-all-of-its-unionized-workers"> piece</a>, which was just as dishonestly framed. But so it goes. The Instacart lay-offs are newsworthy, but the purpose of framing the piece as a hit on unions was not to honestly inform. It was to enrage. </p><p>Dan Primack, business editor over at <em>Axios</em>, was quick to critique the move. </p><p>Zoe Schiffer, the writer responsible for the <em>Verge</em> piece, was quick to defend her work. </p><p>One commenter mentioned the offending headline (which was in the first place much more than a headline, let’s not forget) was “objectively true.” Lee Edwards countered:</p><p>This may all seem like a niche drama, but the frame was dishonest, anyone willing to look at this story with open eyes can see the frame was dishonest, and all of this is happening in a broader context of newly-ferocious efforts to suppress “inaccurate” or “misleading” speech. This brings us to Twitter. </p><p>One of the many problems inherent of a social media platform where top-down censorship of the “untrue” is made officially the law of the land is it effectively rubber stamps a giant “ACCURATE” tag over every piece of information that is <em>not</em> censored. In a world where the “untrue” is ostensibly removed from view, people naturally assume they can believe what they read. In this way, Twitter’s model of censorship is beginning to exacerbate the impact of …</p></div></div>

<!-- TODO: middle1 -->

  

    
    <div>
        <p>LONDON. <strong>Mr Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca, why hasn't AstraZeneca been more specific on detailing the supply problem detected on its European plants? What exactly is the problem? &nbsp;</strong></p>

<div><p>“I think we have been relatively specific with the information. Of course, we are all very disappointed. We would like to produce more. I think we will deliver up to Europe in the month of February a reasonable quantity actually, very similar to what others have delivered on a monthly basis. But of course, it's less than expected and also because our vaccine is easy to use people expected more so we could scale up.&nbsp;Our team is working 24/7 to fix the very much issues of production of the vaccine itself. You have two steps in the production of a vaccine: one is you produce the vaccine itself. We call it a drug substance, the vaccine. Then, when we are finished with it, we move this into different plants where we put the vaccine into vials and we call that the drug product, the final product.&nbsp;For Europe the drugs substance is essentially produced in two plants, one in the Netherlands, one in Belgium. The drug product is actually produced in Italy and Germany. So from a drug product viewpoint, we have full capacity. We have zero problem. The current problems have to do with manufacturing the drugs substance”. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
“So maybe I need to give you a little bit of explanation as to how we manufacture those vaccines. Essentially, we have cell cultures, big batches, 1000-litre or 2000-litre batches. We have cell cultures inside those batches and we inject them with the virus, the vaccine, if you will. Then those cells produce the vaccine, it’s a biotechnology protection. Now, some of those batches have very high yield and others have low yield. Particularly in Europe, we had one site with large capacity that experienced yield issues. So it's essentially a question of when you scale up to the level we are scaling up to - &nbsp;something like this that's never been done. We are scaling up to hundreds of millions, billions of doses of vaccines at a very high speed".</p></div>

<div><p>“A year ago, we didn't have a vaccine. When you do that, you have glitches, you have scale-up problems. Therefore, the yield varies from one to three, by the factor of three. The best site we have produces three times more vaccine out of a batch than the lowest producing site. We do this with a series of partners: in the US, those partners are actually approved by BARDA, the US administration, the group that manages those things and manages the capacity”.</p></div><p>
"In the US, we also have issues of yield and essentially our engineers have worked with our partners to identify what the issues are. We believe we have sorted out the issues now. The issues are different, for instance, in Belgium: we believe it was more a question of downstream filtering because when you finish making the vaccine, you have to filter it. When you filter it, you put it into vials.&nbsp;Our partner in Australia for instance also had yield issues. And they have been in the vaccine business for 20 years. But it's complicated, especially in the early phase where you have to really kind of sort out all sorts of issues. We believe we've sorted out those issues, but we are basically two months behind where we wanted to be. We've had also teething issues like this in the UK supply chain.&nbsp;But the UK contract was signed three months before the European vaccine deal. So with the UK we have&nbsp; had an extra three months to fix all the glitches we experienced. As for Europe, we are three months behind in fixing those glitches. Would I like to do better? Of course. But, you know, if we deliver in February what we are planning to deliver, it's not a small volume. We are planning to deliver millions of doses to Europe, it is not small”.</p>

<div><p><strong>You say that EU is going to receive a reasonable quantity of doses by February. Could you please quantify this?</strong><br>
"First of all, as soon as we get an approval by EMA, in the next few days, we will be shipping at least three million doses immediately to Europe, then we'll have another shipment about a week later and then the third or fourth week of February. And the target is to deliver 17 million doses by February. So, I am just estimating roughly, that would mean like about 3 million doses for Germany, probably 2,5 million for Italy and something like 2 million for Spain. I don't know exactly what the precise allocation is, but it's based on the population of each country. If you're in Germany, you can vaccinate three million people in one month. It's actually not so bad especially for the people who are the most exposed and most at risk. That's not a small proportion. And if you apply the three month regimen, then in March, you can do the same again or more potentially because we are working hard to increase our goals. It's not as good as we would like to, but it's really it's not so bad”.</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>So Europe signed the contract too late, instead of the UK?</strong><br>
“I will not pass judgment on this. But I can only tell you the facts and the facts are that we basically signed an agreement with the UK three months before we did have it with Europe. Now, part of this can be easily explained. When we entered the agreement with Oxford, they had already been working with the UK government on this. So they had a head start. We were able to quite quickly take the UK supply chain and improve it. We had to modify the formula in the process, because Oxford gave us a process that needed to be modified to enable manufacturing at scale.&nbsp;Just think about, we've done all of this in months. Usually, it takes years. We got a manufacturing process that Oxford gave us, which was producing a good vaccine, but not at an industrial scale. It was just able to produce quantities for clinical trials. So then we had to modify the process to turn it into a process that could manufacture billions of doses. At a cost that is reasonable and at a speed that is reasonable".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"We had to change all of these. Then we had to do what we call technology transfer. So we go to each partner and we train them on the process. We train them on how to manufacture. And then, you know, some people are new to this process. It's like they learn the process. They don't know how to make the vaccine and they're not as efficient as others".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"So you may have lower productivity. That's why we have a productivity going from one to three. And so, unfortunately, it's really bad luck. Actually, there's nothing mysterious about it. But look, the sites that have the lowest productivity in the network are the sites that are supplying Europe. And quite honestly, I mean, we're not doing it on purpose. I'm European, I have Europe at heart. Our chairman is Swedish, is European. Our CFO is European. Many people in the management are European. So we want to treat Europe as best we can. You know, we do this at no profit, remember? We didn't go into this to try and make money or whatever. We would like to treat Europe as good as possible. I actually do believe we treated Europe fairly". &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
"Now, let me give you another number. Our total capacity globally now is about 100 million doses a month.&nbsp;From February onwards we are able to make 100 million doses a month, that's not small. Most vaccines have 100 million doses a year, that already takes us on a 1,2 billion pace per year. We are going to keep growing. Of course, we are ramping up production and Europe is getting 17 percent of this global production in February for a population that is 5 percent of the world population.&nbsp; Now, from the beginning we took very seriously the approach that Europe took, which we thought was fair and we all took. In fact, the US didn't say that Europe said that. Europe said the vaccine is common good and everybody needs to get access at the same time globally. That's what we are doing. Europe is getting 17 percent of our global supply for a month for 5 percent of the world population. The problem is: 100 million doses is a lot, but we have 7,5 billion people in the world".</p><p>
&nbsp;
"We are in the ramp-up phase and basically it will improve, but it takes time. Having said all of this, I'm not looking for excuses, honestly.&nbsp; We take accountability. We want to do better and we're working day and night. Our people in manufacturing, we have hundreds of people, thousands of people now. Many of them didn't take any Christmas vacation. I'm not asking you feel sorry for us but you know, we're doing our very best. But it's a very complicated process and a big scale”. &nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
<strong>After the explanation you just gave at the same time it is striking the aggressive way which the EU has responded, even threatning to impose a new control on exports of activity out of Europe. Some are suggesting that you're selling your product to some other countries.&nbsp; </strong><br>
“The suggestion we sell to other countries to make more money is not right because we make no profit everywhere.That's the approach we took and we agreed on that. That’s the agreement we have with Oxford University.&nbsp;It's actually even written in a contract we have with Oxford University: that we will be at no profit. We have slightly different prices from one geographic to the other because the cost of goods may be different. We have a supply chain in Brazil, we have another one in Latin America, another one in South Asia. We have one in Japan. Of course, you know, local costs are different. So you've got slight variations, but more or less, it's about three to four dollars, more or less everywhere.&nbsp;It makes no difference. Zero difference. I understand we all want to be vaccinated.

<p>Clean code is like clean garbage – it’s only truly clean if it doesn’t exist. In other words, the only clean code is <a aria-label="no code (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no code</a>. Let’s start with an acknowledgment that a perfectly clean (empty) codebase is useless. With that in mind, our pursuit of clean code will necessarily consist of tradeoffs. We’ll trade usefulness for cleanliness, complexity for speed, ownership for ease of development, and abstractions for reusability.</p>
<p>DRY (don’t repeat yourself) code is often held aloft as an ideal in the quest for clean code. Before we jump in too deep, let me shamelessly plug my new computer science learning platform <a href="https://qvault.io/">Qvault</a>, check it out if you like CS and like to write code. With that over with, let’s explore why I think DRY can be a good <a href="https://qvault.io/2020/11/30/examples-of-heuristics-in-computer-science/">heuristic</a>, but far from an absolute.</p>
<h2>What is DRY Code?</h2>
<p>According to <a aria-label="Wikipedia (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Don’t repeat yourself</strong>&nbsp;is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns,&nbsp;replacing it with abstractions or using&nbsp;data normalization&nbsp;to avoid redundancy. Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this definition is fairly exhaustive, what I’ve found people <em>usually</em> mean when they say “DRY code” is that when you find yourself repeating pieces of logic you should instead create a reusable function, interface, class, etc, so that you only have to maintain one copy of it. For example, take the following API calls:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  return await fetch(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<p>You may have noticed, but the beginning of those two API calls are nearly identical – they handle some basic logic that checks to see if the user is properly authenticated and sends that authentication in the request. This might not be a big deal with just two API calls, but what if we have 30? Or maybe 1000? Instead, we can DRY up this code by writing a simple <code>fetchWithAuth</code> function that will centralize all the client’s authentication logic in a single place:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">async function fetchWithAuth(url, params){
  if (!isLoggedIn()){
    // redirect to login screen
    return;
  }
  let token = localStorage.getItem(jwtKey);
  let decodedToken = decodeJWT(token);
  const hoursDelta = 24;
  if (decodedToken.exp &lt; (Date.now() + hoursDelta*60*60) / 1000){
    refreshToken();
  }
  if (!params.headers){
    params.headers = {};
  }
  params.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  return await fetch(url, params);
}

export async function updateUserHandle(handle) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/handle`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      handle
    })
  });
}

export async function updateUserInterests(interestUUIDs) {
  return await fetchWithAuth(`${domain}/v1/users/interests`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    mode: 'cors',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interestUUIDs
    })
  });
}</code></pre>
<h2>Why wouldn’t you DRY out your code?</h2>
<p>Seems like a good idea to reduce code duplication right? Well, yes, in general it is. That said, lets look at some of the drawbacks that come along with too much centralization.</p>
<h3>1. Too many abstractions</h3>
<p>Sometimes code is the same at a given point in time, but later on, it becomes distinct in some way. It’s really hard to guarantee that duplicate code will remain perfect copies of each other forever. A hypothetical example of this would be if the Facebook and Instagram APIs had the exact same way to create a social post. Just because they’re <em>coincidentally</em> the same, probably doesn’t mean that the logic should only be written once.</p>
<p>The solution is likely to remain disciplined about splitting out code that, while it may be similar, is only <em>coincidentally</em> similar. Try to only merge code that’s <em>fundamentally</em> the same. A great example would be a math function like <code>log2</code>. That function should work for every case that you need to calculate a logarithm – each call is fundamentally the same.</p>
<h3>2. External dependency creation</h3>
<p>If two different projects share the same logic, it can often make sense to centralize it in a library package. While this is often a great idea, it can add overhead and can end up being more trouble than it’s worth. For example, even if the abstraction makes sense, you’re definitely adding at least the following complexity to the project:</p>
<ul><li>Management of the dependencies versions and running updates regularly</li><li>Requires multi-project updates in order to get a new change to a specific dependent</li><li>Often involves more remote infrastructure like NPM or PyPy</li><li>Gets harder to make “breaking” changes to the libraries core functions – requires a higher standard of code quality and architecture</li></ul>
<h3>3. Localization complexity</h3>
<p>When debugging or reading code, it would be easiest if the flow of logic started at the top of a file and flowed in a linear path. For example:</p>
<pre><code>START PROGRAM
INSTRUCTION 0
INSTRUCTION 1
INSTRUCTION 2
INSTRUCTION 3
END PROGRAM</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, in useful programs, we need functions, classes, methods, type definitions, etc. that force us to read and write code in a non-linear way. The goal should be to keep everything as linear as possible and sacrifice linearity and simplicity for reusability and separation of concerns as necessary. Every time we extract a chunk of code from a larger function into a smaller more encapsulated one, the code becomes just a little bit harder to follow.</p>
<p>With a highly compartmentalized project, when we see a function called <code>getUser</code>, if we want to <em>really</em> know what’s going on we have to peek into that function and remember the current context because we’re now looking at a different file. Obviously, the cognitive burden becomes greater and greater the more definitions you need to jump through.</p>
<h2>Takeaways – Code smells and hueristics</h2>
<p>Since no code is perfect, we can need to make use of some heuristics (rules of thumb), to try to work towards a cleaner codebase.</p>
<h3>1. WET code, or the rule of three</h3>
<p>WET is a better rule of thumb in my opinion than DRY.</p>
<p>WET stands for “write everything twice”, and forces you to think a bit harder about whether or not a piece of logic deserves an abstraction. The rule of three is an alternative that says you should even wait until you’ve written something three times before breaking it out.</p>
<h3>2. Is it testable?</h3>
<p>Most functions should be predictable and testable. They should behave like math functions or <a aria-label="pure functions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://qvault.io/2020/09/07/how-to-make-pure-functions-in-go/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Pure%20Function,of%20data%20outside%20the%20function)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pure functions</a> – given a set of inputs you’ll always receive the same outputs, and the state of the program isn’t mutated. If the code you’re thinking about condensing into a function can be a pure function, then it’s likely a better idea than if it were an impure function.</p>
<p>Pure functions are really easy to write good unit tests for – if your abstraction is easily testable it’s more likely to be a good abstraction.</p>
<h3>3. Are there special cases or arguments only used by a fraction of callers?</h3>
<p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a great function! Its very simple, and obviously can be used to calculate the area of any shape. Here’s a bad example:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getArea(height, width, isTriangle){
  if (isTriangle){
    return (height * width) / 2
  }
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Special cases are bad news – I’m trying to be too abstract. Instead I should just create two separate functions:</p>
<pre><code lang="javascript">function getTriangleArea(height, width){
  return (height * width) / 2
}

function getRectangleArea(height, width){
  return height * width
}</code></pre>
<p>Have any more ideas for good rules of thumb? Let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/wagslane" target="_blank" aria-label="Twitter (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>! I’d love to update and improve this article.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Turing machine programs are sometimes represented as directed graphs. The vertices of the graph are the program’s states and the edges are transitions between states. The program’s print and shift instructions are relegated to being labels for the edges. Here’s an example:</p>

<p><img src="https://nickdrozd.github.io/assets/2021-01-26-spaghetti-code-conjecture/green-graph.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>Suppose you have a Turing machine diagram, but you don’t have access to the print and shift instructions. All you have is the graph of the states and their transitions. I don’t know why you don’t have the prints and shifts, but you don’t. Maybe you’re looking at the diagram on an overhead projection and you forgot your glasses. Maybe the diagram was drawn on a whiteboard and somebody walked past and bumped into it and wiped away the instructions. Maybe you had the program on a deck of punch cards but you dropped them and the cards got out of order and now all you can recover are the state transitions. Way to go, you klutz. Try a rubber band next time.</p>

<p>What can you tell about a program given only its state transitions? Certainly it isn’t possible to figure out exactly what the progam does. There’s no way to tell how the machine will interact with the tape. But the program’s logical structure can be discerned. Look at the example above. States 1 and 2 do some kind of initialization for state 3. States 3, 4 and 5 form a loop. States 5, 6 and 7 form another loop. The 3-4-5 can, based on a decision made at state 5, extend to include 5-6-7 loop.</p>

<p>Why was 6 afraid of 7? Becase 7 ate 9. Neden 4 5 korkuyor? Çünkü 5 6 yedi. The one-two-three cat made it across the river, but the un-deux-trois cat sank.</p>

<p>Busy Beaver programs have state transition graphs too. What do you think they would look like in general? What kinds of properties would you expect a Busy Beaver graph to have?</p>

<p>As far as I know, this question was first posed by Joshua Zelinsky <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4916#comment-1850560">in a blog comment</a>. It seems like an obvious question when you hear it, but I haven’t seen any evidence that anyone had ever thought much about Busy Beaver graphs before that. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.03184.pdf">James Harland</a> pointed out that Busy Beaver graphs can’t be <em>disconnected</em> (that is, that there can’t be two nodes between which there is no undirected path), but didn’t go any further. <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147554934.pdf">Ludewig, Schult, and Wankmüller</a> compiled an appendix of 100 long-running 5-state programs, each accompanied by a hand-drawn state transition diagram. Look at these nice graphs:</p>

<p><img src="https://nickdrozd.github.io/assets/2021-01-26-spaghetti-code-conjecture/uwe-graphs.png" alt="img"></p>

<p>They went to all the trouble of drawing all those diagrams, but their report doesn’t mention the graphs at all. Why not?<sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Zelinsky conjectured that all Busy Beavers graphs are <em>strongly connected</em> (that is, that for any two nodes, there is a directed route from one to the other). Call this the <strong>strongly connected graph conjecture</strong>. <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/bb.pdf">Scott Aaronson</a> made a broader and vaguer proposal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A related intuition, though harder to formalize, is that Busy Beavers shouldn’t be “cleanly factorizable” into main routines and subroutines – but rather, that the way to maximize runtime should be via “spaghetti code,” or a single n-state amorphous mass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the <strong>Spaghetti Code Conjecture</strong>. On top of spaghetti, all covered with cheese, is the longest-running program of some fixed length. Like Aaronson says, it isn’t a formal statement. It’s a stand-in for a set of formal statements. It implies the strongly connected graph conjecture, for instance, and other statements too. Which statements? That’s a research program. Or maybe it’s a research programme.</p>

<p>I’ll say more about the Spaghetti Code Conjecture, but before that I want to look at an application. And before <em>that</em> I want to say something about the nature of “spaghetti code”.</p>

<p>It’s sometimes defined as code that uses <code>goto</code> statements. But that isn’t right. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.6084&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Donald Knuth</a> uses <code>goto</code> in his programs, and he doesn’t write spaghetti code. “Spaghetti” is a logical property, not a syntactical one. It means that the code’s control flow is <em>convoluted</em> or <em>unduly complex</em>. It’s not enough for the control flow to be just <em>complex</em>, it has to be <em>unduly</em> complex. If the code is modeling something that is complex using control flow that is simple, it’s probably wrong. Spaghetti code has a control flow that is more complex than it needs to be.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, a lot of code that is written by professional programmers is spaghetti. Shocking, I know, but true. Spaghetti code is often not created intentionally. It can result from carelessness, or even a lack of taste. Here are two ways of setting a variable to some conditionally chosen value:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>## ternary expression ##################
</span>
<span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>()</span> <span>if</span> <span>test</span><span>()</span> <span>else</span> <span>that</span><span>()</span>

<span>## if / else ###########################
</span>
<span>if</span> <span>test</span><span>():</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>()</span>
<span>else</span><span>:</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>=</span> <span>that</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The ternary expression is obviously the better choice here. It has a simpler control flow. One assign statement, one path. The if-else block has two assign statements, each executed on a separate path. It’s spaghetti-er than the ternary. It’s also much more common. Is that a coincidence? A general lack of taste would explain the correlation. It could explain some other things too.</p>

<p>It really isn’t accurate to describe a Busy Beaver program as “spaghetti”. Spaghetti has a flimsy structure, great for slurping. You wouldn’t want to eat something with the structure of a Busy Beaver program. It would be unpleasant going down and unpleasant coming back up. And make no mistake, it would come back up.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the application of the Spaghetti Code Conjecture. A program can be converted to a state transition graph by ignoring its print and shift instructions and considering only the states. Now go the other direction. Given an <em>n</em>-state <em>k</em>-color state transition graph, how many concrete programs correspond to it? In other words, how many ways are there to decorate the graph with print and shift instructions? There are <em>nk</em> transitions. Ignoring <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2020/10/04/turing-machine-notation-and-normal-form.html">normalization</a>, each transition gets a left or right shift and one of the <em>k</em> colors. That makes <em>2k</em> decorations per transition, and so <em>2nk<sup>2</sup></em> programs per graph. Is that right? I hope so. That means 40 programs per graph in the ❺② case, and 54 programs per graph in the ❸③ case.</p>

<p>This fact can be applied to Busy Beaver searching. The naive search method generates all <em>n</em>-state <em>k</em>-color programs and then searches them. But the total number of programs gets out of hand fast, growing on the order of <em>O((nk)<sup>nk</sup>)</em>. A better way to do it is to generate the possible graphs first and then decorate them with instructions. The Spaghetti Code Conjecture can then be used at graph-generation time to discard graphs that seem unsuitable. (How many program graphs are strongly connected? I have no idea. That’s a sophisticated calculation, and I don’t know what I’m doing.) Discarding a few graphs means discarding a whole swath of programs. It can’t be overemphasized how many programs there are. Discarding them is like bailing water out of a ship. There is no choice but to get rid of a lot of them, and as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>This isn’t just idle speculation. I used the <em>graph decoration</em> technique along with Zelinsky’s strongly connected graph conjecture to find <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2020/10/09/beeping-busy-beaver-results.html">the reigning ❹② Beeping Busy Beaver champion</a>. The conjecture has predictive power! So as far as <em>I’m</em> concerned, its value has already been proved.</p>

<p>Wait, did somebody say “proved”? Like, the conjecture has been formally proved? No, of course not. I doubt it can be proved at all. It might even be provably unprovable. But it could nevertheless be true. Busy Beaver searchers are interested in establishing lower bounds, not upper bounds. If a conjecture leads to better lower bounds, that’s good enough.</p>

<p>How much wood would a woodchuck chuck? Would a beaver eat spaghetti? Raccoons sure do love rummaging through my trash, I can tell you that.</p>

<p>Here’s an argument that the strongly connected graph conjecture is true. It’s not a real proof, just a suggestive argument. Argument by induction on the number states, with fixed <em>k</em> colors. 0- or 1-state programs are trivial and/or degenerate, so start with the base case of 2 states, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. Busy Beaver programs run on the blank tape, so the program starts in transition <code>A0</code>. If it stays in state <code>A</code>, then it will remain on transition <code>A0</code> forever, and is therefore junk. So <code>A0</code> must transition to <code>B</code>. Does <code>B</code> have any connections to <code>A</code>? If it doesn’t, then the program will spend the rest of its execution time in its <em>k</em> <code>B</code> transitions, and won’t be able to use the full <em>2k</em> transitions available. But surely such a program can’t be the ❷ⓚ Busy Beaver. Kinda QED on the base case. Next, the induction step. The <em>n</em>-state Busy Beaver is strongly connected. What about the <em>n+1</em>-state Busy Beaver? Suppose it isn’t strongly connected. For simplicity, suppose also that <em>n+1</em> is the least number of states for a Busy Beaver program whose state graph is not strongly connected. Every Busy Beaver program through <em>n</em> states is strongly connected spaghetti, but then some kind of structure gets introduced at <em>n+1</em>? Why? What kind of structure? Why <em>n+1</em>, and not earlier or later? It seems unlikely. The inductive step is kinda done, and that takes care of the loosey-goosey informal argument.</p>

<p>So we think that Busy Beaver program graphs should be strongly connected. What other properties should they have? I’m now going to enter into the territory of rank speculation and propose a few properties that seem like they should hold. Some caveats:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Busy Beaver programs need to halt, and that means they need to include a halt state (exactly one, in fact). Inclusion of the halt state makes for a lot of exceptions to otherwise general statements. I don’t feel like making that explicit, so just assume that the exception is there. This doesn’t apply to Beeping Busy Beaver programs, because <a href="https://nickdrozd.github.io/2021/01/14/halt-quasihalt-recur.html">they don’t indicate program termination in such a clumsy fashion</a>. In general, <a href="https://oeis.org/A337025">halt-free programs</a> will have a more pleasing graph structure than programs with a halt instruction.</li>
  <li>These conjectures are meant to apply <em>n</em>-state programs where <em>n</em> is “sufficiently large”. This is great for the conjecturer, as it …</li></ol></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>My posts on <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/winning-systems--security-practitioners-2.-preparation/">Winning Systems for Cyber Security Practitioners</a> are my most popular. In them, I attempt to change your perspective on the relative importance of products and <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/forget-solving-the-cyber-security-skills-shortage/">skills</a> in securing what’s precious to you. I make the case for using systems <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/winning-systems--security-practitioners-1.-introduction/">(in the broadest sense of the word)</a> not goals. Systems aren’t new. They pre-date the product-era of today. From infrastructure to code, you can count on them. Products and vendors come and go. Skills are irregular and scarce. It is systems that are eternal and universal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’ve taken my advice, you’ve factored default-deny, responsiveness, robustness, and resilience into your thinking. This post is about minimising your attack surface. In it, I explain what this means and why it may be our best hope for reducing vulnerability in practice. Finally, I’ll tell you what the world might look like if we took this winning system to its ultimate logical conclusion. Before we get there let’s begin at the beginning.</p>

<h4 id="the-problem">The Problem</h4>

<h5 id="1-codebase-size-quality">1: Codebase Size &amp; Quality</h5>

<p>According to the Software Engineering Institute, software developed in the USA has about 6000 defects per million lines of source code (MLOC)<sup id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> for high-level languages like Java and C#. High-quality code has 600 to 1000 defects per MLOC. Code of exceptional quality developed with the highest levels of assurance exhibits defects below 600 per MLOC. Between 1% and 5% of those defects are thought to be security vulnerabilities<sup id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Let’s apply that research to some well-known codebases and see what the numbers look like.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Software</th>
<th>MLOC</th>
<th>Vulns. (high est.)</th>
<th>Vulns. (low est.)</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>FreeBSD</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>2700</td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The low estimates don’t look bad. There’s no chance they apply here. Even the high rate may be too conservative for contemporary Internet-based applications. Most technology companies optimise for the shortest time to market, because they have competition. They optimise for flexibility, because they don’t know what they’re building until they find product/market fit. Security, stability, and ease of maintenance (the conventional measures of software quality) are not high on the list of priorities.</p>

<h5 id="2-tractability-distributedness">2: Tractability &amp; Distributedness</h5>

<p>MLOC is a simplistic measure. Modern Internet applications consist of a mixture of software from a long and complex supply chain. Partly Open Source. Partly licensed. Partly offshore. Partly of unknown origin. Some code recent. Some ancient. Some developed with great care. Some slapdash. Modern web applications draw upon software in the form of services from a dozen places. Your application may be partly distributed even though you think of it as centralised.</p>

<p>Consider this <a href="https://blog.eutopian.io/the-stack/">blog</a>. It has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">web server</a> and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD">Operating System</a>. It uses cosmetic client-side javascript. It has an external comment section. Fonts and cookies come from Google. I should say something about SSL and DNS services. Without these, the site wouldn’t function. All this attack surface for some static text that looks much as it would have in the 1980s. Its puny code is distributed and diverse. It doesn’t even offer an application in the conventional sense. The simplest things have a larger attack surface than you think. Some numbers:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Software</th>
<th>MLOC</th>
<th>Vulns. (high est.)</th>
<th>Vulns. (low est.)</th>
<th>CVEs To Date</th>

</tbody>
</table>

<blockquote>
<p>For OpenSSL nobody believes 194 CVEs represent anything other than a small fraction of the actual vulnerabilities. OpenSSL is mature and supposedly security-critical. It has a highly exposed codebase. It has a single design-purpose. What do you think the vulnerability rate is like for the average piece of software? Our high estimates don’t look high after all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="3-informal-methods">3: Informal Methods</h5>

<p>Some vulnerabilities are design weaknesses or logic errors. Not buffer overruns. Not input validation problems. Not statistical errors. Not side-channel attacks. They are precedence bugs, off-by-one bugs, or errant state machine misbehaviour. Not the kind of flaw that static analysis is good at spotting. Not the kind of flaw you can easily patch away.</p>

<h5 id="4-unintended-consequences">4: Unintended Consequences</h5>

<p>I’ve said nothing about deployment practices, configuration, or administration. Even if you aren’t a developer, there’s no shortage of ways you can expose or create vulnerability as a consequence of individual configuration choices. Software has many layers and many settings. Unintended consequences arise from interactions between these settings and layers. Defaults are frequently a poor choice. Even documentation is sometimes misleading in a way that jeopardises security.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As code breadth, depth, diversity, and distributedness increases, so does scope for errors and vulnerability. These four problems are the reason why software is insecure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="good-news-bad-news-luck-judgement">Good News Bad News, Luck &amp; Judgement</h4>

<p>The news isn’t all bad. Some part of the odds falls in our favour.</p>

<ul>
<li>Not all vulnerabilities are exposed by default.</li>
<li>Not all exposed vulnerabilities are exposed to unprivileged users.</li>
<li>Not all exposed unprivileged user vulnerabilities end in system compromise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Experience tells us we can’t draw comfort from this. There are many winning systems but luck is not one of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>What was hidden from exposure can be inadvertently revealed.</li>
<li>What was inaccessible to unprivileged users can slip within their reach.</li>
<li>What looked like a tiny hole, turns out to be a secret passage into the castle.</li>
</ul>

<p>What about judgement? The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) improves software quality and with it security. However, it provides only a marginal reduction in total vulnerability once we consider the sum of a deepening stack, spiralling dependencies, and increasing distributedness and diversity of code within real applications. If software quality is order and flaws are disorder, disorder is still increasing at a faster rate than order can be imposed. This isn’t an argument against S-SDLC, DevSecOps, Formal Methods, or any other software quality initiative. It’s an observation that these things are not an adequate braking force. We continue to roll downhill towards greater overall vulnerability.</p>

<p>Consider “as a service” providers. They carry their own vulnerable software, which they may improve. They also carry the vulnerable “genes” of all the other components, products, and 3rd party services they build upon. They have no meaningful control over this inheritance and only partial influence over whether those genes are “expressed” in their particular formulation of an architecture or service. Soon software will be everywhere, inside everything. Much of it vulnerable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The winning system is, therefore, the relentless limitation of attack surface. Whether it be by design, development, or deployment. Preferably all three. Don’t wait for software quality to improve. Count on it remaining lousy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="reducing-attack-surface-in-practice">Reducing Attack Surface In Practice</h5>

<p>This series is for practitioners, but it talks of systems. It does so because practices co-evolve with technology and technology becomes obsolete, invalidating practices with it. You can watch this happen in real-time. Professionals, products, and  companies struggle to stay relevant when customers move from traditional physical infrastructure to cloud to serverless.</p>

<p>Winning systems are eternal. They transcend the tech-de-jour. The IT industry hasn’t grasped this. That’s why job descriptions are still packed with vendor and product names. It’s why product companies fail to talk a language that business understands. It’s why I still think a classical Computer Science and Software Engineering background helps. It separates pristine theory from messy, proprietary, and perishable practice.</p>

<p>So let’s start with the pristine theory first before getting dirty with practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>For software which you must expose, expose only a small part.</li>
<li>For that small part:

<ul>
<li>Expose it only to a constrained group of users.</li>
<li>Expose only a necessary subset of its functionality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For that subset:

<ul>
<li>Eliminate complexity, making it as simple as possible.</li>
<li>Apply the winning systems of least-privilege and default-deny.</li>
<li>If a given function can be achieved in a less risky way, take it.</li>
<li>Where complexity is unavoidable, treat that software with suspicion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Remove unused or vestigial elements, they are a liability.</li>
</ul>

<p>The practical extent to which one can limit attack surface is case-specific. It depends upon the level of control you have over the software in question and the environment within which it runs. However, everyone can do something to limit their attack surface, even if your control is limited to that of a network or systems administrator.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the part where we risk a little obsolescence by talking in more detail about practices.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="shedding-vulnerabilities">Shedding Vulnerabilities</h5>

<ul>
<li>Deactivate non-essential modules/plugins. Apply universally from applications to kernels.</li>
<li>Remove unused functionality from code or Operating Systems.</li>
<li>Deactivate non-essential network services.</li>
<li>Better still, don’t install or activate them in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="restricting-vulnerabilities">Restricting Vulnerabilities</h5>

<ul>
<li>Don’t expose networked applications to traffic which is:

<ul>
<li>Not yet authenticated.</li>
<li>Not yet validated in some way.</li>
<li>From non-paying users/agents (business model permitting).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="shielding-vulnerabilities">Shielding Vulnerabilities</h5>

<ul>
<li>Where services are only used from within your network (or within a host), prevent them being accessed from other points of origin.</li>
<li>If services can be bound to individual IP addresses or interfaces, bind them.</li>
<li>Remove unused network protocol stacks.
<br></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="designing-out-vulnerability">Designing Out Vulnerability</h5>

<p>Now the hard part. If you are designing or building software, you have a golden opportunity to avoid whole classes of vulnerability. Doing so may mean changing how your application or group of applications work together to provide the user with a capability. There will be a trade-off and that trade-off will be specific to your situation. Choose wisely.</p>

           <p>Hi, I'm Jan—co-founder of Sacra.</p><p>One of the biggest challenges that Series B and later founders face is hiring and retaining the best talent, especially with the lavish perks and salaries that Facebook and Google can offer.</p><p>We think it's no longer sufficient to sell the dream that your equity is a lottery ticket that could one day pay off. Offering recurring liquidity that allows employees to regularly realize the value of some portion of their vested equity will, in the future, be the absolutely essential flip side to offering ownership. </p><p>We created this calculator to help you understand how to design a recurring liquidity program and how it can make your liquid compensation competitive with the typical compensation of a Facebook E4.</p><p><a href="https://mailchi.mp/sacra/liquidity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Sign up for our founder webinar</strong></a><strong> on recurring liquidity programs to learn more.</strong></p><h2 id="time-to-upside-in-startup-compensation">Time-to-upside in startup compensation</h2><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/8085dc3d-f7fd-46ca-a125-ddb0a07337ca_CleanShot+2021-01-26+at+13.50.13%402x.png?auto=compress,format"><p>"Time-to-upside" refers to how long it takes for your yearly liquid compensation to hit break-even with public company compensation, in this case Facebook's.</p><p>Startups tend to have a long and uncertain time-to-upside: many people take pay cuts in the hopes that they'll have a good outcome down the road. But a low time-to-upside is a huge advantage. If after 3-4 years you can be earning more in liquid comp than you would at Facebook, and you also have all your remaining carried equity on top of that, it makes going to work at a startup potentially far more lucrative than going to work at FAANG.</p><p>The biggest lever you have for changing your time-to-upside is float: how much you allow employees to sell. If you don't offer float, you'll never be able to match the liquid compensation of a company like Facebook. Employees will only see their upside when their equity becomes liquid. </p><p>On the flip side, no amount of float will keep the comps equal. Float is ultimately about reducing your company's time-to-upside so that the team is aligned and your liquid comp can hit and <em>surpass</em> that of Facebook's as the company grows.</p><p>The biggest trade-off with increasing your float is employees losing out on that growth: the earlier they sell, the more they'll miss out on the future appreciation of their stock.</p><p>In the case of a Series B company worth $100M and growing 150% year-over-year, a float of 20% offers a time-to-upside right around 3 years and leaves an employee with $2.2M in carried equity at the end of year 4.</p><p><strong>We've compiled products and services that help you implement a recurring liquidity program.

<p><strong>^^^ PLEASE USE POST USING ABOVE LINK FOR MY “ONE-LINE IT JUST WORKS” ^^^</strong><br>
(IGNORE EVERYTHING BELLOW THIS AS IT’S THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPMENT WORK)<br>
===================================================================</p>
<p><strong>Everything from this point down is out of date as of: 3-30-2020</strong></p>
<p>This was my initial “netflix on the raspberry pi 4 development” blog post. Leaving it on here due to the comments, initial work, info for those interested, but I highly recommend using the easy method above (linked).</p>
<p>Last libwidevine extract: 3-29-2020 – v.4.10.1610.6 of libwidevine – EVERYTHING CONFIRMED WORKING</p>
<p><em><br>
Chromium has made substantial changes the way libwidevine (and a few major things around DRM) are loaded/used/etc. They have also made changes to the setting and reading of the user-agent propagation. For some time (~2 months or so) — the combination of this badly broke Netflix. It seems they have undone the lib loading in the last couple of versions, and user @Spartacuss discovered the user-agent fix.</em></p><p><em>The instructions here (as of 3-29-2020) work for: Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Pandora, and many others.</em></p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 model with 4GB of RAM is the first cheap hardware that can provide a real “desktop-like” experience when browsing the web/watching Netflix/etc. However, if you have tried to run Netflix on the Pi, you have quickly entered the disgusting mess that exists around DRM, WideVine (Netflix being one example of something that needs it), and Chromium.</p>
<p>After hours and hours of effort, I finally discovered a quick and elegant solution that lets you use the <strong>latest default provided Chromium browser</strong>, without having to recompile anything in order to watch any WideVine/DRM (Netflix, Spotify, etc) content.</p>
<h2>Background and the DRM Problem</h2>
<p>If you are not familiar with this, the short version is that Netflix (and many others, ex: Spotify) use the WideVine “Content Protection System” – aka DRM, and if you want to watch Netflix or something else that uses it, you need to have a WideVine plugin+browse supported integration. Chrome, Firefox, and Safari make it available for x86/amd64 systems, but not for ARM since technically they don’t have ARM builds.</p>
<p>Chromium, the project Chrome is based on, does have an ARM build, but it does not include any DRM support, and technically it does not include widevine support by default (*caveat here, which helps us later)<br>
So long story short, the question becomes “how do you enable DRM/WideVine support in Chromium?”.</p>
<p>It seems there are two main solutions out there: use an old (v51, 55, 56, 60) version of Chromium which has been “patched” with widevine support (kusti8’s version seems to be the most popular one – except since the new Netflix changes, that also does not work), which requires uninstalling the latest Chromium available, installing the old/patched one, and dropping in older widevine plugins; the second option is to use Vivaldi – a proprietary fork of Opera which also has been “sort of patched”, but it still needs a valid libwidevinecdm plugin (see bellow) and it has it’s own issues (and also…it’s Opera…in 2019…who uses Opera?)</p>
<p>After a lot of research and trial and error, I discovered a much more elegant solution – use the extracted ChromeOS (armv7l – yay) binaries and insert them into Chromium + make everything think it’s ChromeOS (user agent)</p>
<h2>Netflix/Hulu/Spotify with the Default Raspberry Pi Chromium Browser</h2>

<p><strong>Enough theory – let’s do this in 2 quick steps!</strong><br>
0.) If you have tried Netflix/etc already, open Chromium and clear your browser history + cookies. Otherwise it will cache the “failed” DRM components.</p>
<p><strong>1.) Download the latest extracted ChromeOS <a href="http://blog.vpetkov.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/libwidevinecdm.so_.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libwidevine</a> binary and extract it:</strong></p><!-- Crayon Syntax Highlighter v_2.7.2_beta -->

<p><strong>2.) Completely QUIT all Chromium windows.</strong><br>
Start Chromium with the new Application Menu under “Internet”: <strong>Chromium (Media Edition)</strong><br>
<del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">Open a new tab, and go to: https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm You should be able to see the movie on the left. </del>(While this still works, it will show “No DRM” unless you set the Chromium user-agent from within the app – which breaks Netflix. BitMoving unfortunately looks for that first. Just go to Netflix/Your media source directly.)<br>
You can now play Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Spotify, Pandora, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and many others!</p>
<p>Please note that If you can see the video on the left, this means the DRM plugin has worked! From this point on, anything that does not work (ex: Netflix sometimes breaks after a browser update) is due to the site specifically filtering User Agents/doing other “tricks”. So for example, if Netflix does not work, Spotify, Pandora, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO, etc will still work. <del datetime="2020-03-30T00:52:10+00:00">The BitMovin website is the “real” test on wether the DRM plugin has worked.</del>(While still technically true, if your Chromium user-agent is not set from within the app itself, which breaks Netflix, BitMovin will show “No DRM” even though the DRM decryption works)</p>

<p>It seems the Pi’s raw CPU frequency is still not powerful enough for decoding 100% of the time. While 97-98% of the time is good enough, you will get the occasional “screen tearing” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing), especially in scenes with fast motion.</p>
<p><del datetime="2020-04-07T04:18:34+00:00">Users Otaku, DM (and thanks to Luca for testing/extra info!) have found a solution which was mentioned on https://lb.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=246179 by user Greysvandir.<br>
I had to add a few more things and I created a compressed and slightly automated 😉 version:<br>
# sudo apt install -f compton<br>
$ mkdir -p ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi<br>
$ cd ~/.config &amp;&amp; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dastorm/Compton-xfce-config/master/compton.conf<br>
$ cp -f /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “@usr/bin/compton –backend glx” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
$ echo “xrandr –output HDMI-1 –mode 1280×720” &gt;&gt; ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart<br>
The result is no tearing with 1080p@60fps video.<br>

<p><strong>(OPTIONAL) Get libwidevinecdm version</strong><br>
If you want to check your *actual* libwidevinecdm version, the easiest and quickest way is using user VMX’s elegant python solution:</p>

January 26, 2021 | https://blog.tara.ai/a-2020-of-sprints/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.tara.ai/a-2020-of-sprints/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Launching is hard. The product is never polished “enough”. There are always a hundred more tasks to be completed, and in the midst of a pandemic, it can seem impossible to get a product to the finish line.<br></p>
<p>Yet, we persevered.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>We set a deadline of April 30th 2020 for our <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/tara-ai-1-0">v1.0</a>, and were all cylinders go, with dozens of completed sprints and pull requests from our team and 50 other teams in our early alpha. Best case scenario: my co-founder Syed and I expected a hundred other teams to sign up within a few weeks. Instead, post launch, thousands of workspaces were activated. In short, we were completely blown away by the response.<br></p>
<br>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dx44N4Jx3MeU-ccCvlLrdVZC79artXQ-ORaLC_l5q287H8w1bUvHZLHRkORWcbfdPEjk6B5aJhSJDmkv_moWoJ2hQufI-mas3TJrhN5gIXowR4rINJ0nd4oBaingIQ-dmErRs72M" alt=""></figure></div>

<p>Quickly, Tara AI went to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23033387">page 1 of Hacker News</a> and the outpouring of love and support began. We realized how large of a problem we had truly set to solve, and in 8 months, 20,000 of you worked with Tara to deliver:&nbsp;<br></p>
<ul><li>100,000 tasks</li><li>25,000 sprints</li><li>15,000 product requirements and</li><li>7,000 Github connections</li></ul>

<p>We heard from so many of you how you switched from the “clunk” of Jira, the “mess” of Asana, and how a tool that was built by engineers (for engineers) became your team’s “superpower” to develop and release faster.&nbsp;<br></p>
<br>
<div><figure><img src="https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-1024x597.png" alt="Developer feedback" width="768" height="448" srcset="https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-1024x597.png 1024w, https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-300x175.png 300w, https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-768x448.png 768w, https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-1536x896.png 1536w, https://blog.tara.ai/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Product-Hunt-Feedback-2048x1195.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure></div>

<p>Consider this a promise to you, our power user:&nbsp;<br></p>
<p><strong>Tara will always have simplicity at its core.</strong> Simplicity is beautiful, and we promise to continue to maintain an easy to use interface. We persevere to add value with powerful functionality, and you will never require a full-time “administrator” to use the tool. This is a decade-old concept that needs to end, 1- click is all it should take to start and run a sprint, or connect your project management software to source control.<br></p>
<p><strong>Tara will provide visibility and speed </strong>as you move quickly to deliver software. You should be able to zoom in/out within different concepts in your product delivery assembly line, and the tool should get out of your way as you deliver software.<br></p>
<p><strong>Tara should add predictability</strong> to your workflow. Predictably helping your team deliver on their tasks, sprints or pull requests, and providing indicators to do so. Continually delivering on your sprints, helps you deliver on your team’s monthly product milestones, which adds up to delivery on annual business goals for your organizations. In short, predictability in effort completed, and estimating effort, becomes integral to delivering on release timelines.</p>

<p><strong>So what’s next?</strong><br></p>
<p>In 2020, we received over 520 feature requests from a highly active community of power users via Intercom, email and our slack group. And, we saw sprints being created in just over 15 different languages. In 2021, we’re delivering:<br></p>
<p><strong>A smarter Tara.</strong>&nbsp;Developers have to manually change statuses and constantly provide updates to the rest of their team, to move tasks across the development pipeline. We’re building automation that works intuitively with your source control and development workflow, so that your tasks flow from branch creation (TODO) to merged pull requests (DONE). Teams will be able to provide their DOD (definition of done) and automatically move tasks in the hand-off from development to QA, from one engineer to the next.</p>
<p><strong>An improved interface. </strong>We’re making it even easier to search and filter through the platform with smart labels, to help prioritize your work. We’re also working on a new navigation that makes it faster to create tasks, product requirements or sprints, at any level, as your team delivers software from specification to release.<br></p>
<p><strong>Larger teams. </strong>Today, Tara is optimized for workspaces and teams of up to 30 developers. We’ve mindfully crafted the experience for small teams, yet we continue to hear from larger teams that are anxiously waiting to make the switch to Tara. Moving forward, we’re building functionality to support access controls and user management, along with reporting and quarterly/monthly milestone setting. Our mobile experience is also a part of this roadmap.<br></p>
<p><strong>More integrations. </strong>We’ve shipped several updates to our Github integration, alongside a new Gitlab integration. Next up, we’re working on more source control connections, to welcome teams from Bitbucket and other platforms. We’re also releasing our full-fledged Slack app, with reporting functionality and task creation, directly from Slack.</p>
<br>

<p>And, there’s more. We have an even larger roster of updates planned for 2021. To deliver on this ambitious roadmap, <a href="https://tara.ai/about/careers/">we’re hiring</a> engineers, designers and scientists looking to change productivity for developers.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>We’re excited to see what you will continue to build with Tara. Here’s to our customers.</p>
<p>Onwards and upwards.</p>
<p>&lt;3,</p>
<p>Iba ❤️<br></p>

   Posted 26. January 2021.
   <strong>2 min read.</strong></p></div><div><div><p>Playing with domain names is fun, especially when it comes to the likes of Google and the many variations with multiple <em>o</em>'s in them. Find out what happens when you type the wrong number of <em>o</em>'s in your URL bar.</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you know that <a href="http://gogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://gogle.com</a> and <a href="http://gooogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://gooogle.com</a> both redirect to google.com?</li>
<li>🔍 Bing.com is squatting goo*gle.com with 21 o's - i.e. this url leads to Bing: <a href="http://gooooooooooooooooooooogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://gooooooooooooooooooooogle.com</a> 🔍</li>
<li>🦁 Brave.com seems to be <em>randomly</em> selected as target goo*gle.com with 31 o's - i.e., this url leads to Brave from time to time: <a href="http://gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogle.com</a> (it also often redirects to changing parking pages). Really wondering what / who is behind this.</li>
<li>😱 The same screwed up fake news / bitcoin scam website is squatting no less than 7 of the goo*gle.com domains with 20 o's or less</li>
<li>📣 There remain 5 domains with less than 42 o's available for sale, at an average cost of €188.6 per o - the cheapest one is <a href="http://gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogle.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooogle.com</a> (31 o's), priced at €551.35 on Namecheap (strangely enough this is the one squatted by Brave)</li>
<li>🥳 Somehow I was lucky enough to find out that the ones with 30 and 34 o's were actually available for €7.31 each - a discount of 1000x per o's compared to the average of other available domains</li>
<li>🔮 I haven't investigated what comes after 42 o's...nor decided what I will do with my new squatting places - probably some random coding art!</li>
</ul>
<p>See below the full result of analysis (data is from Namecheap, except from 5 o's which cost comes from GoDaddy).</p>

			<p>The station’s atmosphere is maintained at pressure comfortable for the crew members, and a tiny bit of that air leaks over time, requiring routine repressurization from nitrogen tanks delivered on cargo resupply missions. In September 2019, NASA and its international partners first saw indications of a slight increase above the standard cabin air leak rate. The leak has presented no immediate danger to the crew or the space station. The crew isolated sections of the station to monitor pressure changes to find and repair this air leak starting in August 2020.</p>
<p>The Distran Ultra Pro acoustic camera displays the leak location and estimates equivalent pinhole leakage rates and limit of detection in real-time. This Swiss-made technology detects ultrasounds emitted by air flow as it rushes through small holes, seams, and cracks. The acoustic imaging is overlaid on an optical image in real time, offering clear pinpointing of leaks. Ultra Pro records vacuum and jetting ultrasounds emitted by any type of leak (steam, CO2, CH4, H2, etc.) offering a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>Tests have shown that Ultra Pro’s leak detection abilities are not impaired when the frequencies of noise-source energy are sufficiently far from the test frequency. Not all leaks produce ultrasound at the same frequency, and user selection of frequencies from 10-55 kHz is facilitated by an integrated, real-time spectrogram display. The Ultra Pro can potentially locate partially obstructed, hard-to-reach, or hidden leaks, potentially providing a great advantage as the ISS modules are filled with equipment racks, piping, cables, and experiment payloads.</p>
<p>Distran technology has been in use since 2013, mostly in the oil &amp; gas industry, chemical manufacturing, and power plants. This versatile device, which can also pinpoint partial discharges, saves time and gas or electric consumable costs as well as it provides a safe manner to check for leaks from a distance.</p>

January 26, 2021 | https://frostming.com/2021/01-22/introducing-pdm/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://frostming.com/2021/01-22/introducing-pdm/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When you develop a Python project, you need to install the project's dependencies. For a long time, tutorials and articles have told you to use a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies. This way you don't contaminate the working set of other projects, or the global interpreter, to avoid possible version conflicts. We usually have to do these things:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ python3 -m venv venv  
$ <span>.</span> venv/bin/activate   
<span>(</span>venv<span>)</span> $ pip <span>install</span> -r requirements.txt  </code></pre></div>
<p>There are also workflow tools that simplify this process, such as <a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/">Pipenv</a> and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>. They create virtual environments for you without perception and then install dependencies into them. They are used by a wide range of users. A virtual environment contains a Python interpreter and has the same directory structure as a normal installation so that it can be used as if it were a standalone Python installation.</p>
<h2 id="the-problems-with-virtual-environments"><a href="#the-problems-with-virtual-environments" aria-label="the problems with virtual environments permalink"></a>The problems with virtual environments</h2>
<p>Virtualenvs help us isolate project dependencies, but things get tricky when it comes to nested venvs: One installs the virtualenv manager(like Pipenv or Poetry) using a venv encapsulated Python, and creates more venvs using the tool which is based on an encapsulated Python. One day a minor release of Python is out and one has to check all those venvs and upgrade them if required before they can safely delete the out-dated Python version.</p>
<p>Another scenario is global tools. There are many tools that are not tied to any specific virtualenv and are supposed to work with each of them. Examples are profiling tools and third-party REPLs. We also wish them to be installed in their own isolated environments. It's impossible to make them work with virtualenv, even if you have activated the virtualenv of the target project you want to work on because the tool is lying in its own virtualenv and it can only see the libraries installed in it. So we have to install the tool for each project.</p>
<p>I've been maintaining the Pipenv project as a collaborator for the past two years and became a member of PyPA in early 2020. I am always thinking if the virtual environment is really a must-to-have for Python projects, just like <code>npm</code>, it doesn't need a cloned <code>node</code> binary, but just a <code>node_modules</code> directory that is unique for each project.</p>
<h2 id="pep-582----python-local-packages-directory"><a href="#pep-582----python-local-packages-directory" aria-label="pep 582    python local packages directory permalink"></a>PEP 582 -- Python local packages directory</h2>
<p>The solution has been existing for a long time. <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/">PEP 582</a> was originated in 2018 and is still a draft proposal till the time I wrote this article, but I found out it is exactly what <code>node_modules</code> are in Python.</p>
<p>Say you have a project with the following structure:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.
├── __pypackages__
│   └── 3.8
│       └── lib
└── my_script.py</code></pre></div>
<p>As specified in the PEP 582, if you run <code>python3.8 /path/to/my_script.py</code>, <code>__pypackages__/3.8/lib</code> will be added to <code>sys.path</code>, and the libraries inside will become import-able in <code>my_script.py</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's review the two problems I mentioned in the last section and see how they change with the power of PEP 582. For the first problem, the main cause is that the virtual environment is bound to a cloned Python interpreter on which the subsequent library searching based. It takes advantage of Python's existing mechanisms without any other complex changes but makes the entire virtual environment to become unavailable when the Python interpreter is stale. With the local packages directory, you don't have a Python interpreter any more, the library path is directly appended to <code>sys.path</code>, so you can freely move and copy it.</p>
<p>For the second, once again, you just call the tool against the project you want to analyze, and the <code>__pypackages__</code> sitting inside the project will be loaded automatically. This way you only need to keep one copy of the global tool and make it work with multiple projects.</p>

<p>Starting from the PEP, I made <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/">PDM</a>, a new Python package manager and workflow tool that leverages PEP 582 to get rid of virtualenv entirely. It installs dependencies into the local package directory <code>__package__</code> and makes Python interpreters aware of it with <a href="https://pdm.fming.dev/#enable-pep-582-globally">a very simple setup</a>. It is not only an implementation of PEP 582 but also the only package manager that supports <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a>, a new metadata format based on <code>pyproject.toml</code> which becomes the standard recently. It is foreseen that pip will also gradually support this format. Besides, PDM uses the same dependency resolver as pip and has a full-featured plugin system, allowing for community-contributed plugins to enhance the functionalities.</p>
<p>In PDM, PEP 582 is not mandatory, you can also stick with virtualenv. PDM can detect <strong>existing</strong> venvs but not create new ones.</p>
<p>Another thing that is noteworthy is its dependency resolution mechanism -- it tries to lock versions that are compatible with the <code>requires-python</code> value of the project. Say your project requires Python 2.7 or 3.6 upper and you want to add <code>pytest</code> as a development dependency, in Pipenv(ver. <code>2020.11.15</code>) you have to pin <code>pytest = "&lt;5"</code> manually in <code>Pipfile</code>. And in Poetry(ver. <code>1.1.4</code>) if you run <code>poetry add -D pytest</code> you will get:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>The current project's Python requirement <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span> <span>||</span> <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>4.0</span><span>)</span> is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:
    - pytest requires Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>3.6</span>, so it will not be satisfied <span>for</span> Python <span>&gt;</span><span>=</span><span>2.7</span>,<span>&lt;</span><span>3.0</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Yes, it tells you to upgrade your Python requires version. However, in PDM, you can lock successfully:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>❯ pdm <span>add</span> -d pytest
Adding packages to dev dependencies: pytest
✔ 🔒 Lock successful
Changes are written to pdm.lock.
Changes are written to pyproject.toml.
Synchronizing working <span>set</span> with lock file: <span>11</span> to add, <span>0</span> to update, <span>0</span> to remove

  ✔ Install six <span>1.15</span>.0 successful
  ✔ Install wcwidth <span>0.2</span>.5 successful

🎉 All complete<span>!</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, <code>pytest</code> is pinned to <code>4.*</code> that is compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6+.</p>

<p>You may have seen this <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">comic</a> before, there are already so many package managers in Python's world, do we need a new one? No, I think. Gladly we have seen many improvements in the Python packaging ecosystem and the official installer pip, such as <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a>/<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/">PEP 518</a>, and the <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/announcement-pip-20-2-release/4863">new dependency resolver</a>, more to come in the future. But before the day comes, why not try something different from the traditional, why not make something new that makes at least myself happy. If you think so, PDM should be an option, hopefully.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>TV news has a problem — older people, especially, mostly get their news from television; however, younger people are getting their news, more and more, online. This development is proceeding rapidly. The Pew Research Center found that between 2016 and 2017 the share of Americans who often get their news from TV is down from 57% to 50 % over the course of a bit more than one year: “At the same time, the portion of Americans often getting news online . . . grew from 38% in early 2016 to 43% in the middle of 2017” (Gottfried &amp; Shearer, 2017). In Germany, this development is slower but similar (Hölig &amp; Hasebrink, 2017). Nielsen and Sambrook (2016) sum this up; “Television news as we know it . . . serves the past, not the future, and television news producers have to experiment with new formats and forms of distribution if they wish to remain relevant.” In this fight against irrelevance, globally, many broadcasters try to fascinate their viewers with giant and glittering news studio sets (cf. Pinterest, 2018). They want to make obtaining TV news from a big screen more attractive than from the small display of a Smartphone, for instance.</p>
<p>Since April 2014, the ARD has also broadcast its news from such a new studio. Similar to Al Jazeera, BBC News and CNN, ARD’s newscasters are positioned in front of a large media wall that shows photos, graphics, maps and sometimes videos. In this way, ARD wants to satisfy the “audiences’ requests for more visual stimuli,” as stated by the chief editor of <em>Tagesschau</em>, Kai Gniffke (personal communication, September 12, 2014). The question is, however, what more visual stimuli mean for viewers’ information processing. Therefore, we made the new <em>Tagesschau</em> design the topic of our research seminars to investigate the impact of large media walls and big background illustrations on the newscast’s ability to convey information. This sort of investigation is challenging because TV news exists not only as visual but also as multimodal stimuli (Piazza &amp; Haarman, 2015, p. 462).</p>
<p>Viewers have to make meaning from a mix of spoken words, sounds, inscriptions, videos, photos and graphics, and in addition, process the hosts’ gestures, voice, hairstyle and fashion. Bucher and Schumacher (2012) call this kind of reception a “process of interpretation in which manifold symbol systems have to be combined to a coherent sense” (p. 10). Therefore, it is difficult to analyze the viewers’ processing of television news. The communication scholar, Ruth Teer-Tomaselli, noted that, all “these vectors slide across the analytical plate like peas eaten with chopsticks” (as cited in Jones, 2016, p. 117).</p>
<p>We sought “better cutlery” and found tools suited for this task: the main tool was eye tracking, a technique that analyzes what people are looking at; the second tool was a special method of thinking aloud and the third tool was classical interviews, based on a questionnaire, to measure the recall performance of our test subjects.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>What happens in the minds of people when they watch TV news? Mayer and Moreno (2003), psychologists and experts in multimedia learning, work with a dual-channel assumption to describe this process. Both were inspired by Baddeley’s (1998) theory of working memory, Paivio’s (1986) dual-coding theory and Chandler and Sweller’s (1991) cognitive load theory. According to Mayer and Moreno (2003), “the human information-processing system consists of two separate channels — an auditory/verbal channel for processing auditory input and verbal representations and a visual/pictorial channel for processing visual input and pictorial representations” (p. 44). But each channel has limited capacity; “Only a limited amount of cognitive processing can take place in the verbal channel at any one time, and only a limited amount of cognitive processing can take place in the visual channel at any one time” (Mayer&amp; Moreno, 2003, p. 44). Baddeley (2003) broadens the model. He introduces a third component, the “central executive” (p. 830). This controls and coordinates the processing of both channels; it organizes connections to the long-term memory (p. 835), where all stored knowledge and experiences are located.</p>
<p>In other words, meaningful information processing occurs if humans receive information from both channels, organize the information into a coherent representation and establish connections between corresponding representations. However, and quite importantly, connections can only be established if the corresponding pictorial and verbal information is processed in both channels at the same time. If auditory and visual information diverge, one or both channels can become overloaded. According to Baddeley (2003), the auditory channel — or in his words <em>the phonological memory store </em>— “can hold memory traces for a few seconds before they fade ” (p. 830). For this reason, channels can be overloaded when auditory and visual material is not presented simultaneously; “there is a need to hold one representation in one channel’s working memory until the corresponding material is presented in the other channel” (Mayer &amp; Moreno, 2003, p. 50). This additive memory work can cause cognitive overload. For our study, the model is helpful to theoretically underpin our findings.</p>

<p><strong>Former Studies of TV News</strong></p>
<p>Research into the perception of TV news has a long history. Of particular interest are questions about overloaded working memory, and thereby, disturbed viewers’ information processing. In Germany, research into TV news, and particularly <em>Tagesschau</em>, began in the mid-1970s (cf. Bonfadelli &amp; Friemel, 2015, p. 117 ff.; Renckstorf, 1980; Straßner, 1982). International research is also represented, for example, by Drew and Grimes (1987). They recorded several TV news reports and then manipulated them by cutting some of the material out. This created versions where the verbal and pictorial information was not synchronous, to greater and lesser degrees. In other versions, auditory and visual content were assimilated. The result was that the versions with synchronized information led to significantly better recall; in cases of mismatch, only the pictures were memorized.</p>
<p>Findahl (2009) followed a similar research design by modifying five TV news reports and creating eight versions of each one with different degrees of complexity. The result was comparable to the findings of Drew and Grimes (1987): the better the language and pictures were synchronized, the better the recall of the content was. Corroborating evidence also comes from other studies: Reese (1983) and Brosius, Donsbach and Birk (1996) also tested several variations of news reports; Bergen, Grimes and Potter (2005) studied CNN Headline News. Josephson and Holmes (2006) explored the impact of crawlers and headlines on recall using news reports from foreign countries to avoid the viewer having had already seen them. A more recent survey comes from Portugal: Rodrigues, Veloso and Mealha (2016) investigated the influence of crawlers and headlines on the perception of news presentations and reports. Our own study attempted to find out whether <em>Tagesschau</em>‘s new studio-background design, compared to the old one, is better, worse or just as well suited to successfully transfer information.</p>

<p><strong>Working Hypothesis and Research Questions</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with Goertz and Schönbach (1998), who discovered that too many inscriptions, background pictures or graphics have a negative impact on the recall of TV news, we formulated our working hypothesis:</p>
<p><em>The new design with the large media wall carries the danger of overloading the viewers’ pictorial channel and distracting them from the content that is verbally transmitted.</em></p>
<p>Our investigation was guided by the research question:</p>
<p><em>Which elements of the new studio design related to background illustrations and camera angles will support or impair viewers’ information processing? </em></p>

<p><strong>Object of the research: <em>Tagesschau</em></strong></p>
<p>For our study, we had exceptionally good conditions related to our object of research. The public broadcasting service, ARD, had built a brand new TV studio in Hamburg using a very different, modern design. To test the new technical equipment and the different stage designs, the ARD produced several newscasts in two versions over a number of weeks. Version one was broadcast live from the old studio and version two was produced and concurrently recorded in the new studio. Both versions were almost identical in terms of content but different with regard to design and camera angles. We were able to access the two versions recorded on 11 April 2014, 5 p.m. <em>Tagesschau</em> program, for scientific purposes. By comparing both versions, the impact of the background design style and camera angles could be tested in a real-world setting. The project was designed as free university research, not paying contract research.</p>
<p>In the old studio’s design, the largest part of the background was blue, with blurred traces of a world map. A smaller section, approximately 30% of the background, to the right-hand of the presenter, was filled with photos related to the topic, and a headline was generally placed above the illustrations (Fig. 1). In the new studio with the large media wall, the background is normally filled with impressive pictures, also related to the topic. A broad, blue, half-transparent strip in the lower section separates the background and the host. If there is a headline, it is pushed down to the lower half of the picture (Fig. 2).</p>

<blockquote>“We have a war between two food systems, a traditional diet of real food and ultra-processed food“</blockquote>
<p><br>…<a href="https://twitter.com/RobertLustigMD/status/909205874098397184">tweeted</a>&nbsp;Dr. Robert Lustig, a fellow Professor at UCSF School of Medicine. He’s right. But I&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DrSepah/status/909240257270267904">replied</a>&nbsp;with the inconvenient truth few are willing to admit: “processed foods have won the war.” That isn’t to say we should be hopeless about the obesity epidemic, but we must soberingly admit our current strategy for curbing it is doomed. But there is another way. When other strategies fail, clinicians sometimes use “<a href="http://www.uncommon-knowledge.co.uk/articles/uncommon-hypnosis/problems-paradoxes.html">paradoxical interventions</a>” where the problem is prescribed as the cure. So this is a radical manifesto about how processed foods have not only caused the obesity epidemic, but can also cure it. To paraphrase Robert Frost:</p>
<blockquote>“The only way out is through.”</blockquote>
<h2><strong>S.A.D.! The Standard American Diet is 2/3 Processed Foods</strong></h2>
<p>Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, Dean of the Tufts School of Nutrition, and colleagues published one of the most eye-opening <a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/3/e009892">studies</a> on the Standard American Diet (or what I humorously like to call “S.A.D.!”). Astonishingly, they showed that only 1/3 of calories come from ‘unprocessed’ (whole) foods anymore. The other 2/3 of calories come 10% from ‘minimally-processed’ foods (like cheese, which one could potentially make in a kitchen) and a staggering 57% from ‘ultra-processed’ foods (like Cheeze-It crackers, which can only be manufactured in a factory).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/SADgraphic_grande.png?v=1510353917" alt=""></p>
<p>The evidence is clear. By a 2:1 margin, processed foods have dominated whole foods in America like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7TjFqCDrDs&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3B8MFT53a8TtCwx8jXcL1LLw%3D%3D">Mayweather over McGregor</a>. It’s no wonder, processed foods are widely perceived as cheaper, tastier, and more convenient than whole foods. But what people don’t fully realize is that processed foods are actually a dominant technology developed by a multi-trillion dollar food industry, and we are never, ever going back to the pre-industrial way things were. We live in a world of transformative technologies, and in a nation where <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2016/millennials-are-top-smartphone-users.html">98% of Millennials</a> own ‘smart’ phones, our society will clearly never go back to ‘dumb’ phones and pagers. So why do we expect any differently with food?</p>
<h2><strong>What Works for Some, Does Not Work for Most</strong></h2>
<p>For an individual, it is obviously possible to eat 100% whole foods. There are lots of great success stories of people who transformed their entire diets, lost 100 lbs., got off of their medications, etc. But just because “it worked for me”, doesn’t mean it will work for everyone else, because not everyone can “just do what I did.” Any clinician who has actually worked with thousands of patients know that different people have different levels of readiness to change, will require different approaches, and as a result, some will simply do better than others. This is not to downplay the importance of individual responsibility. As I tell my own patients:</p>
<blockquote>“It’s not your fault that you came into my office, but it is your responsibility to walk out better.”</blockquote>
<p><br>Thus, we must balance individual responsibility with acknowledging the data that most don’t succeed on their own. Educating the majority of Americans to only eat whole foods, without addressing how to manage processed foods, is like teaching “abstinence only” sex education, and expecting most people to never engage in sexual activity until marriage. Educational strategies that don’t acknowledge human behavior are hopelessly ineffective. We must acknowledge people indulge, and teach them how to reduce harm when they do so.</p>
<h2><strong>Convenience is King, and is More Sustainable Long-Term.</strong></h2>
<p>The science suggests that though doctors admonish their patients to “eat right and exercise”, this advice alone generally fails to work. In fact, in the placebo/control group (designed to show no effect) of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1351026/">Diabetes Prevention Program clinical trial</a>, patients were counterintuitively instructed to lose 5-10% of their body weight. That’s because researchers knew they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3135022/figure/F2/">wouldn’t lose any weight</a> anyway! Even the lifestyle (intensive counseling) and metformin (medication) groups, which did lose weight initially and significantly slow the onset of diabetes, eventually regained all the weight lost they lost after a decade.&nbsp;The temporary weight loss was still beneficial (reduced diabetes risk by 34% over 10 years), but would have been more powerful if the weight loss was maintained:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/metformin_grande.gif?v=1510353972" alt=""></p>
<p>That’s because the law of inertia suggests any clinical treatment for obesity that expects patients to significantly do more work, instead of less, will eventually fail for most people in the long-term. Eating 100% whole foods was only sustainable for a society in a pre-industrial farming era, where the only foods we could eat were the whole foods we hunt, picked, and planted ourselves (that’s the real Omnivore’s Dilemma. Sorry, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/magazine/the-modern-huntergatherer.html">Michael Pollan</a>).</p>
<p>But most people no longer have the time, energy, or resources to eat three home-cooked meals per day. Modern households are no longer inter-generational, with fewer grandparents or stay-at-home spouses to bear the responsibility of communal food preparation. Even when TV dinners were introduced in the 1950s, they “<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vP99yWtfovYC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">came as a great relief</a> for housewives burdened with baby-boom offspring.” Convenience is king. But it’s not just because we don’t have time to prepare whole foods, it’s because processed foods are so behaviorally irresistible.</p>
<h2><strong>Obesity is More of a Behavioral than a Biological Problem.</strong></h2>
<p>In the medical community, obesity is considered a symptom of a larger ‘metabolic syndrome’, which shows up externally, as belly fat, but also internally as high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood fats. But these are actually symptoms of the root problem. While obesity is a complex, biopsychosocial issue with no easy explanation, the explosion in obesity rates suggest there’s something radical going on. &nbsp;If you look at this CDC time lapse of obesity rates from 1985-2010, most states went from &lt;10% obesity to &gt;30% obesity in the span of only 25 years!</p>
<p><iframe width="744" height="419" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ihSeSToXOw" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So what’s going on? The main driver is that the way we eat has changed dramatically: with people cooking less, eating out more, and relying more on processed, carbohydrate-rich foods that drive insulin resistance. Thus, this data suggests that obesity is more of a behavioral problem than a biological problem. These foods also serve a psychological need. Despite the current opioid crisis, eating is actually America’s favorite narcotic: with <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2013/eating.aspx">38% of adults</a> reporting “they have overeaten or eaten unhealthy foods in the past month because of stress.”</p>
<h2><strong>Most Ultra-Processed Foods Are ‘Designer Drugs’. We’re Hooked.</strong></h2>
<p>Americans are victims of an ‘obesogenic’ environment that has them hopelessly hooked to the most irresistible designer drug the world has ever known: ultra-processed foods. In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Waistland-evolutionary-Weight-Fitness-Crisis-ebook/dp/B000W7KNDK/ref=pd_sim_351_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=0KHF98P7DGDENXB3A6CS">Waistland: A (R)evolutionary View of Our Weight and Fitness Crisis</a>, psychologist Deirdre Barrett argues out that human beings evolved to crave certain stimuli: fats, salts, and sweets, to help us survive and thrive through harsh times. “Big Food” companies exploited these natural cravings by designing processed foods that are far fattier, sweeter, and saltier than anything that normally exists in nature. Thus, processed foods are “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0034N7JI6/">supernormal stimuli</a>” purposefully designed to be addictive, and effectively outcompete whole foods on our tricked taste buds.</p>
<p>Lest you think this is a conspiracy theory — Big Food industry scientists have admitted they use such principles to create addictive foods. A New York Times article, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/magazine/the-extraordinary-science-of-junk-food.html">The Extraordinary Science of Addictive Junk Food</a>”, revealed that companies like Frito-Lay use $30 million R&amp;D budgets to hire research staffs of 500+ scientists to create ‘frankenfoods’ like Cheetos. Cheetos include technologies like “vanishing caloric density,” which make them melt in your mouth so quickly “your brain thinks that there’s no calories in it . . . you can just keep eating it forever.” In light of such irresistible foods, why do we actually expect people to exercise self-control and just “<a href="https://vimeo.com/97370236">stop it</a>”?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2500/4432/files/cheetos_large.jpg?v=1510354062" alt=""></p>
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<h2><strong>All Drugs Aren’t Bad. All Processed Foods Aren’t Either.</strong></h2>
<p>In the modern era, we treat addiction as a disease, and often replace addictive and impure street drugs like heroin, with prescription opioid medications like methadone that are purified and better controlled to prevent deadly withdrawals and carefully wean people off. Street drugs and prescription drugs are both “drugs”, but can hardly be equated since the former often takes lives, while the latter can often give it back if properly prescribed and used.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can’t lump all processed foods together as being “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh7l8dx-h8M">bad, m’kay</a>?” Minimally-processed foods like yogurt, butter, and cheese, have been made at home for millennia and also ultra-processed in factories more recently. Studies show dairy consumption is associated with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28318689">lower risk</a> of type 2 diabetes. The devil is always in the details though, and a ball of handmade mozzarella cheese is hardly the same thing as processed cheese slices that have so little actual cheese in them the FDA requires legally labeling them as “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processed_cheese#Legal_definitions">cheese product</a>.”</p>
<h2><strong>Intentions Matter: Processing for Health vs. Wealth.</strong></h2>
<p>So we should just avoid ultra-processed foods by avoiding all those chemical sounding ingredients we can’t pronounce, right? While this ‘chemophobia’ can be a helpful shortcut, it’s also not always accurate. If you analyze any whole food like a Kiwi, it’s technically made up of a lot of ‘chemicals’ that naturally exist in nature:</p>
<p>Just because a food is ultra-processed or fortified with added ingredients doesn’t inherently make it unhealthy. While the <a href="http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/exclusive_breastfeeding/en/">World Health Organization</a> educates mothers that breastfeeding for the first 6 months is the “optimal way of feeding infants”, it also acknowledges that infant formula can play an essential or supplementary role in keeping infants alive and healthy when mothers cannot breastfeed regularly. Thus, some ultra-processed foods are optimized for health more than cost or taste, due to tighter government regulations and more selectivity by consumers.</p>

Tkinter is an integral part of Python and you do not need to install it in your working environment. PyQt, on the other hand, is a python binding for Qt, which is a collection of C++ libraries and development tools that include platform-independent abstraction for GUI. To use the PyQt library, we need to install it first. To be comfortable with GUI application production, we need to understand object-oriented programming (OOP) and class elaboration. <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/classes-oop/#:~:text=In%20object%2Doriented%20programming%2C%20a,created%20using%20the%20class%20keyword" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>OOP</span></a> is a type of structuring program that bundles required and related properties/behaviors into an object. Think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure) to provide initial value for the state (attributes) and implementations of behavior (methods). </span></p><p id="viewer-f8f8j"><span>
<strong>Do we still need to learn desktop GUI development?</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-emsel"><span>This is a tough question to answer. There is still demand for GUI desktop applications, however, the software development market has been changed noticeably by emerging web and mobile applications. It depends on your situation and interest but as a geoscientist who has a passion for new IT developments, I would vote for web applications because I want to share them easily with users. On the other hand, by using cloud-based platforms, such as Azure (Microsoft) or AWS (Amazon), you will receive plenty of services that make your production and app deployment pleasurable such as database management or app scalability (though it requires subscription). </span></p><p id="viewer-f071o"><span><strong>Web application development </strong></span></p><p id="viewer-1hg7b"><span>By definition, a web app is an interactive computer program built with web technologies like HTML, which stores database and manipulate data by user(s) to perform tasks through the internet. One of the greatest examples of a web application is Google Docs that users can create, read, update and delete documents. To build a web app from scratch, we need to deal with the database, frontend, and backend steps and then have a host to deploy the web application.</span></p><p id="viewer-a9i2a"><span>To create a web app by python scripts, Django, a full-stack framework, or Flask, a micro lightweight web framework can be used. The former helps developers to build large and complex applications while the latter, Flask, is suitable for simple web applications. </span></p><p id="viewer-f5qtp"><span><strong>For a Machine Learning interactive dashboard, do I have to learn Django or Flask? </strong></span></p><p id="viewer-dlcui"><span>Not actually, thanks to OOP, there are several service providers that eliminated these steps for us. One great example is <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stremlit</a>, which is totally free. You can turn data scripts into a shareable web application in python. No front-end experience is required. It is completely compatible with major libraries such as scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Numpy, matplotlib …</span></p><p id="viewer-6m85p"><span>I used streamlit and its library to build my app but deployed it on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heroku</a>. </span></p><h3 id="viewer-1r9ih"><span>Web App: Well log prediction using various machine learning algorithms </span></h3><p id="viewer-546v5"><span>Motivation: well logs are a critical measurement of the physical properties of rock medium. Commonly, some logs are missing. In this example, we used <a href="https://www.dataenergy.ca/opendata" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Force 2020</a> well log dataset and tried to predict the Neutron Porosity log (NPHI). The predictors (features) are GR, RHOB, DTC, and SP logs and the target log is NPHI. We have chosen a smaller dataset to see the modeling results faster. We selected 3 wells (two for train and test, one blind (not involved in the training process)).</span></p><p id="viewer-33j91"><span>Remember, as well logs are a continuous variable, this is a regression problem and we should choose regression models. Normally, model performance for test datasets is better than those datasets that have not been seen by the model (blind).</span></p><p id="viewer-9vrej"><span>Seven important algorithms have been selected including, AdaBoost, Multi-Layer Perceptron (Neural Network), K Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine, Bayesian Ridge Regression, Decision tree, and Stochastic Gradient Descent regressor. If you want to study the logic behind these algorithms, you may look at <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scikit-learn</a> documentation. The most important Hyper-parameters of these algorithms have been selected to be adjusted by the user. You can play around with parameters to see the prediction results. </span></p><p id="viewer-dbqqs"><span>We provided 4 evaluation metrics for model performances, 1 quantitative and 3 qualitative.</span></p><p id="viewer-13lkg"><span>R2 Score is a square of the correlation. It ranges between 0 and 1. We also plotted the true NPHI log from the blind well which is over-laid by predicted NPHI resulted from the model. The distribution of NPHI porosity for true and predicted data is plotted on the up-right. A scatter plot of True and predicted NPHI is also plotted with a correlation fit line on it. If you want to study detail explanation of Machine Learning with a geoscience example, facies classification, you find this series in the <a href="https://www.dataenergy.ca/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a> practical.</span></p><p id="viewer-10mr9"><span>In this post, I did not want to elaborate on this app scripting or the result of model evaluation in detail. I intended to show that object-oriented programming and cloud hosting provided a facility that everyone (with some basic knowledge of programming), can develop a web application and share it with others. Leave us a comment with any questions or concerns. </span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

it is secure."><div><p>We explain how CryFS works and why it is secure.</p><p>The description can be a bit technical in some points. If you're rather interested in using CryFS, take a look at the <a>CryFS Tutorial</a>.</p></div></section><section><div><h2>Storing data</h2><div><p><img src="https://www.cryfs.org/_next/static/images/storingdata-6e5ee2b5bc550e4d8be92cbcd80b9011.png" alt="Your files, metadata and directory structure are stored as a set of same-size blocks, encrypted, and stored in the cloud."></p><div><p>The goal of CryFS is not only to keep file contents, but also file sizes, metadata and directory structure confidential.</p><p>To hide file sizes, CryFS splits the content of a file into same-size blocks and encrypts these blocks individually.
A tree structure is used to remember how the blocks belong together to form a file.
This tree structure has very little overhead and itself is also stored using encrypted same-size blocks.
To hide file metadata and directory structure, they are also represented using encrypted same-size blocks.</p><p>Each encrypted block is stored as a file in the base directory, using a random ID as filename.
The base directory can then be set up to be synchronized with a cloud provider like Dropbox.
An attacker with access to the base directory can only see a set of same-size ciphertext blocks and can't see
contents, file sizes, metadata or directory structure of your data.</p><p>The blocks are encrypted using a block cipher chosen by the user. A random encryption key is generated when the filesystem is created.
This key is stored in a configuration file, which is then encrypted using the password chosen by the user.
Since it is encrypted, it can be stored together with the ciphertext blocks in the cloud, which is the default.
If you want to use an insecure (e.g. empty) password or don't trust the scrypt algorithm used for encrypting the configuration file, you can also keep the configuration file locally.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div><h2>Configuration File</h2><p>The base directory also contains a configuration file with the information CryFS needs to decrypt it.
This configuration file is encrypted and integrity-checked using the password chosen by the user, so an attacker cannot read or modify it.</p><p>The information stored in the configuration file includes the following.</p><ul><li><strong>[Cipher]</strong>: The cipher used (e.g. <var>aes-256-gcm</var>)</li><li><strong>[Encryption Key]</strong>: The encryption key used for encrypting blocks</li><li><strong>[Root Block ID]</strong>: The block ID for the block storing the root directory (entry point for the filesystem)</li></ul><div><div><p>The configuration file is encrypted twice, once with <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and once with the cipher chosen by the user.
This way, if the user doesn't trust <var>aes-256-gcm</var> for some reason,
they can choose another cipher and still be secure.
The keys for both encryption layers are generated from the user-chosen password using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">scrypt</a>.</p><p>In detail, CryFS generates two keys <var>outer_key</var> and <var>inner_key</var> using scrypt and the user password.
It encrypts the configuration file using the user cipher and <var>inner_key</var>.
To the ciphertext, it prepends the name of the user cipher (so it knows how to decrypt it later) and encrypts
the result using <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and <var>outer_key</var>. This way, an attacker cannot see or manipulate which cipher is used.
As a last step, the scrypt configuration parameters are prepended, so CryFS knows how to configure scrypt when
decrypting the filesystem.
When decrypting the configuration file, CryFS first reads the scrypt parameters and regenerates both keys from the user password.
Then, it decrypts the first layer and reads the cipher chosen by the user.
Using this cipher, it decrypts the second layer and reads the configuration values.</p></div><p><img src="https://www.cryfs.org/_next/static/images/configfileencryption-3ae7bd61acfdd365aab16b721dbbcfad.png" alt="Configuration File Encryption Layers"></p></div><p>The integrity of the configuration file depends on <var>aes-256-gcm</var>.
This cipher is a standard cipher and believed to be very secure.
If, however, you don't trust the integrity of <var>aes-256-gcm</var> and want to use another cipher instead,
we recommend adding the <kbd>--cipher xxx</kbd> parameter each time you mount the filesystem.
This way, CryFS can check that the cipher used by the filesystem is the one you actually specified
and you don't have to rely on the <var>aes-256-gcm</var> integrity verification step.</p><p>Alternatively, you can store the configuration file outside of the base directory and not upload it into the cloud.<br>
This is possible using the <kbd>--config</kbd> parameter when calling CryFS.</p></div></section><section><div><h2>Security Analysis</h2><p>The security of CryFS has been proven in a <a href="https://www.cryfs.org/cryfs_mathesis.pdf">master's thesis</a>
and in a <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-61176-1_23">scientific paper published at DBSec 2017</a>
(<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/773.pdf">PDF</a>) using a game-based security approach.
The works also contain a detailed description of the inner workings of CryFS.</p><p>The current version meets all security goals regarding confidentiality of file contents, size, metadata and directory structure.
The integrity goals mentioned in the thesis are also implemented as of version 0.10.0.
The 0.9.x versions protect the encrypted blocks from being modified by an attacker,
since they use an authenticated encryption scheme like <var>aes-256-gcm</var>,
but they don't prevent an attacker from rolling back the filesystem by replacing blocks with an earlier valid version of the same block yet.</p></div></section><section></section> <section></section></div></div>]]>

Additionally, new techniques for local IP address discovery are included.</p><p>This attack requires the NAT/firewall to support ALG (Application Level Gateways), which are mandatory for protocols that can use multiple ports (control channel + data channel) such as SIP and H323 (VoIP protocols), FTP, IRC DCC, etc.</p><div>

  <li>if testing in a virtual machine (VM) using shared networking (used to protect a host from attacks by routing it through the host, not letting it directly onto the network), if the packets make it out, the parent host machine is where the ports end up getting opened, not the VM ;)</li>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting destination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia à la Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

    <h2>The problem</h2>
<p>I wanted to have a look at
<em><a href="https://archive.org/details/cu31924021781434">Melodia</a></em>, a public-domain
textbook to learn
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight-reading#Sight-singing">sight-reading</a>.
I thought it would be nice to read <em>Melodia</em> on an ebook reader, but the
<a href="https://archive.org/download/cu31924021781434/cu31924021781434.pdf">available
PDF</a> is a
scan of a paper copy in 7 by 10 inches, and my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobo_Glo">Kobo
Glo</a> screen is only around 3.5 by 4.8 
inches:</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/size.svg" alt="sizes of paper and display"></p>
<p>The obvious solution is to scale it down, but it would be too small to read.
So wouldn't it be better if we could split each page into parts of the right
size?</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/split.svg" alt="splitting music into blocks naively"></p>
<p>Of course, it's not that simple. When reading music you want
to follow the lines from left to right, then from top to bottom. It's exactly
like text, where the right way to reflow a page is:</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/split2.svg" alt="splitting text into blocks correctly"></p>
<p>One way to do this would be to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_music_recognition">optical music
recognition</a> to
transcribe the whole partition, and then re-render it to the right format. But
that's not so fun, and I don't know if there are good implementations for this
task which I can easily install (i.e., not expensive and Windows-only programs).
Instead, let's go for a more ad-hoc but much simpler approach.</p>
<p>To split music, you need to be able to recognize the separate lines (i.e.,
staves, or systems). Then you need to find a way to cut them: typically at a
measure bar line, to avoid splitting inside a bar. More subtly, for the result
to look good, you want each split line in the output page to have exactly the
same length, even if the bars on the input page did not, otherwise the result
will look jagged. The naive solution would be to stretch each line, but it
will look awful and distorted. Instead, you want to do something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving">seam
carving</a>: scale the "uninteresting
parts" (e.g., empty space on the staff) while leaving the "important stuff"
(notes, alterations, etc.) untouched. See:</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/splitsheet.svg" alt="3 ways to split sheet music"></p>
<p>What's more, because scaling is undesirable, you need to decide where to cut
among all the bar lines. The goal is to avoid having lines that are too
small and need to be resized by a large factor (leaving too much empty space).
The naive way is to fit as many bars as possible on each line, but this can
leave you with very short lines that are hard to format properly.
This is a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_wrap_and_word_wrap#Algorithm">word wrapping
problem</a></p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/knapsack.svg" alt="word wrapping problem"></p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>So I wrote some code to take care of these tasks for me.
I called it <code>songflower</code>, as in
something that (re)flows songs. The code is <a href="https://a3nm.net/git/songflower">here</a>. I don't
expect it to be usable without significant tweaking, but there is a README and
some documentation that allow to play with it and tweak the parameters.</p>
<p>So what does it do exactly? Glad you asked. :) Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burst the input PDF into a collection of bitmap images, one for each page</li>
<li>Split each page into one image for each <em>line</em> on the page (i.e., staves, or systems)</li>
<li>Split each line into a <em>chunk</em>, i.e., a sequence of consecutive bars having
  exactly the prescribed width. This involves:<ul>
<li>Finding the bar lines</li>
<li>Splitting bars into chunks intelligently</li>
<li>Stretching the chunks to have exactly the right width</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Combine the chunks into output pages (laying them out nicely on the page) and
  combine those into the output PDF.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step is easy with <code>convert</code> from <a href="https://imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a>, although
it is pretty long and for some reason and takes lots of RAM. The last step is
also pretty routine: you just greedily put as many chunks on each page as you
can, you need to compute the right spacing between the chunks to fill all
available height in the layout, and then combining the result into a PDF is just
<code>convert</code> again, plus <code>pdftk</code>. The harder steps are the
two middle steps:</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/steps.svg" alt="the two hard steps"></p>
<h2>Step 1: Splitting pages into lines</h2>
<p>This step is comparatively easy. The program just looks for
rows of the picture that consist mostly of white pixels. It then smooths this by
merging together consecutive white lines that are sufficiently close (to have
some resilience to noise). Last, it cuts at the largest sets of consecutive
white lines, up to some threshold.
This is how the program sees a page of <em>Melodia</em>: </p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/splith.png" alt="illustrating line splits"></p>
<p>The yellow lines are the lines detected as white space, and the red lines are
where the program decided to cut (there were enough consecutive empty lines).
The green lines were not used to cut because they yielded a line that was too
short. The result here is pretty OK, except that the program was a bit too eager
and cut away a tie connecting two dotted minims on the 4th staff from the
bottom. Apart from small problems of this kind, the approach is pretty robust on
the <em>Melodia</em> dataset. The main problems involve slurs, staves that are too
close together on a page, and lyrics which often get removed (this is fine for
my needs but it might not be for yours).</p>
<h2>Step 2: Splitting lines into chunks</h2>
<p>This is the trickier part. Let's focus on the
first line above:</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/splitwo.png" alt="illustrating line splits (original line)"></p>
<p>This is how the program sees it:</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/splitw.png" alt="illustrating line splits (annotation)"></p>
<p>OK, this requires some explaining. The program looks at columns of pixels and
computes two things: the <em>height</em> of the column, and the <em>weight</em> of the
column (smoothed over a small window). The height is just the maximal vertical
distance between two non-white pixels on the column, and the weight is the sum
of the pixel's distance to black. We are especially interested in columns that
both have a minimal height and a minimal weight (excluding some outliers, with
some thresholds, etc). Intuitively, these columns are points on the staff where
nothing is happening. These are the purple parts on the picture above: the cyan
parts have small weight but not height, the pink parts have small height but not
weight, and the black parts satisfy neither criterion. (Sorry, these ugly colors
are just what was the easiest to produce -- it's a debug output.)</p>
<p>We can see that both criteria are useful: if we look only at the height (pink
and purple) then we still include columns of staff that are not empty. If we
look only at weight, then we get fooled by some columns that include part of a
note (bars 2 and 3). But when we look at both criteria, the purple parts are a
reasonable approximation of the parts of the score where nothing is happening.
(Note that floating stuff, e.g., the numbers 168 and
169, prevent parts of the staff from being detected as empty.)</p>
<p>Now, it's good to find where nothing is happening, but where can we find bar
lines? The idea is that a bar line is a part of the staff which:</p>
<ul>
<li>is of minimal height but not of minimal weight (pink)</li>
<li>is surrounded to the left and right by points of minimal height and weight (purple)</li>
<li>is <em>narrow</em>, i.e., not too many pixels wide</li>
<li>contains a column with high weight, i.e., significantly higher (by some factor)
  than the weight of columns where nothing happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a complicated collection of criteria, but I didn't have luck with more
naive approaches. My initial idea was just to look for columns having a minimal
height and high weight, but this is fooled by note stems, e.g., of the last
crochet of bar 3. Still, this criterion is fragile, especially with minims as
their notehead is sometimes not heavy enough to be detected; and you have to set
some parameters correctly.</p>
<p>On the example above, this approach correctly detects all bars (vertical lines),
except the double bar at the middle. The blue bar is where the program decided
to cut the line (to fit the width I had requested), and the red lines were
possible cuts that were not used. Here the choice of a cut is simple (take the
closest to the middle), but in more complicated cases the program will try all
possible approaches.</p>
<p>The last thing to do is stretching the chunks to the left and right of the blue
line so that they have the exact same length -- which they currently don't (the
left chunk is much longer than the right chunk). To do this, the program simply
scales all purple regions. We get this (without the colors):</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/page_0018_0000_0000.png" alt="first split">
<img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/page_0018_0000_0001.png" alt="second split"></p>
<p>It's not perfect: the first bar is a bit off, because the program did not
stretch around the "168".<sup id="fnref:songflower_weird"><a href="#fn:songflower_weird">1</a></sup> Also, in a proper edition, the key
would be repeated at the beginning of the second line, which my program doesn't
dot, but well... Other than that, I think it's pretty seamless, and hard to
notice that there was some work involved in bringing these two lines to the same
width.</p>
<p>Of course, this example is a case where the program doesn't perform too badly.
Sometimes, it has a harder time doing something reasonable:</p>
<p><img src="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/fail.png" alt="case where the program fails"></p>
<p>One could think of more elaborate approaches to avoid problems, e.g., trying to
identify floating things like "168" or lyrics or other things, process the staff
without taking them into account, and then attach them back to the right place
afterwards...</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>There are a lot of corner cases and other subtleties in the code which I didn't
get into. For instance, when the program doesn't detect enough bar lines, then it
will fall back on cutting on spaces detected to be empty -- this is usually less
disruptive. Performance is also an issue, as the code is in Python: to speed
things up is, I use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU parallel</a> to
process multiple pages and lines simultaneously.</p>
<p>Anyway: applying the process to <em>Melodia</em>, fixing a few glitches by tweaking the
parameters on some pages (and adding a title, removing junk, etc.), I got the
<a href="https://a3nm.net/blog/songflower/melodia_reflow.pdf">reflowed PDF</a> I wanted. It's not perfect at all,
and some of the later pages are quite wild, but well, I'll see to it when/if I
get there. :)</p>
<p>You should be able at least to reflow <em>Melodia</em> to a different format by
grabbing <a href="https://a3nm.net/git/songflower/">the code</a> and running it. Other than that, I'd be
happy to know if you have any luck applying this code to other files! I'm also
interested in patches or ideas if you also find it fun to hack on this.</p>

<h3>Release Date:</h3><p>
January 26, 2021
</p><h3>Summary:</h3><p>
A serious heap-based buffer overflow has been discovered in sudo
that is exploitable by any local user. It has been given the name
<em>Baron Samedit</em> by its discoverer. The bug can be leveraged
to elevate privileges to root, even if the user is not listed in
the sudoers file. User authentication is not required to exploit
the bug.
</p><h3>Sudo versions affected:</h3><p>
Sudo versions 1.8.2 through 1.8.31p2 and 1.9.0 through 1.9.5p1 are
affected.
</p><h3>CVE ID:</h3><p>
This vulnerability has been assigned <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156');">CVE-2021-3156</a>
in the <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/" onclick="getOutboundLink('http://cve.mitre.org/');">Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures</a> database.
</p><h3>Details:</h3><p>
When sudo runs a command in <em>shell</em> mode, either via the
<strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> command line option, it
escapes special characters in the command's arguments with a backslash.
The sudoers policy plugin will then remove the escape characters from
the arguments before evaluating the sudoers policy (which doesn't
expect the escape characters) if the command is being run in shell
mode.
</p><p>
A bug in the code that removes the escape characters will read
beyond the last character of a string if it ends with an unescaped
backslash character. Under normal circumstances, this bug would
be harmless since sudo has escaped all the backslashes in the
command's arguments. However, due to a different bug, this time
in the command line parsing code, it is possible to run <tt>sudoedit</tt>
with either the <strong>-s</strong> or <strong>-i</strong> options,
setting a flag that indicates shell mode is enabled. Because a
command is not actually being run, sudo does <strong>not</strong>
escape special characters. Finally, the code that decides whether
to remove the escape characters did not check whether a command is
actually being run, just that the shell flag is set. This inconsistency
is what makes the bug exploitable.
</p><p>
To test whether your version of sudo is vulnerable, the following
command can be used:
</p><pre>sudoedit -s '\' `perl -e 'print "A" x 65536'`
</pre><p>
If you receive a usage or error message, sudo is not vulnerable.
If the result is a <strong>Segmentation fault</strong>, sudo is

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Fear and panic could destroy the city as much as plague itself. Many of the doctors fled, along with the rich and powerful; quacks preyed on the poor with their neverfail miracle drugs. Neighbours informed against each other. People lied to each other – and to themselves. Worse – there were stories of infected people deliberately concealing their telltale ‘tokens’ and going out into the streets trying to infect others.</p><p>-Daniel Defoe, <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em> (1722)</p></blockquote><h5>Zeynep Tüfekçi is a force of nature whose intellectual range encompasses everything from academic sociology to the impact of social media on society to (more recently) the COVID mask and lockdown debates. Her book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3hibL21">Twitter and Tear Gas</a></em> is a now-classic study of Internet-fueled protest, and she continues to write prolifically for <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/column/zeynep-tufekci">The New York Times</a> </em> and <em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/zeynep-tufekci/">The Atlantic</a>. </em>In our lengthy interview—I completely ignored Substack warnings about email length—I unveil the jocular coinage ‘zeynepping’ to describe this unique blend of contrarian and wide-ranging embroilment in the burning issues of the day. She and I have had a year-long DM thread where we agree on basically nothing, except perhaps that McLuhan was right about the fundamentally oral dynamics of modern digital media (which we only mention in passing here, because of course we spent most of our time bickering). She agreed to publicize some of our disagreement in the longest <em>Pull Request</em> interview yet. Tüfekçi also recently started <a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/">her own Substack </a><em><a href="https://zeynep.substack.com/">Insight</a></em>.</h5><p><strong>From what you’ve told me, you started your career as a programmer but then you ended up doing a master's degree and PhD. But your claim to fame was the book on Twitter and the Middle East and its various convulsions, is that right?</strong></p><p>My first claim to fame was when Facebook started. It was just seen as a little college thing, and I started writing that it would scramble our understanding of privacy. It was just collapsing a lot of geographic boundaries, and since I was a college teacher, I could see it in the students’ experience; their mental model of what Facebook was and what it actually did to their experience of space and time. I remember one incident: I used to teach intro to sociology and it's a big lecture class, because that's how those things work. So I would assign little group assignments to break up the lecture. What if you were born a different gender? Or what if you were in a different family? Just very simple, simple stuff for students. And they got a passing grade so long as they turned in something. </p><p>So my TA at one point notices that a bunch of them have the same handwriting. Why on earth are they cheating, what is going on? So I called the group into my office, and they say: <em>What a coincidence we all have the same handwriting!</em> And I ask: <em>Do you know each other?</em> <em>No, we don't know each other</em>, they say. And I did something that I don't ever do: I looked them up on Facebook. And of course, they were all friends with each other, so I just showed them Facebook and I said: <em>Look, you're lying to me, you're all friends with each other</em>. They almost fainted in my office because the idea that their friendship could be documented and be visible to the outside world and that Facebook would be a vehicle for this was a completely alien and incomprehensible thing to these kids.</p><p>The most interesting thing to me was how could they not imagine the obvious thing that this is going to scramble their visibility and ruin their denial. They just had no idea. So I started doing some studies…</p><p><strong>What year was this?</strong></p><p>This was before the Arab Spring, I think my first studies where 2007 or 2008-ish?</p><p>I started saying stuff like: <em>Facebook, they're going to scramble privacy, they are changing how we understand primary and secondary social contacts and their visibility</em>. I started arguing that in some ways—and this is something you and I talk about a lot—this is taking people back to a more intrinsically human way of living, in which you don't lose contact with people. This idea that you've graduated from middle school, and then high school, and then go to a different city and never see those people again, that's kind of a weird 20th-century blip: that's not how humans have mostly lived. But at a scale that is not the same as your village or hunter-gatherer experience. It's got a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and it's going to scramble everything. I kept saying this is going to change the fabric of society, these tools are not these things that just sit outside of society. </p><p>And when the Arab Spring hit, then all of a sudden, because I’m from the Middle East, all of a sudden, people were like: <em>Oh, wait, there was somebody talking about this</em>, and everybody wanted an explanation. That’s when I started being able to do my current work as until then universities would hire me because I could do stats and math. The rest has been a blur.</p><p><strong>I recall first reading your work in the wake of the Arab Spring. The Western vibe at the time was definitely: </strong><em><strong>Isn't this just great and amazing?</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>Twitter is central to this entire social turmoil</strong></em><strong>! Though in retrospect, it might not have had the centrality that Westerners imagined, in terms of the bigger picture…</strong></p><p>But it actually was really important. What's really funny is that a lot of these people are also my friends and people I had known because of the Middle Eastern democracy and dissident crowds. They got so sick of Western journalists asking them about Twitter and Facebook every day, they would just lie, and say: <em>It had nothing to do with any saying. Stop this bullshit. You know, we don't really use those tools</em>.</p><p>They would literally say that, and then they would be on the backchannel saying:<em> Wait, I think the Twitter trending algorithm changed,</em> because they were disassembling it, and they thought about it a lot. But they got so sick of the navel gazing about it because the West could only relate to them as Twitter users. So I wouldn't say it didn't play a key role: I think it played a major role in the upheaval. But it got framed in the West as a stupid question. You know, <em>was it Twitter or was it the people?</em> I felt like stabbing my eyes out when people ask those kinds of questions, so that's when I start writing about it.</p><h4>We have the same narrative about social media in the West now: When it's destabilizing to the people that the chattering classes don't like, it's great. And when it's destabilizing to the chattering classes, then it's terrible: we don't do <em>that</em> to <em>them.</em></h4><p><strong>Right. So the two claims are: This Twitter/Facebook thing is absolutely central. Again, the only way we can relate to these people is via their Twitter usage, otherwise, the local politics are not of vital interest from the Western perspective. And then secondly, that this was all a magnificent thing.</strong></p><p><strong>But as soon as those same disruptions visit the West in the form of Trump, Brexit, the </strong><em><strong>gilets jaunes</strong></em><strong>, etc. Suddenly: </strong><em><strong>Have we questioned whether overthrowing the state of affairs is actually such a great thing??</strong></em><strong> It's interesting to see the contrast between that sort of narrative and the one in 2016.</strong></p><p>We have the same narrative about social media in the West now: When it's destabilizing the people that the chattering classes don't like, it's great. And when it's destabilizing the chattering classes, then it's terrible: we don't do <em>that</em> to <em>them.</em></p><p>When Obama won in 2012, there were I don't know how many articles talking about how great his use of technology and data was. Which is why I started saying: <em>wait, wait, it's not about your candidate, this might not be that great, and there are all these problems</em>. Interestingly, when I started saying that—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">I wrote that </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">Times </a></em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/opinion/beware-the-big-data-campaign.html">op-ed</a>, which caused so much grief for me—I heard from so many tech people, from Obama people and big data people and Silicon Valley people, who told me that these tools were necessarily going to only be used by smart people, which were of course them, right? I mean, the whole tech world was completely convinced that the other side, so to speak, would never be smart like them. Really high level people in both the Obama administration and in Silicon Valley just thought: <em>you know, this is ours, this will always be ours, and it will always do our bidding.</em> And of course, anybody who knows history is jumping up and down saying <em>it doesn't do your bidding like that!</em> It's not your little pony that's gonna just destabilize things you happen to dislike at the moment and leave you alone. So here we are.</p><h4>I heard from so many tech people, from Obama people and big data people and Silicon Valley people, who told me that these tools were necessarily going to only be used by smart people, which were of course them, right? I mean, the whole tech world was completely convinced that the other side, so to speak, would never be smart like them. Really high level people in both the Obama administration and in Silicon Valley just thought: <em>you know, this is ours, this will always be ours, and it will always do our bidding.</em></h4><p><strong>You and I both have the same hang ups, because we've had these conversations before, such as the conflict between literacy and orality, the weird warping of geography that social media causes, which to me is one of the biggest things I can't get my head around. </strong></p><p><strong>But just before we leave the topic of the Middle East: One thing <a href="https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/the-prophet-of-the-revolt">I asked Martin Gurri about</a> is how is it that a lot of these movements, unlike previous revolutionary movements, didn't quite congeal into any sort of lasting institutional change. The classic example is Occupy Wall Street and to a lesser extent the </strong><em><strong>Gilets Jaunes</strong></em><strong> which haven't really done anything in the political space. Arguably the only counter example is Spain with Podemos…</strong></p><p>In Spain, the group just broke off. They just said, we're gonna form a political party. And that's it. </p><p>If you skimmed my book, my theory there is that these movements look like past movements, in that they have these big massive street marches. But you're looking at something different, right? So if you look at a past big march, …</p></div></div>

                    <p>250+ Developers, SREs, DevOps, Architects and Product Managers have spoken: they struggle with releasing microservices into production. It remains a costly, manual, error-prone and nail-biting task for software teams. In our report we dive into challenges, trends and opportunities for improvement when it comes to releasing and validating software in production. </p><p>The survey spotlights the stark challenges SMBs and enterprises are facing as they pursue their cloud, Kubernetes and microservices journey. The need for release automation increases as systems become more complex (dependencies, highly distributed, different release frequencies) and the pressure from the business to release software faster (and more frequently) is higher than ever.</p><h3 id="kubernetes-and-microservices-have-become-mainstream">Kubernetes and Microservices Have Become Mainstream</h3><p>72% of participants say that they are using Kubernetes in production today and 16% says that they are evaluating or planning to use Kubernetes. Microservices are even more popular. 81% of participants say that they are using microservices in production today and 14% says they have plans to use microservices.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 1000w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Screenshot-2021-01-26-at-17.01.14.png 1001w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://vamp.io/state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021"><strong>Download the full report State of Cloud-Native Release Orchestration here.</strong></a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="majority-is-still-using-high-risk-release-strategies">Majority Is Still Using High-Risk Release Strategies</h3><p>Releasing in production is the process of taking running code and making it “live” and accessible to users, in a predictable and repeatable way. It's about paying particular attention to ensure that releasing a new version doesn’t result in a worse experience for your users. 86% of participants are still using high-risk release strategies such as rolling update, blue-green and big-bang releases. There is a strong lack of canary releasing capabilities with only 9% of participants using this low-risk release strategy. Canary releasing limits the number of users exposed to a bad release (known as limiting the blast radius) by gradually rolling out a new version of a service to a small, representative subgroup of <em><em>real</em></em> user traffic before rolling it out to the entire user base.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/release-strategy-image.png 723w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="release-validation-and-rollbacks-remain-a-manual-time-consuming-task">Release Validation and Rollbacks Remain A Manual, Time-Consuming Task</h3><p>Release validation is the process of making sure that released software that’s running in production is meeting the requirements in terms of performance, quality, customer experience and business KPIs. On average it takes 2.2 hours with 4 people engaged during the release validation process.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/image-blog.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/image-blog.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/image-blog.png 723w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Rollbacks are a critical part of your release strategy. When implemented right, it creates a safety net to protect your software teams and minimize the impact on the customer experience when issues are starting to occur. 53% of rollbacks are done manually with an average time to rollback of 45 minutes.</p><h3 id="dependency-management-is-the-biggest-challenge-when-it-comes-to-releasing-microservices">Dependency Management Is The Biggest Challenge When It Comes To Releasing Microservices</h3><p>The report revealed that dependency management is the biggest challenge when it comes to releasing microservices in production. Twenty percent of respondents struggle with dependency management, 14% struggle with internal processes and communication, and 10% find validating changing and testing microservices a challenge.</p><h3 id="the-state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021">The State of Cloud-Native Release Orchestration 2021</h3><p>This blog only scratches the surface of The State of Cloud-Native Release Orchestration, which dives into further topics including release metrics, business drivers to go Cloud-Native, most used monitoring tools and where companies are focussing on when it comes to improvements across the software delivery process in 2021. <a href="https://vamp.io/state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021">Download the full research report for free</a> and share with interested colleagues.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Group-70-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Group-70-1.png 600w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Group-70-1.png 1000w, https://blog.vamp.io/content/images/2021/01/Group-70-1.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://vamp.io/state-of-cloud-native-release-orchestration-2021"><strong>Download the full research report for free here.</strong></a></figcaption></figure>

January 26, 2021 | https://swagitda.com/blog/posts/security-decision-trees-with-graphviz/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://swagitda.com/blog/posts/security-decision-trees-with-graphviz/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>In the recently published <a href="https://www.verica.io/sce-book/">“Security Chaos Engineering” e-book</a>, one of the chapters I wrote covers attacker math and the power of decision trees to guide more pragmatic threat modelling. This post will walk through creating the example decision tree from the e-book using <a href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> and a .DOT file.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Using this as a reference, you can extrapolate this process into a pattern to inform saner security prioritization during the design phase of the product lifecycle. I won’t cover how to populate your own decision tree in this post since that is already covered in the e-book, which is immediately available at your fingertips for the delectable price of free.</p>
<p>As an apéritif, here’s the end result towards which we’ll be building:</p>
<p><img src="https://swagitda.com/blog/img/graphviz/attack-tree-15.png" alt="The final decision tree for threat modeling an S3 bucket containing sensitive data"></p>
<h2 id="a-brief-intro-on-graphviz">A brief intro on Graphviz</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, Graphviz is a graph visualization tool. It is open source, which was especially compelling as I tried out various graphing tools for the decision tree use case because I am a ho for not spending money.</p>
<p>Graphviz takes descriptions of graphs in text form and converts them into a visual (like an image or PDF). I found that the default styling options for Graphviz can quickly look like a hybrid of the infamous <a href="https://twitter.com/defensecharts">defense charts</a> or the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/graphic-design-is-my-passion">“graphic design is my passion” meme</a>. However, these style deficiencies are balanced by the ease of editing the relationships represented in the graph – an issue I previously found tedious when using GUI-based tools.</p>
<p>The textual descriptions of the graph are written using the <a href="https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html">DOT language</a> (and thereby saved as a .DOT file). I personally found it quite intuitive, though, as always, your mileage may vary.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-decision-tree">Building the decision tree</h2>
<p>For those of you who haven’t read the report yet (reminder: <a href="https://www.verica.io/sce-book/">it’s free</a>), let’s set some background context on this example.</p>
<p>Organizations often store important content in cloud storage buckets. In this example, our imaginary organization wants to store customer video recordings in an S3 bucket. As the product and engineering teams think through the design of this project, they want to avoid bad things happening to the project that could cost money (whether via downtime or compliance fines) or time (which is also money)<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The (rather obvious) way attackers win is by successfully accessing the video recordings in the S3 bucket. Thus, the decision tree shows the potential paths attackers can take, including attacker actions performed in response to defensive actions or mitigations, to reach the goal of accessing that S3 bucket.</p>
<p>The branches of the tree are oriented from the lowest cost paths to attackers (on the left) to the most expensive attacker paths (on the right). The lowest cost path for attackers is generally the one with zero defensive mitigations in place, what I <a href="https://swagitda.com/blog/posts/on-yolosec-and-fomosec/">affectionately call “yolosec."</a> The highest cost path for attackers usually involves finding and exploiting zero day vulnerabilities or performing upstream supply chain attacks<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If you want to understand more about the decision tree architecture, I entreat you yet again to <a href="https://www.verica.io/sce-book/">download the Security Chaos Engineering report</a>.</p>
<h2 id="step-1---defining-the-basic-nodes">Step 1 - Defining the basic nodes</h2>
<p>The most basic security decision tree will have two common states: Reality (the starting node from which all others descend)<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and Attackers Win (the ending node reflecting attackers accomplishing their goal).<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>All the branches on the tree – reflecting different cost paths – will end up connecting the Reality and Attackers Win nodes in some fashion.</p>
<p>Let’s define these states in a .dot file (I named mine <code>sce-tree.dot</code>). We’re going to be using a <em>digraph</em>, which is short for “directed graph.” Directed graphs show one-way relationships, whereas undirected graphs show symmetrical relationships.</p>
<p>Your initial code thus looks like:</p>
<pre><code>digraph {
	reality
	attack_win 
}
</code></pre><p><code>reality</code> and <code>attack_win</code> are our first two nodes. We don’t have any attributes for them yet (styling will <a href="#step-8---beautifying-the-graph">come later</a>), so it looks pretty plain.</p>
<p>In this example, we know that the asset we’re threat modelling is the S3 bucket with video recordings, so we can apply a label to the <code>attack_win</code> node saying as much. That way, when the graph is visualized, the node will read as “Access video recordings in S3 bucket” rather than “attack_win”.</p>
<p>To create this label, we add brackets after the relevant node to contain the attribute <code>label="Access video recordings in S3 bucket"</code>. There are a <a href="https://graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html">bunch of attributes</a> you can assign to nodes (like styling), but we’ll cover more of those later.</p>
<p>For now, the foundation for our threat model decision tree looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>digraph {
	reality [ label="Reality" ]
	attack_win [ label="Access video recordings in S3 bucket" ]
}
</code></pre><h2 id="step-2---creating-the-first-attack-node">Step 2 - Creating the first attack node</h2>
<p>The first branch in the decision tree should represent the lowest cost attack path. In the example from <a href="https://www.verica.io/sce-book/">the SCE report</a>, the branch barely involves an attack – it assumes #yolosec, representing a reality in which you’ve allowed crawling on your sitemap, enabling cache APIs (like the Wayback machine) to create caches of the bucket’s contents.</p>
<p>This means our first attack node is actually more of a state of being. The only attacker action is to access this API cache, for which we will create a new node:</p>
<pre><code>digraph {
	// base nodes
	reality [ label="Reality" ]
	attack_win [ label="Access video recordings in S3 bucket" ]

	// attack nodes
	attack_1 [ label="API cache (e.g. Wayback Machine)" ]
}
</code></pre><p>You have a few options for how you want to define the nodes in your decision tree. Above, I defined the node as <code>attack_1</code>, since I personally find it easier to keep track of attack (and defense) actions sequentially. However, you can also define the nodes more explicitly, such as <code>api_cache</code>, like so:</p>
<pre><code>	// attack nodes
	api_cache [ label="API cache (e.g. via Wayback machine)" ]
	toothbrush_0day [ label="0day in your electric toothbrush" ]
	planet_hax [ label="Hack the planet!"]
}
</code></pre><p>You can also use letters, like <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, etc., but I personally find it crude and harder to follow relative to the more descriptive options as the tree gets more complex.</p>
<p>You’ll also note I’ve commented the heading <code>// attack nodes</code>. I find it easier to separate out attack vs. defense nodes, especially when it comes to styling (as we’ll see first in <a href="#step-6---differentiating-between-attack--defense-nodes">step 6</a>). Another option is to organize your nodes within the .dot file by branch, such as:</p>
<pre><code>digraph {
	// base nodes
	reality [ label="Reality" ]
	attack_win [ label="Access video recordings in S3 bucket" ]

	// branch 1
	attack_1 [ label="API cache (e.g. via Wayback machine)" ]
	defense_1 [ label="#yolosec" ]

	// branch 2
	attack_2 [ label="0day in your electric toothbrush" ]
	defense_2 [ label="roll over and play dead" ]
}
</code></pre><p>Whatever your preference, just make sure you’re consistent as you continue to build out the tree. Also note that Graphviz does <em>not</em> warn you if there are duplicate nodes, so choose whichever organization option will minimize the probability of you creating duplicates.</p>
<h2 id="step-3---creating-the-first-branch-edges">Step 3 - Creating the first branch edges</h2>
<p>Because I’m impatient and maybe you are, too, let’s work towards visualizing this first branch so we can see something tangible from our efforts thus far. This means we need to create the <em>edges</em> for the first branch.</p>
<p>Edges are the connectors between nodes. Because our decision trees are causal diagrams, we’ll be using the <code>-&gt;</code> edge (i.e. arrowhead edge) to represent a directional flow of action.</p>
<p>In the case of this first branch, we start from the reality node, which connects to the #yolosec state of an API cache existing, which leads to attackers successfully accessing the bucket data (and thus winning). In our .dot file, these edges will be defined like this:</p>
<pre><code>digraph {
	// base nodes
	reality [ label="Reality" ]
	attack_win [ label="Access video recordings in S3 bucket" ]

	// attack nodes
	attack_1 [ label="API cache (e.g. Wayback Machine)" ]

	// branch 1 edges
	reality -&gt; attack_1
	attack_1 -&gt; attack_win
}
</code></pre><p>If you want to highlight what a snafu the API cache is, you can even add a “#yolosec” label (via <code>xlabel=</code>) to the edge:</p>
<pre><code>reality -&gt; attack_1 [ xlabel="#yolosec" ]
attack_1 -&gt; attack_win
</code></pre><h2 id="step-4---visualizing-the-first-branch">Step 4 - Visualizing the first branch</h2>
<p>Now that we have the necessary nodes and edges for our first branch, let’s visualize it! Spoiler alert: without any styling, it’s not going to look too pretty.</p>
<p>I find a PDF to be the most digestible format for decision trees, since it allows better zooming and panning than an image (like a .png). However, for obvious reasons, I’ll be using .png’s to illustrate the results of each command throughout this post.</p>
<p>To create a PDF of our decision tree thus far, we can use the command:
<code>dot -Tpdf sce-tree.dot -o attack-tree.pdf</code></p>
<p><img src="https://swagitda.com/blog/img/graphviz/attack-tree-01.png" alt="First branch of our decision tree"></p>
<p>That is super hideous! But we successfully visualized that a reality in which an API cache of our video recordings is available leads to attackers winning with minimal effort (with the #yolosec tag for extra flair).</p>
<h2 id="step-5---filling-out-another-branch">Step 5 - Filling out another branch</h2>
<p>Now it’s time to add another branch. This will involve creating new attack nodes, defense nodes, and edges between them.</p>
<p>Because we learned our lesson on the dangers of #yolosec, we know that we should implement the mitigation of disallowing crawling on our site maps. This will be our first defense node:</p>
<pre><code>digraph {
	// base nodes
	reality [ label="Reality" ]
	attack_win [ label="Access video recordings in S3 bucket (attackers win)" ]

	// attack nodes
	attack_1 [ label="API cache (e.g. Wayback Machine)" ]

	// defense nodes
	defense_1 [ label="Disallow crawling on site maps" ]

	// branch 1 edges
	reality -&gt; attack_1 [ xlabel="#yolosec" ]
	attack_1 -&gt; attack_win
}
</code></pre><p>As discussed in <a href="https://www.verica.io/sce-book/">the SCE report</a>, we next need to think about how an attacker will respond to our mitigations (what is known as “belief prompting”). The easiest thing an attacker can do next, if an API cache isn’t available, is searching public buckets to see if the target data is accessible. This will be our second node among our attack nodes:</p>
<pre><code>// attack nodes
attack_1 [ label="API cache (e.g. Wayback Machine)" ]
attack_2 [ label="AWS public buckets search" ]
</code></pre><p>We will again …</p></div></div>

					<div><p>Bellinzona, 25.01.2021 – The Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB; Bellinzona, Switzerland), affiliated to the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) developed a second-generation ‘double antibody’ that protects from SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, and all its tested variants. It also prevents the virus from mutating to resist the therapy.</p><p>Antibody-based immunotherapy was already shown to be effective against COVID-19 but faces two main obstacles: it needs to work against the circulating viral variants; it must prevent formation of new variants, that can rapidly ensue via a mechanism similar to that leading to antibiotic resistant bacteria. We solved the problem by joining two natural antibodies into a single artificial molecule, called ‘bispecific antibody’, that targets two independent viral sites simultaneously.</p><p>Pre-clinical trials showed that this bispecific antibody potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, including the recent UK one circulating in Switzerland and Europe with increased spread. The bispecific, but not first-generation antibodies, prevents the virus from changing its structure to evade therapy. The high bispecific potency and its overall characteristics make it an ideal candidate for human clinical trials, with good chances of employment both for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.</p><p>“We exploited our knowledge of the molecular structure and biochemical traits of the virus to fuse together two human antibodies, obtaining a single bispecific molecule simultaneously attacking the virus in two independent sites critical for infectivity”, said <strong>Luca Varani</strong>, group leader at the IRB and author of the scientific work. “Supercomputing simulations allowed us to refine and validate the bispecific antibody design, which was later produced and tested in the laboratory. Although the virus can mutate and escape from the attack of a single first-generation antibody, we have shown that it cannot do so against the double action of the bispecific’.</p><p><strong>Davide Robbiani</strong>, IRB director and co-author of the scientific work, commented:” IRB and Ticino consolidate their position among the world leaders in antibody discovery and development, especially against emerging and neglected infectious diseases. Despite the limited resources, in comparison to big-pharma, we achieved our goals in just a few months’.</p><p>“A single injection of the bispecific antibody provides instantaneous protection against the disease in pre-clinical trials. The antibody effectively reduces viral burden in the lungs and mitigates inflammation typical of COVID-19”, said <strong>Daniel Ruzek</strong> from the Czech Academy of Sciences who led the antibody pre-clinical testing.</p><p>The bispecific antibody was developed within the <strong>research consortium ATAC, funded <a href="https://www.irb.usi.ch/news/covid-19-irb-receives-eu-emergency-research-funding/">last April</a> from the European Commission</strong> in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Other members include San Matteo Hospital in Pavia (Italy), Karolinska Institutet (Sweden), Braunschweig University (Germany) and the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission. Collaboration with Rockfeller University and the Czech Academy of Science was instrumental to prove the bispecific efficacy.</p><p>The Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB) in Bellinzona, affiliated to the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI) performed basic research for more than 20 years. Financed by private and public institutions, and by competitive grants, the IRB currently hosts 13 research groups and 125 researchers that investigate the mechanisms of host defence against infectious agents, cancer and degenerative diseases. Currently, the research activities extend beyond immunology to include the fields of DNA repair, rare diseases, structural and cell biology. With more than 720 publications in leading scientific journals, the IRB has gained an international reputation as a centre of excellence in human immunology. <a href="http://www.irb.usi.ch/">www.irb.usi.ch</a></p><p>More <a href="https://covidantibodytherapy.info/">info</a> on the ATAC project </p><p>This work is presently under review and has been posted on the pre-print server bioRxiv:</p><p><strong>Bispecific antibody prevents SARS-CoV-2 escape and protects mice from disease</strong></p><p>Raoul De Gasparo, Mattia Pedotti, Luca Simonelli, Petr Nickl, Frauke Muecksch, Julio C.

		<p>It should come as no surprise that we here at Plex are media lovers. Consummate curators of all that streamy goodness. Voracious imbibers at the fount of all content. Okay, gross, but you get the point. Anyway, every so often an armchair Reddit philosopher comes forth to question some basic truths: “What exactly is the nature of ‘Media’?” they ask. And “How can Plex help us media lovers more fully consummate our curationship?” Okay, sorry, gross again. But it’s a fair question, and one that deserves a little more attention.</p>
<p>Not to date ourselves, but quite a few of us are products of the ‘80s and ‘90s. And when we think about the media that shaped our childhoods and young adult lives, there was one thing that defined us and made it clear that even though we were weird, at the very least we weren’t weird alone. That’s right: <em>stamp collections!</em></p>
<p>Oh wait. We meant VIDEO GAMES.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SYepu_5oSOc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>In the beginning…</h3>
<p>The genesis of Plex saw us casting a disdainful eye over shelves of CDs, DVDs, and random files strewn over hard drives; we knew there had to be a better way to centrally organize and curate our media collections. A safe haven free from scratches and <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bewaring-of-the-green/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">green markers</a>. A place where we could Marie Kondo until every last poster and background was perfect, and then explore and play from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>But there was one category left on that media shelf, gathering dust. It was the old plastic cartridges for our beloved gaming consoles of yore. After all, in the years since our youth, fellow curators have managed to amass rich archives of gorgeous metadata for games, and the retro gaming community truly does run deep. It’s a fantastic movement, and after some soul searching and spiritual walkabouts, the answer arrived: this media belongs inside Plex!</p>
<p>We’ve actually kicked the idea around for years, and given that over the last year we’ve been looking for new ways to entertain and distract ourselves, we decided to finally make it happen. And we gotta say, the results are super cool! It’s so fun to see a collection of ROMs rendered as a Plex library with all the power of filtering, searching, and beautiful details pages, but of course that’s only half the picture…</p>

<h3>Let there be light!</h3>
<p>Video and audio streaming have always been our specialty. We’re blessed with some amazing engineers (among the best in the world!) working on this, and in general we’ve been laser focused on making that experience better.</p>
<p>However, over time we’ve seen some truly impressive developments in interactive game streaming tech. Please allow us to introduce our new partner <a href="https://parsec.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parsec</a>: With their underlying low-latency streaming technology, it was suddenly possible to offer <em>fully playable</em> game libraries within Plex.</p>
<h3>Let the library teem with games</h3>




<p>We’ve also partnered with the most hallowed name in retro games: Atari. With them on board as a partner we’re able to fully license a catalog of classic titles right out of the box. We’re talking Centipede. We’re talking Lunar Lander. We’re talking Motor Psycho!</p>

<p>Look. This effort is real, but if we’re honest it was conceived by a few passionate Plex Labs rats over scorpion bowls at <a href="https://www.mamasfishhouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mama’s</a>. For now, we’ve convinced the powers-that-be to let us run with it, but we know it’s far from done and we see it as a kind of internal Kickstarter-type project.

<p>There are a few limitations you should be aware of: For now, the server only works on Windows and macOS (sorry, Parsec doesn’t offer their libraries on Linux or other platforms currently, meaning it is not available for servers running on Linux, NAS devices, or NVIDIA SHIELD); and gameplay is restricted to Android (mobile and TV), iOS, tvOS, and the Chrome web browser.</p>
<p>To get started, grab the latest Plex Media Server, and create a new Games library, just like you would for any of your existing media types. We’re working on relaxing these limitations, but for now they’re real.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><blockquote>
<p>Today we announced our <a href="https://vectorized.io/press/2021-01-26">Series A Financing</a> to enable us <a href="https://vectorized.io/cloud">to expand our cloud service</a> (sign up for early preview!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the last two years we have been working towards The <em>Intelligent Data API</em>: a way to turn data streams into data products. </p>
<p>Today, Jan 26th, 2021 the world is very different from what it was 10+ years ago, when the majority of data streaming technologies were invented. A decade ago, the bottleneck was disk- ‘ye olde spinning hard drives. The slowness of spinning disks dominated how storage systems were built, because a single misstep would cause your users to experience massive delays. Today’s hardware is like the new Avengers comics, every part is so vastly improved it is hardly recognizable - with modern disks being the new Captain Marvel, 1000x faster. </p>
<p>Over this same decade, we saw the rising need for enterprises to react in real time to the ever increasing data volume, velocity and variety. It was us, consumers, using a phone application anywhere in the world, and being able to hail a cab without speaking the foreign language. Or us, consumers, purchasing a movie on a transatlantic flight and expecting that our credit card would detect a fraudulent transaction due to a double charge, even if it happened mid air at 560 miles per hour all while crossing country boundaries. These expectations have, in a transitive sense, created a renaissance in the real-time infrastructure that powers these businesses. Whether you are combining taxi-driver demand, customer presence with surge pricing or merging 25 different data sources to detect a fraudulent transaction, customers expect you to react to events now in real time.</p>
<p>However, once you decide to move your infrastructure towards an event-driven paradigm, you will soon find yourself drowning in complexity on how to actually operationalize open source components at scale. That’s why we created the Intelligent Data API, a developer centric environment for transforming realtime streams into products, with new primitives for unifying historical and real time data as well as modern day store-procedures for streaming.</p>
<h2 id="The-Intelligent-Data-API-has-3-parts">The Intelligent Data API has 3 parts.<a href="#The-Intelligent-Data-API-has-3-parts" aria-label="The Intelligent Data API has 3 parts permalink"></a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Compatibility with the largest data streaming ecosystem (Kafka-API)</li>
<li>Unification of historical and real time data (Shadow Indexing)</li>
<li>Stateful stored-procedures for streaming data (WASM)</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/c4248dc50a7bfc9adb47d3d24b393bef/ida.svg" alt="ida"></p>
<h3 id="Part-1-Compatibility-with-the-largest-data-streaming-ecosystem---The-Kafka-API">Part 1: Compatibility with the largest data streaming ecosystem - The Kafka API<a href="#Part-1-Compatibility-with-the-largest-data-streaming-ecosystem---The-Kafka-API" aria-label="Part 1 Compatibility with the largest data streaming ecosystem   The Kafka API permalink"></a></h3>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/b75f9269fcb81f00a2409b2157861d4b/kafka-compat.svg" alt="compat"></p>
<p>Let’s be clear, engineers absolutely love the Kafka-API. What they love is the fact that they can take TensorFlow, Spark Streaming, and ElasticSearch and have a sophisticated fraud detection pipeline. They love the empowerment of the millions of lines of code the community has built over the years, allowing them to build entire products overnight.  It is no secret, however, that to run and operate Kafka and Zookeeper at scale requires a team of dedicated distributed systems engineers, not working on product features, but managing infrastructure. </p>
<p>Our first step towards building the Intelligent Data API was first to build the <a href="https://vectorized.io/blog/validating-consistency/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">most reliable</a> Kafka-API compatible streaming platform in the world. One that would require <em>no code changes to existing enterprise applications</em> and a platform that was able to squeeze every single ounce of performance out of modern hardware. </p>
<p>What’s more is we wanted to build this in the open under a <a href="https://vectorized.io/blog/open-source/" target="_self" rel="nofollow">Free and Source Available License</a> - BSL - taking inspiration from our friends at CockroachDB. Redpanda is a new storage engine with one licensing limitation: we are the only company allowed to offer <a href="https://vectorized.io/redpanda" target="_self" rel="nofollow">Redpanda</a> as a SaaS. Other than that, we wanted to empower every single Kafka-API user to build upon a new storage engine optimized for the new world of superscalar CPUs, 100Gbps NICs and NVMe access times in the low double digit microseconds. </p>
<h3 id="Part-2-Unification-of-historical-and-real-time-data-Shadow-Indexing">Part 2: Unification of historical and real time data (Shadow Indexing)<a href="#Part-2-Unification-of-historical-and-real-time-data-Shadow-Indexing" aria-label="Part 2 Unification of historical and real time data Shadow Indexing permalink"></a></h3>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/abad95a3c37a96b21a3eedc63a24c07b/shadow-index.svg" alt="compat"></p>
<p>Amazon S3 officially launched in 2006. 15 years later and trillions of objects stored, we now have reliable infinite storage. This cheap, infinitely scalable storage is what people call the Data Lake. Think of it like your uncle Larry’s doomsday basement. You put everything in it, with no structure, hoping that one day you can take advantage of it (Larry, if you are reading this, no shame!). In more formal terms, it is a central repository of data with an Object-based API that is infinitely scalable. For developers it provides a simple way to achieve disaster recovery. Within seconds of uploading a file to S3 you get eleven-nines of durability. That’s 99.999999999% probability that after storing 10’000 objects you might lose one in 10 million years. It is an engineering marvel in my opinion. </p>
<p>Redpanda eliminates the need for disaster recovery by integrating with these infinitely scalable storage systems. Instead of deleting data locally, it will push the old segments onto S3 and fetch them when clients need them. On the surface this sounds like the obvious solution in a cloud native world, but what it does for enterprises is that it unifies the way you access and manage both historical and real-time data without changing a single line of code in your application!</p>
<p>We call this feature Shadow Indexing because it doesn’t keep the historical data on local disks, instead it keeps a location reference of how and where to fetch the data should a Kafka-API client request it. What enterprises are the most excited about, however, is the fact that you can spin up a new Redpanda cluster and replay petabytes of data to retrain your machine learning model without affecting your production cluster or changing any code. In a way, this presents a true disaggregation of compute and store for streaming data. </p>
<h3 id="Part-3-Ship-code-to-data">Part 3: Ship code to data<a href="#Part-3-Ship-code-to-data" aria-label="Part 3 Ship code to data permalink"></a></h3>
<p><img src="https://vectorized.io/58597a221eeb649d195cd813c95b19ca/code-to-data.svg" alt="compat"></p>
<p>As data accumulates, it builds sort of a gravitational pull, attracting applications to interact with it, in turn generating more data. The more data is collected, the stronger the pull for other applications to interact with it, ad infinitum. If you are a developer working with real-time data streaming applications you understand that as soon as a component touches Kafka or in our case Redpanda, the higher the propensity for applications interacting with it to also integrate with the Kafka-API. In fact, the system was explicitly designed from day-0 to be a way to decouple multiple disparate systems and API’s by simply using the Kafka-API. Redpanda, through the Kafka-API, is a viral primitive, one that is scalable, secure, fast, durable, replayable and integrates with just about every single other data framework in existence today. </p>
<p>Instead of fighting data gravity, Redpanda inverts the typical paradigm of sending data to compute frameworks like Spark Streaming, etc and instead allows developers to ship code to the storage engine. At the lowest level we use WebAssembly, an intermediary language that allows software engineers to write and edit code in their favorite programming language to perform one-shot transformations, like guaranteeing GDPR compliance by removing personal information or to provide filtering and simple aggregation functions. Think of these transformations as the modern day stored-procedures for streaming data.</p>

<p>One of the reasons we are developing Redpanda in the open is because we believe in the power of community. Today, we are happy to announce that we will be releasing our WASM engine as part of the BSL license on GitHub. While the Kafka API is ready for production, and we hope you put us through the paces, Shadow Indexing and WASM are still in experimental mode but we invite you to try them! </p>
<p>Please join us on <a href="https://vectorized.io/slack" target="_self" rel="nofollow">Slack</a> or if this is the kind of technology you want to hack on, we are <a href="https://vectorized.io/careers" target="_self" rel="nofollow">hiring</a>.  From all of us at Vectorized, we hope to see you soon! </p></section></div></div>]]>

<ul>
<li>some browsers (Chrome) only divulge the local IP via WebRTC over HTTPS but some of our attacks require HTTP so we first redirect to the HTTPS version of the attack software to extract the local IP</li>
<li>we then redirect to the HTTP version with the local IP included in the URL if we were able to obtain it to bypass other cross-origin protection mechanisms (the <code>.local</code> mDNS/Bonjour address presented will not be useful for the attack)</li>
</ul>

</ul></li>
<li>large UDP beacon sent from browser via WebRTC TURN authentication mechanism to non-standard port to attacker's server to force IP fragmentation with TURN <code>username</code> field stuffed

<li>we perform a similar attack as our TCP segmentation, but over UDP as IP fragmentation will occur and provide different values than TCP segmentation</li>
<li>victim MTU size, IP header size, IP packet size, TCP header size, TCP segment sizes detected by server and sent back to victim's browser, used later for packet stuffing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(v1) "SIP packet" in new hidden form generated, containing internal IP to trigger Application Level Gateway connection tracking

<li>victim NAT rewrites SIP or H.323 packet, replacing internal IP with public IP, hinting to attacker exploit was successful</li>
<li>(v2) as H.323 call forwarding can direct to any other IP, packet can contain any internal IP of any other host on the victim's network, triggering the NAT to port forward to any system on the network</li>
<li>even if victim NAT normally rewrites source ports, the ALG will still be forced to port forward to the attacker's port of choice as it believes victim machine (or other machine on the network, entirely determined by attacker) opened that port and attacker sees new source port in arriving SIP/H.323 packet </li>
<li><b>attacker can now bypass victim NAT and connect directly back to any port on any machine on the network, exposing previously protected/hidden services and systems</b></li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>to investigate...perhaps by you?</i>
<ul>
  <li>non-malicious usage: this technique essentially gives browsers full TCP and UDP socket capability to communicate to any protocol locally on the system; the connection can be abstracted through a cloud server that connects back but the browser just talks to the cloud server as if it's the socket and makes browsers much more powerful to communicate on non-web-friendly protocols</li>
  <li>if testing in a virtual machine (VM) using shared networking (used to protect a host from attacks by routing it through the host, not letting it directly onto the network), if the packets make it out, the parent host machine is where the ports end up getting opened, not the VM ;)</li>
  <li>IP fragmentation allows full control of all data in the IP data section, meaning full control of the <b>UDP header</b>, including source/dest ports in the overflowed packet...what else could this abuse?</li>
</ul></li>

<h2 id="network-address-translation-nat">Network Address Translation (NAT)</h2>

<p>We use NATs (Network Address Translation) for several reasons. The most useful feature of NAT is that it allows a single public IP address to be shared among multiple systems. It does this by creating a local network, providing local IP addresses to all machines that connect, and when one of those systems reaches out to the Internet, it rewrites packets going out to use the public IP so responses come back to the NAT, and vice versa, rewriting destination IP to specific client's IP. </p>

<p>It's the responsibility of the NAT to differentiate connections to the same addresses/ports (google.com:443) from internal hosts as ultimately their outbound port, destination ip and source ip will all be the same. If two different internal peers attempt to connect from the same source port, modern NATs will alter one of the source ports (some networks do this to all TCP/UDP source ports).</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samyk/slipstream/main/img/lan.png" alt="NAT"></p>

<h3 id="connection-tracking">Connection Tracking</h3>

<p>From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netfilter">Wikipedia à la Wikiwand</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>One of the important features built on top of the Netfilter 
framework is connection tracking. Connection tracking 
allows the kernel to keep track of all logical network 
connections or sessions, and thereby relate all of the packets
which may make up that connection. NAT relies on this 
information to translate all related packets in the same way, 
and iptables can use this information to act as a stateful 
firewall.</code></pre></div>

<p>If a machine behind your NAT sends a packet out and your router expects the remote host may respond, it keeps track of information, specifically the source and destination ports, source and destination IP addresses, and your internal IP, then returns any packets matching it back to your internal IP.</p>

<p>If another host on your LAN attempts to make the same connection with the same source and destination ports + IPs, your NAT wouldn't be able to discriminate it (the source IPs are different on your LAN but are rewritten to the same public IP on the WAN side), so it alters the source port, but rewrites it when sending back to you.</p>

<h3 id="application-level-gateway">Application Level Gateway</h3>

<p>ALGs allow NAT to track a multi-port protocol like FTP to go out from your system to an FTP server, then track when you request a file to be sent to your internal IP on a specific port, the ALG can rewrite the packet to include your public IP, then forward the FTP's server connection back to you. Had it not rewritten your IP, the FTP server would try to connect back to you on your internal IP (or not try at all if it expects the source IP to be the same as the signaling connection).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>New research gives patients with <span>PTSD</span> the power to restore their own patterns of brain activity</p><div>
    <div>
          <div property="content:encoded"><p><strong>LHSC: University Hospital&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In a new study at Lawson Health Research Institute (Lawson) and the University of Geneva, researchers showed that a technique called brain training can be used to restore patterns of brain activity and reduce symptoms of hyperarousal in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (<span>PTSD</span>).</p>
<p>Individuals with <span>PTSD</span> often experience more random patterns of brain activity. A leading symptom of <span>PTSD</span> is hyperarousal, which is associated with defensive responses to stress or triggers. A technique to restore patterns of brain activity to a more balanced order and reduce hyperarousal therefore holds promise as a potential treatment.</p>
<p>With the brain training technique, also called neurofeedback, patients exercise their own brain activity through a circular neurofeedback loop, which acts as a mirror to display brain activity. This is done through a brain-computer interface that records brain signals through sensors on the scalp. Since brain activity is displayed on screen, users can complete brain training exercises in ways similar to a gym workout.</p>
<p>In this study, led by Lawson’s Dr. Ruth Lanius, the goal was for patients with <span>PTSD</span> to reduce the intensity of the brain’s dominant brain wave - the alpha rhythm. Patients used neurofeedback to visualize their brain activity as they played a simple video training game. The 30-minute game consisted of a space ship displayed on a starry background. When patients were successful in reducing their alpha rhythm, the space ship moved forward.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“Patients reported reducing the dominant brain wave by concentrating their attention towards the visuals on screen. This seemed to propel the spaceship forward,” said Dr. Ruth Lanius, a scientist at Lawson and a psychiatrist at London Health Sciences Centre. “This is consistent with prior research that suggests the alpha rhythm is reduced with increased processing of attention.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers were surprised to find the reduction in alpha rhythm resulted in lasting changes. After the initial reduction, the alpha rhythm rebounded, or increased, to levels matching those found in healthy individuals. Patterns of brain activity were restored to a more proportional balance that is associated with healthy brain function.</p>
<p>Following&nbsp;these sessions, patients experienced a decrease in hyperarousal. “This is very significant. Neurofeedback may give patients the power to restore their patterns of brain activity and improve symptoms of psychiatric illness,” said Dr. Lanius, who is also a professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Western University’s Schulich School of Medicine <span>&amp;</span> Dentistry. “This means that existing mechanisms of the human brain may be harnessed for therapy, providing an alternative to pharmaceutical and brain stimulation therapies.”</p>
<p>Dr. Lanius and her collaborators are currently continuing this research with a larger group of patients with <span>PTSD</span>. Patients in this study will complete multiple sessions of brain training to determine whether positive effects can be sustained long-term.</p>
<p>The study, “<a href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/09/12/cercor.bhw285.abstract" rel="nofollow">Neurofeedback tunes scale-free dynamics in spontaneous brain activity</a>”, was published in the journal <em>Cerebral Cortex</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>20,000 had died as a result of the tsunami by the time I spoke with Joi. Three reactor cores had melted. Unknown to most at the time, sixteen radioactive <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49379-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plumes</a> were sweeping across the Fukushima countryside. Families across the nation, some being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK253930/table/tab_6-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relocated</a> and all glued to the news, were asking: Are we safe? Should we stay indoors? Can our children drink the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3701991/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">milk</a>?</p>
<p>There were no clear answers, but there was plenty of speculation. Datasets available to the government and power company were withheld from the public. Scientists across the world, eager to evaluate the situation, were left guessing.</p>
<p>That day in March 2011, Joi told me that he and a small cast of characters had assembled a rough plan for <em>Open Global Sensing</em>. I’d just left Microsoft where, in my role as Chief Software Architect, I’d started and nurtured a new product called <em>Azure</em>. “We could use your cloud and data expertise. Will you join us?</p>

<p>A few weeks later 15 of us <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/seanbonner/5629245498/in/album-72157626383390989/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">met</a> in Tokyo, came together around a mission, and set off to Akihabara. Within days, a volunteer’s car had been <a href="https://safecast.org/2011/04/first-safecast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">armed</a> with a laptop, a GPS, and a high-quality Geiger counter. The team began mapping radiation levels and uploading them as CC0-licensed data for all the world to see. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-0434-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Citizens became scientists</a>, and <a href="https://safecast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Safecast</a> was born.</p>

<p>Over 10 years, using more than two thousand sensors, more than ten thousand volunteers have worked to gather a <a href="https://map.safecast.org/?y=37.28&amp;x=139.7&amp;z=8&amp;l=0&amp;m=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapidly growing dataset and map</a> of hundreds of millions of data points. During that time, the team has used commercial IoT technology to create <a href="https://safecast.org/devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ten generations of sensors</a> – some fixed, some mobile. Some measuring radiation, some air quality. Some hard-wired, some solar powered. With support of several <a href="https://safecast.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generous benefactors</a>, Safecast’s citizen scientist volunteers have managed to build one of the largest open environmental datasets in existence.</p>

<p>But gathering that data was far, far too difficult. If we’re to benefit from a world of devices that are cloud-connected from birth, IoT needs a new soul.</p>
<h2 id="surfing-the-public-airwaves">Surfing the Public Airwaves</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I came to believe that the only viable business model for large-scale cellular IoT is the <em>Kindle’s Whispernet</em> model, where the lifetime cost of cellular is simply embedded into the cost of the product.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Low data-rate applications don’t need the complexity of Linux, containers, or edge computing. For these solutions, AI/ML is best done in the cloud, with microcontroller-based device design focused on simplicity, reliability, low power, and low cost.</p>
<p>The earliest Safecast devices recorded their data onto SD cards. We embraced Bluetooth for mobile phone-based upload, and then <a href="https://www.semtech.com/lora/what-is-lora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoRa</a> and <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoRaWAN</a> for fixed location backhaul. LoRa is an amazing technology, and we came close to becoming addicted due to its low power and low cost. But being a global project with a low density of devices, each time we deployed a sensor we ended up needing to build our own network – a consuming undertaking that was greatly complicated by the fact that LoRa chips and concentrators and spectrum rules vary around the world.</p>
<p>The answer, of course, was to use the globally-harmonized public airwaves of cellular.</p>
<p>But what a nightmare! Cellular has huge power draw; it’s a significant challenge for hardware developers to build battery-powered cellular devices. Cellular modems have arcane interfaces and are extremely awkward for developers to deal with. Carriers and cloud providers now (rightfully) require device certificates, TLS, and firmware update, adding even more complexity to the simple task of uploading just a little bit of data.</p>
<p>What’s more, the cellular business model of charging “per month per device” is fundamentally flawed for narrowband cellular IoT, where devices are very high-volume, low-cost, and may even be discarded. Charge the user? Charge the vendor? Charge even when it’s broken? I came to believe that the only viable business model for large-scale cellular IoT is the <em>Kindle’s Whispernet</em> model, where the lifetime cost of cellular is simply embedded into the cost of the product. For the user, <em>it just works</em>.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-data-pump">A Simple Data Pump</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We’re counting on you software folks to solve that problem, Ray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For many applications – including Safecasts’s – all you need is a simple <em>data pump</em>. Take a little bit of data, perhaps hourly or daily, format it in a simple way, like JSON, and deliver it securely to a cloud-based app via REST. Is that too much to ask?</p>
<p>Before investing more time and energy on this problem at Safecast, I began to talk to others in the industry. Does anybody have a simple way of dealing with low-power cellular from a developer perspective? No one did.</p>
<p>Next, I decided to talk with a number of the thousands of commercial and industrial customers I’ve met with over the years. I heard horror stories about how they tried cellular and gave up. Stories of how they tried Wi-Fi, and now want to bail because it’s a complete <a href="https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/a-smart-refrigerator-can-take-down-your-business.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cesspool</a>. To a customer, they were all stories of frustration.</p>
<p>I happen to be very close to the leadership of a few cellular carriers, and so I pressed them: How are you (as an industry) going to realize the promise of cellular if it’s so difficult for developers to use?</p>
<p>Their answer? “We’re counting on you software folks to solve that problem, Ray.”</p>
<p>And so began another journey.</p>
<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Today’s opportunity is not just about improving our own interactions, but in learning how best to collaborate <em>with machines</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In building Lotus Notes, Groove, and Talko, I’ve spent decades of my career building software in the field of <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/computer-supported-cooperative-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer-Supported Cooperative Work</a>. In the soul of that software was the aspiration to improve outcomes by qualitatively improving interactions among co-workers.</p>
<p>Today’s opportunity is not just about improving our own interactions, but in learning how best to collaborate <em>with machines</em>. Distributed networks of sensors can enable us to know what’s happening in our environment; in our fleets; in our patients; in the COVID vaccination delivery chain; in our food supply; in our HVAC systems; at the entrances to our offices.</p>
<p>Sensors and controls will be ubiquitous in business. They should give us greater <em>situational awareness</em> and should empower us to work together more effectively and serve customers more effectively.</p>
<p>In starting and leading Blues Wireless, my objective is to make it possible for every organization to be able to collaborate with machines to improve their business and improve the world, through visibility, transparency, and control.</p>
<p>We’ve built a few new components – the <a href="https://blues.io/products/"><em>Notecard</em></a> and the <a href="https://notehub.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Notehub</em></a> – that have the potential to fundamentally change the game in the cellular world. With its Safecast roots, simplicity and <em>IoT for good</em> are at the soul of the Notecard.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://blues.io/blog/images/notecard.png" alt="Close-up photo of the Notecard."> <figcaption>
            <p>Our first product, the Notecard.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But with my own roots being in the commercial world, they’re packaged it in a form that you can use to embed this <em>cloud data pump</em> in your product. Your machine.</p>
<p>Perhaps something that notifies you when a rodent trap or dumpster needs to be emptied, to keep our alleys clean. Or something that sends an alert when the power goes out on a fridge full of medication. Or something that takes action when a low-income tenant’s home gets too cold.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with fancy expensive devices that do edge computing and local AI, but we love dumb old devices at Blues. We love ‘brownfield’ and we love retrofits. The simpler, the cheaper, the broader, the better.</p>
<p>Because it’s our dream that by monitoring the environment at a personal, grassroots level, we can be better educated and in touch with our earth. We’re committed to help make that happen.</p>
<p>But it’s also our dream that by adding simple inexpensive monitors for our food, our fuel, our fridges, our health, that the benefits of the ‘cloud’ and the ‘edge’ can extend to everyone, including the old, the disadvantaged, and the under-served.</p>
<p>It’s our dream that once you see how easy it is to make your product <em>cloud connected from birth</em>, that this little cloud data pump – the Notecard – might <em>itself</em> turn out to be the soul of a new machine: yours.</p>

    <div id="postcontent">
  <p>Now that many more people are joining <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a>, some interesting new privacy concerns about its contact discovery and notification protocol are popping up. In particular, people are surprised other people that are (no longer) in their contact list can still discover them when the join Signal. Moreover, some people that join Signal are annoyed that other people are automatically notified of this fact.</p>
  <p>Let me be clear: <a href="https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/">Signal makes pretty sure</a> that Signal itself cannot learn who is connected with who. The problem is with the way people expect contact discovery works, and how it actually works. And with a lack of control over how discovery works, and who gets notified of what.</p>
  <p>The way Signal <em>contact discovery</em> works is as follows. When your register, a hash of your phone number is stored by Signal. Every once in a while, your Signal app computes a hash of all phone numbers in your contact list, and sends this list to Signal. Signal compares this list with the list of hashes of known registered users, and tells your app of any matches. The contacts that match are added to the Signal’s own address book.</p>
  <p>This means that if <em>your</em> number is on <em>my</em> contact list, your number will be added to Signal’s own address book on my phone, and I will be able to contact you via Signal. This happens even if <em>my</em> number is (no longer) in your contact list. On top of that, Signal <em>notifies</em> me when a person in my contact list joins Signal (again irrespective of whether I appear in that person’s contact list). This is not necessarily what people expect.</p>
  <p>Some people would only want to be discovered by people that are on their own contact list. And not be unknown people that happen to know their phone number, or by people that they used to know but parted ways with (these could be partners, but also previous colleagues, or patients). Moreover, notification of discovering new contacts should be optional, that is: the person <em>discovered</em> should be able to control whether others are notified of this fact.</p>
  <p>Indeed Signal’s matching process could be made such that people are only notified if <em>both</em> have the other person’s number in the contact list. But note that Signal would be next to unusable if I would not be able to tell at all whether you are on Signal if I want to send you a message with it - if you would be able to block discovery of your number, you would never receive a Signal message. So there is a privacy versus usability trade-off there. It would be good to allow users to choose their own position regarding that trade- off. You might even want to offer users the option to make a selection of their contacts available for discovery, meaning that only selected contacts will ever know that you are on Signal, and can contact you there.</p>
  <p>Regarding notification, note that even if Signal would not notify users of new contacts, users could very easily test whether someone in their contact list is on Signal (by trying to send a message and see what happens). With some clever scripting (malicious) users could easily automate this. But as almost all users will not try this for real, limiting notifications actually matters in practice. Again something that should be implemented.</p>
  <p>Note there are other, more privacy friendly, ways to establish contact and send messages anonymously (note that once you exchange messages the Signal server by necessity learns the social graph). The underlying issue is that all these services use phone numbers as contact points. You’d rather use something more ephemeral to establish contact, something that is not public, and something that you can revoke for particular contacts. See <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2808138.2808142">this paper</a> I wrote five years ago (<a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~jhh/publications/abb-wpes.pdf">open access pdf version</a>).</p>
  <p>(This blog post was based on some Twitter discussions. See <a href="https://twitter.com/DorotheaBaur/status/1349340273357291528">this tweet</a> and all its branches.)</p>
  <p>P.S.: Interestingly enough a matching algorithm that only discovers contacts when both <span><em>A</em></span>’s number is in <span><em>B</em></span>’s list of contacts and vice versa is inherently more privacy friendly.</p>
  <p>Let <span><em>C</em>(<em>A</em>)</span> denote the list of phone numbers on the contact list of <span><em>A</em></span>. Let <span><em>K</em><em>D</em><em>F</em></span> be a key derivation function, i.e.&nbsp;a hash function that takes a considerable time to compute. Because of this, when given <span><em>O</em> = <em>K</em><em>D</em><em>F</em>(<em>I</em>)</span> it is impossible to do a brute force search for <span><em>I</em></span>. But of course you can still test a suspicion for <span><em>I</em></span> to see if <span><em>K</em><em>D</em><em>F</em>(<em>I</em>)</span> matches <span><em>O</em></span>.</p>
  <p>Define <span><em>S</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> to be <span><em>K</em><em>D</em><em>F</em>(<em>A</em>|<em>B</em>)</span>.</p>
  <p>The basic algorithm would run as follows.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Round 1:
  <ul>
  <li>At regular time slots (each day, or week), each device with phone number <span><em>A</em></span> computes <span><em>S</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span>, and sends <span><em>S</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> to the server.</li>
  <li>The server stores these values <span><em>S</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span>.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Round 2:
  <ul>
  <li>When all devices are done executing the first round, each device with phone number <span><em>A</em></span> now computes <span><em>S</em><sub><em>B</em><em>A</em></sub></span>, and sends <span><em>S</em><sub><em>B</em><em>A</em></sub></span> to the server.</li>
  <li>If the value the server now receives is in the database constructed in the first round, it notifies <span><em>A</em></span> of this fact. <span><em>A</em></span> thus discovers <span><em>B</em></span>.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>After these two rounds, the server destroys the database.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If <span><em>A</em></span> discovers <span><em>B</em></span>, this means that <span><em>B</em></span> sent <span><em>S</em><sub><em>B</em><em>A</em></sub></span> in the first round. A also must have sent <span><em>S</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> in the first round. As <span><em>B</em></span> will also send <span><em>S</em><sub><em>A</em><em>B</em></sub></span> in the second round, <span><em>B</em></span> will also discover <span><em>A</em></span>.</p>
  <p>Note that this way it becomes harder for the server to search for users that registered for the service. Instead of trying to brute force search for <span><em>A</em></span> that matches a hash of <span><em>A</em></span>, now the server has to brute force for all possible combinations of <span><em>A</em></span> and <span><em>B</em></span>. Even testing whether a suspicion that <span><em>A</em></span> joined the service becomes harder, because you either have to know a contact <span><em>B</em></span> of <span><em>A</em></span> (and test <span><em>K</em><em>D</em><em>F</em>(<em>A</em>|<em>B</em>)</span>, or brute force this for all possible values of <span><em>B</em></span>.</p>

<p>At the start of December, I switched jobs to a new games company. While I really enjoyed being a lead programmer at my previous company, I found it difficult to combine both my leadership and programming responsibilities. I ended up feeling like I wasn’t doing my best work on either. My calendar often looked like Swiss cheese, with small meetings interspersed throughout my day. I’ve taken a step back on my leadership responsibilities now, so I can focus more on writing code.</p>



<p>But since my new job didn’t start for another six weeks, I decided to run an experiment on myself. I’ve always been curious about whether an 8-hour workday was actually optimal for me. Now that I had no boss to report to and no coworkers to keep in the loop, why not try cutting my work hours in half? My hope was that I would be able to achieve some kind of momentum on my personal project. I’m happy to report this was definitely the case and that I’ve learned a lot, more than can fit in a single blog post!</p>

<p>My game <em>Up There They Love</em> has been in production in some shape or form for almost three years now. While I had always intended for it to be a “forever project”, something that I could always return to when inspiration struck, it also felt kind of stuck in development hell. Games are meant to be played and I never got to the point where players could actually do that.</p>



<p>To explain it briefly, <em>Up There They Love</em> is an adult visual novel combined with a character management sim and a sexy card game. I designed all of the mechanics, programmed the whole game myself, and have done most of the writing. While friends have helped out over the years, this has always been a solo project. And yes, I’m <a href="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/programming/building-a-tech-stack-for-my-visual-novel/">building my own engine</a>.</p>



<p>The state of the game in early December last year was that the character management sim had been (mostly) implemented already, but the visual novel had not received a lot of love and the card game was just an idea; it hadn’t been designed at all.</p>



<p>So now that I had some time between work assignments, I wanted to see how much I could get done on my game if I fully committed to it. Would I be able to implement the core loop of my game and finally get something playable?</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In this three-part series, I will explain some of the strategies I employed during this period and how effective they were for my productivity.</p>







<p>This experiment did not form in a vacuum. I had recently read the book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37880811-make-time">Make Time</a> and I felt highly inspired to try it out. What makes this book so great is that it isn’t about applying One Neat Trick that will instantly fix your entire life but instead asks you to pick a few things that suit your style of working from a list of 80 different tactics.</p>

<p>There were a number of tips that I implemented immediately, but I also wanted to try out a few ideas of my own. Specifically, I wanted to see how far I could get by working very intensely on my game, but for only four hours a day.</p>



<p>I wanted to do all of my work between 8 AM and noon, have lunch, and then do something else for the rest of the day. The idea being that I could get a lot done on my game while also having more time for other activities that bring me joy, like lazily watching my shows on the couch.</p>



<p>I’m happy to report that this experiment was a resounding success. I was able to make <em>incredible </em>progress on my game while also streaming a season and a half of the brilliant superhero drama <em>The Boys</em>.</p>



<p>So how did I do all that?</p>







<p>One of the recommendations from <em>Make Time</em> is to turn off all notifications on your phone and other devices except those that you explicitly <em>want</em> to be interrupted by. The default on your phone is to interrupt you whenever, it’s high time to challenge that notion!</p>



<p>I decided to turn off all notifications except Google Calendar (meetings), LoseIt (diet tracking reminders), and WhatsApp (family &amp; friends). I also explicitly logged out of Twitter in the morning, which added some friction to wasting time on that website.</p>



<p>Next, I wanted to meticulously plan my mornings. I’m a morning person and get up at 6 AM every day, but I’m not always spending that time wisely. I decided to map out the two hours between 6 AM and 8 AM to an exact schedule:</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png" data-src="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png" alt="" data-srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-300x169.png 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-768x432.png 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png 1280w" data-sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" srcset="https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-300x169.png 300w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine-768x432.png 768w, https://www.uptheretheylove.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Morning-Routine.png 1280w"></a></figure>



<p>I’m able to do this is that I don’t have any children, I no longer have a commute, and my wife likes to sleep in until at least 8:30 AM. I’m therefore able to perfectly control my schedule in the morning, which definitely makes me an outlier. So don’t feel bad if you cannot apply this type of schedule to your own mornings!</p>



<p>My morning routine acknowledges my Twitter addiction, but I also explicitly block out time for planning my day. This does not always work out <em>perfectly</em>, but it does give me a much better chance of having a productive day.</p>







<p>Even though I no longer had any teammates to interrupt me, I still blocked out the time between 8 AM and noon in my calendar every day for doing focused work. This ensured that I would be in the right headspace and allow me to focus on getting stuff done. I would clear the notification from my phone when I started working, which helped me to get in the groove.</p>



<p>I stuck to this schedule for six weeks while waiting for my new job to begin. And the main thing I found is that I had to unlearn a lot of bad habits. It turns out that a lot of time at work is usually <a href="https://nesslabs.com/illusion-of-productivity">spent on busywork</a>! When I’m stuck on a problem at work, I tend to distract myself with e-mails or checking Twitter. But when your workday is only four hours, you really can’t afford to do that!</p>



<p>That’s why adding a bit of friction to Twitter was really useful. When I got stuck on a problem in one area, I would instead switch contexts to another area of my game. For example, I would work on the UI design when I was stuck on a coding problem and work on making temp art when I couldn’t figure out the game design.</p>



<p>Because I have ADHD, I find it very easy to slip into what the ADHD community calls “hyperfocus”. This is a mental state in which the whole world fades away and nothing becomes more important than the work in front of you. Getting into hyperfocus is in fact so easy for me to do that my main issue has always been getting <em>out</em> of this mental state. Setting a strict deadline helps with that: I can use my hyperfocus to get a lot done and I stop working when it’s time for lunch.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I did not always follow my own advice. There were definitely days that I worked beyond my four-hour limit. And I just want to put it in writing: <em>every time I did that was a mistake</em>. I did not get more done and instead just made myself jittery and anxious for no good reason. Hyperfocus is an extremely tiring mental state, it’s not possible to sustain it for more than a few hours without a serious crash the next day.</p>







<p>Working four hours a day for six week gave me 120 hours of time devoted to my game, or three full-time weeks. But I feel I got more done than that would imply. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Some of my accomplishments:</p>



<ul><li>All major gameplay systems implemented!</li><li>Implemented card game prototype in the actual game</li><li>Closed the gameplay loop from placement to night gameplay and back again</li><li>Created new temp art for 2 / 3 characters</li><li>Added code generation for widgets, screens, and Sass files</li><li>Converted most CSS to use <a href="https://css-tricks.com/abem-useful-adaptation-bem/">ABEM</a> naming scheme</li><li>Fixed not being able to use <a href="http://blog.bahraniapps.com/gifcam/">GifCam</a> to capture footage</li><li>Added base widget class that renders itself when internal state changes (future blog post material!)</li><li>Converted all widgets and screens in the game to use new base class</li><li>Added localization system and used it for all new screens in the game</li><li>Perfected nightly build system using <a href="http://www.buildout.org/en/latest/">buildout</a></li><li>Added animations to <a href="https://twitter.com/mrhands31/status/1349311128468398083">night gameplay</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mrhands31/status/1352583568262914049">task outcome</a> screens</li></ul>







<p>It’s clear to me that I can get a lot done if I focus on reducing distractions and focus my efforts where it matters. Now that I’m gainfully employed again, I don’t think it will be acceptable for me to tell my boss that I would like to do all of my work in four hours yet get paid for eight. But I will definitely carry some of the learnings from this experiment with me.</p>



<p>What I intend to do now is roughly divide my workday in two: mornings are for <strong>focused </strong>work like coding and solving technical problems, while afternoons are for <strong>collaborative </strong>work like writing documentation and doing code reviews. But since I’ll be working from home in the foreseeable future, I will definitely be sticking to my morning routine!</p>



<p>In the next parts of this series, I will discuss how I figure out my task priorities and how I used public accountability to keep myself motivated.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>We are proud to announce the launch of Library Futures Institute, a 501c3 organization fighting for the technology-positive future of libraries.</p>
              <p>The Board chose the name “Library Futures” understanding that our organization will work to ensure a sustainable future for libraries in the modern digital environment where our users live, work, and learn.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Our libraries and their promise of uplift and transformation are facing a threat to their continued existence. As our society moves into an increasingly digital landscape, libraries have built significant collections that have become inaccessible, unaffordable, or worse, subject to limitations striking at the very ability for a library to loan books to patrons. The significant legal and financial value of a collection, and the library's role in providing continual access to the collection, has been diminished by restrictive licensing, unscrupulous pricing, or an outright refusal to sell works to libraries. These policies directly impact the library's right to lend, copy, and preserve materials for the future.</p>
              <p>Without access to digital resources and digital books, libraries will not be able to continue to meet the needs of patrons. Libraries already struggle to provide access to digital resources. Market shifts have resulted in a handful of publishing entities who use highly restrictive licenses designed to lock down information rather than facilitate access to it. The true impact of these policies has become terribly clear during the pandemic as users have been cut off from access to collections.</p>
              <p>Library Futures will safeguard our libraries' right to provide free and open access to information to all citizens, a critical aspect of democratic process. Crucially, guiding the public in an increasingly complicated information landscape is a primary mechanism through which libraries can support the public good. Scholars like Joan Donovan assert that “hiring 10,000 librarians'' will fix our media landscape – those librarians will need access to high-quality, reasonably priced, and well-preserved materials. The future of our culture and knowledge depends on this.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>We are dedicated to ensuring that libraries will continue to provide open, non-discriminatory access to information to benefit the general learning, research, and intellectual enrichment of the public.</p>
              <p>The work of the Library Futures Institute will also advance a research and programmatic agenda that strengthens the rights of libraries,&nbsp; including working toward ownership of digital works through the adoption of less restrictive licensing agreements for e-media and e-books. New licenses should allow libraries to own digital works with the same associated rights as print materials. This change would empower, not challenge, the library’s mission to promote access to knowledge, culture, and literature.</p>
              <p>The people who are involved with the Library Futures Institute – our Board, our Executive Director, our volunteers, our donors, and our future partners (like you!) - are keenly aware of the inequity in access to information. Immigrant communities, low-income families, and people living without internet access have the most at stake in this fight. Our communities do not have the resources to pay top-dollar for access to digital books at a premium, and will be unable to access the information and resources they need for school, work, and general learning.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>That awareness infuses every aspect of our work, from our future Catalyst Fund, to library-focused programming, and our support for digital lending.</p>
              <p>We are excited to launch today and partner with libraries, academic institutions, foundations, consortia, non-profits, and others, to enhance Library Futures’ mission.</p>
              <p>And Library Futures will work for all libraries - public, private, school, media, digital – to uphold our mission and values.</p>
              <p>We believe in the promise of libraries. We believe that access to information can uplift and edify society. We are also committed to preserving works for future generations. And we believe technology, used appropriately, can play an important part in saving a library mission and values.</p>
              <p>Together, we can change the paradigm. Together, we are Library Futures.</p>
              <p><strong>Board of Library Futures Institute</strong></p>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Hi! Dan and Nathan here.</strong> Early in 2020, we launched the Everything Bundle, a Substack devoted to productivity and business strategy. We started with two newsletters, Superorganizers and Divinations, written and produced by just us. Almost twelve months later, we now have eight newsletters in the bundle, written by some of the smartest, most accomplished practitioners in tech and startups: Li Jin, Tiago Forte, Nat Eliason, Jerry Colonna, and Sherrell Dorsey.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The response has been far better than we ever anticipated: the Everything Bundle has been read by over 750,000 people, it has almost 2,400 paid subscribers, and has cracked the top 10 on Substackâ€™s paid newsletter leaderboard. To us, the signal is clear that there is value in a bundle like this. Readers want access to a place that consistently delivers business writing from a variety of perspectivesâ€”for one subscription price.</p>

        <p>Weâ€™re proud of what weâ€™ve built so far, but we think itâ€™s just the start. Today we want to share where weâ€™re going, what we stand for, and why we exist. But first, a few announcements:</p>

        <h5>The Everything Bundle is now Every.</h5> 
        <p>We started by covering productivity and strategy, and our hope is to cover every industry and job role, every broad theme and niche interest. Weâ€™ve picked the name Every as one that reflects that scope.&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™re structured as a writer collectiveâ€”a new model for a media company.</h5>
        <p>Weâ€™ve been doing it for almost a year, and now weâ€™re ready to talk about it. A writer collective is a way to write thatâ€™s somewhere between starting a Substack and working for <em>The New York Times</em>. We give our writers financial upside in the work they do and the freedom to build their own creative vision, but we also support them with distribution to an audience, editorial support, and an advance on their subscription revenue if they need it. Weâ€™re excited to see ideas like this becoming <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/business/media/brick-house-journalism-cooperative.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">part</a> of the <a href="https://www.axios.com/forbes-paid-newsletter-subscriptions-ab423ae1-0b90-4863-acad-40a373adce80.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">zeitgeist</a>: we believe it is the best structure to support diverse voices, uncover undercovered topics, and create quality writing that can help our readers think differently about business and solve real-world problems.</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™ve moved onto our own homegrown platform.</h5> 
        <p>Our business wouldnâ€™t exist without Substack, and we think the world of them, but weâ€™re excited to announce that Every will be run on a platform we built ourselves. Weâ€™re technology people. And as weâ€™ve grown, we keep coming up with ideas to make our product and business better. So we decided to build our own CMS, one that works differently from anything that already exists, and gives us the freedom to evolve it however we want as we seek new ways to meet the needs of our audience.&nbsp;</p>

        <h5>Weâ€™ve raised a pre-seed round from Eric Stromberg at Bedrock and a group of ambitious angels.</h5>
        <p>Weâ€™ve known Eric for many years, and because heâ€™s a former founder in the space and a&nbsp; current investor in The Athletic, Cameo, and Dipsea, we think heâ€™s the perfect person to help us build our vision.</p>

        <p>Weâ€™re building Every because we believe there is someone in every industryâ€”from wealth management to waste managementâ€”whose eyes sparkle when they talk about their work. These people are ambitious, and they are curious. They think of business as a subject that is intellectually interesting, and as an activity that can be pursued not just for personal gain, but also as an expression of soul. They care deeply about what they do because they see how it connects to the lives of the people they serve: they can tell you how everything in the world depends on their job getting done.</p>

        <p>You have never heard of most of these people, but they are out there. We hope to find them and bring them to our readersâ€”by writing about them, and by writing with them. We believe by doing so, we can help build a better world: the stories told today become the businesses built tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Weâ€™ve dedicated ourselves to this mission because we believe great business writing is currently too rare. Weâ€™d love to walk you why we think itâ€™s rare, and how a writer collective can help make more of it.</p>

        <h2>Why is great business writing rare?&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>There is more business writing on the internet than a single mind can fathom. Much of it is amazing, but as we all sadly know, thereâ€™s a lot that isâ€¦ not. Weâ€™re all burned and burdened by the glut of â€œthink pieces,â€� advertorials, and hastily composed posts that donâ€™t reach for nuance or complexity.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>We think this happens for three primary reasons.</p>
        <h4>1 - Great business writing requires multiple skills</h4>
        <p>To write something great about business, you have to know something worth writing about, and you need to be able to write about it in a compelling way. Unfortunately, the number of people who can do both is vanishingly small.</p>
        
        <p>        
          <img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/static/rare-venn.jpg">
        </p>

        <p>Most of the people who know what theyâ€™re talking about donâ€™t write. Writing is hard, itâ€™s time consuming, and, honestly, itâ€™s agonizing. You canâ€™t take a magic pill and suddenly wake up as a compelling writerâ€”you just have to spend years and years doing it. Itâ€™s a craft.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>On the other hand, there are many skilled writers who donâ€™t have enough business knowledge. Or they simply donâ€™t have the time to dive deeply enough into their subject to do it justice. Which brings us to our second point.</p>

        <h4>2 - Writers are pressured to publish too often</h4>
        <p>Great writing takes time. Yes, thereâ€™s the time it takes to write and edit. But it also takes time to experience things worth writing about, to reflect, and to learn. Thereâ€™s no shortcut or trick that can solve this constraint. Thatâ€™s why the best writing, often found in books and magazines, develops over months, if not years.</p>

        <p>Of course that timescale is rare on the internet. Writers who work for ad-supported digital publications often need to produce daily, if not multiple times a day. Solo paid newsletters need to publish at least weekly, if not 2-3 times a week. Weâ€™ve done this ourselves, and some of our favorite writers do it with a level of quality and consistency that boggles the mindâ€”but itâ€™s grueling. You get burned out. We did.</p>

        <p>When youâ€™re burned out, you forget what inspired you to start writing in the first place. You scroll through Twitter â€œlooking for ideasâ€� and contemplate a career change to carpentry, until, defeated, you curl into a nap. You realize that your sense of curiosity, rather than driving your work, is currently in hidingâ€”which brings us to our third point.</p>

        <h4>3 - Most writing is chasing clout, rather than insight</h4>
        <p>Every writer wants clout. But when you prioritize clout over curiosity, the work suffers. You try to play up popular narratives. You worry about keeping up.&nbsp; You look at what everyone else is writing about, and you try to write the same thingâ€”but better. You opine on every trending topicâ€”even when you donâ€™t have anything new to add to the conversation. You say dumb things to get attention. (Okay, to be fair, we have <a href="https://every.to/divinations/quibi-will-be-a-multi-billion-dollar-355585" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">done that</a> ourselves, but at least hopefully in an interesting way ðŸ™ˆ.)</p>

        <p>This strategy can attract attention, but it leaves readers unsatisfied, and doesnâ€™t age well. Itâ€™s like blowing counterclockwise into a hurricane and claiming credit when it reaches a Category 5. Aiming directly for clout is all about profiting from trends, rather than creating them. Itâ€™s about answering questions that have already been asked, not about asking new questions.</p>

        <p>When you put all of these forces togetherâ€”an arena that requires multiple skills to succeed, the incessant pressure to publish, and the human tendency to chase cloutâ€”you end up with a lot of writing thatâ€™s kind of like cotton candy. It tastes good at first, but it gives you a stomachache after a while. Worse, it creates a narrative ecosystem that rewards folks who already have money and an audience, rather than reflecting the best of what our community knowsâ€”and wants to knowâ€”about the world.</p>

        <p>So, what to do? Write together, rather than alone.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>How writing together solves these problems</h2>
        <p>Writing together isnâ€™t trending right now, but itâ€™s actually pretty great.&nbsp;</p>

        <ol>
         <li>When you write together, you donâ€™t need one person to have both business knowledge and writing talent. You can find one person who has business knowledge and another person who has writing skill, and then create systems that support them writing together. Now youâ€™ve unlocked both business experience and writing talent in a way that wasnâ€™t possible before.</li>
         <li>When you write together, you donâ€™t have to publish so often that you risk burning out. Instead, the group can share the load. That means each writer has time to produce higher quality work, but readers still get content on a consistent schedule.</li>
  
         <li>And finally, when you write together, you can form a culture that pushes you to write from a genuine sense of curiosity, expertise, and interest, rather than clout-chasing. You can hold each other accountable to this when you veer away from it, and you can encourage each other to pursue the fragile little sparks of inspiration that turn into the best pieces.

    <section>
      <p>I’ve long felt the same way about personal computers that Matt Crawford feels about cars: &nbsp;it is important to build your own PC so that you can have more control over a technology that you use every day.</p><p>I have been building my own PCs since the mid-1990s, when I put together my first machine using a NexGen Intel-clone processor. &nbsp;Since then I have not bought a whole PC; when I want better performance, I simply add more memory, put in new hard disks, upgrade the graphics card, or swap out the motherboard and CPU.</p><p>Windows-based computers are not hard to build. &nbsp;You just buy the parts—motherboard, CPU, memory, disk storage, a case, monitor and graphics card, and plug them together. &nbsp;There are a number of little tricks you learn along the way, like properly seating the cooling fan on top of the microprocessor, or inserting the memory sticks into their sockets the right way. &nbsp;But PCs are highly modular and standardized, and the standards don’t shift that often—from SCSI connectors to SATA, or from DDR3 to DDR4, or DVI to DisplayPort to connect the monitor. &nbsp;You just need to keep straight what the current standards are, and buy accordingly.</p><figure><img src="https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 600w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 1000w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/size/w1600/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 1600w, https://www.americanpurpose.com/content/images/2021/01/IMG_4043.jpg 2016w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Getting ready for a build</figcaption></figure><p>Building your own machine has quite a number of advantages. &nbsp;You can customize them to exactly the uses you intend. Not everyone is a gamer who requires a humongous 16GB graphics card. &nbsp;You can get away with a rather modest machine if you’re just trying to create a home entertainment system. &nbsp;You can put your computer in a nice case that will fit easily on your desk. Recently I’ve taken to using a $50 Raspberry Pi-based computer to read the newspaper in the morning. &nbsp;In recent years AMD has pulled ahead of Intel in the CPU wars; why not shift over to their chips? &nbsp;Maintenance is much easier: computers, like human beings, seldom fail as complete systems; rather, an individual component goes on the fritz and needs to be replaced. &nbsp;Because something has failed on your motherboard does not mean you need to replace your keyboard, mouse, and monitor. &nbsp;If you have built your own machine, you can usually diagnose a problem down the road. &nbsp;For example, if you don’t hear the little “beep” when you turn it on, you know the machine has failed to post and that there’s something wrong with your BIOS. On the other hand, if it posts but hangs up when loading Windows, you suspect your copy of the operating system has been corrupted and needs to be reinstalled.</p><p>From the standpoint of someone who wants to maximize their technological autonomy, Apple computers are an absolute nightmare. &nbsp;Although I still own an Apple laptop, I seldom use it and definitely do not love my iPhone. &nbsp;Apple products were deliberately designed to prevent their users from modifying them, down to the use of proprietary fasteners that require special Apple-only tools. &nbsp;I tried to get into an old Mac laptop with my sons a few years ago; we ended up with a lot of useless bent metal trying to force our way in. &nbsp;Apple does not want you to be able to fix your own computer—rather, it wants you to visit the “Genius Bar” at the Apple Store and look over all the new products while you wait for someone to fix your machine in the back room. &nbsp;The “genius” refers not to you, the helpless customer, but to the marketing guy who thought up this system.</p><p>Apple is constantly making its users adopt proprietary connectors that you are forced to buy from them. &nbsp;An example is the “lightning” connector that was first introduced on the iPhone 7 and replaced the old 3.5mm headphone jack. &nbsp;Apple claims that this change was made to improve the user experience, but really they just want to force you to buy new headphones or adapters. &nbsp;They’ve similarly changed the plug on their power cords so often that you have to discard one from just a couple of years ago in favor of their most recent model. &nbsp;Landfills around the world are brimming with useless Apple power adapters.</p><p>Microsoft, as I well remember, tried to get away with something like this in the 1990s. &nbsp;The programming language Java had been created as a common, open standard that would operate across a variety of platforms—Macs, PCs, Linux, and so on. &nbsp;Microsoft then tried to “fork” the language and create a version that would only run on its own machines, which it could do because so many people used Windows PCs. &nbsp;This became part of the Justice Department’s decade-long antitrust suit against Microsoft, which in the end forced the latter to stand down.</p><p>You can only get away with this sort of behavior if you hold a near-monopolistic position in the marketplace, and the huge scale of tech companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon has become a major challenge for our democracy. Unfortunately, after the Microsoft case, the U.S. stopped trying to enforce antitrust laws against Big Tech. This is a pattern that has only recently been reversed.</p><p>So learning to build your own computer reduces your acquisition costs, keeps down operating expenses, means that you can fix your machine when it breaks down on a weekend, and otherwise gives you the satisfaction of knowing exactly what’s under the hood of your computer. &nbsp;You’ve clawed back a little bit of personal autonomy.</p>

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The decision of whether to use a monorepo or a polyrepo structure for your source code can be a very emotional (maybe even religious!) battle. On its surface, it's not much different than "tabs vs spaces" or "vim vs emacs". Or is it?</p>
<p>In the following, I will attempt to draw objective, logical arguments for both approaches and also throw in a very popular third option: the hybrid.</p>
<h2 id="quickintro">Quick intro</h2>
<p>The <strong>monorepo layout</strong> consists of a single code repository where multiple projects coexist in a hierarchical directory structure. For example:</p>
<pre><code>├── lib
|   ├── lib
|   └── lib
├── lib
├── lib
├── lib
├── app
|   ├── lib
|   └── lib
|       ├── lib
|       └── lib
├── app
|   └── lib
└── big-project
|   ├── lib
|   ├── app
|   |   ├── lib
|   |   └── lib
|   └── app
|       └── lib
└── big-project
    ├── lib
    ├── lib
    ├── app
    |   └── lib
    └── app
        ├── lib
        └── lib
</code></pre>
<p>Each <code>lib</code> and each <code>app</code> would contain various other sub-directories to house the source code itself, depending on the language it is written in. You get the idea.</p>
<p>In <strong>polyrepo layout</strong> (sometimes also called <strong>multirepo layout</strong>), on the other hand, the code is spread across... well multiple repositories. The degree to which the separation between logical pieces of code can vary from language to language and from style to style. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Here's an example possible structure.</p>
<pre><code>github.com/myorg/app1
├── docs
├── examples
├── src
└── tests

github.com/myorg/app2
├── docs
└── src

github.com/myorg/app3
├── lib
|   └── src
├── lib
|   └── src
└── lib
    └── src

github.com/myorg/lib1
└── src
</code></pre>
<p>Each repository is focused on specific functionality. The structure of the repository is usually heavily influenced by the best practices of the language they host.</p>
<p>A third alternative that some people use is the <strong>hybrid repository layout</strong>, whereby some components coexist in one or more monorepos, while others are separated in their own isolated, smaller repositories. Deciding which component goes where may be influenced by team ownership, the language of the code, whether the component is open or closed source, and other factors.</p>
<h2 id="judgingcriteria">Judging criteria</h2>
<p>The structure of your source code empowers or impedes various engineering processes. It is the lifeblood of your technical product and it needs to account for all the possible ways it can be used. To avoid boiling the ocean with this article, however, we will focus on the most popular use-cases and characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of importing</li>
<li>Ease of contributing within and across projects</li>
<li>Viewing diffs</li>
<li>Structure of releases</li>
<li>Builds and CI</li>
<li>Open vs closed source</li>
<li>Issue tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, we will make certain assumptions about the underlying technologies used: for example, we will assume that you are using GitHub for the repositories and the issue tracking. The considerations typically apply to most other setups that do not necessarily use these technologies. They work similarly.</p>
<h2 id="letstakealook">Let's take a look</h2>
<h3 id="imports">Imports</h3>
<!-- ![Containers seen from above](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/chuttersnap-kyCNGGKCvyw-unsplash.jpg) -->
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/chuttersnap-kyCNGGKCvyw-unsplash.jpg" alt="Shipping containers seen from above"></p><p>You can't talk about the code layout, without looking primarily at how code can be imported and reused. Different languages can vary wildly in the way code can be imported.</p>
<p>For example, in Go, you have the freedom to reference just about any package (directory) in any repository with ease. There are mechanisms to automatically download any remote code and use it, via the new <a href="https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules">modules features</a>. For Go, it is just as easy to use monorepos or polyrepos for code imports.</p>
<p>In Java, on the other hand, you cannot simply import a GitHub repository - you have to first publish a JAR to an artifactory, and then reference that JAR in your Java-specific build file. So it becomes far easier to reference a package in the same repository than across repositories setup-wise. But the code can become unwieldy. For this reason, some Java monorepo layouts tend to stick with segmenting the code across separate modules, each possibly producing separate artifacts. See for example <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.html">multi-module Maven builds</a>.</p>
<p>JavaScript tends to be spread across multiple repositories typically. To use a package from one repository to another, however, the package needs to be published to NPM. It's less popular to use a monorepo layout with JavaScript, however, if you would like to experiment, there are a number of tools to help out with the directory organization, such that each project gets its own separate <code>package.json</code>. <a href="https://github.com/lerna/lerna">Lerna</a> is one such tool.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: It depends heavily on the language. Even if the language requires an artifactory or a package repository in the middle when referencing code across repositories, it still seems like polyrepos are more popular. When using a monorepo layout, it's often preferable to create distinct modules of each project and some communities have developed tools to help with that.</p>
<h3 id="contributionswithinthesameproject">Contributions within the same project</h3>
<!-- ![Software engineers collaborating](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/cowomen-cKQkMFzXHAI-unsplash.jpg) -->
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/cowomen-cKQkMFzXHAI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Software engineers collaborating"></p><p>Making changes to source code can be isolated to one specific area, or it can span multiple functional concerns and thus need to cross-project boundaries. The developer experience may vary depending on how the code is laid out.</p>
<p>When viewing changes to a single project, it is easier to visualize the history of changes in GitHub in a polyrepo setup, by simply navigating the list of pull requests. In a monorepo setup, however, all the pull requests are mixed together; your best bet, in that case, is to first open the specific sub-directory you are interested in and then clicking the <strong>History</strong> link. If you have squash merges enabled, you can easily navigate the PR from the commit message.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/history.png" alt="history"></p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Managing contributions within the same project is easier with a polyrepo layout, as it is easier to track the history of changes per-repository rather than per-directory.</p>
<h3 id="contributionsacrossprojects">Contributions across projects</h3>
<!-- ![Whiteboard collaboration](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/kaleidico-26MJGnCM0Wc-unsplash.jpg) -->
<p><img src="https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/kaleidico-26MJGnCM0Wc-unsplash.jpg" alt="Whiteboard collaboration"></p><p>When making contributions across multiple projects, there is a significant distinction. Arguably, this is one of the main reasons to use the monorepo layout. When everything is in a single repository, many cross-cutting concerns can be modified and submitted as a single, atomic PR. For example, you could write code for a new feature and make adjustments end-to-end: UI, backend, API, DB schema migration, documentation, etc. The simplicity of the dev-test and contribution process really shines in monorepos, when done right <sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. Atomic PRs also help to visualize changes for review. It is easier to see a feature take shape when the changes across projects are visible in one place.</p>
<p>In polyrepos, cross-cutting changes need to be performed as separate distinct PRs. Although it is more work to open separate PRs, it's sometimes useful to create the mindfulness that the components are landing asynchronously in production (for example, if these are separate microservices talking to each other).</p>
<p>One of the challenging aspects of contributing across multiple repositories is that the dependencies are often referenced as a pinned version number. If you change project B on the <code>main</code> branch and it is referenced by project A as <code>v1.2.3</code>, then you will need to work out a way to test project A with the latest of project B for development, or, as a workaround, perform a release of project B and update project A to now point to <code>v1.2.4</code>. This creates possible significant hurdles for the developer to go through and for this reason, developers get discouraged to contribute to other team's codebases unless they really have to.</p>
<p>Another possible side-effect of dependency version pinning is what I call <em>delayed integration breaking</em>: the <code>main</code> branch of project B no longer works with project A due to some change performed in the past. Project A has been pointing to <code>v1.2.3</code> for a long time, while project B has been evolving independently. The first time this is discovered is when a developer attempts to make a change to B, which is needed in A. This, again, contributes to the hurdles developers face when contributing across repositories and creates hidden technical debt.</p>
<p>Dependency version pinning is not a bad thing in and of itself. If the two projects are well separated and the team maintaining the dependency is aware of maintaining compatibility (and enforces this with proper testing), then this is often preferred. After all, the way we typically consume open-source software relies on this model and it is very successful. However, if two projects need to evolve together tightly, then a possible alternative might be always referencing the <code>main</code> branch version (in Java, this is known as the <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/maven_snapshots.htm"><code>SNAPSHOT</code> version</a>) as the dependency and thus being able to catch integration regressions much more quickly. During a release, all <code>SNAPSHOT</code> references would need to be updated to pinned versions, however.</p>
<p>Another option might be to use a bot that regularly updates dependencies. The support for such a bot may be language-specific, however. Here's an <a href="https://github.com/tenable/Kastle/pull/165">example of Scala Steward in action</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, in polyrepo setups developers have the option to use staggered dependency upgrades: the ability to update a dependency gradually across other projects and thus control the way a change is rolled out. In a monorepo setup, this would be achieved through other means, such as <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html">feature flagging</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Managing contributions across projects is usually easier in a monorepo layout, as PRs can make changes across several components at the same time and there is no need to constantly update the referenced version of dependencies. In addition, integration breakages are obvious immediately.</p>

<figcaption>Compilers are the New Frameworks</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike React, Vue or Angular, that do the bulk of their work in the browser at runtime. Svelte is a compile time framework.</p><blockquote>A framework should be thing, that runs in your build step.</blockquote><p>It shifts that work into a compile step, taking our high level declarative components and turning them into efficient, imperative, low level code to manipulate the DOM directly.</p><p>All these results in a framework free vanilla js code at runtime.</p><p>The implications are:</p><ul><li>Faster initial load.</li><li>Faster payload delivery due to small size.</li><li>Unnecessary updates never happen. (Which you get to see when you put a breakpoint in a React app!)</li><li>Less performance hits on run time as all optimizations gets performed in compile time.</li><li>Unused CSS gets removed in the build step.</li><li>It even points out missing attributes, that are necessary.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>When doing image processing, rendering or converting between RGB color spaces, it is easy to end up with RGB values outside of the 0.0 to 1.0 range (or 0 to 255 for 8-bit colors). This normally means that it isn’t possible to encode the color and it needs to be adjusted somehow before being displayed or encoded (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScRGB">scRGB</a> is an example of an exception, and has a different range). The range of supported colors in a color spaces is referred to as a its <em>gamut</em>.</p><p>Many of the colors outside the gamut are still valid colors, they just can’t be encoded in the given color space. The colors that can’t be encoded can be categorized as follows (for RGB color spaces without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_color#Imaginary_colors">imaginary primaries</a>):</p><ul><li><strong>One or more RGB values are larger than one, but none are negative</strong><br>These colors are too bright for the color space, but could be encoded at a lower luminance.</li><li><strong>One or more negative values</strong><br>These color are more colorful than the color space is able to encode. Some of these can be real colors, but they can also be colors more colorful than physically possible. This is a consequence of linear encoding of colors, which is able to encode colors that can’t exist in real life.</li></ul><p>The simplest technique for dealing with colors outside the valid range is to simply clamp <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> individually. The simplicity of this makes the technique widespread, but unfortunately it has significant drawbacks and can lead to unpleasant color distortions.</p><p>Here is an example of taking a photo and increasing its exposure and colorfulness significantly, with results displayed as sRGB. Colorfulness has been increased by scaling <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a> chroma. RGB values here are simply clamped to the 0.0 to 1.0 range.</p><br><div><p><a href="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/original.jpg"><img alt="Original" decoding="async" height="378" loading="lazy" src="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/original.jpg" width="504"></a><em>Unprocessed</em></p><p><a href="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/clipped_rgb.jpg"><img alt="Processed" decoding="async" height="378" loading="lazy" src="https://bottosson.github.io/img/gamutclipping/flowers/clipped_rgb.jpg" width="504"></a><em>Processed with out of range values clamped</em></p></div><p>This is of course problematic. Hues are heavily distorted and all the details in the flowers are gone. Better methods are needed. Thankfully, this problem isn’t new and has been researched a lot over the years.</p><p>Two main research topics exist:</p><blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_mapping">Tone mapping</a></strong>, which is concerned with mapping high dynamic range images to a lower dynamic range. This typically involves altering both colors inside and outside the gamut and sometimes involves different kinds of spatial filtering to keep details while reducing overall dynamic range.</p><p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_management#Gamut_mapping">Gamut mapping</a></strong>, which is concerned with mapping colors from one color space to another and dealing with the mismatch in what colors can be encoded. This can either be done using <em>gamut compression</em> or <em>gamut expansion</em>, which adjusts all colors of an image, or using <em>gamut clipping</em>, which leaves colors that exist in both color spaces intact, while mapping colors outside the gamut back in range. For an overview see the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236121201_The_Fundamentals_of_Gamut_Mapping_A_Survey">“The Fundamentals of Gamut Mapping: A Survey”</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Tone mapping, gamut expansion and gamut compression are all useful techniques, but will not be the focus of this article. Instead we will limit the scope to creating a practical alternative to clipping sRGB values, by looking at gamut clipping in the sRGB color space and on relatively simple, robust and portable algorithms. The source code for the operations shown is also available, at the <a href="#source-code">end of the article</a>.</p><p>The techniques investigated are also, with some additional work, applicable to other color spaces, and some of the building blocks can be for other things, such as gamut compression. Combining gamut clipping with tone mapping can also be useful since some tone mapping techniques may still produce colors outside the target gamut.</p><h2 id="gamut-clipping">Gamut Clipping <a href="#gamut-clipping"><span><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" enable-background="new 0 0 512 512" version="1.1" xml:space="preserve" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M459.654,233.373l-90.531,90.5c-49.969,50-131.031,50-181,0c-7.875-7.844-14.031-16.688-19.438-25.813  l42.063-42.063c2-2.016,4.469-3.172,6.828-4.531c2.906,9.938,7.984,19.344,15.797,27.156c24.953,24.969,65.563,24.938,90.5,0  l90.5-90.5c24.969-24.969,24.969-65.563,0-90.516c-24.938-24.953-65.531-24.953-90.5,0l-32.188,32.219  c-26.109-10.172-54.25-12.906-81.641-8.891l68.578-68.578c50-49.984,131.031-49.984,181.031,0  C509.623,102.342,509.623,183.389,459.654,233.373z M220.326,382.186l-32.203,32.219c-24.953,24.938-65.563,24.938-90.516,0  c-24.953-24.969-24.953-65.563,0-90.531l90.516-90.5c24.969-24.969,65.547-24.969,90.5,0c7.797,7.797,12.875,17.203,15.813,27.125  c2.375-1.375,4.813-2.5,6.813-4.5l42.063-42.047c-5.375-9.156-11.563-17.969-19.438-25.828c-49.969-49.984-131.031-49.984-181.016,0  l-90.5,90.5c-49.984,50-49.984,131.031,0,181.031c49.984,49.969,131.031,49.969,181.016,0l68.594-68.594  C274.561,395.092,246.42,392.342,220.326,382.186z"></path></svg><span></span></span></a></h2><p>The goal of gamut clipping is to take colors that are outside the target gamut, and map them back to valid colors in a way that avoids perceived distortion and artifacts. In this article we also want to do this in a way that is reasonably efficient and simple to implement. Many techniques require complex iterative algorithms per pixel (or storing the results in 3D lookup tables) – those will not be considered here, but can be useful for many applications.</p><p>Instead we will take this commonly used approach:</p><ul><li>Work in a perceptual color space.</li><li>Keep hue constant, only change lightness and chroma.</li><li>Only project color along straight lines in the perceptual color space.</li></ul><p>For an overview of different approaches, see the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236121201_The_Fundamentals_of_Gamut_Mapping_A_Survey">The Fundamentals of Gamut Mapping: A Survey</a>.</p><p>As a color space, we will use the <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/">Oklab</a> perceptual color space, since it models hue, chroma and lightness well while being easy to work with mathematically. In particular, with Oklab, the shape of the gamut of an RGB color space is described by cubic polynomials, which are quite practical to work with compared to the equations you get with other spaces.</p><p>Since we have decided to keep hue constant, it is now possible to plot the problem in two dimensions, using lightness, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, and chroma, <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. To better understand the shape of the sRGB gamut, let’s look at of slices of constant hue. These are sampled every 30 degrees:</p><br><p>Our goal is to find a way to map colors outside the gamut, shown in grey in the graphs, back into the gamut using straight lines.

If the intersection is with the lower edge, this is everything we need to do. If the intersection is with the upper half, the triangle is only an approximation and we need to refine the solution. Again, one step of Halley’s method is enough to do this with high accuracy.</p><p>Altogether, this is everything needed to find the intersection between a line and the sRGB gamut. To derive the numerical approximation of the location of the cusp, this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JdXHhEyjjEE--19ZPH1bZV_LiGQBndzs?usp=sharing">Google Colab Notebook</a> was used. With same method is should be possible derive approximations for other RGB color spaces.

choice of projection will always be a matter of preference. Overall I think preserving lightness does the best overall of the above methods (and others agree, it is a commonly used technique). One challenge with preserving lightness though is that all colors with <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L&gt;1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> or <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L&lt;0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> get projected to a single point, and that highly saturated colors can become almost completely desaturated if light or dark enough, even though sacrificing just a small amount of lightness would have resulted in a much closer match.</p><p>For this reason I’ve looked into creating new methods that mostly preserve lightness, but behaves closer to the single point projection methods for high and low lightness colors. The result is two new methods. They are novel as far as I am aware, but there are a lot of gamut mapping papers I haven’t read.</p><p>The first method is based on projection towards <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">.</mi><mn>5</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L=0.5, C=0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and the second based on <span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>L</mi><mrow><mi>c</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>s</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow></msub><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L=L_{cusp}, C=0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_033"><div><p>As our application scales to multiple users, we need to start thinking about scaling our servers and applications with it. Load balancing is the activity of effectively distributing traffic load across multiple servers.</p><p>This is how we achieve highly available applications that help us achieve scaling effectively.</p><h2>What is load-balancing?</h2><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>Since nobody can afford a web server overload, we scale out our backend servers to multiple machines. The aim is to have a distributed architecture and to avoid having all users connecting to a single server and choke it up. Therefore we distribute the incoming traffic by making use of a load balancer.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png" alt="load balancing" width="762" height="433" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-1024x582.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-300x170.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-768x436.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-696x395.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing.png 1070w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px"></figure><p>The load balancer thus becomes a key component in our architecture, diverting traffic based on different techniques that we will discuss later in this post. Its main responsibility is to avoid convergence of traffic and thus avoiding choking of the system.</p><p>Load balancers thus become the first point of contact for the client requests.</p><p>There can be multiple load balancers in a system as well. One each for various tiers of the application. This would help handle the separate application tiers more effectively and also scale them independently if needed.</p><figure><img src="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png" alt="load balancing multiple tiers" srcset="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-1024x472.png 1024w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-300x138.png 300w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-768x354.png 768w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers-696x321.png 696w, https://www.wisdomgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/load-balancing-multiple-tiers.png 1276w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><p>It is also important to mention that when a load balancer redirects to a particular location, it might not hit an application server. It might hit another load balancer that is implemented at a location-based cluster in a data center if we were scaling globally.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>If a server goes down, the load balancer also ensures that no traffic is directed to that server until it is back up and running. This is done by performing health checks that ensure the load balancer is only sending traffic to servers that are online.</p><p>But how do we decide which machine the user will land upon?</p><h2>Types of load balancing</h2><p>There are three types of load balancing:</p><ol><li>DNS load balancing</li><li>Hardware-based load balancing</li><li>Software-based load balancing</li></ol><p>As with everything, there are pros and cons to either of the approaches. Let us discuss them in detail.</p><h2>DNS load balancing</h2><p>DNS load balancing is the most commonly used technique for load balancing. Instead of having dedicated hardware for resolving which server to redirect to, a nameserver is responsible for managing traffic.</p><p>The nameserver has a list of IP addresses that correspond to the various servers that can be routed to. Every time someone queries for a particular domain, the nameserver returns this list of IP addresses and changes the order of the addresses. The reordering is done in a round-robin fashion. Thus, every new request is routed to a different machine in a round-robin order And the load gets distributed among different servers.</p><p>The reason a list of IP addresses is returned and not a single IP address is to have a failover strategy. If the first IP address does not respond in a stipulated amount of time, the client can call the next IP address in the list.</p><p>Though this is a popular strategy, it has its limitations too. What the strategy does not factor in is the existing load on the server, the processing time of the server, their online status, etc.</p><p>Another limitation of this technique is that IP addresses are cached on the client machine’s DNS resolver. This can be mitigated by setting a low TTL (time to live, or how long to store the mapping for). But it is a tradeoff since longer TTL means clients do not know about changes and shorter TTL may improve accuracy but increases DNS processing and DNS caching was implemented to mitigate that in the first place. Also, the client might choose to disregard your TTL value altogether. So it is not guaranteed.</p><p>Another limitation is of possibly routing to a machine that is not functional will exist. Though most cloud services these days do provide health checks along with DNS balancing these days, but it might not be true for all services.</p><p>The most common use case for this type of load balancing is for distributing traffic across multiple data centers, possibly in different regions. It is also preferred by companies because it is a cost-effective solution and easy to deploy.</p><h2>Hardware-based load balancing</h2><p>As the name suggests, we use physical appliances as a load balancer. They sit in front of the application servers and handle the distribution of traffic.</p><p>These are highly performant pieces of hardware that factor in the number of open connections, how much compute is being utilized and several other parameters to decide where to route the traffic to.</p><p>Having dedicated hardware to take care of load balancing is highly performant. It also is efficient since a dedicated machine is responsible for evaluating load distribution. The throughput is fast because of the specialized processors. It also provides the benefit of increased security since physical access to the hardware can be limited by the organization.</p><p>But hardware is expensive to purchase, to set up and it requires maintenance and regular updates. It can also require network specialists since it can be a lot of work to do for a developer.</p><p>Another disadvantage is that we have to factor in the scenarios where there is extreme peak traffic and plan for purchasing hardware accordingly. This is not the case for software-based load balancers.</p><h2>Software-based load balancing</h2><p>Software-based load balancing is the process of installing load balancing software on cost-effective hardware and VMs. They are cheaper and provide more flexibility than the hardware ones. They can also be provisioned and upgraded easily.</p><p>The major benefit of software-based load balancers over DNS load balancers is the flexibility and the advanced configuration options. We can configure load balancing on the basis of multiple parameters like cookies, HTTP headers, CPU utilization, memory consumption, network load, etc. We will discuss the different algorithms that can be implemented in detail later.</p><p>A benefit of the software-based approach over the hardware one is that we can scale beyond the initial capacity by just adding more VM based instances. No need to buy additional specialized hardware. We also would have to plan ahead of time for peak traffic if we were buying specialized hardware to manage it. In the cloud, there are no hardware balancers, and you purchase more virtual machines to fulfill your needs. This ends up being cheaper.</p><p>There are many “software-balancers as a service” services out there that allow us to use them without any configuration of our own. Or we can install the software from one of the open-sourced versions ourselves. <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HAProxy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nginx/nginx" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nginx</a> are fairly common ones that many enterprises use as well.</p><p>Since there are a lot of ways in which the software-based load balancers can be configured, we will discuss the major algorithms to do so next.</p><h3>Traffic routing algorithms used by software balancers</h3><p><strong>Round Robin: </strong>Similar to DNS based routing, a software uses a list of IP addresses and rotates through this list on every request. Nothing else is taken as a parameter.</p><p><strong>Weighted round-robin</strong>: A modified variation of the round-robin in which the traffic is routed in a weighted manner. The weights are determined by the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities. Thus, machines that can handle more traffic get more of it relative to those that can handle less.</p><p><strong>Least connections:</strong> Traffic is redirected to the machine that has the least amount of current network connections. Similar to the previous one, there are two approaches. One assumes that all requests to a server take equal server resources. The other takes into account the server’s traffic capacity and compute capabilities while making the decision of least open connections.<br>This approach is a good candidate for scenarios where the connections are long-term ones and stay open for larger durations, such as live streams or gaming applications.</p><p><strong>Random:</strong> The load balancer picks two servers randomly and then using the least connections mechanism, sends the request to the one that gets selected.</p><p><strong>Hash-based: </strong>A key is defined on the basis of which distribution takes place. The key could be the client IP address, or the request URL, or both. Hashing the IP ensures that the requests from an IP are always redirected to the same server. This is useful in cases where the server has some in-memory data/cache about the user’s information.</p><p><strong>Least time:</strong> This builds up on the least connections method. The traffic is redirected to the server with the fewest active connections and the lowest average response time.</p><p>And that is all there is to know about the basics of load balancing. Load balancing plays a prominent role in distributed architectures and helps in scaling our applications. It also helps improve responsiveness and achieve high availability.</p><p>If you have any queries, feel free to drop a comment below.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>We rendered the <a href="https://tranco-list.eu/">top 1 million pages</a> on the web, tracking every conceivable performance metric, logging every error, noting every requested URL. To our knowledge this produces the first dataset that connects performance, errors, and library use on the web. In this article we analyze what the data can tell us about creating high performance web sites.</p>
        <div>
            <p><b>1M </b> pages visited
            </p>
            <p><b>65</b> metrics per page
            </p>
            <p><b>21M</b> resource URLs requested
            </p>
            <p><b>383K</b> errors logged
            </p>
            <p><b>88M</b> global variables logged
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <p>Can you do better than our analysis? We <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/indexhtml/web-performance-metrics">published the dataset to Kaggle</a>, so you can crunch the numbers yourself.</p>
        <h2>Why render a million web pages?</h2>
        <p>
            A common sentiment these days is that the web is somehow slower and buggier than it was 15 years ago. Because of an ever-growing pile of JavaScript and frameworks and webfonts and polyfills, we've eaten up all the gains that faster computers, networks and protocols have given us. Or so the argument goes. We wanted to check if this was actually true and try to find what common factors are causing slow and broken websites in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            The high level plan was simple: Scripting a web browser, having it render the root page of the top 1 million domains, and logging every conceivable metric: render times, request counts, repaints, JavaScript errors, libraries used, etc. With all this data, we can ask questions about how one factor correlates with another. What factors contribute most to slow render times? Which libraries are correlated with long time-to-interactive? What are the most common errors, and what's causing them?
        </p>
        <p>
            Gathering the data was a matter of writing a bit of code to use Puppeteer to script Chrome, firing up 200 EC2 instances, rendering a million web pages over the weekend, and praying that you've actually understood how AWS pricing works.
        </p>

        <h2>Overall numbers</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for root HTML document</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 0.9 (0.003%)</li>

            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (0.08%)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>HTTP 2 is now more common than HTTP 1.1, but HTTP 3 is still rare. (Note: We're counting anything using the QUIC protocol as HTTP 3, even if Chrome sometimes reports this as HTTP 2 + QUIC.) This was for the root document, for linked resources the protocol numbers look a bit different.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Protocol use for linked resources</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 0.9 (0.0001%)</li>

            <li><span><span></span></span>HTTP 3 (8.6%)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For linked resources, HTTP 3 is about 100x more prevalent. How can this be true? Because all the sites are linking the same stuff:</p>

        <p>There's a handful of scripts that are linked on a large portion of web sites. This means we can expect these resources to be in cache, right? Not any more: Since Chrome 86, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning">resources requested from different domains will not share a cache</a>. Firefox is planning to implement the same. Safari has been splitting its cache like this for years.</p>

        <h2>What makes the web slow: Predicting time-to-interactive</h2>

        <p>
            Given this dataset of web pages and their load time metrics, it would be nice to learn something about what it is that makes web pages slow. We'll investigate the dominteractive metric, which is the time it takes before the document becomes interactive to the user. The simplest thing we could do is just to look at the correlation of each metric with dominteractive.
        </p>

        <p>

            </p><blockquote>Correlations of metrics with dominteractive</blockquote>
        
        <p>
            Essentially every metric is positively correlated with dominteractive, except the 0-1 variable indicating HTTP2 or greater. Many of these metrics are also positively correlated with each other. We need a more sophisticated approach to get at individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive.
        </p>

        <p>Some of the metrics are timings, measured in milliseconds. We can look at their box-plot to get an idea of where browsers are spending their time.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/timings-box-plot.png" alt="Box plot of web page timings"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of timing metrics. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>
            One way to get at the individual factors contributing to a high time-to-interactive is to do a linear regression, where we predict dominteractive from other metrics. That means we assign a weight to each metric and model the dominteractive time of a page as the weighted sum of the other metrics, plus some constant. An optimization algorithm sets the weights so as to minimize the prediction error over the whole dataset. The size of the weights found by the regression tells us something about how much each metric contributes to the slowness of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll exclude timing metrics from the regression. If we spend 500ms establishing a connection, that adds 500ms to dominteractive, but this is not a particularly interesting insight. Timing metrics are fundamentally <em>outcomes</em>. We want to learn what causes them.

        <p>
            The numbers in parenthesis are the regression coefficients learned by the optimization algorithm. You can interpret these as having units of milliseconds. While the exact numbers should be taken with a grain of salt (see note below), it is interesting to see the scale assigned to each feature. For example, the model predicts a 354ms slow down for every redirect needed to deliver the main document. Whenever the main HTML document is delivered via HTTP2 or higher, the model predicts a 477ms lower time-to-interactive. For each request triggered by the document, it predicts an additional 16 ms. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When interpreting regression coefficients, we need to keep in mind that we're operating on a simplified model of reality. Time-to-interactive is not in fact determined by a weighted sum of these input metrics. There are clearly causal factors the model has no chance of discovering. Confounding variables is clearly an issue. As an example, if loading the main document with HTTP2 is correlated with loading <i>other</i> requests over HTTP2, then the model will bake this advantage into the weights for main_doc_is_http2_or_greater, even if the speed up comes from requests other than the main document. We need to be cautious when mapping what the model says onto conclusions about reality.
        </p>

        <h3>What is the effect of HTTP protocol version on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Here's a fun plot of dominteractive split by the HTTP protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page.</p>
        <div>
            <p><img src="https://catchjs.com/images/blog/errs-and-perf/dominteractive-by-protocol.png" alt="Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version"></p><blockquote>Box-plot of dominteractive split by HTTP protocol version of the first request. The orange line is the median, the box goes from the 25th to the 75th percentile. The percentages in parenthesis are the fraction of requests made with this protocol.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <p>There's a tiny number of sites still delivered over HTTP 0.9 and 1.0. And these sites happen to be fast. It seems we can't disentangle the fact that protocols have gotten faster with the effect that programmers will happily consume this speed-up by delivering more stuff to the browser.</p>

        <p>This is for the protocol version used to deliver the root HTML page. What if we look at the effect of the protocol for resources linked in that document? If we do a regression on number of requests by protocol version, we get the following.</p>

        
        <p id="full-rs-expand"><a onclick="expandRs()">View regression code <span></span></a></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Regression coefficients for number of requests by protocol version, predicting dominteractive</b></li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http2_requests (14.18)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http3_requests (22.05)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_1_requests (25.14)</li>
            <li><span><span></span></span><span><span></span></span>http1_0_requests (61.18)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we were to believe this, we would conclude that moving requested resources from HTTP 1.1 to 2 gives a 1.8x speed-up, while going from HTTP 2 to 3 causes 0.6x slow down. Is it really true that HTTP 3 is a slower protocol? No: A more likely explanation is that HTTP 3 is rare, and that the few resources that are being sent over HTTP 3 (e.g. Google Analytics) are things that have a larger than average effect on dominteractive.</p>

        <h3>What is the effect of type of content on dominteractive?</h3>
        <p>Let's predict time-to-interactive from the number of bytes transferred, split by the type of data being transferred.</p>

<p><small>21 Jan 2021 — 8 min read</small></p>
</header>
<p>In the past four years, I wrote three eBooks about programming. It’s like an
addiction.</p>
<p>I would be terrible at talking about writing techniques, so I won’t. But the
content is not everything when you write an eBook. You have to care about
creating <strong>beautiful files to release</strong>: PDF, ePub, Kindle…</p>
<p>Here is the story of how I built my eBooks, especially
<a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">the last one</a>. After some trial and errors, in the
end, I used the same recipe as the two previous ones, and it involves a
fantastic tool: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p>I wanted my last eBook to be a practical guide, not an academic manual. So I
imagined a very <strong>custom design</strong>, with a <strong>dark theme</strong> and many colors (it is
not designed to be printed).</p>
<p>Since it was about coding, I also wanted to include some source code examples
with <strong>syntax highlighting</strong>.</p>
<p>Bust most of all, I wanted an efficient workflow.</p>

<p>I intended to release a first version of the book ASAP, then iterate thanks to
readers’ feedback and new ideas I had. For this reason, I wanted to focus on the
content and on the appearance <strong>independently</strong>.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to spend time on the presentation each time I updated the content.
I’m a web developer; it wouldn’t occur to me to edit my CSS each time I update
the HTML content. Same here.</p>

<p>I thought: why not just use <strong>MS Word</strong> or its Apple version, <strong>Pages</strong>? Well, I
tried. It didn’t go well.</p>
<p>You can customize pretty much everything you want. Every color, font family,
font size… But it gets trickier when you want to include source code.</p>
<p>Since I wanted to have syntax highlighting, the <em>less bad</em> solution I found was
to copy and paste from VS Code. At first, it looked (kind of) okay, but as soon
as I wanted to modify it, it went terribly: the formatting was lost, spaces were
inserted where I didn’t want them…</p>
<p>Definitely, these tools are not made to write content with embedded source code.</p>
<p>I also tried <strong>Illustrator</strong> and its open-source alternative,
<a href="https://www.scribus.net/"><strong>Scribus</strong></a>.</p>
<p>It was worse.</p>
<p>I admire people able to use these applications. They seem to require a lot of
training and practice. Unfortunately, I intended to release my book in the next
two years, so I didn’t have time to learn them. 😉</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m used to writing content using <strong>Markdown</strong>. Or in <strong>Slack</strong>. Or in
<strong>Notion</strong> (for this blog post). Today, we have such perfect tools for
writing. I didn’t want to struggle each time I update some examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in the end, I relied on the tool I used for my previous books: <strong>Pandoc</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> is a command-line tool whose main feature is
converting some text (usually Markdown) to another format: HTML, ePub, PDF, etc.</p>
<p>I used it for my other books, and it’s perfect for “academic” work (thesis,
research articles). But I wasn’t sure that creating something a bit more
original, with shiny colors and such, was possible.</p>
<center>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I spent around 5 hours to write the content, and lost the same amount of time looking for a publishing software or Saas to generate beautiful PDF for developer-oriented content, with source code.

</center>
<p>To write the content, I could now write using Markdown, with the basic
formatting options I needed: titles, italic, source code… And the source code
was highlighted!</p>
<p>By the way, syntax highlighting is themeable, and I really wanted to use
<a href="https://draculatheme.com/">Dracula</a>, which I already used for my VSCode. So I
created
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-dracula-theme">a custom theme</a>
for it. 🙂</p>

<p>The only thing I find problematic with Pandoc is
<a href="https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html">its documentation</a>. It contains a lot of
information, but it’s on one page.</p>
<p>One page!</p>
<p>So you scroll, then scroll, and scroll again. And when you want to find
something, you do Cmd/Ctrl+F, type “color”, oh cool, there is something. Then
you realize you’re in the section concerning the generation of some obscure and
unknown document format…</p>
<p>Anyway, you can usually find what you’re looking for. I’d just prefer if it used
something more modern, such as Gitbook or Docusaurus, to maintain the
documentation and make it easier to navigate.</p>

<p>Pandoc is very good at generating HTML or an ePub file. You can give it some CSS
to customize anything you want. It would be a dream if you were able to do the
same to generate a customized PDF.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is slightly more complicated…</p>

<p>To generate PDFs, Pandoc uses <em>pdflatex</em>, which relies on
<strong><a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a></strong>. The LaTeX language is used to write
documents with a powerful but unusual syntax. These documents are then converted
to PDF, Postscript, etc.</p>
<p>So, a little like Pandoc. But with a weird syntax instead of beautiful Markdown.</p>
<p>Long story short, if you want to customize the PDF rendered by Pandoc with
<em>pdflatex</em>, you don’t have a choice: you need to provide some LaTeX code, a bit
like CSS.</p>
<p>And I didn’t want to spend several months learning LaTeX—it’s truly fantastic,
you can do anything you want with it. So I did what every good developer hates
doing: search on Google and copy-paste pieces of code.</p>
<p>Here is, for example, how I managed to have the book title in the page footer:
(sorry if you are a LaTeX guru, it probably will hurt your eyes)</p>
<pre><code><span>\usepackage</span><span>{</span><span>fancyhdr</span><span>}</span><br><span>\pagestyle</span><span>{</span>fancy<span>}</span><br><span>\fancyhf</span><span>{</span><span>}</span><br><span>\lfoot</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>\begin</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><span>[</span>overlay,baseline=<span>{</span>(0,0)<span>}</span><span>]</span><br>  <span>\node</span><span>[</span>rectangle, outer sep=0pt, text=white, anchor=west <span>]</span><br>    (pageno)<br>    <span>{</span>A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks, © Sebastien Castiel<span>}</span>;<br>  <span>\draw</span><span>[</span>fill=comment, draw=comment<span>]</span><br>    (<span>[</span>xshift=-<span>\oddsidemargin</span>-1in<span>]</span>pageno.north west)<br>      rectangle<br>    (<span>[</span>yshift=1.5pt<span>]</span>pageno.south east);<br>  <span>\end</span><span>{</span><span>tikzpicture</span><span>}</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Well, to be fair, it would have been much more straightforward if I just wanted
the book title. But I wanted it in an indigo rectangle starting from the far
left of the page.</p>

<p>Still, most of the time, I was able to get what I wanted. It just took more time
than I wanted to spend on it.</p>
<p><em>You can find here
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-header-tex">the complete LaTeX header file</a>
I used for my book. I cleaned it a little and added some comments.</em></p>
<p>Although I didn’t interact with them, I’m sure the LaTeX community is fantastic
because you can find many resources on the Internet: answers on forums,
tutorials, manuals, etc.</p>

<p>I think the last time I used the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">GNU make</a> utility was like
ten years ago. I had this idea that it was only used by C or C++ projects.</p>
<p>If you never heard of <strong>GNU make</strong>, it’s a utility program to run specific
commands to generate files. It’s mostly used to compile and build programs, but
you can use it for any command.</p>
<p>My first intuition was to write a shell script to generate my book in several
formats. Quickly, I realized a <strong>Makefile</strong> would make more sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had <em>content</em> files and <em>resource</em> files (images, the LaTeX header, for
example)</li>
<li>I needed to generate intermediate files, such as the cover as a PDF from a PNG</li>
<li>Some formats (ePub) were used to create other formats (Kindle)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a Makefile, I regenerated only the needed parts, based on which files were
updated since the latest build. I could run <code>make pdf</code>, <code>make epub</code>,
<code>make mobi</code>, or just <code>make</code> to generate all formats.</p>
<p>Here is the portion of my Makefile used to generate the <em>ePub</em> and <em>mobi</em>
(Kindle) files:</p>
<pre><code>BOOK_TITLE <span>=</span> A\ React\ Developer’s\ Guide\ to\ Hooks\ -\ Sebastien\ Castiel<p><span>epub</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>echo <span>'✅  ePub'</span></p><p><span>kindle</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi<br>  <span>@</span>echo ‘✅  Kindle’</p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.epub</span><span>:</span> dist content/*.md images/* resources/dracula.theme resources/metadata.xml resources/epub.css<br>  <span>@</span>pandoc content/foreword.md content/ch*.md content/resources.md \<br>  --output<span>=</span>dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub \<br>  --highlight-style resources/dracula.theme \<br>  --standalone \<br>  --epub-metadata<span>=</span>resources/metadata.xml \<br>  -c resources/epub.css \<br>  --epub-cover-image<span>=</span>cover.png \<br>  --toc --toc-depth<span>=</span>1 \<br>  --metadata title<span>=</span><span>"A React Developer’s Guide to Hooks"</span></p><p><span>dist/<span>$</span>{BOOK_TITLE}.mobi</span><span>:</span> dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub<br>  <span>@</span>kindlegen dist/<span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.epub -o <span>$</span><span>{</span>BOOK_TITLE<span>}</span>.mobi &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</p></code></pre>
<p>Okay, maybe slightly overkill for my needs, but I felt so powerful! 💪🏻</p>
<p><em>You can find
<a href="https://gist.github.com/scastiel/4c409156ad4bc6a6dbbfe2abbd163671#file-makefile">here the complete Makefile</a>
for my book.</em></p>

<p>I embedded the examples’ source code in a small <strong>React</strong> application to run
them locally. The user can start it by running <code>yarn start</code> and navigate easily
through them.</p>
<p>Now, I feel a bit silly not to have thought of using
<a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a>, which could have been a perfect
solution.</p>

<p>I often design graphics using <strong><a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a></strong> (for
example, the banner for the <a href="https://gum.co/use-hooks">Gumroad page</a>), even if
at the end I manipulate and generate bitmap images. I know it’s not its first
purpose, but I find it easier to use than Gimp or commercial alternatives.</p>
<p>If you know a better choice, please please please tell me!</p>

<p>From the beginning, I really wanted a custom presentation with a dark theme.</p>
<p>Now, I realize this wish took me a lot of extra time. And I would have preferred
spending that time on the content. Plus, I don’t know if the readers actually
like this theme or not…</p>
<p>Also, it may have been better to focus first on the <strong>web support</strong>.
<a href="https://v2.docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a> could do an excellent job: readers could
navigate the sections, search for keywords, etc.</p>
<p>The PDF or ePub version would be secondary content: available, but maybe with a
generic appearance. So what?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, if the user finds the content useful, shouldn’t it be all that
matters?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will probably consider this change soon. Plus, I’d like to create a <strong>course</strong>
(without video) from the book’s content…</p>
<p>Regarding the workflow with Pandoc, I’m quite satisfied with it. Writing using
Markdown is lovely to focus on the content without caring how it will render.
And since Markdown is text, it’s easy to keep track of the history using Git. 🙂</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png" alt="Poker vs chess" width="499" height="451" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-347x314.png 347w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-694x628.png 694w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-768x695.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image18-1536x1389.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></a></p>
<p>Poker can be a lot of fun if you have a witty enough group of friends and a generous snack budget. There’s nothing worse than playing poker with a bunch of serious gamblers who think conversation and choice of hot wing spiciness are potential tells.</p>
<p>I like chess because nothing is hidden. I don’t like leaving things to chance, and I’m often foolish enough to believe I can figure out how to win if I have all the information.</p>
<p>In chess, there are no missing pieces. There isn’t a sneaky queen that your opponent can place on the board when you least expect it. Everything is in the open. The strategy and tactics are entirely determined by what is sitting in front of you in plain sight.</p>
<p>If I try to play poker the way I play chess, I’m going to lose. I can’t see all the cards. Information is hidden from me, and it’s information I need to make the right decisions.</p>
<p>If you can’t stand the uncertainty of poker, don’t do a startup. Don’t do an innovation project.</p>
<p>Innovation is like poker.</p>

<h2>The Rules of Startup Poker</h2>
<p>This is not an ordinary game of poker. (So don’t worry if you’re not a poker player, this will still make sense.) I will stretch the analogy of Texas Hold ‘Em as far as I can in this special variation of Startup Poker.</p>
<p>Each player needs to pay the ante to play. This is a cheap game, so we’ll keep the ante at $1. Those are the costs of running an innovation project.</p>
<p>Each player gets dealt two cards that they can keep hidden. These cards represent the organization’s unique capabilities and business model — what they already have when they start.</p>

<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png" alt="A group of people playing poker part 2" width="599" height="450" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-418x314.png 418w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-836x628.png 836w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-768x577.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image2-1536x1154.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>As a normal Texas Hold ‘Em game progresses, the dealer will turn over additional cards in the middle of the table, which each player can use as part of their hand. First there are the three cards called “the Flop,” which are turned over at the same time. Then a fourth card is turned, which is called “Fourth Street” or “The Turn.” The last card is “the River.” Players can place bets before each of these rounds, trying to raise the stakes and force other players to fold.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png" alt="Texas Hold ‘Em startup poker" width="484" height="817" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1.png 1184w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-186x314.png 186w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-372x628.png 372w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-768x1297.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image4-1-910x1536.png 910w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px"></a></p>
<p>In Startup Poker, all these shared cards represent the Market. The first three cards are “the Early Adopters.” The fourth card is “the Early Majority” and the last is “the Late Majority.” As the game goes on, the Market matures and players discover if they hold the winning hand.</p>
<p>The winner of the game is the person who has the best fit between the cards in their hand (which represents their business model) and the cards on the table (the Market). We can think of this as Product / Market fit or Business Model / Market fit.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png" alt="Market vs business model" width="599" height="472" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-399x314.png 399w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-797x628.png 797w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-768x605.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13-1-1536x1210.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>The basic setup is the same, but remember, we are not playing regular Texas Hold ‘Em. Our rules are a bit different.</p>
<h2>Information Costs Money</h2>
<p>In Startup Poker, players have to ante another $1 every round to stay in. This is the cost of product development. (For our purposes, we are eliminating the standard Hold’em practice of “blinds,” which is a form of uneven antes.).</p>
<p>Additionally, instead of every round beginning by flipping over Market cards, players can get a preview by paying an additional $1 for each card. (In real poker, everyone sees the flipped card, but in our version you’re paying for a sneak peek.)</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png" alt="A poker player peeking at a flipped card" width="699" height="514" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-427x314.png 427w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-853x628.png 853w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-768x565.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image7-1536x1130.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of funding an <a href="https://kromatic.com/workshops/building-and-resourcing-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="innovation team" data-wpil-keyword-link="linked">innovation team</a> to gather Market information. This investment isn’t really just money, it’s blood, sweat, and tears. But since people * time = money, we’ll just use our poker chips to represent this investment. The team is really going out into the real world, talking to customers, putting up a landing page, or running some other form of experiment or research to gather information.</p>
<p>At that point, they have the option to kill the idea (fold) or persevere before a round of betting.</p>
<p>Should we go straight ahead and bet on our hand? Or should we buy a peek at the Market first?</p>
<h2>Bet It All in Waterfall</h2>
<p>We could just close our eyes and bet it all on our pair of jacks. This is the equivalent of <a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/lean-startup-in-the-enterprise-anti-pattern-the-lean-waterfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">waterfall development</a>, where we place our bets and literally let the cards fall where they may.</p>
<p>We believe our cards are the correct ones for the Market, despite having not seen a single card from that Market. So we are placing a lot of faith in our business model and capabilities — our pair of jacks — and to be fair, that is a formidable hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png" alt="A player risking it all to bet in a poker game" width="599" height="405" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-465x314.png 465w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-929x628.png 929w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-768x519.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image9-1-1536x1038.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>But we’ve invested for the long hall, so we push it all in and check the snack bar while the hand plays out. But the Market isn’t kind. Our opponent starts with a 2 and a 4, but winds up closing a 2-6 straight with the 3, 5 and 6 from the Market. We lose to a weaker starting hand that ended up being better for that Market. We end up sitting in the corner binging on Pringles and lukewarm beer for the rest of the night while everyone else keeps playing, but that’s a risk of Waterfall.</p>
<h2>Information Has Value</h2>
<p>So instead of going all-in based on our business model and capabilities, should we buy that peek at the Market if we’re holding a pair of jacks?</p>
<p>The answer here is yes. Obviously so.</p>
<p>If everyone is sneaking a peek at the next card except you, you are at a huge disadvantage. Now they are playing chess because they can see more of the board. Meanwhile, you think you are still playing poker.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png" alt="A player playing chess blindfolded" width="512" height="565" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14.png 1812w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-285x314.png 285w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-569x628.png 569w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-768x847.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image14-1392x1536.png 1392w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p>
<p>True, they still can’t see their opponents’ hole cards, so they don’t have all the information, but they have more than you.</p>
<p>So should you pay for the peek no matter what you are holding in your hand? Well, that depends on the cost.</p>
<h2>Don’t Play Every Hand</h2>
<p>If you start the game with a 2 of spades and a 9 of hearts, you have a bad hand. It’s not worth getting Market information because you are woefully unprepared for any Market. You might get lucky and find three twos on the board, but that’s a longshot. The odds are that someone else has a better hand. Just fold and play the next hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png" alt="2 Of spades and 9 of hearts" width="399" height="354" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-354x314.png 354w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-708x628.png 708w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-768x682.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image5-1536x1363.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px"></a></p>
<p>For large organizations, this is the equivalent of having an idea that is fundamentally mismatched with the company.</p>
<p>“Let’s make vegan hamburgers,” says the mining company.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is the 2/9 offsuit of business ideas. Let’s skip this idea and work on something with a little more promise.</p>
<h2>Pivoting</h2>
<p>In the real world, startups aren’t stuck with the cards that they are dealt. If something isn’t working with their business model, they can pivot.</p>
<p>You can also alter your product in Startup Poker, because after you peek at the cards on the board, we let you trade the cards in your hand — for a price. Each round, each player has the opportunity to trade in one card at a cost of $1. It’s an option to change your product / business model after you’ve gotten a taste of the market.</p>
<p>So let’s say you start with a pair of twos — one heart and one spade. You pay $3 to peek at three cards. They are the three, four, and five of hearts.</p>
<p>You might want to trade in your two of spades and get a new card from the deck, giving yourself a shot at a flush, a straight, or a straight flush.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png" alt="Early adopters vs business model" width="599" height="585" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-321x314.png 321w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-643x628.png 643w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-768x750.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image16-1536x1501.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></p>
<p>You are exercising an option to find a better fit with the Market. It’s only the information that you’ve gained by buying a peek at the Market that makes this pivot worthwhile.</p>
<h2>Arrogance</h2>
<p>Let’s face it, arrogance never helps in chess or in poker. Everytime I get cocky in chess, I lose.</p>
<p>Chess rankings are highly visible when playing. So when I relax for my lunchtime game and see that I’m playing someone with a rating 200 points below me, I know I’m going to win. Which is of course exactly when I’m going to lose.</p>
<p>I’m so confident in winning that I start checking my Slack messages while playing. Then I draft an email. Then I make some tea. I get distracted, forget my plan, and generally make a stupid mistake.</p>
<p>“Bad luck!” But there is no luck in chess — this is the folly of arrogance.</p>
<p>If we really wanted to make Startup Poker realistic, every player would be forced to drink 5 shots of bourbon before playing, then when they look at the two cards in their hand they’ll be convinced they have three of a kind. Every entrepreneur thinks they are the second coming of Steve Jobs.</p>
<p>Confidence is great. Good entrepreneurs don’t go into a market without some level of confidence. But arrogance allows your confidence to overrule your judgement.</p>
<h2>The Size of the Pot</h2>
<p>There’s another oddity to Startup Poker in that no one knows exactly how big the pot is. It is somewhat determined by the antes that people are paying in and the bets being made, but mostly it’s determined by the Market.</p>
<p>Of course, people can bet up the pot and force players to invest more to keep up. It’s the same as startups competing against each other. When one buys advertising, the others better match it or have a better strategy.</p>
<p>To calculate the value of the Market, we add up the value of the cards to determine the size of the pot (numbered cards are worth their face value, royal cards are worth $10, and aces are worth $15). So this makes buying Market information even more important.</p>
<p><a href="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png"><img src="https://kromatic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png" alt="The size of the pot" width="699" height="356" srcset="https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3.png 1999w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-600x306.png 600w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1200x612.png 1200w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-768x391.png 768w, https://blog.kromatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image3-1536x783.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px"></a></p>
<p>Don’t waste your money and time playing for a small pot.</p>
<h2>Crowded Markets</h2>
<p>Lastly, look at who is competing. It can be very compelling to play in a game with fewer people. Remember, the size of the prize is mostly determined by the Market, not the amount of competition. Unfortunately, in Startup Poker, players can join the game at any time.</p>
<p>When the dealer starts turning over Market cards, players who have not anteed up to that point can opt in. Of course at first they are at a disadvantage. They have missed at least one opportunity to get advanced information, and they’ve lost at least one opportunity to pivot. But they can still get into the Market — a Market that you’ve already invested in.</p>
<p>So if the first two cards the Market shows are a King and Jack, that’s $20 already in the pot. That might attract some latecomers to the game, and the competition might increase quickly.</p>

<p>Players who find themselves alone in a game at the early stages should still take advantage of the opportunity to get more information early, and to pivot if necessary. Even if …</p></div></div>

		<p>I've already described the differences between <a href="https://blog.luap.info/why-most-saas-companies-cant-be-successful-with-both-enterprise-and-smb-customers.html">Saas B2B SMB and Saas B2B Enterprise</a>. But to summarize, B2B Enterprise is when you customers buy you for your vision and your solutions and B2B SMB is when people buy you for your features. As a result B2B Enterprise is also usually when your customers are big companies (more than 250 employees).</p>
<h2>Nobody cares about the product in Enterprise</h2>
<p>Because the only people who care about the product are not the people who buy or sell your product. This can be simplified as : No important person cares about your product. I'm not even sure that the product quality of a B2B Saas company has any influence on the company's business success.</p>
<p>Let's first define a good product, a product of good quality. A good prodct is a product users are happy to use, it is heavily influenced by UI, UX and simplicity of doing common actions. If you want to understand if your product is good, talk to a new user, and ask him a feedback of your product, if he tells mostly things to improve, you have a bad product ! If most of your users are think the same, you have a bad product.</p>
<p>Let's look at the product quality of big Saas Enterprise products:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is Salesforce a good CRM  ?</li>
<li>Is SAP a good ERP ?</li>
<li>Is Team a good communication system ?</li>
<li>Is any Oracle product a good product ?</li>
<li>What about Workday, Atlassian, MongoDB, Alteryx ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people who use those tools will tell you that the products are shit, while still being more or less satisfied with the overall functionalities it offers them.</p>
<p>Of course not all products are like that, Zoom comes to my mind as a good product in the Saas b2b enterprise space. But if you look at the 50 most successful business Saas b2b enterprise software in the world, most of them will have a shitty product. There are several explanations of why it is like that:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the bigger and the older a company is the worse the product is going to become, so of course the biggest companies have the shittiest product</li>
<li>Second, people who buy the product, are not the ones who are using it, as a result product quality is never something they care</li>
<li>Third, A good product is beneficial for referrals or inbound marketing, but most of B2B enterprise companies get their customers through outbound marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>Should that change ? I don't think so. At the end of the day if you are obsessed about product quality you should not try to work in B2B enterprise. Working time is limited and the more you work on the product quality the less you work on other more important topics.</p>
<h2>How to be a successful product manager in Saas B2B Enterprise</h2>
<p>Most PM, read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507">Inspired</a>, like the book and would like to work inside their Product organization the same way it is described in the book. But the book, and most product management articles you can read online, are focusing on creating great products, or products that customers love. But one thing you need to always have in mind when you are working for a business, is that the business is paying you because your work is going to bring them money. And in the case of Saas Enterprise, making great products is not what is going to bring money to your company.</p>
<p>The result of that mindset is that you will see very often inside Saas B2B companies. Customer support, customer management and product management clashing with Sales and the execs about how the product is not what the end users want. There is this perpetual stupid loop of sales and execs saying, we dont care about those things because that is not what customers wants and the end users focused teams saying, but this is what end users are telling us on a daily basis. Both of those teams are right, they just don't talk about the same people.</p>
<p>If at heart, being a product manager is creating products that customers love, then product management in Saas Enterprise is closer to <em>creating products which support the sales and customer team</em></p>
<p>If you look at your job from that angle, a lot of things change:</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on your users only, you need to focus on two kinds of groups, users and your sales colleagues. Most of the PM toolkits still apply when listening to users. But to listen to sales people things are different. You need to small talk with them, you need to go into sales meetings, you need to understand the sales cycle, you need to understand the value proposition of your company, you need to be in contact with sales guys.</p>
<p>First challenge : Every salesperson in the company is going to push you to build features that their prospects want. The sales team is not really a team, every member has its own objectives, and a small part of their salary comes from team objectives. So they are willing to 'fight' with each other to achieve their objectives.</p>
<p>Second challenge: Sales people have no idea of what features their customers want. First because the customers themselves don't know what they want. Second, salespeople are trained to sell some kinds of products, and are not really good at guessing new ideas and finding what is important or not. They will most of the time repeat what a customer is saying, without even trying to understand what that means or if the customer really needs it.</p>
<p>Third challenge: There is a ton of politics in sales. Execs directly step in into the sales cycle, promising things to customers. Some prospects are 'strategic', some prospects are more important than others ...</p>
<p>So if I can give you a few advice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be friend with sales people, you are going to tell them 'No' a lot of time (if not all of the time), but their feedbacks is important, so try to be as much friend with them as possible</li>
<li>Be friends with sales execs, involve them in your decisions, make them participate. They are not going to decide, but they will like being consulted, and will help you maintain a good relationships with them</li>
<li>Stop complaining that your product is not the best for your users. Your customers are not your users, treat them well but keep in mind they are not the only ones you need to care about</li>
<li>Always balance your decisions between what is great for your users and what is great for your sales colleagues. Are we spending enough time on things that help the business VS spending time on making users love the product ?</li>
<li>Keep fighting to improve the product because at some point a too bad product is going to be very bad for your company. But don't make product quality the most important decision in your prioritization and day to day decisions</li>
<li>Don't let the execs or salespeople or your manager make the decisions for you. Always stay in control. As soon as the execs are able to impose you their decisions, you lose all credibility as a product manager and you won't protect your developers, neither your users and it's going to be bad. You need to be able to say 'No' to your CEO, and you need to be able to tell him 'No' every day!</li>
<li>Forget what you have read in Inspired, almost none of it will help you be good in Saas Enterprise. Always search what impact this new thing is going to have in the overall product. Don't promise anything. Either say 'No' or say 'Yes' but don't do it afterwards. As a result it is also much more complex to evaluate a PM in that type of company.</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't have any idea on how bad a product needs to be to really harm your business. It is almost as if the worst products make the best businesses.</p>
<p>This post can look a bit negative but don't interpret that as a critic. Some PM will prefer working with AB Tests and KPIs and others will like of the environement of Saas Enterprise, I personally prefer the latter !</p>
<p>If you have any question, send me an email. </p>

A CrashLoopBackOff is possible for several  types of k8s misconfigurations (not able to connect to persistent volumes, init-container misconfiguration, etc). We aren’t going to cover how to configure k8s properly in this article, but instead will focus on the harder problem of debugging your code or, even worse, someone else’s code 😱</p><p>Here is the output from kubectl describe pod for a CrashLoopBackOff:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Name:           frontend-5c49b595fc-sjzkg</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>Namespace:      tedbf02-ac-david-nginx-golang-tmcclung-nginx-golang</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>Priority:       0</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>Start Time:     Wed, 23 Dec 2020 14:55:49 -0500</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>Labels:         app=frontend</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>                pod-template-hash=5c49b595fc</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>                tier=frontend</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>Status:         Running</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>IP:             10.1.31.0</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>IPs:            &lt;none&gt;</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>Controlled By:  ReplicaSet/frontend-5c49b595fc</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>Containers:</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>  frontend:</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>    Container ID:   docker://a4ed7efcaaa87fe36342cf7532ff1de5cd51b62d3d681dfb9857999300f6c587</span></p><p><span>15</span><span>    Image:          .amazonaws.com/tommyrelease/awesome-compose/frontend@sha256:dfd762c</span></p><p><span>16</span><span>    Image ID:       docker-pullable://.amazonaws.com/tommyrelease/awesome-compose/frontend@sha256:dfd762c</span></p><p><span>17</span><span>    Port:           80/TCP</span></p><p><span>18</span><span>    Host Port:      0/TCP</span></p><p><span>19</span><span>    State:          Waiting</span></p><p><span>20</span><span>      Reason:       CrashLoopBackOff</span></p><p><span>21</span><span>    Last State:     Terminated</span></p><p><span>22</span><span>      Reason:       Error</span></p><p><span>23</span><span>      Exit Code:    1</span></p><p><span>24</span><span>      Started:      Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:25:26 -0500</span></p><p><span>25</span><span>      Finished:     Sun, 24 Jan 2021 20:25:26 -0500</span></p><p><span>26</span><span>    Ready:          False</span></p><p><span>27</span><span>    Restart Count:  9043</span></p></pre></div><p>Two common problems when starting a container are OCI runtime create failed (which means you are referencing a binary or script that doesn’t exist on the container) and container “Completed” or “Error” which both mean that the code executing on the container failed to run a service and stay running.</p><p>Here’s an example of an OCI runtime error, trying to execute: “hello crashloop”:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>Port:          80/TCP</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>    Host Port:     0/TCP</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>    Command:</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>      hello</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>      crashloop</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>    State:          Waiting</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>      Reason:       CrashLoopBackOff</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>    Last State:     Terminated</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>      Reason:       ContainerCannotRun</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>      Message:      OCI runtime create failed: container_linux.go:370: starting container process caused: exec: "hello": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>      Exit Code:    127</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>      Started:      Mon, 25 Jan 2021 22:20:04 -0500</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>      Finished:     Mon, 25 Jan 2021 22:20:04 -0500</span></p></pre></div><p>K8s gives you the exit status of the process in the container when you look at a pod using kubectl or <a href="https://github.com/derailed/k9s" title="k9s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">k9s</a>.

The Dockerfile schema is quite lenient and allows users to set <code>Cmd</code> without <code>Entrypoint</code>, which means that the first argument in <code>Cmd</code> will be the executable to run. </p><p>Note: k8s uses a different naming convention for Docker <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code>.

In order to get the startup command when you’re dealing with someone else’s container, we need to know the intended Docker <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code> of the Docker image.

First, we pull the container locally using <code>docker pull</code>, then we inspect the container image to get the <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code>:</p><ul><li><code>docker pull &lt;image id&gt;</code></li><li><code>docker inspect &lt;image id&gt;</code></li></ul><p>Here we use <code>jq</code> to filter the JSON response from <code>docker inspect</code>:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span>david@sega:~: docker pull docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2</span></p><p><span>2</span><span>7.10.2: Pulling from elasticsearch/elasticsearch</span></p><p><span>3</span><span>ddf49b9115d7: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>4</span><span>e736878e27ad: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>5</span><span>7487c9dcefbe: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>6</span><span>9ccb7e6e1f0c: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>7</span><span>dcec6dec98db: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>8</span><span>8a10b4854661: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>9</span><span>1e595aee1b7d: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>10</span><span>06cc198dbf22: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>11</span><span>55b9b1b50ed8: Pull complete</span></p><p><span>12</span><span>Digest: sha256:d528cec81720266974fdfe7a0f12fee928dc02e5a2c754b45b9a84c84695bfd9</span></p><p><span>13</span><span>Status: Downloaded newer image for docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2</span></p><p><span>14</span><span>docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2</span></p><p><span>15</span><span>david@sega:~: docker inspect docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2 | jq '.[0] .ContainerConfig .Entrypoint'</span></p><p><span>16</span><span>[</span></p><p><span>17</span><span>  "/tini",</span></p><p><span>18</span><span>  "--",</span></p><p><span>19</span><span>  "/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh"</span></p><p><span>20</span><span>]</span></p><p><span>21</span><span>david@sega:~: docker inspect docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.2 | jq '.[0] .ContainerConfig .Cmd'</span></p><p><span>22</span><span>[</span></p><p><span>23</span><span>  "/bin/sh",</span></p><p><span>24</span><span>  "-c",</span></p><p><span>25</span><span>  "#(nop) ",</span></p><p><span>26</span><span>  "CMD [\"eswrapper\"]"</span></p><p><span>27</span><span>]</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="the-dreaded-crashloopbackoff">The Dreaded CrashLoopBackOff</h2><p>Now that you have all that background, let’s get to debugging the CrashLoopBackOff.</p><p>In order to understand what’s happening, it’s important to be able to inspect the container inside of k8s so the application has all the environment variables and dependent services.

Using the <code>Entrypoint</code> and <code>Cmd</code> you discovered earlier, you can execute the intended startup command and see how the application is failing.</p><p>Depending on the container you’re running, it may be missing many of the tools necessary to debug your problem like: curl, lsof, vim; and if it’s someone else’s code, you probably don’t know which version of linux was used to create the image. We typically try all of the common package managers until we find the right one. Most containers these days use Alpine Linux (apk package manager) or a Debian, Ubuntu (apt-get package manager) based image. In some cases we’ve seen Centos and Fedora, which both use the yum package manager.</p><p>One of the following commands should work depending on the operating system:</p><ul><li><code>apk</code></li><li><code>apt-get</code></li><li><code>yum</code></li></ul><p>Dockerfile maintainers often remove the cache from the package manager to shrink the size of the image, so you may also need to run one of the following:</p><ul><li><code>apk update</code></li><li><code>apt-get update</code></li><li><code>yum makecache</code> </li></ul><p>Now you need to add the necessary tools to help with debugging. Depending on the package manager you found, use one of the following commands to add useful debugging tools:</p><ul><li><code>apt-get install -y curl vim procps inetutils-tools net-tools lsof</code></li><li><code>apk add curl vim procps net-tools lsof</code></li><li><code>yum install curl vim procps lsof</code></li></ul><p>At this point, it’s up to you to figure out the problem. You can edit files using vim to tweak the container until you understand what’s going on. If you forget all of the files you’ve touched on the container, you can alway kill the pod and the container will restart without your changes. Always remember to write down the steps taken to get the container working. You’ll want to use your notes to alter the Dockerfile or add commands to the container startup scripts. </p><h2 id="debugging-your-containers">Debugging Your Containers</h2><p>We have created a simple script to get all of the debuging tools, as long as you are working with a container that has curl pre-installed:</p><div><pre><p><span>1</span><span></span></p><p><span>2</span><span>/bin/sh -c </span><span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>curl</span><span> -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/releaseapp-io/container-debug/main/install.sh</span><span>)</span><span>"</span></p></pre></div><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve learnt how to spot and investigate the CrashLoopBackOff errors in containers.

<p>Client, executives, and business owners always have one question at the start of a software project:</p>



<h4><em>“When will it be done?”</em><em></em></h4>



<p>If you’ve been working in software development for more than a month, you know this question is a trap.</p>



<p>Software development isn’t an assembly line where each task is measured down to the second. You’re creating a product that’s literally never existed before. There will always be uncertainty about the timeline.</p>



<p>Even so, software development is a business, so we have to accommodate the people we build software for.</p>



<p>They need the best estimate we can give them, and we need to avoid promising something we can’t deliver.</p>



<p>Which brings me to the focus of this article:</p>



<h4><em>How can I create an estimated timeline that my stakeholders will accept—but won’t lead to unrealistic deadlines for me and my team?</em><em></em></h4>



<h2>Ideal Days vs. Story Points: Two Common Methods</h2>



<p>GRAPHIC</p>



<p>In the quest to create better project estimates, developers have come up with all kinds of systems.</p>



<p>Two very common ones are:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Ideal days (or similar time-based estimates)</li><li>Story points</li></ol>



<p>Both can be used to create project timelines, and both have their pros and cons.</p>



<p>One method is reliable, data-driven, and stable.</p>

<h2>1. Ideal Days: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>

<p>Here’s a simple definition of for the ideal days method of estimating work:</p>



<h4><em>Ideal days is an estimate of the number of days your team would take to complete a project if they worked on nothing else and had no interruptions.</em><em></em></h4>



<p>In this context, “interruptions” means anything that causes the team to stop work on the project, including team meetings, training, other projects, illness, etc.</p>



<p>For example, a team of three developers might estimate a total of 45 ideal days to complete a project. If they had no interruptions and worked on nothing else, that would be an estimated timeline of 15 days.</p>



<p>No team exists without at least <em>some</em>&nbsp;interruptions.</p>



<p>For that reason, many teams might estimate somewhere between 20 and 30 days in this situation, depending on how optimistic (or realistic) they are.</p>



<h3>Pros of Ideal Days</h3>



<p>There are two main pros to the ideal days method:</p>



<ul><li>It’s concrete and intuitive</li><li>Clients and outside stakeholders understand it immediately</li></ul>



<p>When you tell a client, “this project should take 20 days,” you don’t have to educate them about the process you’re using or a new idea. They already understand the concept of time estimates expressed in hours, days, or months.</p>



<p>In most cases, clients and outside stakeholders will ask for an estimate given in days, weeks, or months—which is the main reason the ideal days method is so popular.</p>



<h3>Cons of Ideal Days</h3>



<p>There are three major problems with the ideal days method:</p>



<ul><li>Human beings are scientifically proven to be outrageously bad at estimating how long things will take;</li><li>Ideal days are often calculated based on the ideal case scenario, not a data-backed review of actual work completed on similar projects;</li><li>In practice, software teams often miss their promise date when using the ideal days method.</li></ul>



<p>This is not news to developers, of course. It’s no secret that we’re all bad at estimating time.</p>



<p>Despite these drawbacks, though, ideal days remain a popular method of estimating time. That brings us to the other most popular method: Story points.</p>



<h2>2. Story Points: Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1270" src="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-scaled.jpg" alt="Story Points: Advantages and Disadvantages" srcset="https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-300x149.jpg 300w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-1024x508.jpg 1024w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-768x381.jpg 768w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-1536x762.jpg 1536w, https://www.7pace.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/02-Image-6-2048x1016.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></figure>



<p>Here’s a definition of story points:</p>



<h4><em>Story points are an estimate of the effort—not time—required to complete a task within a larger project.</em><em></em></h4>



<p>As you probably know if you’re reading this article, the term “story points” comes from the idea of user stories, a key idea within Scrum and Agile project management methodologies.</p>



<p>If you’re creating a new report for small business owners, for example, your user story might say:</p>



<p><em>As a small business owner, I want a daily report of my revenue for the previous day.</em><em></em></p>



<p>Story points are the estimates of the effort it will take to build all the features needed to create the experience described in the user story.</p>



<h3>Story Points Use a Relative Scale</h3>



<p>Story points are often assigned using the Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.) or some other relative scale.</p>



<p>We may not know <em>exactly</em>&nbsp;how big a task is, but we know that changing a background from blue to green might be a 1 while building a new drop-down menu might be a 3 by comparison.</p>



<h4><em>Importantly, you should </em><em>never, ever</em><em>&nbsp;mix story points with ideal days or any other time-based estimation method. That includes the common practice of pegging story points to a certain number of hours or days (e.g., “One story point = one day”).</em><em></em></h4>



<p>Doing so strips your team of the most powerful reason to use story points—increasing your velocity.</p>



<h2>Pros of Story Points</h2>



<p>High-performance software teams don’t operate at one speed.</p>



<p>Instead, as they work their way through a project, they find ways to do it better, faster, and with less waste.</p>



<p>That means two vitally important things for your team:</p>



<ul><li>After you’ve been through three sprints, you will have a <em>very</em>&nbsp;strong understanding of how fast the team is moving—its velocity;</li><li>The velocity will increase over time as the team finds new ways to complete the work faster and with less waste.</li></ul>



<p>For example, it may take your team five days to complete the first 100 points of a project.</p>



<p>If so, your <em>velocity</em>&nbsp;over that first week is 100.</p>



<h3>Story Points Example Estimate</h3>



<p>Say you’re using one-week sprints for a 1,000 point project.</p>



<p>After three sprints, the team completes 104, 109, and 117 story points, respectively.</p>



<p>That’s an average velocity of 110, which is very strong evidence of the team’s capacity for this particular project <em>even with</em>&nbsp;normal interruptions. This is in stark contrast to the ideal days method, which assumes no interruptions and no other priorities.</p>



<p>You can now go to your stakeholders and confidently report that the 1,000 point project should be complete in a total of nine weeks.</p>



<p>If your team is increasing its velocity as it works (as it should!) there is a very good chance you’ll be able to deliver the project <em>ahead</em>&nbsp;of your promised delivery date.</p>



<h2>The Cons of Story Points</h2>



<p>While story points have many advantages, there are a few downsides, including:</p>



<ul><li>Story points are abstract and difficult to understand;</li><li>You might not be able to make a good timeline estimate right at the outset of a new project;</li><li>You’ll have to work hard to educate clients about the method and communicate with them often about the team’s progress.</li></ul>



<p>The abstract nature of story points means you’ll have to work much harder at communicating with clients, executives, and outside stakeholders.</p>



<p>At the beginning of the project, they’ll want you to tell them <em>exactly</em>&nbsp;how long the project will take—along with how much it will cost.</p>



<p>And in truth, you won’t <em>really</em>&nbsp;have an accurate estimate for them. It will be three sprints before you have an accurate velocity number you can use to make a data-backed projection.</p>



<p>For that reason, your initial estimates will be more uncertain than your estimates once you get the team moving.</p>



<p>That issue will be a point of concern for many clients, salespeople, or executives. They’ll want a firm timeline <em>before</em>&nbsp;they approve the project.</p>



<p>Luckily, there’s a straightforward way to create high-quality initial estimates even before you have a data-backed velocity number.</p>



<h3>How to Create an Initial Delivery Estimate Using Story Points</h3>



<p>The good news is: initial estimates using the story point method aren’t any less uncertain than the ideal days method.</p>



<p>If your team has completed similar projects to the one being proposed, review the completed sprint boards, then use the velocity the team achieved on those projects as a starting point for your estimate.</p>



<p>This lets you create realistic, data-backed estimates for the timeline of your project, ones that will get more accurate as you begin the project and start completing the work.</p>



<p>As a bonus, if you review the completed sprint boards of similar projects with your client or stakeholders as you give them your initial estimate, it will make you look like you <em>really</em>&nbsp;know what you’re doing.</p>



<p>Data-driven methods have that effect on people. 🙂</p>



<h3>Story Points Create Better Outcomes</h3>



<p>Despite its downsides, we believe story points create better outcomes for everyone involved in software development, including:</p>



<ul><li>Fewer last-minute overtime or weekend work;</li><li>More on-time projects;</li><li>Happier clients;</li><li>Happier developers;</li><li>Less overtime and write-offs—which leads to more profitable projects.</li></ul>



<h2>Use Time Tracking with Story Points for Full Visibility Within Your Sprints</h2>



<p>Story points are awesome for scoping and planning work, and velocity (once you have a real number based on at least iterations) is the most accurate way we know to calculate project timelines.</p>



<p>Together, story points and velocity are the antidote to fussy clients who want to know: “How long will this take!?”</p>



<p>Internally, however, once you’re inside a sprint, story points leave a gap in your visibility to the work being completed.</p>



<p>For example, imagine your team sets 20 points of work for a two-week sprint.</p>



<p>In Scrum, you never move a task to “complete” until it’s fully complete—ready for the user to use.</p>



<p>Five days into a ten-day sprint, you might still have 20 points remaining as “unfinished” on the sprint board.</p>



<p>You’re halfway through the sprint, but you have no information about how it’s going. You have 20 points of work remaining, but will it take five days to complete as you planned? Three days? 15 days?</p>



<p>At this point in the sprint, you have no data to make that projection.</p>



<p>It’s a bit like waking up in the morning, looking at your clock, but the only data you see is the year. It’s useful to know what year we’re in, but it doesn’t tell you if you’re running …</p></div></div>

<h4>The GPD P2 Max is a hyper-powered cross between a palm pilot and an ultrabook - it's a cyberdeck by any other name...</h4>

<p>The early 1990s were a great time to be a kid. There was the ever present threat of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls">nuclear annihilation</a>, we were constantly being reminded that <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291/">Greed was Good</a>, and it marked the advent of truly portable computing.</p>

<p>Sure, laptops had been <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2019/03/08/the-1978-xerox-notetaker-the-first-computer-to-be-used-on-a-commercial-flight-xerox-vintagecomputing-history/">available for a while by that point</a> - albeit at a price which would financial cripple small countries - but the first part of the final decade of the 20th century saw the arrival of computing devices which would actually fit in your pocket.</p>

<p>There was a kid in every school whose Dad had been given one by his work, decided it was too complex, and who <em>palm</em>ed it off to their offspring in the misguided belief it would help them organise their busy juvenile lives.</p>

<table>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_Series_3">Psion 3</a> had a keyboard and a screen. It had an address book, database software, contact managers, calculators, agendas, and world clocks - everything the high-powered 80's corporate executive could ever need to organise his high-powered 80s executive life.</p>

<p>To adolescents in the schoolyard, it had limited practical utility beyond being cool as hell - it could be flipped shut, and it could fit in your pocket.
</p>
<p>
Granted, owning one of these bad boys would not grant an amazing degree of popularity to the possessor, and the technological gap between the home and office computers of the day and the popular palmtops, meant that it would only ever be of limited utility.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Regardless, the palmtop computers were so cool as to be ice cold, and I have long wanted one which could be genuinely useful, fill the gaps left wide open by even the best mobile phones, and perform as well as a desktop PC. I wanted a   <a href="https://cyberdeck.cafe/">cyberdeck.</a></p>

<p>This led to a spree of purchases of Linux-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook">netbooks</a> and EeePCs in the early to mid 2000s - all of which were abandoned as underpowered, locked-down limited-use-case wastes of money not long after.</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>The dream of a cyberdeck died - or at least fell into a coma - until the Raspberry Pi came on the scene.</p>

<p>It was ultra-low power, tolerable performance, and cheap as chips. Pi-based Cyberdecks began appearing on reddit in the (incredibly long) run-up to the release of CDPR's <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>
<p>I even made my <a href="https://www.cyberpunks.com/super-simple-dirt-cheap-diy-portable-raspberry-pi-laptop/">own, super cheap, super low-tech version</a> which was published on another site.</p>


</td>

<img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/ghetto_cyberdeck.png" alt="The most ghetto cyberdeck... IN THE WORLD!">
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>But the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Pi</a>, excellent though it is, is a little <em>too</em> low powered to be used as a daily driver. Yes, you can use it as your main machine, but you’ll soon feel that it’s lacking… something.</p>

<p>And so, up until yesterday, I was using a 14” Dell E7470 for my everyday work and play, and carrying a Linux powered Oneplus 3 as my phone and for my mobile computing needs. The Oneplus, running <a href="https://www.ubports.com/">Ubuntu Touch</a> is great if privacy is your main concern, but as pocket sized computing platform, it’s just not there.</p>

<p>And then yesterday morning I smashed the screen of my Dell. Disaster! I write for a living, I work from home and I have deadlines. The repair is going to cost around 80 quid if I do it myself, and I would be offline for over a week. If a similar disaster occurred under normal circumstances, I’d work from the local library, but due to the current pandemic, that isn’t really an option.</p>

<p>Chinese hardware company GPD advertises the <a href="https://amzn.to/3iOQEoH">P2 Max</a> as “The world’s smallest Ultrabook,” and it is. There was also one for sale less than a mile away from me.</p>

<p>Money changed hands (at a suitable social distance), and I took my new purchase home with me.</p>

<h4> What's in the box?</h4>

<p>It’s a hella small box, and in it is a hella small, gunmetal grey laptop. It’s of comparable size to one of the palmtops of old, and I can pretty much cover the whole thing with one of my hands.</p>

<p>Open the lid, and there is a keyboard will full-sized keys. Just not very many of them.</p>

<p>There’s the usual QWERTY layout, cursors, CAPS, and numericals - but there a few noticeable absences. Only one shift, Alt and Ctrl, for instance. This isn’t a big deal as one hand can easily span the entire keyboard. There are no function keys either. The mousepad is about as small as it can be while still being usable. Again that’s OK as this tiny GPD ‘ultrabook’ comes with a 10 point touchscreen, and most of the time I use a USB optical mouse anyway.</p>

<p><img src="https://thecrow.uk/assets/gpd_P2_max_is_tiny.png" alt="Honestly, it's really small!"></p>

<p>The device is powered by a standard Type C USB of the same type I use to charge my mobile, and in return, offers two Type A USB ports (one on each side), a micro HDMI port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It’s not the most expansive array of ports, but it keeps the size and weight down.</p>

<p>The screen itself is a work of wonder. At 8.9 inches, it can support resolutions of up to 2560 x 1600 px. That’s insane. No-one on Earth has eyesight good enough to comfortably read text that small for an extended period. Yes, it’s just about do-able, and the text itself is perfectly formed, but eyestrain will quickly become an issue. After spending an evening at 1920 x 180, I eventually set it to an easy 1440 x 900 px.</p>

<p>So, it’s a teeny tiny laptop with a great screen and a good keyboard, but is it an ultrabook?</p>

<p>GPD certainly thinks so - it’s the machine’s headline selling point. Personally, I’m not even sure what an Ultrabook even <em>is</em>, apart from being a somewhat flexible marketing term.</p>

<h4>Specs matter</h4>

<p>Earlier, I mentioned the netbooks i previously owned. They failed as proto-cyberdecks because they were just not up to the task of everyday computing. They weren’t even really up to the task of basic web browsing.</p>

<p>The GPD P2 Max is different. The model I now own came with a 512GB SSD, and a solid 16GB of DDR4 RAM. That’s pretty solid. The processor is an eighth gen Intel. On paper at least, it’s similar to my currently unwell Dell.</p>

<p>Windows 10 Home edition booted to desktop in a few seconds -long enough for me to verify the specs before installing my OS of choice.</p>

<p>The Ubuntu Linux install took around 10 minutes, and i3 wnt quickly on top of that. I was able to retrieve the conf files from my old machine over SSH, and just like that, I was home.</p>

<p>Yes, it took a few minutes to get used to the keyboard, and I kept banging my fingers into the touchscreen and acidentally stealing focus, but meh. A person gets used to these things.</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>The best way of judging the performance is to tell you exactly how I’m using the machine at the moment, and how I’ve used it in the single day since it’s been in my house.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m writing this article in Atom on Workspace 5.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On workspace 1, I have three XFCE terminals open - running Bashtop, TaskWarrior, and an SSH to my Pi which is tailing my access logs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace two has a Firefox window with 27 open tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace three has another Firefox window with a dozen or so tabs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Workspaces one, two and three open automatically with their contents intact on boot.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace four has an incognito Firefox window, in which I’m doing research I probably won’t want to reference again.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace six is running a <a href="https://thecrow.uk/why-does-this-site-look-like-crap-getting-used-to-life-with-jekyll/">Jekyll</a> local server in a terminal, automatically updating the preview of this article on workspace four.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workspace seven is running a script which periodically checks for comments on this blog and brings them to my attention.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Workspace eight, I have <a href="https://thecrow.uk/freelancing-in-a-time-of-quarantine-and-why-rss-is-the-greatest/">QuiteRSS</a>, checking for writing jobs on my behalf.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In workspace nine, I’m conducting a war of attrition against Matthias Corvinus of the Hungarian Empire in <em>Civilization VI</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Is the GPD P2 Max capable? Hell yes. I’m using it exactly how I used my old laptop. I’ve been playing games through Steam. I’ve been  Windows games using WINE. I’ve been productive and I’ve been having fun.</p>

<p>And when I’ve finished, I can pick it up and put it in my pocket. Even better, the screen is covered with Gorilla Glass 4, so the accident which happened to my Dell can never happen again.</p>

<p>It’s a cyberdeck.</p>

	<h2>
Why though?
	</h2>
	<p>
I know, I know, the topic is already covered by some excellent tutorials and explanations. To name a few,

	<ul>
	<li>

	<li>
Bruce Dawson's <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/category/floating-point/">blog posts</a>
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
But I think that reexplaining some obscure concepts with different words (and buttons) might still help someone understand them better. And in the end, make fewer mistakes, write faster code, and create better software in general.
	</p>
	<p>
So I wrote this tutorial. It has C++ code samples, clickable models, and even quests and puzzles. I used everything, every trick I know to explain things in the clearest way possible. If you think your understanding of floating-point computations still could be improved after reading all the other tutorials, this page should help you.
	</p>
	<p>
Let's get started, shall we?
	</p>

	<h2>
But first! Meet the 6-bit <span id="index_integer_number">integer number</span>
	</h2>
	<p>
Floating-point numbers were invented to represent real numbers. Like <span>0.5</span> or <span>3.1415926</span>. The ones that can't be represented by integers like <span>1</span> or <span>3</span>. But in fact, floating-point numbers are made of integers, so you should probably learn them first.
	</p>
	<p>
At the very low-level, all computers do is crunch integers. And only some finite subset of them. Computers operate with bit tuples, and there are only as many different combinations of bits as <span>2<sup>n</sup></span> where <span>n</span> is the length of a tuple, and these combinations are your numbers.
	</p>
	<p>
If you have 1 bit, you can only have two numbers: 0 and 1. If you have 2 bits, there are 0, 1, 2, and 3. If you have 8 bits, you have 256 different numbers, if 16 — 65 536, 32 — 4 294 967 296, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
Since 2-bit tuples provide too few numbers and 64 bit — too many, here's a nice and compact model of a 6-bit integer number.
	</p>
	<canvas id="integer" width="640" height="200"></canvas>
	
	
	<form>
		<b>Quest 1.</b> Please make the model show <span>31</span>.
		
		
	</form>

	<p>
Integer numbers are not universally standardized but there are some common conventions. For instance, the most common way to represent negative integers is by using the higher half of the range.
	</p>
	<p>
This means that by constantly incrementing the model, at some point you'll see: <span>..., 29, 30, 31, -32, -31, -30, ...</span>
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 2.</b> Please make the model show <span>-32</span>.
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
It looks a little odd when you meet this jump, but it all makes perfect sense when we see all the range in one picture. Let's pick an even simpler model. The 1-digit decimal number will do.
	</p>
	<table>
	<tbody><tr><td><b>Unsigned 1-digit decimal</b></td><td><b>Signed 1-digit decimal<b></b></b></td></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr>
	<tr><td>5</td><td>-5</td></tr>
	<tr><td>6</td><td>-4</td></tr>
	<tr><td>7</td><td>-3</td></tr>
	<tr><td>8</td><td>-2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>9</td><td>-1</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>
	<p>
The first half of the range is shared between signed and unsigned types. Then there's a leap back for the signed ones. After that, they diverge by exactly half a range.
	</p>
	<p>
If you take overflows into consideration, it starts to seem natural. Yes, signed numbers overflow at half-range, but unsigned numbers overflow too, only half a range later. It's like two continuous rolls of numbers going along each other.
	</p>
	<table>
	<tbody><tr><td><b>Unsigned 1-digit decimal</b></td><td><b>Signed 1-digit decimal<b></b></b></td></tr>
	<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
	<tr><td>9</td><td>-1</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>0</span></td><td>0</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>1</span></td><td>1</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>2</span></td><td>2</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>3</span></td><td>3</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>4</span></td><td>4</td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>5</span></td><td><span>-5</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>6</span></td><td><span>-4</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>7</span></td><td><span>-3</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>8</span></td><td><span>-2</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td><span>9</span></td><td><span>-1</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td><span>0</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td><span>1</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td><span>2</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td><span>3</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td><span>4</span></td></tr>
	<tr><td>5</td><td>-5</td></tr>
	<tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<p>
Please don't write your code expecting this behavior, though. Integer overflows are not universally standardized. And even if they work properly for your case, exploiting overflows makes code obscure, error-prone, and often non-portable.
	</p>

	<form>
		<b>Puzzle 1.</b> What will this C++ program print out?
		<p>
This puzzle requires significant C++ knowledge. If you're not familiar with the language, feel free to guess.
		</p>
		<div>
		<pre id="code_1">  // built with Clang 3.8 on Intel Core i7
  uint16_t a = 50'000;
  uint16_t b = 50'000;
  uint64_t c = a*b;
  std::cout &lt;&lt; c;</pre>
		</div>
		
		
	</form>

	<p>
With proper convention, integer numbers may represent some non-integer values. For instance, <span>0.45</span> of a meter is <span>45</span> centimeters. <span>45.6</span> centimeters is <span>456</span> millimeters.
	</p>
	<div>
	<p>
456 mm = 45.6 cm = 0.456 m
	</p></div>
	<p>
It's just a matter of representation. It's all about where to put the decimal point.
	</p>

	<h2>
Speaking of which, meet the 6-bit <span id="index_fixed_point_number">fixed-point number</span>
	</h2>
	<p>
With things like price tags or body temperature, we know where the decimal point goes. These things could be manipulated with the decimal point in mind.
	</p>
	
	<p>
Just as that, we can turn an integer number into a fixed-point number by assigning a place to put the binary point. In this model, the binary point is put after two bits, so it's still an integer, but now it measures quarters, so it can now represent some subset of real numbers such as <span id="fp_15">1.5</span>.
	</p>
	<canvas id="fixed" width="640" height="200"></canvas>
	
	<p>
Fixed-point numbers are still integers, but they are integer numbers of fractions.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 3.</b> Please make the model show <span>-8</span>.
		
		
	</form>

	<p>
You can add and subtract them like the regular numbers, but you have to introduce more elaborate rules for division and multiplication. And you have to watch for overflows and underflows accordingly.
	</p>
	<p>
Sometimes fixed-points are fine, but they can get cumbersome with a lot of calculations. With fixed bit tuple size, you have to choose where to put the binary point to lose as little precision as possible on any arithmetic operation. Wouldn't it be great if something did that for you?
	</p>

	<h2>
And finally, meet the 6-bit <span id="index_floating_point_number">floating-point number</span>
	</h2>
	<p>
Floating-point numbers are that popular because they work fine even if you don't think about where the decimal point is where it shall appear after the computation.
	</p>
	<p>
They come from <i>scientific</i> (also known as <i>exponential</i>) notation. With this notation, you can compactly write both astronomical and subatomic values.
	</p>
	<div>
	<p>
	m<sub>Sun</sub>: <b>1.989e+30</b> kg</p><nobr>Mass of the Sun, which is 1989000000000000000000000000000 kg</nobr>
	<p>
	m<sub>e</sub>: <b>9.1093897e-31</b> kg</p><nobr>Mass of an electron, which is 0.0000000000000000000000000000091093897 kg</nobr>
	</div>
	<p>
Just like a number in scientific notation, a floating-point number has a sign, some meaningful digits, and an exponent.
	</p>
	<canvas id="floating" width="640" height="200"></canvas>
	
	<p>
The three major differences are:
	</p>
	<ol>
	<li>
it's all binary not decimal;
	</li>
	<li>
the exponent value goes before meaningful digits;
	</li>
	<li>
and since it's binary, and all the numbers, except for <span>0</span>, start with <span>1</span>, you don't even have to write down the first <span>1</span> most of the time. It will be there implicitly. Saves you a whole bit!
	</li>
	</ol>
	
	<form>
		<b>Quest 4.</b> Please make the model show <span>1</span>.
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
Only for the very small numbers, when we want our exponent to be smaller than we can afford, we omit the implied <span>1</span>. In scientific notation, it's like writing <span>0.00123e-45</span>. It's not normalized. So we call these numbers <i><span id="index_subnormal_numbers">subnormal numbers</span></i> or <i><span id="index_denormalized_numbers">denormalized numbers</span></i>.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 5.</b> Please make the model show <span>0.25</span>.
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
Since you're still working with bits, and every number is still just an integer in disguise, you can imagine a floating-point number as an integer number <nobr>of <span>2<sup>n</sup>s</span></nobr>.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 6.</b> Please make the model show <span>2</span>.
		
		
	</form>
   <p>
Unlike integer numbers, floating-point numbers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">standardized</a>, and the standard specifies several useful conventions. The whole range of possible bits consists not only of numbers, but of two distinct zeros, two values for infinitely large values, and a whole subrange of “not a number”s.
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
To understand what are the special infinite values for, you should probably understand floating-point zeros first.
	</p>
	<p>
They are not actual zeros. Instead, they model anything that is absolutely smaller than the smallest representable number. Of course, they may occasionally represent an actual zero, but there is no way to tell if they are. So they should be treated as small numbers and not <span>0</span>. And as such, they deserve to retain their signs.
	</p>
	<div>
	<pre id="code_2">  auto min_float
    = std::numeric_limits&lt;float&gt;::denorm_min();
  std::cout &lt;&lt; min_float;
  // prints 1.4013e-45


  std::cout &lt;&lt; min_float / 2.f;
  // prints 0


  std::cout &lt;&lt; -min_float / 2.f;
  // prints -0
	</pre>
	</div>
	<p>
The smallest representable number is the smallest denormalized number. One half of it is semantically a number, but pragmatically a zero.
	</p>
	<p>
Denormalized values are not universally available. If you don't want that precision, you can win some performance by turning them off.
	</p>
	<p>
Speaking of performance, some of the compiler optimizations are algebraic. This means that the compiler optimizes floating-point numbers such as if they were real. Usually, it's not a problem. Sometimes it is.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Puzzle 2.</b> What will this C++ program print out?
		<div>
		<pre id="code_3">  std::cout &lt;&lt; 0 - (min_float / 2.f);
		</pre></div>
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
When you divide a non-zero number by zero, you get infinity. And just like floating-point zeros are not zero, these are not infinite. These are just numbers that are too big to be represented.
	</p>
	<p>
There are also numbers that can't possibly be represented in this model at all, like square roots of negative numbers. Technically, they are still numbers, but being complex numbers and not real, they don't have the representation. Operations that take numbers as input and can't provide numbers as output return special “<span id="index_not_a_number">not a number</span>” values then.
	</p>

	<h2>
<span id="index_representation_error">Representation error</span>
	</h2>
	<p>
Of course, numbers that get to be represented in floating-point numbers, are usually represented with an error. We have only that many bits, that many combinations, and the real number's range is infinite. You can't squeeze an infinite range into a finite set.
	</p>
	<p>
When a number doesn't have the representation, we pick the nearest number that has one instead.
	</p>
	
	
	<p>
The difference between their values is our representation error.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 7.</b> Using the dial, please enter a number with the error of <nobr>exactly <span>0.001</span></nobr>.
		
		
	</form>
	<p>
The common misconception is: since our smallest representable numbers are small, the representation error should be small too. But remember, we are talking about integer numbers of <span>2<sup>n</sup></span>s. The greater the <span>n</span>, the greater the possible representation error is.
	</p>
	<form>
		<b>Quest 8.</b> Using the dial, please enter a number with the error <nobr>of <span>1000</span></nobr>.
		
		
	</form>

	<h2>
<span id="index_computational_error">Computational error</span>
	</h2>
	<p>
Still, the representation error is not our worst enemy. Any real-world number we collect from a sensor, or a user interface, has its own error anyway. And it usually dwarfs the representation error of floating-point numbers. 
	</p>
	<p>
However, as we process the data, we introduce computational error, too.
	</p>
	
	

	<p>
Computational error is not …</p></div></div>

January 26, 2021 | https://digitstodollars.com/2021/01/21/hardware-is-hard/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://digitstodollars.com/2021/01/21/hardware-is-hard/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>We have written a lot about the blind spot the US venture ecosystem has for <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2019/09/30/3042/">semiconductors</a> (<a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/08/10/not-a-drop-for-you/">and here</a>) and hardware more generally. We recently helped a venture firm conduct due diligence on an electronics company, which put us in the awkward position of having to walk in someone else’s shoes. Sympathy for the devil, and all that. In our posts we have attempted to be fair, pointing out that US VCs are making sensible economic decisions albeit on a short-sighted viewpoint. Investing in hardware is much more capital intensive and thus risky than investing in software. In this post, we want to work through some of the math behind that. </p>



<p>Let’s say we have a company, Unicorn Electronics, that wants to build The SmartHorn <sup>TM</sup>, a device that magically solves customers’ problems perfectly. How do we get the company to “escape velocity” – positive cashflow sufficient to fund the company’s immediate growth needs?</p>



<p>First, Unicorn needs to design the Horn. Depending on how complex the device is this can cost anywhere from $100,000 to $1 million, from a third party design shop. Some people can do this design themselves, others are going to need outside help. For our purposes, let’s say the Horn design costs $500,000. This amount gets the company the “blueprints” and a few prototypes.  </p>



<p>But most devices today are fairly complex. Even if the hard computation is done in the cloud or in the app, the device itself needs to be able to function, to be programmed and to communicate with the Internet. That means firmware. This is low-level software, and not only is their no standard “firmware” programming language or operating system, pretty much every chip company has its own instruction language. Hiring firmware engineers is not that expensive in dollars, but it can be very expensive in time. Here’s a typical scenario. The design shop hands the firmware designers some prototypes. The firmware team finds a bug that requires a new wire or capacitor. So the design firm has to build (by hand) a new prototype. The firmware team then finds that two of the chips are not speaking to each other – the Bluetooth and the temperature sensor for instance. Is the problem in one chip or the other or somewhere in the wiring in between? Often this will mean the design team needs to spin up yet another prototype. And since these teams are likely in different cities, if not different countries, every re-spin loses days in shipping and re-work. </p>



<p>So far, we have spent $500,000 and a month on the design, and $100,000 and four months on firmware.</p>



<p>Now we have to find a manufacturer. This company will need to create tools and molds as well as designing a manufacturing flow. They can do this fairly quickly, but as they are operating on expensive machine tools, they will have minimum quantity requirements. These can be as low as a few thousand units, but here is where the costs really start to add up. </p>



<p>Let’s say the SmartHorn costs $100 in parts and manufacturing, but the manufacturer requires a minimum of 5,000 units. Then the tricky part becomes sourcing parts. The global electronics supply chain is incredibly tight right now. <a href="https://digitstodollars.com/2020/10/27/what-is-happening-to-the-supply-chain/">We wrote about this back in October</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/business/auto-factories-semiconductor-chips.html">New York Times was catching up last week</a>. Lead times for many parts can be several months, and frustratingly it is hard to predict with often some of the lowest value parts in the shortest supply. So add $500,000 (5,000 units X $100 BOM) and four months. </p>



<p>Then we enter into a whole sea of minutiae. The device will need various certifications UL, FCC, etc. Add $50,000, but fortunately this can be done while the manufacturing is ramping up. But there are bigger costs as well such as insurance. Most distributors (i.e. retail) and enterprise customers will want the company to maintain a range of insurance policies, tack on another $50,000 or so. Then we have to factor in shipping and customs and taxes, so maybe $20 per device. </p>



<p>Next up, the company has to factor in warranties and returns. The accountants have requirements for setting reserves for these, but a rough rule of thumb (sufficient for our purposes here only) is 10% of the costs of the materials needs to be set aside to cover the cost of returns and replacements. </p>



<p>Finally, the company has to contend with marketing. This amount can range from nothing to A Lot, depending on whether they are selling to consumers or to a single large enterprise customer. A basic PR budget and some content marketing runs about $50,000, plus or minus. </p>



<p>Adding this up we have the following budget:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Item</td><td>Amount</td><td data-align="center">Time</td></tr><tr><td>Design</td><td>$500,000</td><td data-align="center">1 Month</td></tr><tr><td>Firmware</td><td>$100,000</td><td data-align="center">4 Months</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacture</td><td>$500,000</td><td data-align="center">4 Months</td></tr><tr><td>Certification</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Insurance</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Shipping </td><td>$100,000</td><td data-align="center">1 Month</td></tr><tr><td>Marketing</td><td>$50,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Sub-total Cost of Goods Sold</td><td>$1,350,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>Warranty Reserve</td><td>$135,000</td><td data-align="center"></td></tr><tr><td><strong>TOTAL</strong></td><td><strong>$1,485,000</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>9 Months</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>All of this has to take place before the company can collect any revenue, unless they have done some form of crowdsourcing. So just to break even the company has to charge $297/unit, and to get a 50% gross margin the retail price would need to be $594. </p>



<p>We also need to factor in software costs. For this example, we will assume Unicorn Electronics does their own app and back-end software. The company could probably build all of the hardware and software with a team of ten people. If the average salary is $150,000 year (assume some expensive onshore talent and some less expensive offshore talent), the total comes out to $1.5 million for a year. </p>



<p>So $1.485 million in hardware costs and $1.5 million for headcount, for a total of $2.985 million. The company then sells 5,000 units for $594 a piece or $2.97 million in revenue and yielding a net <em><strong>loss</strong></em> of ($15,000). Hardware can be dispiriting.</p>



<p>The good news is that there is a heavy fixed costs component to this model, so tweaking a few variables can have a big impact. For instance, if they raise prices by $6/unit to an even $600, the net profit goes to $15,000 (positive). Sell an additional 1,000 units and the net profits are close to half a million dollars. If they sell 100,000 units then the company has a path to becoming a true Unicorn. There is a lot of leverage in the model, which is why people keep trying to build hardware. </p>



<p>That being said, the realities of hardware can be daunting. Take the $3 million the company needs to get a product out the door, a similarly sized team could build a software application that can potentially grow much faster and they would still have a million dollars to do customer acquisition. Compounding this, the software would come with a recurring revenue stream. The trouble with hardware is that for the company to grow, they have to come out with the Smart Horn 2 and the Smart Horn 3, and go through all of the above again, and again. </p>



<p>Hardware has immense financial leverage, but the upfront costs and more crucially the time required are daunting. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure><div></div></figure><section><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><a href="https://rudderstack.com/blog/the-complete-customer-data-stack/">Your data warehouse is the platform your customer data stack is built on</a>. It acts as a robust central system for driving critical business decisions while maintaining a unified source of truth for your entire organization. Businesses are constantly looking to improve their product or marketing strategies to get an extra edge over their competitors. Data warehouses help you get that competitive edge by serving analytical data to make fact-based decisions that drive innovation and business growth. While teams turn those analysis-driven insights into strategies and tactics, it’s tough to activate the warehouse’s actual data that the insights are based on.</p>
<p>To make it easier to utilize and activate all of the analytics your teams build, we’re launching a new feature called RudderStack Warehouse Actions. Warehouse Actions enables you to leverage processed customer data stored in your data warehouse and directly route this enriched information to your entire customer data stack.</p>
<p>In this post, we detail Warehouse Actions. We explain how configuring your warehouse as a data source can fully unlock your data’s value, how Warehouse Actions works, some of its benefits, and how to set it up in RudderStack.</p>
<div> <p> <iframe title="" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iafB9gyoWtc?rel=0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> </div>
<h2>Why Warehouse Actions?</h2>
<p>Data warehouses are an indispensable tool as they enable decision-makers to access data quickly through business intelligence tools, SQL clients, and other analytical applications. Without a data warehouse in place, you are forced to rely on the individual (siloed) applications you use and the raw data from each for analysis. </p>
<p>A warehouse helps guarantee that your data is unified, consistent, and high-quality by eliminating duplicate records, errors, and inconsistent information. It also enables your teams to perform deep analysis and modeling on your data, something that is nearly impossible without a warehouse.  Given the quality of the data in your warehouse and your teams’ can derive from it, it makes sense to use the customer data in your warehouse to activate your customer tools. </p>
<p>Warehouse Actions makes feeding customer insights into your customer data pipelines easy by turning tables into event streams that can trigger activation in your downstream customer tools. </p>
<h2>How Warehouse Actions Works</h2>

    </span><figcaption>Warehouse Actions Architecture</figcaption></figure>
<p>RudderStack makes it easy to collect data from different sources, event and non-event, and securely ingest them into your warehouse. Once data is successfully ingested, your teams can then apply advanced queries or models to generate valuable data composites (either tables or views) that are frequently materialized (aka written) as their tables and stored in your data warehouse. For example, <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> can be used to transform data within your warehouses by simply writing select statements. dbt turns these select statements into tables and views.</p>
<p>With Warehouse Actions, any updates to the analytics-derived datasets that live in your warehouse can be collected by RudderStack and pushed as events to all of your customer tools.</p>
<h2>Benefits of Using a Warehouse Actions</h2>
<p>Even if collected and unified across multiple touchpoints, customer event data may lack the necessary information to build complete or enriched customer profiles. Event data alone doesn’t give context into any of the information stored in your customer master data, campaign data, or even your advertising data. When you have data from sources beyond events that could make your customer profiles better or enable deeper, more meaningful analysis, you need a data warehouse. Your warehouse is where you can combine all of these different types of customer data to define better customer profiles and derive more meaningful insights from more in-depth analysis. With Warehouse Actions, you can route the customer insights in your data warehouse to third-party tools for further activation. </p>
<p>For example, when running a new marketing campaign, you are often challenged with gathering the “right data” for personalized emails,  push notifications, or targeted audiences. This “right data” often starts with simple data, such as name and email address, and then expands to complex customer data, including behavioral traits, products viewed, subscriptions enrolled, and so on. All of the data you need to make the “right data” is either already in your data warehouse or easily could be. </p>
<p>Warehouse Actions lets you action on the “right data”, routing the outputs of your team’s analysis to all of your customer tools. As a result, it is significantly easier to help your marketing teams build and automate things like customized recommendations for campaigns. Also, it allows your product team to build win-back flows for users likely to churn. </p>
<h2>Setting up Warehouse Actions in RudderStack</h2>
<p>We will use a real-world example to walk through how to set up Warehouse Actions. Let’s say your company wants to use the number of log-ins over seven days to calculate a lead score for new users. Multiple log-ins will increase the lead score. </p>
<p>Let’s also say that because you use RudderStack Event Stream and RudderStack Cloud Extract, you have the log-in event data from your website, iOS app, and Android app, as well as the lead records from Salesforce in your warehouse. You can use SQL (or another method of querying the data) to build a simple model for calculating each lead score. The result is a table in your warehouse that lists Salesforce leads and their associated score. </p>
<p>In Snowflake, the query to calculate lead score and produce a table might look something like this: </p>

<p>With Warehouse Actions, you can easily pull the updated lead profiles from the table in Snowflake back through RudderStack and send them to Salesforce, meaning your sales team will have the most up-to-date status on new signups. Because the table is translated into an event stream, you can also route it to any other tools that need the lead score, like marketing automation and customer experience platforms. </p>
<p>Configuring Warehouse Actions is simple and only takes a few minutes.</p>

<h2>Pachyderm Uses Warehouse Actions to Automate Their Onboarding E-mails</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.pachyderm.com/">Pachyderm</a>, an enterprise-grade, open-source data science platform, implemented Warehouse Actions for lead qualification. After creating an account, the first action Pachyderm wants their customers to do is create a workspace. They encourage users to do this in a series of drip emails sent through <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a>, but they don’t want these drip emails to go out to customers that have already created a workspace. This data is already in their data warehouse, and now, with Warehouse Actions, they can automatically exclude these customers from this drip email series.</p>

    <p>2021-01-26 08:59:23+00:00</p>
    <p><a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a> is the “new” (13 years old already) display server technology on Linux, which is supposed to replace
the antiquated X11. It promises better security, performance, portability, everything, compared to X11, and
it sure does deliver, provided that you’re not using <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/">unsupported graphics cards</a>.
You can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIctzAQOe44">this talk / rant about X11</a> to get an idea about how bad it is.</p>

<p>Some power users also haven’t switched to Wayland because their window manager doesn’t have a
Wayland equivalent (XMonad, Awesome, Bspwm and the others, all having their unique feature-set). Some may wonder “hmm maybe I can port it myself”. I wrote this post to make you (re)consider that.</p>

<p>One of the main ideas of Wayland is that it’s merely a specialised IPC protocol, and the communication is
strictly between the clients (applications on your screen mainly) and the server.</p>

<p>The server is what we are interested in now. Unlike X11, where the server is X.Org and the window manager
is just an X11 client with special privileges, on Wayland the window manager is also a server and a compositor. In fact, the correct terminology is “Wayland compositor”. This piece of software has the
task of doing everything it wants with the clients, which is usually among the lines of showing them
on the screen and giving them inputs events from your keyboards, mice, touchscreens etc. In fact, <a href="https://mir-server.io/">no one
stops you from leaving window management as an API</a>.</p>

<p>On my laptop, I prefer using GNOME under Wayland, because it has the most stable, fully-featured and “just works”
experience there is. However, I wanted a better way of organising windows on my screen than leaving them
shuffled around. Tiling was also not good, because every time you launch a new window, the others get
shrunk to fit, which is not good on a small laptop display.</p>

<p>Luckily I discovered <a href="https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM">PaperWM</a>. It’s perfect for laptops, instead of
shrinking your windows, it just renders them off-screen. To switch between one or the other you can just
flick three fingers on the touchpad. It’s great. It’s also “glossy” and polished and has great UI and animations.</p>

<p>It has some disadvantages though, mainly concerning its speed. I find it sluggish, and it’s no surprise that
like all other GNOME Shell extensions, it’s a JavaScript behemoth. PaperWM still uses the GNOME Tweener
framework for its animations, which is entirely written in JS. Because of that, it needs to communicate with the main
GNOME compositor process on each operation. And because we’re talking animations, said operations happen
for <em>every frame</em>. That means there is JS executed for every frame, 60 times a second. It’s horrible!</p>

<p>BTW nowadays GNOME uses animations implemented in C (since GNOME 3.34), the “GNOME runs JS on every frame” statement is for the most part false today.</p>

<p>Because of the inefficiency of PaperWM, it also means that it drains my battery quickly, which is bad for a laptop!</p>

<p>So, because I am a student with a lot of free time, together with <a href="https://alexge50.com/">Alex</a> we figured we shall develop a scrollable tiling (PaperWM-like) Wayland compositor. It’s called <a href="https://gitlab.com/cardboardwm/cardboard">Cardboard</a> (get it??). It also has the nicety of
being controlled and configured by a remote control program, like bspwm.
Neither Alex nor I had experience with any kind of Wayland development. However, I wrote <a href="https://tudorr.ro/software/windowchef/">an X11 window manager</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tudurom/disputils/">some XRandR querying utilities</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tudurom/ruler">a window rule daemon</a>. Alex has experience
with <a href="https://git.alexge50.com/a/gie">graphics programming</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alexge50/libwatchpoint">C++ devilry</a>.</p>

<p>Our “tech stack” was <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots</a>, which is an exceptional Wayland compositor library (apart from its lack of documentation). The description from the README is spot on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About 50,000 lines of code you were going to write anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I (because I wrote most of the Wayland-interfacing code) realised soon that there is still a lot of boilerplate involved in writing a compositor, much more than for an X11 window manager,
namely setting up your own rendering code, registering and storing input devices and screens in your own data structures, passing input events to windows, calculating bounds for bars
and other overlays (courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlr-protocols/blob/master/unstable/wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1.xml"><code>layer-shell</code></a>) and others. X11 handles all of this for you,
the window manager just reacts to events regarding window inputs to establish its behaviour. With Wayland, you handle everything, even with wlroots. The upside is that if you don’t like the way X11 does something
(which is a given), not only that you can do it in your own way on Wayland, you are required to do so.</p>

<p>Because we weren’t really prepared for what writing a compositor involved, we thought that it must be approached like a “normal” program: split code into modules, each with their own responsibilities, call wlroots to do its thing, the usual stuff.
We are writing a program in our way and wlroots lets us “interface with Wayland”. Or so we thought.</p>

<p>We were as careful as possible to separate responsibilities into different structures / classes, yet we ended up with most functions taking a pointer to <code>Server</code> as their first parameter.
<code>Server</code> is a singleton holding all the other “sub-modules” in it. It represents the compositor itself. The reason most functions need <code>Server</code> is that everything is related to everything,
not because of a mistake in structuring the code, but by design. This is what a compositor requires, the problem of writing a compositor is somewhat complex because it has a great deal variables ranging
from input events, drawing on the screen, creating behaviours that the user leverages, reacting to application events. All of them can affect the other, you can not separate the thing into modules.
The best you can do is separate the code in different files and folders based on some criteria, like grouping data structures with related routines.</p>

<p>As an example, let’s take damage tracking. For starters, because the compositor is also tasked with rendering the content and displaying it on the screen, we have some rendering code that runs on every frame.
Damage tracking is tracking which areas of the screen have changed in an amount of time. An example would
be typing a letter in the terminal. The place where the cursor is changes to the letter you typed, and the cursor advances.
If there is no change, the frame is not rendered, as it would look
exactly the same as the previous one, which would be a waste of processor time.
This way, instead of re-rendering everything 60 times a second (I assume that you use a common display), we can render and paint as little as possible to account for the changed region.
You can read <a href="https://emersion.fr/blog/2019/intro-to-damage-tracking/">an introduction to damage tracking</a> written by one of the main developers of wlroots.</p>

<p>I have just implemented the most basic form of damage tracking: do not render the frame if nothing on the screen changes.
It doesn’t track the damage itself, just that it exists.
To do this, I first added a <code>wlr_output_damage</code> object to my <code>Output</code> structure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct Output {
</span>    struct wlr_output* wlr_output;
    struct wlr_output_damage* wlr_output_damage;
<span>+   struct wlr_box usable_area;
</span>    ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This structure tracks the damage accumulated per-output, as rendering is also per-output (this means that you can use screens of different refresh rates, yay!). However, to make this initial attempt at
damage tracking easier, I decided to trigger rendering for all attached outputs. I added a <code>set_dirty()</code> function to the <code>OutputManager</code> class that does just that:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>OutputManager</span><span>::</span><span>set_dirty</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>output</span> <span>:</span> <span>outputs</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>wlr_output_damage_add_whole</span><span>(</span><span>output</span><span>.</span><span>wlr_output_damage</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This marks every output as entirely damaged, and as such triggers a render.</p>

<p>With this function set into place, I had to identify when does the “screen” change, namely when a window “commits” (changes its contents) and when a window is moved. The window move is one example
of the way everything is related to everything in the …</p></article></div>

    <p>You may have heard that TypeScript has been taking the web development space by storm in the <a href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">last</a> <a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/javascript-flavors/typescript/">few</a> <a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/javascript-flavors/">years</a>, bringing to it static types. I believe the same thing is starting to happen in the world of Python, where type checkers like <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/">mypy</a>,  <a href="https://pyre-check.org/">Pyre</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/pyright">Pyright</a> are increasingly used, at least where Python is used by companies to write large systems.</p>

<p>For the last several releases of Python, there have been an increasing number of type checking features added to each release by various PEPs:</p>




<p>The traffic on <a href="https://mail.python.org/archives/list/typing-sig@python.org/">typing-sig</a>, the mailing list where most major new typing features are proposed and designed, has also been seeing increasing traffic year over year.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I personally have found type checking to be very useful when working on large Python applications<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. It helps me find numerous small errors that are introduced during regular development<!-- such as import errors-->. Sure, most of these errors would be caught by the automated tests that I write for each new feature anyway<!-- TODO: footnote+link to TDD or similar practice? -->, but the type checker can find a whole bunch of errors all at once without even running the program, which decreases cycle times when adding new features:</p>

<p>Without type checking I tend to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat 4-6 times, in rapid succession:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Run program to manually test.</li>
<li>Find basic error (like a missing import).</li>
<li>Fix basic error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>But <em>with</em> type checking I can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write a bunch of new code.</li>
<li><strong>Run the type checker. Get a report of 4-6 basic errors. Fix basic errors immediately.</strong></li>
<li>Debug/fix deeper errors in the new code.</li>
</ul>


<p>I appreciate this increased productivity that type checking gives me when working on large programs. And I hope that more Python users try type checking for themselves, especially as Python gains an increasing number of related features in recent releases. It’s an exciting time to be a Python developer!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rust has a very lively and fast-paced open source ecosystem, with a ton of contributors working on a ton of awesome projects.</p><p>And if you are asking – what can I build in Rust? The answer is almost everything.</p><p>This article will feature some of the open-source Rust libraries, frameworks, and repositories that could be useful to study or use for your own project.</p><p>For your convenience, I’ve split them into fields such as web development, game development, blockchain, and others. Let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="web-development-frameworks-for-rust">Web development frameworks for Rust</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/t4/t4mp0qkr.1_(45)_(1).jpg" alt="Rust web development" loading="lazy"></p><p>Can you build a web app with Rust? Definitely!</p><p>Rust has multiple extremely fast web frameworks – Rocket, Actix Web, and Yew – and you can use the one that matches your needs and preferences.</p><h3 id="rocket">Rocket</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket">Rocket</a> is the most accessible web framework in the Rust ecosystem for beginners. It is highly customizable and helps you kickstart a new application quickly. At the same time, it avoids a lot of unnecessary boilerplate. Rocket also has many features included, which means that you won’t need to go far from the framework to build everything you need.</p><p>In contrast to Actix Web, the framework runs on nightly Rust – the “experimental” version of the language.</p><h3 id="actix-web">Actix Web</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/actix/actix-web">Actix Web</a> is usually thought to be more performant and stable than Rocket. Underneath, it works with the actor model used in <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-erlang#process-oriented">Erlang</a> and <a href="https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/actors.html">Akka</a>.</p><p>In contrast to Rocket, it’s less “batteries included”, meaning that you will most likely need to use third-party libraries for extra functionality.</p><h3 id="yew">Yew</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/yewstack/yew">Yew</a> is a Rust framework for creating web apps with WebAssembly. Among its main benefits, it lists a component-based framework like in React and Elm, outstanding performance because of the multi-thread support, and JavaScript interoperability.</p><p>As of now, it is not production-ready but should be an excellent choice for side projects and internal tooling, especially if you want to work with WASM.</p><h3 id="zola">Zola</h3><p>If you need something quick and simple to serve a static website, <a href="https://github.com/getzola/zola">Zola</a> is a fantastic tool to create fast and scalable web pages without any other dependencies or JS bloat.</p><h3 id="warp">Warp</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">Warp</a> is a web server framework written in Rust. In comparison to Rocket and Actix, it is rather slim for a web framework and will provide you only with basic functionality out of the box.</p><h2 id="game-development">Game development</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/cu/cubf89sc.2_(36)_(1).jpg" alt="Rust game development" loading="lazy"></p><p>Rust is exceptional for game development for the same reason that C++ is: it is predictably performant. Here are some of the engines you can use to build your own Rust game.</p><h3 id="bevy">Bevy</h3><p>Two of the main Rust game engines are Bevy and Amethyst. Among them, <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">Bevy</a> is the newer and cooler one. It is a simple, data-driven engine and can essentially be called Amethyst 2.0 since it is heavily inspired by it.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qjc0V58lB7A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>For more info on Bevy, you can check out the <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/">Bevy book</a>.</p><h3 id="amethyst">Amethyst</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst">Amethyst</a> is the more mature one of the two and, because of that, has more features that you might need for a large-scale project and better integrations with 3rd party libraries. But, Bevy is catching up fast. If you are searching for an engine for your new project, I’d recommend looking at them both and seeing which one you like better.</p><h3 id="ggez">ggez</h3><p>If you are searching for something simple to start off, <a href="https://github.com/ggez/ggez">ggez</a> is a lightweight cross-platform game framework for making 2D games with minimal friction.</p><hr><p>If you want to read more on game development in Rust, check out <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">Are we game yet?</a></p><h2 id="operating-systems">Operating systems</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/zd/zdu35vif.3_(34)_(1).jpg" alt="Rust operating systems" loading="lazy"></p><p>Rust is an excellent alternative to C in operating system development since it offers the same level of performance while taking care of memory safety.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've made it to the third and final part. Incredible. I applaud you. <br></p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/blog/2020-in-review-1">Part 1: The Product and the Trivia Itself </a></li><li><a href="https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/blog/2020-in-review-2">Part 2: The Business Side of WCT</a></li><li>Part 3: The Technical Side of WCT ( &gt;&gt; you're reading this part)</li></ul><p>We love writing trivia and we love turning that trivia-love into trivia-money, but we also love making software. At the end of the day, without software I’m just a man yelling out random trivia facts into my webcam.<br></p><p>Here’s the four key technical areas where we invested Ryan’s brainpower:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Transitioning to Webflow</li><li>A/B Testing Trivia Difficulty Settings</li><li>Digging the Distribution of Slack and Teams</li><li>Automation and Algorithms</li></ol><h2>1. Transitioning to Webflow</h2><p>Remember how earlier I wrote that co-founder Ryan had written 100% of our code? Well, we decided to make life easier by moving the front end “marketing site” off Ryan’s plate and onto mine.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Inspired by this <a href="https://twitter.com/tylertringas/status/1250521285630836741?s=21">Tyler Tringas tweet</a>, we started looking into what it would take to migrate our existing “marketing site” onto a “no-code” platform like Webflow. Well, not like Webflow. Specifically Webflow.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We found a contractor through Webflow’s <a href="https://experts.webflow.com/">market of “Experts”</a> and in two weeks we had fully migrated our site.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/600fc4d7405fce7407ccfeb2_0qaOYceifcBgW2wIF5bw4lbZMUZJwYAFAidQZ08w2_mP8N2LMRcFEXmxIHRX02wivu-DEzeWXj33cVVC5-7ZuBXL02WFJGfewz6KdpMSqp-OfDE4Imjiz1KgDf5eO3UmUTNIOEPH.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The website today as seen via Webflow.</figcaption></figure><p>Our site. Not our entire app. We created a subdomain so that everything behind “auth” (i.e. logging in) remains app.watercoolertrivia.com. That is our web application, and Ryan builds those pages with our other engineering contributors.<br></p><p>Moving the marketing site to my plate meant I could build new pages quickly, run promotions, and set up design tests without slowing down Ryan from building more important and more impactful features. Plus I got to up-skill. I’m no Webflow expert, but I can scratch together a <a href="http://yearly-faves.com/">fun side project</a> every now and then on the platform now. <br></p><h2>2. A/B Testing Trivia Difficulty Settings</h2><p>A/B testing is one of the many deities in the polytheistic church of Silicon Valley. Or something. So we hopped aboard.<br></p><p>Specifically, we’d heard for a few months that groups were disengaged during their free four-week trial of Water Cooler Trivia because the trivia questions were too hard. We heard this feedback, but didn’t act. That makes us bad entrepreneurs. Oops!<br></p><p>Then we did act.&nbsp;</p><ol role="list"><li>We tweaked what it means to be an “Easy” quiz. It used to mean that we give you questions with an average 70% correct. We moved that to a floor instead of an average.</li><li>For half of new trials, we <em>defaulted</em> the group into the Easy setting rather than the Medium difficulty setting we had traditionally used as default.<br></li></ol><p>Making that change to half the groups meant we could measure the impact.</p><h3>The results</h3><p>Ultimately, the easier difficulty setting had a statistically-significant impact on increasing the share of free trials that converted to paying Water Cooler Trivia customers. Specifically,&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>For groups with easier quizzes, the share submitted increased by 5 percentage points (+10% relative)</li><li>For groups with easier quizzes, the # of correct responses per quiz increased from 5.1 to 5.8 per quiz (most quizzes are 10 questions). Getting more questions right feels good.</li><li>For groups with harder quizzes, they actively <em>changed</em> their difficulty setting away from the default at 2.5x the rate of groups with easier quizzes<br></li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/600fc4d78be75fd0ab80c098_YCICSmmsV_F2HFnlX6Iw7a8htrNM6VkcrDjkNIWGCWRF8tVpvpn8VJbtw5HUhkGslaJ4LLh1RYqdT_xzHTaVRl3mUsDe-YxSSSIyMyAEMj-D0C_y8XLiijG9jaOltTEZ_jtCB0WC.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Yep, we track our experiment results in Google Sheets.</figcaption></figure><p>So we rolled out the winning treatment. And eventually we launched even more difficulty settings. Accessibility rules.</p><h2>3. Digging the Distribution of Slack and Teams</h2><p>Technically our Slack integration was released in late 2019 and our Teams integration was released in early 2021. <em>Editor’s note: the integration is in the final stages of Microsoft’s approval process as of Jan 25, 2021</em>. However, we still consider integrations a key part of our year.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/600fc4d7ace92c3cb295bc25_nwdtr8PDiCecKwFj7tycNeD2EUG9_ruXUa222ZKUgerLRypAm1B3ZqQyoBSTrEQ7GXDqh1Ldw8F2kFCIL-jEOuKJTuXfnxWEIhAEpV6X2NBMPF-GgFpqTesr9gQB_ZZrGTMtewqw.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Slack works on mobile as you can clearly tell here.</figcaption></figure><p>Groups that sign up via Slack engage with Water Cooler Trivia about 2.5x more than groups that sign up via email. Realizing that, we added “Sign up with Slack” directly to our homepage. The popularity of both Slack and Teams exploded during the shift to remote work, so we doubled down on our product marketing and experience in the Slack and Teams apps.&nbsp;</p><h2>4. Automation and Algorithms</h2><p>Free-text trivia rules. It’s more satisfying to pull that European capital or Indonesian ingredient from the back of your mind than randomly guessing multiple choice option C.<br></p><p>Of course, grading free-text responses is significantly more challenging than multiple-choice and true-false. We increase the challenge by declaring “spelling doesn’t matter” on each quiz. It’s cool with us if you don’t know the difference between Schwarzenegger and Schwartzenegger.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/600fc4d7b8169256a65024e8_7e98ggQzpLL_mBw4FpCn_oVrc2QbtZBRRsFIooEVjMBGQVMuRgZKqMtOlWQQ7wnGaXi-qIvNM6ud9jdTAAxF9vXuPsy2XMpTTOKcmInKGlnv0-Q0bpaSJSf7GwAyWxUSdpK3Xofi.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>We did use a keyboard to make these changes, but it wasn't this keyboard.</figcaption></figure><p>Historically, we’ve used a few clever tricks to keep false negatives and positives low (&lt;0.5% of all responses). As the business has grown, we’ve had more manual grading on our plate, often requiring grading in the middle of the night.<br></p><p>We worked with a data scientist to assess eight different free-text matching algorithms on a set of thousands of our own hand-graded trivia responses. Some of the concepts:</p><ul role="list"><li>Vowel-stripping</li><li>Levenshtein distance</li><li>Token sort ratio</li><li>Token set ratio<br></li></ul><p>Unsurprisingly, we quickly discovered a tradeoff between&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>Increasing the share of responses “autograded” and</li><li>Minimizing error rate<br></li></ul><p>At one extreme, the “fuzzy partial ratio” matching algorithm (more detail <a href="https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy">here</a>) was the most “aggressive” variant.&nbsp; Although it would have reduced our manual grading by ~50%, it was likely to introduce hundreds of grading mistakes per week.&nbsp;<br></p><p>We opted for a more conservative approach: “fuzzy token sort ratio.” We expect it to reduce our manual grading burden by ~10-15% without adding an increase in errors.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, in way more detail than you wanted to know, that was our 2020 at Water Cooler Trivia HQ. We’re thrilled to have you with us as we roll out more features and <a href="http://app.watercoolertrivia.com/signup">keep the weekly trivia fun rolling</a> for your team in 2021.</p></div><div><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eac6192807ea6b9679cf771/5fd2e2b18c2626f02925e9ad_Screen%20Shot%202020-12-07%20at%201.31.43%20PM.png" height="148" alt="Collin Waldoch - one of the Water Cooler Trivia founders"></p><div><p>Collin Waldoch is a co-founder of Water Cooler Trivia.&nbsp;He writes the questions.

<a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sq/index.html"><code>sq</code></a>, version 0.23, which is meant for general use.</p>
<p><code>sq</code> is a command-line tool that intends to expose much (but not all!)
of the functionality that the library provides.  Although we fully
intend for <code>sq</code> to be an OpenPGP swiss army knife, and that the truly
arcane should—in general—be possible, we firstly want <code>sq</code> to be
usable by humans at the command line.  We understand this to mean that
it should be possible to use <code>sq</code> to tweak and twiddle OpenPGP data.
But, those who have the desire to use Sequoia to frob it will need to
use the library.  And, they are probably better served by it anyway.</p>
<p><code>sq</code> has a subcommand-style interface similar to git.  This has the
advantage that every command has its own option name space, which
makes it much easier to understand exactly what options influence a
given command.</p>
<p>In terms of functionality, <code>sq</code> already provides the base operations
that any OpenPGP user needs in their day-to-day use: key generation
(<code>sq key generate</code>), encryption (<code>sq encrypt</code>) &amp; decryption (<code>sq decrypt</code>), signing (<code>sq sign</code>) &amp; verification (<code>sq verify</code>), key
certification (<code>sq certify</code>), and key server (<code>sq keyserver</code>) &amp; <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service-11">web
key directory</a> (WKD) (<code>sq wkd</code>) interaction.  It also includes some
utility functions.  It can generate a WKD (<code>sq wkd generate</code>), encode
and decode <a href="https://autocrypt.org/level1.html#the-autocrypt-header">Autocrypt headers</a> (<code>sq autocrypt</code>), manipulate keyrings
(<code>sq keyring</code>), inspect OpenPGP-related data like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_(command)"><code>file</code></a> does (<code>sq inspect</code>), and pretty print an OpenPGP file’s contents (<code>sq packet dump</code>).</p>
<p><code>sq</code> is still missing a fair amount of functionality.  In particular,
there is no public or private key store.  (Although prototypes exist.)
This means all OpenPGP certificates must be stored in files, which is
not scalable.  Also, many necessary and useful commands are still
missing.  For instance, it is not currently possible to add new
subkeys to a certificate, or change their expiration date.</p>
<p><code>sq</code> is also not ready to be used from scripts.  Although we are
unlikely to change the current API, the bigger problem is that <code>sq</code>’s
output is not machine readable.  In the medium term, we plan to add a
<code>JSON</code>-output mode to every command.  Given the legion of <code>JSON</code>
parsers, this should effectively eliminate the need for tools that
consume <code>sq</code>’s output to have to parse it manually, and will hopefully
eliminate an entire class of common security-sensitive bugs.</p>
<p>Until now, we haven’t published <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sequoia-sq"><code>sq</code> on <code>crates.io</code></a>, and we’ve
discouraged packagers from including it in their distribution.  We now
think that <code>sq</code> is ready for general use.  If you have suggestions,
please <a href="https://sequoia-pgp.org/contribute/">reach out</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-demo">A Quick Demo</h2>
<p>Creating an OpenPGP key is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>$ sq key generate --export /tmp/alice.sec -u 'Alice &lt;alice@example.org&gt;'
</code></pre><p><code>sq</code> saves the key in <code>/tmp/alice.sec</code> and a generic revocation
certificate in <code>/tmp/alice.sec.rev</code>.</p>
<p>We can use <code>sq inspect</code> to examine the new key’s structure:</p>
<pre><code>$ sq inspect /tmp/alice.sec
/tmp/alice.sec: Transferable Secret Key.

</code></pre><p>Here we see that <code>sq</code> uses ECC by default, and generates a signing
subkey and an encryption subkey.  (<code>sq key generate</code> has options to
tweak both the cipher suite and the key’s structure.)  <code>sq</code> generates
a signing subkey by default to prevent an attacker from repurposing a
signature over data as a certification or binding signature.</p>
<p>The secret key material is unencrypted by default.  Supplying the
<code>--with-password</code> option will cause <code>sq</code> to prompt for a password and
use it to encrypt the secret key material.</p>
<p>We can use <code>sq packet dump</code> to get even more details:</p>

</code></pre><p>For the sake of brevity, I’ve only shown the User ID and the
corresponding self signature.  An interesting thing to note here is
the <code>salt@notations.sequoia-pgp.org</code> notation.  This is a random
32-byte value, which Sequoia inserts into every signature by default.
Because it is unpredictable, it is harder for an attacker to trick a
user into signing a specific message.</p>
<p>It is possible to get even more details by supplying the <code>--hex</code>
option to <code>sq packet dump</code>.  This causes it to print a descriptive map
of the packets' contents, which is useful if you are dissecting an
OpenPGP message.</p>

</code></pre><p>To turn a key into a certificate (i.e., to remove the secret key
material), we can use the <code>sq keyring filter</code> subcommand:</p>
<pre><code>$ sq keyring filter --to-certificate /tmp/alice.sec &gt; /tmp/alice.pgp
</code></pre><p>And using <code>sq inspect</code>, we see that we now have a certificate and not a
secret key:</p>
<pre><code>$ sq inspect /tmp/alice.pgp
/tmp/alice.pgp: OpenPGP Certificate.
...
</code></pre><p><code>sq keyring filter</code> also allows the user to specify a few predicates to
actually <em>filter</em> the keyring.</p>
<p><code>sq keyring</code> has other useful functionality.  It can split a keyring
into individual keys and it can merge multiple keys or keyrings
into a single keyring.</p>
<p>To sign and encrypt a message, we specify one or more certificates for
the recipients, and one or more keys for the signers.</p>
<pre><code>$ echo "Hello, woods!" | sq encrypt --recipient-cert /tmp/bob.pgp --signer-key /tmp/alice.sec &gt; /tmp/msg.pgp
</code></pre><p>Decrypting and verifying the signature is similar:</p>
<pre><code>$ sq decrypt --recipient-key /tmp/bob.sec --signer-cert /tmp/alice.pgp /tmp/msg.pgp
Encrypted using AES with 256-bit key
Compressed using ZIP
Good signature from 4D4D 029F 2206 7039
Hello, woods!
1 good signature.
</code></pre><p>(If you are interested in examining the structure of the message at
the byte level, be sure to try the <code>--hex</code> option.)</p>
<p><code>sq</code> can also fetch keys from key servers:</p>

<p>A realistic look at Python web frameworks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take a look around the blogosphere at various benchmarks for Python web frameworks, you might start to feel pretty bad about your own setup. Or, alternatively, super-hyped about the possibilities.</p><p>Consider, for instance, the incredible work of the guys at <a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">magic stack</a>, getting <strong>100,000 requests per second</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> in a single thread. This is on par with compiled language like Go's performance.</p><p>But that benchmark doesn't really cover a fully fleshed out web framework, right? We need a lot more functionality and structure from our frameworks than reading and writing bytes. What about fully fleshed-out web-frameworks in python?</p><p>One such framework is <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a>, which again has been shown to have similar performance: <strong>100,000</strong> requests per-second. Or there's <a href="https://vibora.io/">Vibora</a>. Not only does this claim to be a drop-in replacement for <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, but it also has its own templating engine. And it handles <strong>350,000 requests per second</strong>!</p><p>Even more mind-blowing is <a href="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto">Japronto</a> which claims an insane <strong>1.2 million requests per-second</strong> in a single thread 🤯 trouncing the performance of other languages and frameworks:</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/squeaky-pl/japronto/master/benchmarks/results.png" alt="https://github.com/squeaky-pl/japronto"></p><p>Recently we've been doing a lot of work improving the performance of our Python APIs. Currently we're running <a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a>, and we initially had a single question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread? </em>But looking at these benchmarks had us asking more:</p><ol><li>Can we meaningfully compare them to our setup?</li><li>How realistic are they for a full production application?</li><li>Would we be better using one of these frameworks over Flask?</li></ol><p>In other words, how much should we trust these benchmarks? And to what extent should they influence our choice of technology?</p><p>In order to answer these questions, in this post, I benchmark a realistic Flask application along with it's <a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic">Sanic</a> equivalent. I'm going to guess that most readers come from a background with one of the more "traditional" Python frameworks (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask</a> or <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>), and it's certainly more relevant to devs here at Suade Labs. For this reason, I run the Flask app in a number of different ways, to see what the best bang for our buck is: how performant can we make our application with (almost) zero changes to the code? Along the way we'll pick up some tips for the original question: <em>how can we serve more requests from a single worker thread?</em></p><p><strong>Sidenote: </strong>if you're new to Python's web frameworks, or its asynchronous libraries, take a look at [1] from the addenda at the bottom of this post for a quick explainer. This post mostly assumes you know these things.</p><h2 id="the-baseline">The baseline</h2><p>First let's run some simple "Hello, World!" benchmarks on our system to get a meaningful baseline for comparison. For reference, the Flask benchmarks on <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=fortune&amp;l=zijzen-f">techempower</a> give 25,000 requests per second.</p><p>Here's our Flask app:</p><pre><code>app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def hello():
    if request.method == "GET":
        return "Hello, World!"

    data = request.get_json(force=True)
    try:
        return "Hello, {id}".format(**data)
    except KeyError:
        return "Missing required parameter 'id'", 400</code></pre><p>I ran it under a variety of conditions. First "raw" via <code>python app.py</code>, and then under <a href="https://gunicorn.org/">Gunicorn</a> with a single <code>sync</code> worker via <code>gunicorn -k sync app:app</code> and finally Gunicorn with a single <a href="https://github.com/gevent/gevent">gevent</a> worker via <code>gunicorn -k gevent app:app</code>. In theory Gunicorn should handle concurrency and dropped connections much better than the raw python, and using the gevent worker should allow us to do asynchronous IO without changing our code [2a]. We also ran these benchmarks under <a href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, which in theory should speed up any CPU-bound code without making any changes (if you haven't heard of PyPy see [2b] in the addenda below for a quick explanation and some terminology).</p><p>And what about Sanic? Well, here's the "rewrite" of our app:</p><pre><code>app = Sanic(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
async def hello(request):
    if request.method == "GET":
        return text("Hello, World!")

    data = request.json
    try:
        return text("Hello, {id}".format(**data))
    except KeyError:
        raise InvalidUsage("Missing required parameter 'id'")</code></pre><p>And here are the results:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1000w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/hello_world-3.png 1161w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><div><p>Some technical details: I used Python 3.7 with the regular CPython interpreter and Python 3.6 with PyPy 7.3.3. At the time of writing, running 3.6 is the latest PyPy interpreter, and their Python 2.7 interpreter is faster in some edge cases, but as Python 2 is <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">officially dead</a>, I don't believe it productive to benchmark. My system details are available in the addenda [3]. I used <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a> to actually execute the benchmarks.</p><p>I'll break the results down in two parts. First: Sanic dominates, with 23,000 requests a second, although running our Flask app under Guncorn + gevent and PyPy does a pretty good job at keeping up. Second: what's going on with the performance range for our Flask app?</p></div><p>Under CPython, we see that using Gunicorn quadruples the number of Flask requests per second from 1,000 to 4,000 and using a gevent worker adds a mild (sub 10%) speed boost to this. The PyPy results are more impressive. In the raw test, it is churning through 3,000 requests a second; it received the same 4x speed boost from Gunicorn, getting us to 12,000 requests a second; finally with the addition of gevent, it cranks up to 17,000 requests a second, 17x more than the raw CPython version without changing a single line of code.</p><p>I was quite struck by the fact that gevent had such little effect on the CPython process - probably this is because the CPU is maxed out at this point. On the other hand, it seems that PyPy's better speed means it is still spending time waiting on system calls / IO, even under Gunicorn. Adding gevent to the mix means that it switches between concurrent connections, processing them as fast as the CPU will let it.</p><p>To get a real sense of this, I ran the benchmark whilst monitoring CPU usage. Here's a short test against the raw app under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/sync_cpu_usage.png 919w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>You can see that the program hops between CPU cores and rarely utilises 100% of a given core. On the other hand, here's part of a much longer test against the Gunicorn gevent worker under PyPy:</p><figure><img src="https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png" alt="" srcset="https://suade.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 600w, https://suade.org/content/images/2021/01/gevent_cpu_usage.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Now it's evident that there is no switching between CPU cores (the process has become "sticky") and the individual core is being utilised to a far higher degree.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways</strong>: Sanic wins. PyPy is fast. Run your "traditional" app under Gunicorn.</p><h2 id="realistic-benchmarks">Realistic benchmarks</h2><div><p>The benchmark above, while fun, is pretty meaningless for real-world applications. Let's add some more functionality to our app!</p><p>First, we'll allow users to actually store data in a database, which we'll retrieve via an ORM (in our case <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>, the de-facto stand-alone ORM in python). Second, we'll add input-validation to make sure our users get meaningful error messages, and that we're not accepting junk that crashes our app. Finally we'll add a response marshaller to automate the process of converting our database object to JSON.</p></div><p>We'll write a simple book store app, for a publishing house. We have a number of authors each writing zero or more books in several genres. For simplicity, each book has only a single author, but can have multiple genres - for example we could have a book which is in both the "Existential Fiction" and "Beatnik Poetry" categories. We're going to add 1 million authors to our database and roughly 10 million books. [4]</p><p>Our SQLAlchemy models look a little like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(UUIDType, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False)
    ... # snip!

class Book(db.Model):
    author_id = db.Column(
        UUIDType, db.ForeignKey("author.id"), nullable=False, index=True
    )
    author = db.relationship("Author", backref="books")
    ... # snip!
</code></pre>
<p>To marshal these, we use <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a>, which is a popular Python marshalling library. Here's an example of the Marshmallow model for the Author overview:</p>
<pre><code>class Author(Schema):
    id = fields.Str(dump_only=True)
    name = fields.Str(required=True)
    country_code = EnumField(CountryCodes, required=True)
    email = fields.Str(required=True)
    phone = fields.Str(required=True)
    contact_address = fields.Str(required=True)
    contract_started = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_finished = fields.DateTime(format="iso")
    contract_value = fields.Integer()
</code></pre>
<p>In our endpoints these are used for validating input and returning results like so:</p>
<pre><code>@bp.route("/author", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def author():
    """View all authors, or create a new one."""

    if request.method == "GET":
        args = validate_get(marshallers.LimitOffsetSchema())
        limit = args["limit"]
        offset = args["offset"]

        authors = Author.query.limit(limit).offset(offset).all()
        return jsonify(marshallers.authors.dump(authors))

    if request.method == "POST":
        author = Author(**validate_post(marshallers.author))

        db.session.add(author)
        db.session.commit()

        return jsonify({"id": author.id})
</code></pre>
<p>The full source code can be viewed in the <a href="https://github.com/olliemath/async_python">GitHub repo</a>. Here, the thing to note is that <code>marshallers.foo</code> is an instance of a <a href="https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Marshmallow</a> schema, which can be used both to validate a Foo input, for instance in a POST request, as well as to marshal Foo instances ready for returning as JSON.</p>
<p>In order to actually perform asynchronous database requests, some fancy footwork is required with patching libraries, which depends on which postgres connector you use. SQLAlchemy does not support this out of the box, and in fact its primary developer has a great post arguing that <a href="https://techspot.zzzeek.org/2015/02/15/asynchronous-python-and-databases/">an async ORM is not always a great idea</a>. Juicy technical details in addenda [5], but beware that just using a Gunicorn gevent worker will not necessarily get you what you want.</p><p>PyPy tends to suffer a performance hit when using C-extensions and libraries instead of pure python, conversely CPython should get a performance boost from the C-based libs. To take account of this I tested two different underlying database connectors: both <a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">psycopg2</a> and a …</p></div></section></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>Every so often I get asked for advice on how to become an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/heroes/">AWS Hero</a>.</p><p>The specific answer isn’t that interesting – “get involved in the community and hope someone nominates you as a Hero” seems to be the process at AWS. I understand that the <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/overview">Microsoft MVP process</a> is a bit more transparent and better prescribed.</p><p>But the general question of “how do I become well-respected in my chosen technical specialty” is VERY interesting. Even if you don’t have any aspirations to build a public following, there is tremendous career value in becoming the go-to person within your technical niche.</p><p>The person who everybody on your team comes to with their toughest question about that language or framework. The person who knows where all the bodies are buried in ActiveDirectory or Typescript or DynamoDB. Those folks have great careers and job security because authoritative knowledge like that is rare.</p><p>To some extent, it’s rare because wisdom only comes with experience. But I know plenty of engineers who’ve sat in the same chair for ten years getting the same year of experience ten times. Heck, I’ve been there myself; I spent a couple of years as an “accidental DBA” who never really learned that much about SQL Server beyond what the daily firefighting required.</p><p>I used to spend a lot of time wondering how other people seemed to level up so quickly on new technologies. How do you break through that stagnant cycle of learning and forgetting stuff in bits and pieces, using the same technology for years without ever feeling like an expert?</p><p>A few years ago I learned a secret for doing this, a cheat code if you will, from my fellow AWS Hero <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/author/jared-short">Jared Short</a>. This is his secret recipe for leveling up in tech:</p><p><strong>Read the documentation for one job-relevant technology, cover-to-cover, every week. </strong></p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Forrest is giving away my secrets, but it's true. I'd estimate around 700+ hours of just reading AWS docs over my career with intent to retain / learn (not just reference). It feels silly until you almost immediately understand some esoteric side-effect or behavior. <a href="https://t.co/juQ0b9mENI">https://t.co/juQ0b9mENI</a></p>— Jared Short (@ShortJared) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShortJared/status/1347629518312378369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div></figure><h2 id="h-reading-docs-the-wrong-way-and-the-right-way">Reading docs: the wrong way and the right way</h2><p>I get it, that doesn’t sound revolutionary. “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM</a>” is literally as old as computing itself. It’s the classic kiss-off answer to questions you ought to be able to Google.</p><p>And that betrays a key limitation in how a lot of us think about documentation. We think of it tactically, as a resource to query when we have a specific question or encounter a particular error. We use docs to fill in our <em>known unknowns.</em></p><p>That’s how you can get stuck for years, say, administering a PostgresSQL cluster and never really becoming that deep of an expert on Postgres. If you only learn something new when the situation demands it, your mental model of Postgres (or whatever) will look like a gradually expanding version of this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2181" height="1647" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 2181w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 1536w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/tactical.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2181px) 100vw, 2181px"></figure><p>Over time, as you encounter more new use cases for the technology, you’ll burn more “never forget” bubbles into the mental model. But you’ll still have this heavy sense of unknown unknowns hanging over you, and you’ll never be sure if you’re really using the optimal approach to solve a new problem.</p><p>Instead, Jared’s approach is to read docs strategically<em>, </em>preemptively, curiously: as a way to fill in your <em>unknown unknowns</em>. The things you might not encounter in ten years, but that would cost you two days of troubleshooting if you ran into them tomorrow.</p><p>Read docs like novels (cover to cover), not like dictionaries (look up the term, cross-reference, and stop). Over time, that strategy will lead to a mental model of your professional domain that looks more like this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="727" height="549" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png 727w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/01/strategic.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px"></figure><p>(This is <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/how-many-certifications-do-i-need-to-get-a-cloud-job">the same benefit</a> you get from studying for certifications, by the way: you’re building a mental map of the domain, so you don’t have to stumble through the darkness on every new quest.)</p><p>On the surface, that sounds simple, but it’s far from easy. Here are three common objections people raise when I advise reading docs as a career-advancement strategy:</p><h4 id="h-i-don-t-have-a-photographic-memory-i-ll-never-remember-a-bunch-of-random-docs"><strong>“I don’t have a photographic memory. I’ll never remember a bunch of random docs.”</strong></h4><p>Back when I was in college, a well-meaning friend convinced me I should read a book on SAP. Forget today — I couldn’t have told you a single thing about SAP <em>ten minutes after finishing that book</em>. I’d never been inside an enterprise, much less understood the problems these ERP integrations I was reading about were supposed to solve. It was like trying to talk to the aliens in the movie <em>Arrival</em>: my brain was the wrong shape.</p><p>Likewise, you probably won’t get much value out of glancing through docs for a technology you don’t use and have no context for.</p><p>So do these two things:</p><p>1. <strong>Focus on docs for technologies you are already using</strong>. We’ve all had that mind-numbing feeling when plowing through some esoteric text that doesn’t relate to our daily lives, where you glaze over for three pages and then go, “what did I just read?”</p><p>Avoid this by focusing on docs for technologies or languages you’ve already got a vested stake in – say, because they’re on your plate at work or you’re trying to build them into a side project.</p><p>Encourage active reading and engagement with the information by asking yourself questions like these as you read:</p><ul id="block-ef7bb5e0-252c-434f-98de-116c8c0e2003"><li>Did I understand that? (If not, maybe read the section again)</li><li>Does what I just read match my existing mental model of how this technology works? (If not, do I need to go review a different doc and then come back to this?)</li><li>Could this feature or fact help me on my current project?</li><li>If I had known this six months ago, what would I have done differently? (“Chosen a different technology” is a totally acceptable answer!)</li></ul><p>Then, <strong>2. Read those docs repeatedly, on a schedule, over and over</strong>. Seriously. If you’re on a team that’s building out centralized CI/CD for Azure, maybe read the part of the Azure DevOps docs on pipelines this week and the part on build agents next week, and when you get to the end, start over. The cloud changes fast. You’ll fold in new information at the same time you’re reinforcing the old.</p><h4 id="h-i-don-t-have-time-to-read-a-bunch-of-documentation"><strong>“I don’t have time to read a bunch of documentation.”</strong></h4><p>Yes, and weeks of work can save you hours of planning. Maybe use some of the time you currently spend injecting “HERE” print statements into your code to figure out why it’s not working.</p><figure><img src="https://faasandfurious.com/pages/debugging-tactics.png" alt="Debugging Tactics"></figure><p>More seriously, it’s not a bad idea to block a bit of time on your calendar each day – 30 minutes, even –  for targeted doc-reading. You may find it hard to carve that time out of your workday, but defending time and setting expectations with your manager is its own skill, worth practicing. Call the block of time “deep work.” It is.</p><h4 id="h-the-docs-for-technology-x-are-no-good-trust-me-they-re-not-worth-reading"><strong>“The docs for [technology X] are no good. Trust me, they’re not worth reading.”</strong></h4><p>I don’t always buy this excuse. The docs might not be that bad; you might just have the wrong expectations.</p><p>For example, the AWS documentation gets <a href="https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1347737875991777280">a terrible rap</a> for being wordy and poorly-organized. And it’s maybe even worse than you’ve heard – if you’re trying to look up the name of an IAM action or the syntax of a CLI command, that is.</p><p>But as an educational tool that dives deep on the architectural underpinnings and technical limitations of services, the AWS docs are <em>fantastic. </em>They’re better than any book you could ever buy about the cloud. (And the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/">Builder’s Library</a> is better still.) The AWS docs are designed not just to be referenced, but to be read. Read ’em!</p><p>On the other hand, some types of docs like step-by-step tutorials are very much designed to be referenced during hands-on builder time. It may not make sense to spend a lot of time reading those in the abstract. So bring your common sense.</p><p>However. There are also plenty of technologies out there where the docs are truly incomplete, out of date, or just plain wrong – many smaller open-source projects, in particular.</p><p>Turns out you have another option here, at least for OSS projects: <em>read the source code.</em> Not sure what a module does, what its edge cases are, what the error code means? Read the source code and find out! It might be faster than (and will definitely be at least as accurate as) looking for the answer in the docs, <em>even if the docs are pretty good. </em></p><p>If you write code for a living, reading other people’s shipped, battle-tested code — not just PRs from your own team — is genuinely one of the most transformative things you can do for your career. Because while you’re answering your immediate question, you’ll also be picking up style, organization, and technique from professional programmers operating under all kinds of interesting constraints. Seriously. Read code.</p><p>(And then, if it’s open-source, maybe consider contributing some docs!)</p><h2 id="h-what-do-i-get-out-of-all-this"><strong>What do I get out of all this?</strong></h2><p>If you read a targeted set of docs consistently over a sustained period — say, a couple of years — while actively practicing on that technology, you will be able to perform magic. That’s a promise.</p><p>Let’s go back to Jared Short again for an example. (Yes, I checked with Jared, he graciously agreed to let me spill his secrets in this piece.) As an engineer at an AWS shop, Jared …</p><ul><li>Reads the documentation for one AWS service, cover to cover, every week.</li><li>Blocks daily time for this on his calendar.</li><li>Focuses on services he’s actually using at work (he tells me that so far in 2021, he’s been through all the docs for Lambda, AppSync, and Step Functions).</li></ul><p>Jared’s been doing this week in, week out, for *years*. And that  unglamorous commitment lets him perform nerd magic like this:</p><figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I needed to understand extensions better for a thing, read the docs cover to cover like an insane person.</p>— Jared Short (@ShortJared) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShortJared/status/1347612782389301249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div></figure><p>If you don’t want to take the time to read that whole Twitter thread, let me sum it up for you.</p><ol><li>An experienced AWS engineer encounters a weird behavior: AWS Lambda seems to be executing code when it should not be. He posts a plea for help on Twitter.</li><li>Other experienced engineers take a look and go, “huh. Weird.” To be clear, this is not a case of RTFM. The problem is nontrivial and the solution, if there is one, is not well-known. …</li></ol></div></div></div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607550167012_219370"><div><p>Today a lot of valuable digital construction data (BIM data and beyond) is locked up in closed proprietary data formats which are bound to aging software packages developed by a single software vendor. As a result, stakeholders in the construction process (e.g. contractors, sub-contractors, estimators, specification writers, owners, facility managers, etc.) are unable to fully leverage the BIM data to make better decisions or optimize their processes. Some of the negative results are miscommunication and misunderstanding between stakeholders, inaccurate estimation, change orders, scheduling and planning conflicts, errors in constructability, and so on.</p><p>Two decades ago, it was common practice for data formats to be only read and written by a single piece of software, on a single platform. This is no longer adequate.</p><p>As the internet has grown in importance, and as computing devices have become more specialized, well-designed open data exchange formats such as PDF, HTML, JPEG, MP3, MP4, and XML have become crucial to the effective exchange of data.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607550167012_228680"><div><p>So what is an open format, why is it good for the construction industry? First, according to Wikipedia:</p><blockquote><p><em>An open format is a file format for storing digital data, defined by a published specification usually maintained by a standards organization, and which can be used and implemented by anyone. For example, an open format can be implemented by both proprietary and free and open-source software, using the typical software licenses used by each. In contrast to open formats, closed formats are considered trade secrets.</em></p></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606975570419_24188"><p><h3>Open Formats are Good for Customers</h3></p></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607435564498_23818"><div><p><em>As a customer, it is risky to build a dependency on technology based on a single vendor’s closed format. </em>Users place themselves entirely at the mercy of one business: their pricing, tooling, and support. This has proven to be a real problem for customers that have their data locked up behind a walled garden that they must pay exorbitant amounts of money to have limited access to it.</p><p>This is a relic of an older business model from the time when most computing was done in isolation on a single machine. This model is extremely outdated. </p><p>Customers expect to be able to have contextual views of the same data across different platforms with varying capabilities.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606975833465_16265"><p><h3>Open Formats are Good for Businesses</h3></p></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606975950758_13055"><div><p>Technology that is open is better.

It has become the default asset transmission format in the games industry. Even though FBX has a free SDK, it is not open format. Reading and writing FBX files requires the binary SDK and it cannot be ported to web-browsers. FBX was originally designed for animation data. It does not do a good job of conveying the semantics of BIM data and is inefficient at handling large geometry.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976375619_14778"><p><a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0"><strong>glTF</strong></a><strong> (GL Transmission Format)</strong> is an open data exchange format for 3D geometry and animation data that was designed specifically for WebGL.

This means that to make a rendering, the parametric surfaces and solids must go through a very lengthy conversion process into a triangular representation appropriate for rendering by the GPU (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">Graphical Processing Unit</a>). The GPU specializes in drawing lists of triangles very quickly. The conversion of a parametric surface to a triangular format is called “triangulation” or “tessellation”.</p><p>The process of triangulating complex intersecting parametric surfaces is very time consuming for a computer, and hard to do correctly. It requires a specialized library, called a geometry kernel. With the goal of reducing the time required to display the geometry, this made IFC unacceptably inefficient for us.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976621178_36617"><p><h3>Our Findings Left Us Searching for More Answers</h3></p></div></div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606976943187_17825"><p>We found that these formats required too much complexity to parse large scale BIM projects correctly and efficiently on low-power devices, and they had no built-in mechanism to carry the structured BIM data.

            <div data-animation-name="slideInUp">
              <p>As a startup or small business, your product is important. Probably the most essential asset for your company. A good product means that you get to sell, make money, and keep existing. With this in mind, itâ€™s understandable to want to build the perfect product. But what if thatâ€™s not the answer? History is full of examples of companies that launched what they thought was the perfect product and watched it fail in slow motion. What if I told you that the solution isnâ€™t to try building the perfect product but to start with a shitty one.</p>

<h2>What Defines a Good Product?</h2>
<p>Before we go on, letâ€™s define what a good product is. Simply put, itâ€™s what your customers are willing to buy because it solves a problem. When itâ€™s really good, customers tell their friends and family all  about it.  In the words of Clayton Christensen, they're hiring that â€˜productâ€™ (or service) to get a job done.</p>

<p>Think of it like this. When your kitchen pipes are clogged, you hire a plumber. If you're hungry, you hire a pizza. Need to move around? Hire an Uber. Building a good product means that it solves your customer's problems so well that they're happy with the purchase.</p>

<p>If this is what a good product is, then why would you ever build a shitty one? Because itâ€™s very rare — almost impossible even — that youâ€™ll develop the perfect product right out of the gate.</p>

<p>You need to start somewhere. And thatâ€™s often with a <strong>less-than-optimal product.</strong> You need this at first to <strong>figure out what your customers really want.</strong></p>

<p>In other words, you're looking for a product-market fit.</p>

<h2>Finding Product-Market-Fit</h2>
<p>When we talk about a shitty product, we don't mean you should intentionally build a bad one. Just don't strive for perfection yet, especially if you're unsure who your customers are and what they want.  Your customers are the final arbitrators of how good your product is, so your focus at every stage of developing the product is to find out if they want what youâ€™re building. This is what a product-market fit is all about.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.productplan.com/glossary/product-market-fit/" target="_blank">According to Marc Andreesen</a>, an entrepreneur and investor credited with developing the concept, said product-market fit means finding a good market and a solution good enough to satisfy that market. With a good product-market fit, your target customers are buying your solution, using it, and talking about it to other people on a large enough scale to sustain the companyâ€™s growth and profitability.</p>

<p>To find a good product-market fit, youâ€™ve got to find out what your market wants and ensure that the product contains that. This is where the shitty product comes in.</p>

<p>Building a perfect product is expensive and time-consuming. Unfortunately, if your product doesn't fit the market or vice versa, then all that time and money will be wasted. When building something new, your first goal isn't to create a perfect product; itâ€™s to figure out what your market is and what potential buyers want. When you figure this part out, you can then channel your energy to perfecting the product.</p>

<h3>Start with an MVP</h3>
<p>No, not the best player on the sports team. Here, MVP means Minimum Viable Product -- the smallest and cheapest version of your product that you can produce to find out if you have a good product-market fit. Itâ€™s essentially your â€˜shittyâ€™ product. Think about it like this, the goal of your MVP is to find out with the first version if thereâ€™s a viable market for it. If there is, then you can work on improving the MVP to make a stronger offering.</p>

<p>Take the example of the Ford Edsel. It failed so badly that the word â€œEdselâ€� on Dictionary.com has a slang definition of â€œSomething useless; a fiasco.â€� <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/03/AR2007090301419_5.html" target="_blank">Ford launched the Edsel</a> in 1957, and they were designed to be flashy rather than practical. After praising the cars for months, Ford unveiled the new line of Edsels on-E-day.â€™ Almost 3 million people visited showrooms, but only 64,000 units were sold. The line was finally killed in 1959, costing Ford almost $2 billion in losses. Thatâ€™ll be worth over $17 billion today.</p>

<p>Among all the other factors contributing to the lineâ€™s failure, spending so much time to develop a perfect car without any validation from the market was perhaps the biggest. They obviously didnâ€™t understand what their market wanted, and it cost them badly.</p>

<p>When building your product or service, especially as a small company or startup, you must build with your market in mind. That is, build what you <strong>know</strong> your market wants, not what you <strong>think</strong> they want. Assumptions can be deadly. And in the age of customer centricity, go ahead and let your customers tell you exactly what they want.</p>

<h2>Learn Fast, Build Often</h2>
<p>When you build your MVP, your goal is to get it in front of your target audience. You need to learn from early customers, beta testers and really anyone willing to give you feedback. There are few questions you need to ask.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is the problem my product solves a real market need?:</strong> This is perhaps the most critical question that has to be answered. If you donâ€™t solve a real problem,  it doesnâ€™t matter how good your product is; the chances of finding a product-market fit is practically non-existent. For a product-market fit to exist, you need a problem that enough people have and are willing to â€™hireâ€™ your product to solve.</li>
<li><strong>Is the product creating new problems:</strong> Sometimes, your product is good, and solves a market need, but in the process unintentionally creates a new problem. This is why itâ€™s critical to test out your MVP with a small group of people that fit your target market. By watching them interact with your product, youâ€™ll learn what is good, what needs improvement and most importantly, how to improve it. Direct customer feedback is invaluable, so take full advantage when you can get it. And understand that and there will almost always be problems with your MVP. Thatâ€™s part of the whole â€˜shittyâ€™ approach.</li>
</ul>

<p>As big as Google is, they once failed to do this, which cost them dearly. Google unveiled Glass in 2012. It was the tech leaderâ€™s first attempt at wearable technology. However, the software had many bugs, health, and safety concerns, and there just werenâ€™t many practical uses for it. Much more than that, Google failed to position the product properly. When they launched, t, it was just a prototype, not a finished product. They spend way too much time â€˜perfectingâ€™ it rather than getting an MVP out there quickly to get customer feedback.</p>

<p>Worse yet, Google didnâ€™t even seriously seek feedback at all. Astro Teller, the director of the Google X research Lab, told <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8235277/sxsw-astro-teller-google-x" target="_blank">The Verge in an interview</a> that they marketed Glass as a finished product.</p>

<p>As part of the Explorer program, Google released Glass to tech enthusiasts and journalists with a $1500 price tag for early access. However, because the product wasnâ€™t ready, many trashed the product, writing articles like: â€œ<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/nobody-really-likes-google-glass-2013-5" target="_blank">Nobody Likes Google Glass</a>,â€� and even invented the term â€œ<a href="http://nypost.com/2014/07/14/is-google-glass-cool-or-just-plain-creepy/" target="_blank">Glassholes</a>.â€�</p>

<p>By not building an MVP or a shitty product that could be tested privately, Google Glass failed horribly. By January of 2015, Google stopped selling Glass and had to end itâ€™s explorer program.</p>

<p><strong>Learn from the best and avoid the pitfalls of Ford and Google.</strong></p>

<p>When building your product, Your first goal shouldnâ€™t be to make a perfect product. Itâ€™s to make sure thereâ€™s enough market demand and a good fit for it. And thatâ€™s why you need to start with a less-than-perfect and well,  â€˜shittyâ€™ product. Not in the sense that you are trying to fail. Ideally, you want to be as close to perfect as possible, even in the early stage. But donâ€™t waste valuable development cycles fine-tuning your offering until you validate with customers that they actually want it.</p>

<p>A great example of a company that started with a â€˜shittyâ€™ product is Zappos. They were one of the first online retailers, and now sell everything fashion, from boots, to bags. When they started in 1999, Nick Swinmurm, the founder, wasn't sure if people were ready to buy shoes online. He could have invested thousands of dollars in buying stock, building a distribution network to see if the business model worked, but he took a different approach.</p>

<p>He went to local stores, took pictures of their inventory, and then posted the pictures on a basic website. That was their MVP. A shitty website and some photos. If there was an order, heâ€™d go buy the shoes from the retailer and send them to the customers.</p>

<p>The success of this proved that there was demand for the product, and achieved product-market fit. The rest is history, as Zappos eventually grew into the billion dollar empire it is today on the model of selling shoes online.</p>

<p>In conclusion, when building your product, your main goal should be to find out if your audience wants your product. Figure this out as cheaply and as fast as possible. When you achieve product-market fit, you can then worry about building the perfect product. At least, you know that thereâ€™s someone ready to buy it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is trending. But the remote revolution started long before the pandemic and will stay powerful even after the hype subsides. As with any change, how well you adapt and improve will determine whether you get the better of remote work or run back to offices once the external factors go away.</p> <p>I decided to go remote 3 years ago and I'm glad I did. My last workplace was BriteCore, a remote-first company based in the US. And tomorrow, I'll be joining Doist, a pioneer in the world of remote work. I have gone through a lot of interview processes in the recent years.</p> <p>This article is an attempt to answer the why, what and how of remote work. The intended primary audience are developers from developing countries like me (I'm from Bangladesh) who do not want to relocate right now but wants to work on exciting products and teams all over the world. The general ideas apply to all professions that can be carried out remotely and to professionals anywhere in the world.</p> <h2 id="why-remote"> Why Remote</h2> <h3 id="better-opportunities"> Better Opportunities</h3> <p>Going remote means your employment is not limited to your physical location anymore. That opens up a world of opportunities. You can work for your dream company or with the colleagues and experts that you cherish. And all of it while staying in the place you like with the people you love. If you are the nomad type, this gives you great flexibility.</p> <h3 id="better-financial-gain"> Better Financial Gain</h3> <p>💵 Remote work opens up much better opportunities with much better compensations if you're, like me, living in a developing country. The compensations are generally much better than the local industry.</p> <p>📈 The high exchange rates between the powerful currencies and the local ones allow you to leverage the asymmetry and save much more. In fact, you can end up with a higher net savings per month than someone earning more than you in expensive places like San Francisco or London for example.</p> <p>📉 Tax rates are also generally lower and most developing countries have generous rebates if you're bringing in foreign remittance.</p> <p>✅ Even if you're living in a developed country, remote work saves you a good amount from commute, lunch and everything in between that comes with showing up in an office.</p> <h3 id="better-self-actualization"> Better Self-actualization</h3> <p>Remote work allows you to do deep work and puts you in control of your routine and interruptions. In a world of constant connectivity, the option to go deep as needed can give you an unfair advantage in knowledge based work that reward craftsmanship and superior skills. Read the interesting book titled <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Work by Cal Newport</a> to learn more about this.</p> <h2 id="the-remote-skillset"> The Remote Skillset</h2> <p>Remote work comes with its share of challenges. You need to adapt and overcome these challenges to thrive in a remote work environment for the long term. And the process starts with adopting the remote skillset.</p> <p>I use a handy mnemonic  to summarise the skillset essential for remote work. I call it the <strong>IBM CI</strong>. IBM, as you probably know, is the name of a famous company and CI or <em>Continuous Integration</em> is a term developers are quite familiar with.</p> <p>The mnemonic comes from <strong>I</strong>ndependence, <strong>B</strong>alance, <strong>M</strong>astery, <strong>C</strong>ommunication and <strong>I</strong>mpact. I borrowed it from <a href="https://doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doist</a>. So, all credit goes to the awesome team there. I just came up with the mnemonic to remember it better. You can find it in any of their job descriptions. Their <a href="https://blog.doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> is chalk-full of great articles on remote work. Subscribe to the blog to get the best out of it.</p> <p>I'll only touch on two aspects that encompass everything else.</p> <p><strong>Manager of One</strong>: Going remote means you're unlikely to have colleagues by your side. If you're working from home, it can be quite a challenge to put a boundary between work and non-work time. You're in charge of yourself and your schedule. So, you need to be able to do it well if you want to succeed in remote work in the long term.</p> <p>I borrowed the term <em>Manager of One</em> from Basecamp, a pioneer and advocate of remote work. The ability to manage yourself is pivotal to a successful remote career. Read more about it on Basecamp's <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1430-hire-managers-of-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> on the topic.</p> <p><strong>Communication</strong>: Bulk of the communication in remote work happens in the written medium. You need to harness your ability to express your thoughts and ideas clearly in the written form to thrive in a remote setting. This is also going to be the primary mode of making connections with colleagues across the company. You don't need to become a literary genius though. Clear and concise technical writing goes a long way. <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1208930197702995968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This tweet </a>sums up a  lot of great points.</p> <p>The tone gets lost in transmission in written medium. It's always good to pay extra attention to not come off harsh. Warm your messages with emojis 😃</p> <p>Most remote settings will have a diverse workforce. It's important that you stay sensitive to cultural diversities and refrain from saying anything that may be acceptable in your culture but not in others. Avoid using swear or curse words in all settings even if you deem it to be informal. I have had a manager in the past who would use the f-word in meetings. Please don't!</p> <p>As for technical skills, I advice to work on-site when starting out if possible. Most remote jobs expect you to do your job with minimal supervision. It's easier to find jobs and perform better when you have some experience under your belt.</p>  <p>Remote work means managing yourself well. Most of your communication will happen online and it is expected that you'll be using a lot of collaboration tools. Here are some of my suggestions to organise yourself better and produce quality output.</p> <p>📝 Use a task management tool. Put all your tasks as they pop up in your list and plan them accordingly. I use <a href="https://todoist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Todoist</a> for this but any tool that you're comfortable with works, even pen and paper.</p> <p>📓 Use an app for writing and taking notes. I prefer <a href="https://ia.net/writer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iA writer</a> for long documents and <a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evernote</a> for quick notes synced across devices. But again, anything that you're comfortable with works fine.</p> <p>🛠 Familiarise yourself with communication tools like Slack, Teams, etc if not already. Most companies use one for communication. While there's not much of a learning curve, you should at least know that they exist. Same for project management tools like Jira, Trello and so on.</p> <h2 id="shades-of-remote"> Shades of Remote</h2> <p>This section is more focused on developer jobs. Remote work can mean a lot of things for a developer. It can be consulting, freelancing, working for steady clients or full time contracts with companies. I'll categorise them in 3 buckets and list some resources where you can find opportunities for that category.</p> <h3 id="freelancing-platforms"> Freelancing Platforms</h3> <p>You can freelance on projects remotely on freelancing platforms. Examples include Upwork, Freelancer, etc where you can join, create a profile and start bidding on projects.</p> <p>While this is a good option to work on projects you're interested in, I tend to prefer not working on them as a career choice. All clients are not the same, so it needs a lot of calibration every time you start a new project.</p> <p>Clients generally choose these platforms for cost optimisation. So, the engineering standards are generally a bit lower and the deadline pressures are more intense.</p> <p>This also means variable workload and variable income, which makes planning your time and life harder. But I have worked on projects intermittently on Upwork before and it can be a good path to pursue if it suits you.</p> <p>Here's a list of popular freelancing platforms:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.upwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upwork</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiverr</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.freelancer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freelancer</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.guru.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guru</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">peopleperhour</a></li></ul> <h3 id="agency-platforms"> Agency Platforms</h3> <p>Some platforms employ a vetting process and only allow successful candidates on their platforms. For the lack of a better word, I call them agency platforms. These platforms are on the rise and I see new ones every now and then.</p> <p>Once you're on the platform, you may have to bid for projects again or you may be paired with companies depending on the type of the platform. But you'll be working as a member of the platform and the platform will take a cut off your earnings.</p> <p>One major downside of both these types of platforms is that you don't get any paid time offs (PTO). If you don't work, you don't get paid. You don't get any other perks or benefits either. But once you get yourself on these platforms, it may be easier to land clients or contracts (and better ones) than on platforms mentioned in the first category. Remember to check reviews before joining. Do not join if you don't like their practices.</p> <p>Here's a list of some platforms in this category:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.toptal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toptal</a></li> <li><a href="https://x-team.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Team</a></li> <li><a href="https://turing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turing</a></li> <li><a href="https://triplebyte.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TripleByte</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.vettery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vettery</a></li> <li><a href="https://6nomads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6nomads</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.crossover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crossover</a></li></ul> <p>This list is not exhaustive and there's a lot of other platforms like these. I haven't worked on any of these, so do your review before you decide to join.</p> <h3 id="remote-companies"> Remote Companies</h3> <p>Remote-first or full-remote companies fall in this category. The number of such companies is increasing rapidly, thanks to the pandemic. You can apply to these companies directly from their job posts and work as independent contractors after you successfully complete their recruitment process.</p> <p>I prefer this category of remote work because you get to work for the company directly. Generally, the teams and cultures are better in companies who hire directly.</p> <p>Similarly, the compensations and benefits are better as well. Most of them will provide PTOs and have good practices around remote work.</p> <p>Some popular companies that hire remotely are:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://doist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doist</a></li> <li><a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zapier</a></li> <li><a href="https://buffer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffer</a></li> <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gitlab</a></li> <li><a href="https://automattic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automattic</a></li> <li><a href="https://basecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Basecamp</a></li></ul> <p>There are many job forums and aggregate websites that you can subscribe to for job openings in remote companies. You can create email subscriptions according to your choices. Here's a list of some popular remote job forums:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://weworkremotely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We Work Remotely</a></li> <li><a href="https://remoteok.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RemoteOK</a></li> <li><a href="https://angel.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AngelList</a></li> <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?r=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack OverFlow jobs</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/remote-jobs-SRCH_KO0,6.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glass Door Jobs</a></li> <li><a href="https://remotecircle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RemoteCircle</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit Remote Jobs Forum</a></li> <li><a href="https://remotive.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remotive</a></li> <li><a href="https://jobs.underpin.company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Underpin</a></li> <li><a href="https://remote.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote.co</a></li> <li><a href="http://remote4me.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote4Me</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/remote-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn jobs</a></li> <li><a href="http://remotepython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remote Python</a></li></ul> <p>These platforms are great for job search.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em><span>In today's era of drip campaigns and automated sales message, a well-crafted cold email stands head and shoulders above its competition. The only way to write a great cold email is to be authentic and maybe even a little bit weird. In his recent book, </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Authentic-Selling-Principles-Sales-Everyday/dp/1735956902/" rel="follow noopener" target="_blank"><span>Authentic Selling: How To Use The Principles of Sales in Everyday Life</span></a><span>, Jeff Kirchick lays the framework for the perfect cold email. For those of us who haven’t spent the past fifteen years in a sales role, the thought of sending cold emails can be scary. Hopefully the except from </span><span>Authentic Selling</span><span> will ease some of those nerves.</span></em></p>

<p><b>Authentic &amp; Eccentric Cold Outreach</b></p>

<p><span>People are weird. All of us are eccentric in one way or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first thing I tell inside salespeople when I hire them is that I want them to embrace themselves and everything that makes them authentically weird. The weirder they are, the better. And whether or not you like my theory on weirdness, it is absolutely true today that most buyers are inundated with emails, many of which come from salespeople, vying for their attention. What this means is that you need to stand out from the pack. Hence, the weirder you are, the better. Even though Waldo was dressed in strange red and white attire, he was always hard to spot in those “Where’s Waldo?” books because he wasn’t weird enough to really stand out from the pack. And Waldo looked like a pretty weird guy. You need to be weirder than Waldo.</span></p>
<p><span>I compartmentalize a good sales email into three parts: The Excuse, The Value Proposition, and The Ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What does this mean in the real world? It means that when I write a subject line for my e-mail, the goal is to get the person to open the e-mail. It is not to get that person to buy my product. It is simply to get them to open the message.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some better examples of subject lines that are hard to ignore:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“Hello from a fellow alumnus of X University”</span></p>
<p><span>“Hello from a fan of [buyer’s product company name]”</span></p>
<p><span>“Fellow Boston Bruins fan looking to connect”</span></p>
<p><span>Or, perhaps for a Star Wars fan, “Read or read not, there is no try”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>You get the picture. You are using something appealing to your target to establish some mutual synergy. And from there, the goal remains the same. The goal of the first sentence is to get the reader to the second sentence. The goal of the second sentence is to get the reader to the third sentence. The goal of each and every word is to get the reader to the next word. And eventually, as you will soon see, the ultimate goal at the end is to have mutual agreement to meet together. But it is only the sum of the parts – the e-mail in its entirety – which should convince the reader that this is a worthy outcome.</span></p>
<p><span>None of this can be accomplished if you are writing an essay to the client. Most people feel out whether or not they have the time to read an email by staring at its sheer size once they open it. If the email is too long, it is likely to get deleted, even if the email itself is some of the finest prose ever known to mankind. This is really no different than how you would approach the proverbial stranger at the bar. If you went up to them and told them your life story, they are likely to be a little creeped out. But, if you led off with something short and sweet about a commonality, it leaves the door open for curiosity that can spark a conversation.</span></p>
<p><span>Without further ado, let’s start to dive into the structure of sound cold outreach.</span></p>

<p><b>Part 1: The Excuse</b></p>
<p><span>I call the first part of cold outreach “the excuse” because you are always interrupting someone’s day, and when you interrupt someone’s day, you better have a good excuse. You would never walk up to someone, for example, who is clearly on a phone call, and ask them for directions. If you did, you would at least preface your statement with a good excuse: “Hey, I know you look really busy but this is kind of an emergency so I hope you don’t mind me interrupting you to ask a quick question?” Anything short of that and the person who you are calling upon for help is likely to leave with a bad taste in their mouth over your poor manners, and this makes them all the more likely to decline helping you or to provide you with bad directions. No one wins in that situation.</span></p>
<p><span>The excuse for reaching out to someone should always be something personal. Most sales training programs miss this, encouraging the sales rep to open up with some sort of before and after scenario. This could be something about how bad life is today in the absence of the product that is being sold, and what life looks like after, followed by examples of satisfied customers and some statistics to substantiate the point. While none of this is objectively wrong to do, per se, it is also what pretty much everyone else is doing. And if you are fighting for someone’s attention and every single vendor is promising them a better outcome, ultimately it all just starts to sound like white noise.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some examples of successful outreach I have performed.</span></p>
<p><span>I found someone who, like me, was an English major in college. She happened to go to The University of North Carolina. Anyone who goes to UNC hates Duke University as they are bitter in-state sports rivals. As a fellow English major myself, I penned an email to this prospect with the subject line “Hello from a fellow English major and Duke hater.” I opened the email by lamenting how everyone told me I would never get a job out of college with my useless English degree and how it was serendipitous for us to find ourselves linking up in the world, both gainfully employed, with me trying to sell her my product. I went on to talk about how we must also have a mutual disdain for Duke. Let’s face it, Duke resembles the New England Patriots in many ways, in that everyone who is not a fan of either team generally has a lot of ill-will toward their fanbases. And this is coming from a diehard Patriots fan. It’s just reality.</span></p>
<p><span>The prospect I was writing to wrote back to me saying that the email was clever and that she was interested in connecting with me. Meanwhile, I had only spent one or two sentences in the email getting to the meat and potatoes of what we were even selling – and even then, I left it all in high-level terminology. The point being, it did not really matter exactly “what” it was that I was selling – it was the “why” that is always more compelling. And in this case, the “why” was this commonality we had developed which might lead to some building of trust. From a point of trust, no matter what you are buying, you can at least assume that the seller is going to do everything they can to make sure you are successful. Here is the actual email:</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span>Hey [Prospect],</span></p>
<p><span>Couple things...</span></p>
<p><span>1. Real happy to see a fellow English major thriving in the workforce! They always told me my degree wouldn't be worth much unless I became a teacher, turns out I am saving lives one at a time by selling fraud prevention and call authentication technology.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Duke stinks so it's great you did all of this at UNC.</span></p>
<p><span>In all seriousness, you look like the person who would vet technology for authenticating inbound callers. I know you guys do some stuff with [our competitor], but we would love to have an opportunity to show how we could augment those efforts. Let me know if you would be open to connecting sometime.</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers,</span></p>
<p><span>Jeff</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span>There is something important I want to call out about this. Nowhere in this email did I compromise my authenticity. I really was an English major in college, I really do enjoy meeting people who shared my major, I genuinely do enjoy joking about us both being gainfully employed, and I also authentically hate Duke (N.B. – apologies to any Duke alumni/alumnae reading this). So nowhere did I sell my soul by writing this message. And this is the thing that is so hard for people to realize in today’s politically-charged climate: you have so much more in common with most people than you would think. If you could only spend a little bit of time peeling the onion, chances are that you would have so much to talk about and agree on if you could get over the obvious differences you see at surface level. It is just a matter of finding out what those commonalities are so you can exploit them and turn them into a positive for both sides. Remember when we talked about empathy a couple chapters ago? You’re going to need that to be able to get far enough with people to realize what values you share. It is those who lack empathy and write other people off entirely that do not even give themselves (and others) an opportunity to see what values they share.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another example of a good excuse to reach out to someone is based on content that they have written. I once uncovered the personal blog of a prospect of mine called “The Traveling Parent.” The blog was basically about how this man balanced his work life with his home life. As you can guess by the title of the blog, he traveled a lot for work and rarely saw his children. He had to get creative about using technology to stay in touch with them, and when he was at home, he needed to set certain boundaries in order to maximize his time with his children. I was actually personally touched while reading his blog. And even though I am not a parent, I do travel quite a bit for work and I could really empathize with his struggle through my own personal experiences of feeling homesick whenever I would hit the road for a new destination. I wrote him a message saying as much after dozens of failed attempts to connect with him previously, and surely enough, he wrote back to me with an interest in meeting. In this scenario, it was by making myself vulnerable that I showed him my humanity, and he responded in kind.</span></p>
<p><span>Content that people write is ripe for good, genuine connections. A personal blog is one thing, but oftentimes people are also writing professionally about subject matter that is relevant to their work, or even for volunteer work that they do in their personal time. For example, I am a volunteer in the Big …</span></p></div></div>

January 26, 2021 | https://blog.melski.net/2010/11/30/makefile-hacks-print-the-value-of-any-variable/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.melski.net/2010/11/30/makefile-hacks-print-the-value-of-any-variable/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<div>
					
					<!-- .entry-header -->

											<div>
							<p>One of my favorite makefile debugging tricks is this rule for printing out the value of a variable:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">print-%:
        @echo '$*=$($*)'</span></pre>
<p>
Throw this into a GNU make makefile and then print any <span><span face="Courier New">make</span></span> variable you like by invoking targets like <span><span face="Courier New">print-MAKE_VERSION</span></span>:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ gmake print-MAKE_VERSION
MAKE_VERSION=3.81</span></pre>
<p>
You can imagine how handy this is when diagnosing issues with your makefiles.  Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li><span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> defines a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Pattern-Rules"><i>pattern rule</i></a> that matches any target that starts with the characters <span><span face="Courier New">print-</span></span>.</li>
<li>In the context of a pattern rule, the <span><span face="Courier New">$*</span></span> variable expands to the <i>stem</i> of the target, that part which matched the <span><span face="Courier New">%</span></span> in the pattern.  In my example above, that corresponds to <i>MAKE_VERSION</i>.</li>
<li>GNU make variable expansion rules allow for variable references <i>inside</i> variable names, so <span><span face="Courier New">$($*)</span></span> expands first to <span><span face="Courier New">$(MAKE_VERSION)</span></span>, and finally to the value of the <span><span face="Courier New">MAKE_VERSION</span></span> variable.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Makefile injection with <span face="Courier New">-f</span></h3>
<p>
The <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule is a slick hack, but it’s a nuisance to have to modify a makefile just to use it.  Worse, you might not even be able to modify the makefile.  Fortunately, there’s a solution:  the <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> command-line option.  You’re probably familiar with it — that’s how you tell gmake to use a different makefile than the default <span><span face="Courier New">Makefile</span></span> when it starts.  For example, if you have a  makefile named <span><span face="Courier New">build.mak</span></span>:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">gmake -f build.mak</span></pre>
<p>
What you may not know is that you can use <i>multiple</i> <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> options on the command line.  GNU make will read each file in turn, incorporating the contents of each just as if they were included with the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Include"><span><span face="Courier New">include</span></span></a> directive.  We can create a simple makefile called <span><span face="Courier New">printvar.mak</span></span> containing nothing but our <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule, then inject it into any makefile we want like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">gmake -f printvar.mak -f Makefile print-MAKE_VERSION</span></pre>
<h3>A shell script to save typing</h3>
<p>
The combination of the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule and the <span><span face="Courier New">-f</span></span> command-line option is powerful, but it’s unwieldy — too many characters to type.  The solution is a shell script wrapper:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">#!/bin/bash

filename=""
if [ -f GNUmakefile ] ; then
  filename="GNUmakefile"
elif [ -f makefile ] ; then
  filename="makefile"
elif [ -f Makefile ] ; then
  filename="Makefile"
fi
if [ -n "$filename" ] ; then
  vars=""
  for n in $@ ; do
    vars="$vars print-$n"
  done
  gmake -f $filename -f printvar.mak $vars
else
  echo "No makefile found" 1&gt;&amp;2
  exit 1
fi</span></pre>
<p>
Save that in a file called <span><span face="Courier New">printvars</span></span> somewhere on your <span><span face="Courier New">PATH</span></span> and you can do things like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ printvars MAKE_VERSION COMPILE.cc
MAKE_VERSION=3.81
COMPILE.cc=g++    -c</span></pre>
<h3>Advanced <span><span face="Courier New">make</span></span> variable diagnostics</h3>
<p>
Beyond simply printing the value of a variable, GNU make 3.81 has three built-in functions that allow introspection on variables, which you can add to the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule for additional diagnostics.</p>
<p>
First is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Origin-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(origin)</span></span></a> function, which tells you how a variable was defined.  For example, if a variable <span><span face="Courier New">FOO</span></span> was inherited from the environment, <span><span face="Courier New">$(origin FOO)</span></span> will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">environment</span></span>.  Variables defined in a makefile will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">file</span></span>, and so forth.</p>
<p>
Next is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavor-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(flavor)</span></span></a> function, which tells you the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Flavors">flavor of the variable</a>, either <span><span face="Courier New">simple</span></span> or <span><span face="Courier New">recursive</span></span>.</p>
<p>
Finally is the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Value-Function"><span><span face="Courier New">$(value)</span></span></a> function, which gives you the <i>unexpanded</i> value of the variable.  For example, if you have variables like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">FOO=123
BAR=$(FOO)</span></pre>
<p>
<span><span face="Courier New">$(value BAR)</span></span> will give the result <span><span face="Courier New">$(FOO)</span></span>, rather than the fully-expanded <span><span face="Courier New">123</span></span> that you might expect.</p>
<p>
With these additions, the <span><span face="Courier New">print-%</span></span> rule now looks like this:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">print-%:
	@echo '$*=$($*)'
	@echo '  origin = $(origin $*)'
	@echo '  flavor = $(flavor $*)'
	@echo '   value = $(value  $*)'</span></pre>
<p>
And here’s how it looks in action:</p>
<pre><span face="Courier New">ericm@chester:/tmp$ printvars MAKE_VERSION COMPILE.cc
MAKE_VERSION=3.81
  origin = default
  flavor = simple
   value = 3.81
COMPILE.cc=g++    -c
  origin = default
  flavor = recursive
   value = $(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(CPPFLAGS) $(TARGET_ARCH) -c</span></pre>

      <p>We’ve joined <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/making-twitter-a-better-home-for-writers.html?utm_campaign=The%20week%20in%20newsletters&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. This is big news for people who use Revue, people who will start using Revue and the whole team who built it. So in this email I wanted to go a little deeper than just this news. And that’s what email does better than any other platform. It lets you go deeper with a wide audience, both in your relationship and in your thinking. Add nuance, context, speak personally.</p><p>That experience inspired us to build the first version of Revue. We wanted to make sending an email newsletter as simple and enjoyable as Tweeting. That core goal has never changed, but the world around us sure has.</p><p>Email has become a much more important publishing platform. The publishing world is working even harder at its re-invention. And we’re proud to be part of that. Today, Revue makes it easy for a wide variety of creators and publishers to send a newsletter — and make money from it.</p><p>We help them find an audience, create a deep connection and grow without limits.</p><p>Today, we serve a spectrum of customers, from ambitious media upstarts like The Markup to independent creators like Scott Melker and even large legacy publishers like Germany’s Madsack. And while different, all of them come to Revue for one purpose: to transform how we share and absorb content.&nbsp;</p><p>They want to change the way publishing works. Who gets heard and who gets paid. And that’s what connects their goals to us, the people who build Revue.</p><p>The folks over at Twitter are amazing partners who believe in and add to our mission. Thanks to them we can invest more, build faster, and get better for you.</p><p>Thanks to our joining Twitter, we can make publishing on email even more accessible. As a first step, we’re excited to share some updates that will improve the way you can build and get paid for your content:</p><p>🤝 Starting a newsletter on Revue is now free</p><p>🤝 On paid newsletters, we only charge 5%</p><p>We’ve made these changes so that everyone can be a creator on Revue, with the opportunity to scale their newsletters and a paying audience without the added fees or obstacles that can limit growth.</p><p>One important element to our customers success is giving you full control. You own your audience, your content, your brand. You can send from your own domain. You can connect Revue to hundreds of other tools without coding. And of course we have an API for you to build on.</p><p>We are also building a version of Revue for larger creators and publications. They have even more control, This version offers features like fully custom designs and tools to help them manage their audience, cross-promote newsletters and include subscription offers.</p><p>For now, we’ll continue to operate as a standalone business. But expect to hear more about how we’re working with Twitter soon as we look at more ways to help you grow faster, be discovered more easily and build even deeper connections.</p><p>Our goal is to create the single best place in the world for media businesses of the future to start, to grow big and to innovate. There is a lot to do, so we’ll keep working on it — along with all the people who use Revue.</p><p>🧡</p><p>Martijn, Founder</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In <a href="https://www.chatkitty.com/blog/posts/building-a-chat-app-with-react-native-and-firebase-part-1/">this tutorial series</a>, 
I'll be showing you how to build a functional and secure chat app using the latest React Native 
libraries, including Gifted Chat and the Expo framework, powered by the ChatKitty platform.</p><div>
          <p>So far you learned how to use the <a href="https://gifted.chat/">Gifted Chat</a> React Native library with ChatKitty's 
JavaScript SDK to build a full featured chat screen with real-time messaging functionality into your app, 
adding screens for users to create public channels, discover new channels, and view their channels. 
In <a href="https://www.chatkitty.com/blog/posts/building-a-chat-app-with-react-native-and-expo-part-3/">the third article of this series</a>,
you enhanced that chat experience by implementing in-app and push notifications to notify your users when 
chat events occur. </p>
<p>In this tutorial, you'll be building on the group chat experience you created adding <strong>direct messaging</strong> 
to allow users to communicate privately. You'll also be adding a few enhancements to the chat experience 
including <strong>typing indicators</strong>, and <strong>chat room presence notifications</strong>. </p>
<p>After reading this article, you will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Create direct channels for users to chat privately</p>
</li>
<li><p>Integrate Gifted Chat's in-built typing indicator and implement a custom more detailed indicator</p>
</li>
<li><p>Notify chat users when a user enters or leaves the chat from a chat screen</p>
</li>
<li><p>Allow users to leave chat channels they are no longer interested in</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you followed along the previous articles, you should already have the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/chatkitty">ChatKitty JavaScript SDK NPM package</a> 
added to your Expo React Native project. To make sure you have the latest version of ChatKitty, run the 
yarn upgrade command:</p>
<pre><code># upgrade ChatKitty SDK to the latest version
yarn upgrade chatkitty</code></pre>


<p>Before we begin, let's go over some terms we'll be using a lot in this article.</p>
<h2 id="direct-channels">Direct channels</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.chatkitty.com/blog/posts/building-a-chat-app-with-react-native-and-gifted-chat-part-2/">Previously, we learned about ChatKitty chat channels</a>,
specifically <strong>public channels</strong> that users can discover and join, or be invited to join. <strong>Direct channels</strong>, 
on the other hand, let users have private conversations between up to 9 other users. New users cannot be added to a direct 
channel and there can only exist one direct channel between a set of users. Direct channels are perfect 
for one-off conversations that don't require an entire channel to discuss.</p>
<h2 id="entering-a-chat">Entering a chat</h2>
<p>When a user starts a chat session and has no other active chat sessions in the session channel, the user 
has <strong>entered a chat</strong>. In other words, users who have entered a chat have <em>at least one active chat session</em> 
for that chat channel, and are <strong>active participants</strong> of the conversation. Active chat participants 
receive real-time messaging events, and are present to reply immediately. </p>
<h2 id="leaving-a-chat">Leaving a chat</h2>
<p>After a user ends a chat session and has no other active chat sessions in the session channel, the user 
has <strong>left a chat</strong>. Users leave a chat when there is <em>no longer at least one active chat session</em> 
for that chat channel, and are <em>no longer active participants</em> of the conversation. After leaving a chat, 
users begin to get notifications of events that happened in the chat while they are away.</p>
<h2 id="leaving-a-channel">Leaving a channel</h2>
<p>After a user joins a channel, the user becomes a channel member. Channel members can send messages in 
a channel, and receives messages and notifications related to the channel. If a user is no longer interested 
in a channel, the user can leave the channel and is no longer a channel member.</p>
<p>Okay, let's get started! 🏎️</p>
<p>First, you'll be adding direct messaging functionality to your chat app.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-direct-messaging-channel">Creating a direct messaging channel</h2>
<p>Edit the <code>ChatScreen.js</code> screen file you previous created to destructure its <code>navigation</code> prop:</p>
<pre><code>export default function ChatScreen({ route, navigation /* Add this */ }) {
  const {user} = useContext(AuthContext);
  const {channel} = route.params;

  // Unchanged
}</code></pre>


<p>Now, you can customize your Gifted Chat message avatar to create or get a direct channel, and navigate 
the user to a new chat screen with the direct channel when it's pressed.</p>
<p>Define a new method <code>renderAvatar</code> to pass into your <code>GiftedChat</code> component:</p>
<pre><code>import { Avatar, Bubble, GiftedChat } from 'react-native-gifted-chat';

// Unchanged

function renderAvatar(props) {
  return (
    &lt;Avatar
      {...props}
      onPressAvatar={(avatarUser) =&gt; {
        kitty
          .createChannel({
            type: 'DIRECT',
            members: [{ id: avatarUser._id }],
          })
          .then((result) =&gt; {
            navigation.navigate('Chat', { channel: result.channel });
          });
      }}
    /&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>


<p>Set the <code>GiftedChat</code> <code>renderAvatar</code> prop to the method you defined:</p>
<pre><code>return (
  &lt;GiftedChat
    messages={messages}
    onSend={handleSend}
    user={mapUser(user)}
    loadEarlier={loadEarlier}
    isLoadingEarlier={isLoadingEarlier}
    onLoadEarlier={handleLoadEarlier}
    renderBubble={renderBubble}
    renderAvatar={renderAvatar} /* Add this */
  /&gt;
);</code></pre>


<p>After these changes, <code>ChatScreen.js</code> should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import React, { useContext, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { Avatar, Bubble, GiftedChat } from 'react-native-gifted-chat';

import { kitty } from '../chatkitty';
import Loading from '../components/Loading';
import { AuthContext } from '../navigation/AuthProvider';

export default function ChatScreen({ route, navigation }) {

<p>If you run the app now and go to a public chat screen, you should see:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.chatkitty.com/images/blog/posts/building-a-chat-app-with-react-native-and-gifted-chat-part-4/screenshot-public-chat.png" alt="Screenshot: Public chat"></p>
<p>Tapping a message avatar should take you to a new chat screen where you can have a direct private conversation.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.chatkitty.com/images/blog/posts/building-a-chat-app-with-react-native-and-gifted-chat-part-4/screenshot-direct-chat.png" alt="Screenshot: Direct chat"></p>
<p>ChatKitty automatically creates a unique channel name for direct channels, so we see a UUID in the app 
title bar. Let's use a more appropriate name for the chat screen title.  </p>
<p>Add a helper method <code>getChannelDisplayName</code> to the <code>index.js</code> file in the <code>src/chatkitty</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code>export function getChannelDisplayName(channel) {
  if (channel.type === 'DIRECT') {
    return channel.members.map((member) =&gt; member.displayName).join(', ');
  } else {
    return channel.name;
  }
}</code></pre>


<p>After this change, <code>index.js</code> should look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import ChatKitty from 'chatkitty';

export const kitty = ChatKitty.getInstance('YOUR CHATKITTY API KEY HERE');

export function getChannelDisplayName(channel) {
  if (channel.type === 'DIRECT') {
    return channel.members.map((member) =&gt; member.displayName).join(', ');
  } else {
    return channel.name;
  }
}</code></pre>


<p>You can now update your app to use a more readable channel display name.</p>
<p>Update <code>HomeStack.js</code> in <code>src/navigation</code> to use the <code>getChannelDisplayName</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>import { getChannelDisplayName, kitty } from '../chatkitty';

// Unchanged

&lt;ChatStack.Screen
    name="Chat"
    component={ChatScreen}
    options={({ route }) =&gt; ({
      title: getChannelDisplayName(route.params.channel), /* Add this */
    })}
/&gt;</code></pre>


<p>Also update <code>BrowseChannelsScreen.js</code> and <code>HomeScreen.js</code> in <code>src/screens</code> to use the helper method:</p>
<pre><code>import { getChannelDisplayName, kitty } from '../chatkitty';

// Unchanged

&lt;List.Item
    title={getChannelDisplayName(item)} /* Add this */
    // Unchanged
/&gt;</code></pre>


<p>Running the app now shows the display names of a direct channel's members in the title bar</p>
<p><img src="https://www.chatkitty.com/images/blog/posts/building-a-chat-app-with-react-native-and-gifted-chat-part-4/screenshot-direct-chat-name.png" alt="Screenshot: Direct chat name"></p>
<p>Great! Now you can privately chat with other channel members. Now let's move on to enhancing your chat 
app's experience with a typing indicator.</p>

January 26, 2021 | https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/react-as-generator-engine | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/react-as-generator-engine">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><img src="https://www.asyncapi.com/img/posts/react-as-generator-engine.webp" alt="Post cover image"><p>React permanently changed the way how developers write web-apps. Personally, we love React and knew it would solve many pain points we faced with Nunjucks. Therefore in the last <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/shape-up-process/issues/1">cycle</a> we integrated it as a template rendering engine into our <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a>. This post is a short introduction for developers who write or plan to write templates for AsyncAPI specification using React. It also includes a comparison with the default Nunjucks renderer.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>Your React template requires <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">@asyncapi/generator-react-sdk</a> as a dependency. You need it to access the <strong>File</strong> component required as a root component responsible for rendering a file. Furthermore, it provides some common components to make your development easier, like <strong>Text</strong> or <strong>Indent</strong>.	</p><p>Let's consider a basic React template file as the one below called <strong>MyTemplate.js</strong>:</p><p>The exported default function returns the <strong>File</strong> component as a root component that the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a> uses to figure out what file it should generate. In the example above, we overwrite the default functionality of saving the file as <strong>MyTemplate.js</strong>, and we set <strong>asyncapi.md</strong> as the filename. Using the <strong>Text</strong> component, we specify what content should be rendered inside the file. The content of the resulting file is: <code>Some text that should render as is\n</code>. Notice the <strong>\n</strong> character at the end. It is automatically added after the <strong>Text</strong> component.</p><blockquote><p>For further information about components and their props, see the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">Generator React SDK</a>.	 </p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">Generator</a> doesn't use React renderer by default. You need to specify in the template configuration that your template is based on React. For that, change the <strong>renderer</strong> field of <strong>generator</strong> object inside the template's <strong>package.json</strong> file:</p><p>You can find more information about the Generator configuration <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/blob/master/docs/authoring.md#configuration-file">here</a>.	 </p><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><p>The process of creating content from React components consists of two steps: transpile and render.	 </p><p>The SDK has a custom transpiler which ensures that any directory in template's <strong>template</strong> folder are transpiled using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup">Rollup</a>. Rollup helps bundling all dependencies and transpile them into CommonJS modules. This is required because this library will be used through NodeJS (by AsyncAPI Generator) which does not understand these new modules natively and we do not want to limit the developer in which syntax they prefer nor how they want to separate code.</p><p>Also, SDK has its own reconciler. It traverses through each element in the template structure and transforms it into a pure string. Prop <code>children</code> is always converted to a regular string and stored in the <code>childrenContent</code> prop in each component. Check the below example, to see how it works. In addition, you can also see how to apply the composition to templates using components:</p><p>There are some restrictions:</p><ul><li>React hooks feature is not allowed.</li><li>HTML tags are not supported.</li><li>React internal components like <code>Fragments</code>, <code>Suspense</code>, and others are skipped.</li></ul><h2 id="comparison-with-nunjucks">Comparison with Nunjucks</h2><p>The AsyncAPI generator still uses <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a> as a default render engine. It's a templating language, heavily focused on string literals, filters (similar to bash pipes), and partials called macros.	</p><p>The next sections compare how you can accomplish certain things in Nunjucks and React. For more complex examples, see the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates">template-for-generator-templates</a> repository with examples based on React and compare those with <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/tree/nunjucks">nunjucks</a> branch.</p><h3 id="creating-reusable-parts">Creating reusable parts</h3><p>It may sound obvious, but when writing any code, even a template, a programmer wants to create reusable parts that separate repeating logic.</p><p>In Nunjucks, you can reuse parts of the template using <strong>macros</strong>, in React, using <strong>components</strong>. Imagine that you are writing a template that produces Markdown content. You need to create a reusable macro/component that renders a list from an array of strings.</p><p>Using Nunjucks you can write the code below:</p><p>Using React you can write the code below:</p><p>Looking at both examples we see that in Nujucks we operate on string literals, it means that when passing data to a macro, you always need to know what type of data the macro takes. In React we operate on JS objects/variables. By this, your IDE should always inform you what value, of what type, you must pass to component. Additionally, you must place Nunjucks's macro inside the <strong>partials</strong> folder of the template. Using React, you can put your components wherever you want.</p><h3 id="using-third-party-packages">Using third party packages</h3><p>Using helper functions from third-party packages, in Nunjucks you must apply them as <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/blob/master/docs/authoring.md#filters">filters</a>. For example, you want to use one function from <a href="https://github.com/esamattis/underscore.string">Underscore.string</a> library like <strong>cleanDiacritics</strong>, which replaces diacritic characters with closest ASCII equivalents. To do this, you must create a function inside <strong>filters</strong> folder to convert the function to Nunjucks's filter:</p><p>And then you can use this function inside your template/macro:</p><p>The main problem with this solution is that it creates an unnecessary boilerplate - you must create a function in a separate file. Another problem is that you operate on the name of this helper function which means you must always remember what filters you have included in your template.</p><p>In opposite, in React you can use <code>Underscore.string</code> directly in your template:</p><p>It is worth mentioning that when using packages in this way, you always operate on the reference to the function, not on its name, so you know what functions you have in the file's scope.</p><h2 id="cons--pros">Cons &amp; Pros</h2><p>Like any solution, React has its advantages as well as disadvantages.</p><h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3><ul><li>Using React, you use JS directly. You don't need to learn custom Nunjuck's syntax, only how React works under the hood.</li><li>It provides better debugging functionality that is not possible with Nunjucks.</li><li>It provides better error stack traces.</li><li>Better tools support development. You write templates in JavaScript, you use a reference to functions/variables, and therefore your IDE can tell you what you can use in a given scope.	</li><li>Provides better support for separating code into more manageable chunks/components. You don't need to create <strong>partials</strong> folder. You can create React component wherever you want, also next to the template's source code.</li><li>You can easily test your components. It is difficult with Nunjucks. You can split template file into separate chunks and test them in separate test cases.</li></ul><h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3><ul><li>Common pain when writing templates with React is related to indentations and new lines. However, we have several helpers in SDK to make your life easier, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/blob/master/src/components/Indent.tsx"><code>Indent</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/blob/master/src/components/Text.tsx"><code>Text</code></a> components.</li><li>Some people don't like to mix logic inside template files, so probably React won't be friendly for them.</li><li>HTML tags at the moment are not supported. The developer must write them as a string literal, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/blob/main/components/ListChannels.js#L18">here</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><p>We use React render engine already in three official AsyncAPI templates:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates">template-for-generator-templates</a> template showcases features of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator">the AsyncAPI Generator</a>, including the React renderer. It shows how to write templates, reusable parts (components), what are the recommended patterns. It has simple and complex examples. You can also check how the same things could be done using Nunjucks in <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates/tree/nunjucks">this</a> branch.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/markdown-template">markdown-template</a> is written using React. It generates documentation into a Markdown file.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/ts-nats-template/">ts-nats-template</a> is re-written using React to generate a TypeScript NATS client.</li></ul><p>If you want to check the source code of React renderer, go to the <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk">official repository</a>.</p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>There is a long way ahead of us to stabilize React as a render engine. We know about problems that make it unpleasant to write templates using React, such as indents or new lines, but we will work on that. Additionally, we have a couple of improvements on our list that will allow things like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/issues/10">File Templates</a> to be simplified in the Generator. We also plan to support <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator-react-sdk/issues/3">TypeScript</a>.</p><p>We are waiting for your feedback.</p><p>Happy coding!</p><blockquote><p>Cover photo is from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080179/"><code>Drunken Master</code></a> movie.</p></blockquote></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1611636833572/KkMic2coN.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div itemprop="text"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.appsmith.com/">Appsmith</a>  is an open-source low code platform for developers to build internal apps and workflows.</p>
<p>In Appsmith, our developer users define business logic by writing any JS code in between <code>{{ }}</code> dynamic bindings almost anywhere in the app. They can use this while creating SQL queries, APIs, or triggering actions.
This functionality lets you control how your app behaves with the least amount of configuration. Underneath the hood, the platform will evaluate all this code in an optimized manner to make sure the app remains performant yet responsive.</p>
<p>Let us take an example of binding a query response to a table widget.</p>
<p>It all starts with the binding brackets <code>{{ }}</code> . When the platform sees these brackets and some code in it, in a widget or action configuration, it will flag the field as a dynamic field so that our evaluator can pick it up later. In our example let us bind usersQuery to usersTable</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608182443695/gunous9nM.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_2.46.08_PM.png"></p>
<p>Since we have added this binding in our tableData field, we will flag this field and store it in our widget config</p>
<pre><code>
{
  <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        ...
        <span>"tableData"</span>: <span>"{{
            usersQuery.data
                .map(row =&gt; ({
                    name: row.name,
                    email: row.email
                }))
            }}"</span>,
        <span>"dynaminBindingPathList"</span>: [
            {<span>"key"</span>: <span>"tableData"</span>}
            ...
        ]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the background, our evaluation listener, always keeps a lookout for such events that would need an evaluation. For our example, this is a scenario that definitely needs an evaluation, so it kicks off our evaluator.</p>
<p>We pass on our current list of app data constructed in what we call as <code>DataTree</code> to the evaluator thread and patiently wait to hear back from it ⏱</p>
<pre><code>
{
    <span>"usersQuery"</span>: {
        <span>"config"</span>: {...},
        <span>"data"</span>: [...]
    },
    <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        <span>"tableData"</span>: <span>"{{
            usersQuery.data
                .map(row =&gt; ({
                    name: row.name,
                    email: row.email
                }))
            }}"</span>,
        <span>"dynaminBindingPathList"</span>: [{<span>"key"</span>: <span>"tableData"</span>}]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>For performance reasons, we run our evaluation process in a separate background thread with the help of <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">web workers</a>. This ensures that evaluation cycles running longer than 16ms do not hang up the main thread giving the app bandwidth to always respond to user events.</p>
<p>Inside the thread, the event listener gets a wake-up call and gets to work. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Get differences</strong>: First it will calculate differences in the <code>DataTree</code> from the last time. This will ensure we only process changes and not the whole tree.</p>
<p>  In our example, we would see the <code>usersTable.tableData</code> has changed and <code>usersTable.dynamicBindingPathList</code> has a new entry.</p>
<p>  It takes each difference, filters any un-important changes, and processes the rest.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Get evaluation order with dependency map</strong>: It also maintains a <code>DependencyMap</code> between various entity properties. The evaluator will notice if any bindings have changed and recreate the sort order accordingly.</p>
<p>  For our example, we will infer that <code>usersTable.tableData</code> now depends on <code>usersQuery.data</code>. This means that the query response should always be evaluated before we can evaluate the table data and that whenever we see a change in the query response, we need to re-evaluate the table data as well</p>
<pre><code>  
  {
      ...
      <span>"usersTable.tableData"</span>: [<span>"usersQuery.data"</span>]
  }

  
  [
      <span>"usersQuery.data"</span>,
      <span>"usersTable.tableData"</span>
  ]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate:</strong> After creating an optimized evaluation order, we will evaluate the update the tree, in that said order. Evaluation happens via a closed <code>eval</code> function with the whole <code>DataTree</code> acting as its global scope. This is why we can directly reference any object in our <code>DataTree</code> in our code.</p>
<pre><code>  

  <span>const</span> code = <span>`
    usersQuery.data.map(row =&gt; ({
      name: row.name,
      email: row.email
    }))
  `</span>;

  <span>const</span> scriptToEvaluate = <span>`
    function closedFunction () {
      const result = <span>${code}</span>;
      return result
    }
    closedFunction()
  `</span>;

  <span>const</span> result = <span>eval</span>(scriptToEvaluate);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Validate and parse:</strong> We always want to make sure the values returned after evaluation to be in the right data type that the widget expects. The ensures the widget always gets predictable data even if your code has returned some errors. This is also needed for any function down the line in the evaluation order, if it refers to this field, will always get a reasonable data type to work with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that completes it. At the end of this, we will have a fully evaluated <code>DataTree</code> that we can then send back to the main thread and start listening for any new event to do this whole process again.</p>
<pre><code>
{
    <span>"usersQuery"</span>: {
        <span>"data"</span>: [...] 
    }
    <span>"usersTable"</span>: {
        <span>"tableData"</span>: [...]
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Our main thread gets an event saying the evaluation is complete, with the new evaluated <code>DataTree</code> which it stores in the app redux state. From here, the widgets pick up their data and render it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608182466454/vym6oXaQG.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_2.46.22_PM.png"></p>
<h3 id="summarizing-our-philosophy">Summarizing our philosophy</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pull vs Push:</strong> While building a low code app builder for varied developers, we thought hard about how the written code works with the rest of the platform. We wanted configuration to be easy to start yet powerful when it needed to be. For this reason, we went with a Pull based architecture rather than Push.</p>
<p>  What this means is that in most places, you won't have to think about how the data will get to a field. You write code that pulls everything from the global <code>DataTree</code> and sets it to the field where you write it. This way the moment the underlying data changes, it get propagated to all the fields dependant on it and you as a developer do not have to orchestrate ui changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong> One-way data flow:</strong> Since we are built on top React.js and Redux, we strongly embrace the one-way data flow model.</p>
<p>  What this means is that you cannot set a table's data directly to that field from some other part of the app. If you do need to update the table, you will have to trigger the query to run, which will then cause the table to re-render with the new data. This helps the code you write easy to reason about and bugs easy to find. It also encapsulates each widget's and action's logic in itself for good separation of concern.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What do you mean, exactly, by “CPU”?</strong></p>



<p>Once upon a time, computers sat on our desks; we knew exactly how many processors they had; and back then our biggest uncertainty was whether they could handle Y2K. Fast forward to today: our computers have 4, 8 or 16 processors — or quite possibly all of those at the same time, depending on how you define “processor.” (I’m using the terms “CPU” and “processor” interchangeably.) In this post I’ll describe “<em>processor sockets</em>,” “<em>processor cores</em>,” and “<em>processor threads</em>” with the goal of being able to answer “just how many CPUs do I have here?”</p>



<p>Most of us can readily rattle off the three words behind the initialism “CPU”: <em>“central processing unit!</em>” With today’s complex processors, however, we’re now faced with having to clarify whether the unit we speak of is</p>



<ul><li>a hardware package (a “socket”),</li><li>an independent execution unit (a “core”) within that package; or</li><li>a largely dependent unit (a “thread”) within that core that is more logical abstraction than anything else.</li></ul>



<p>Why do we now have this complexity? And, how did we get here? A brief look at each of these concepts should put it all in context.</p>



<h2>Processor Sockets</h2>



<p>This is the oldest of the three concepts, and the easiest to understand. A CPU socket is a receptacle, a physical connector linking the processor to the computer’s motherboard (the primary circuit board for the computer). Most PCs of the Y2K era (the 1990s) had just one CPU (and hence just one CPU socket). If you wanted another CPU then you needed a motherboard with another CPU socket. Two-socket PC motherboards first appeared around 1995. Multiple-socket motherboards were quite expensive and thus tended to be limited to higher-end servers.</p>



<p>You also needed an OS capable of making use of the additional processors, one with SMP* support: Windows 98 wouldn’t work (but Windows NT could) and if you were using Linux back then you’d probably need to recompile your kernel.</p>



<p>The number of CPU sockets on your motherboard is, of course, the same as the number of discrete CPU packages in your system (assuming you didn’t leave any sockets empty). By extension, <strong>the term “processor sockets” can refer to these discrete CPU packages themselves</strong> — handy when needing to distinguish this sense from the other two processor senses. A processor in the <em>socket</em>-sense is quite tangible: it’s something you can buy. (You can’t buy a <em>core</em> by itself — although you could rent one in the cloud!)</p>



<h2>Processor Cores</h2>



<p>Around 2005 both AMD and Intel started taking multiple processors and putting them in the same package: <strong>think of this as two CPUs sharing the same socket</strong>. There are some technical advantages to doing so (<em>e.g.</em> faster cache coherency as it’s not limited by the motherboard) along with the manufacturing advantages (the cores are usually, although not always, manufactured in the same die). Processor manufacturers turned to this model (more cores rather than faster cores) after being unable to increase clock speeds significantly after reaching the GHz range. Each processor core can execute code independently (whatever the layout: whether the cores are all on the same die, sharing the same processor socket, or each core has its own processor socket), although there are slight variances due to shared caches and bus layout.</p>



<p>Total core count is today the most important processor metric when planning systems with independent parallel workloads (such as those of today’s servers), taking the primary place CPU clock frequency held for comparing processors two decades ago.</p>



<h2>Processor Threads</h2>



<p><strong>Processor threads are “logical processors”</strong>: the CPU reports more processors than physically exist.</p>



<p>In 2002 Intel Corporation introduced the “Xeon MP” and “Pentium 4 HT” processors – the first processors with what Intel called “Hyper-Threading Technology.” Sill commonly called “hyperthreading” (the Kleenex of the processor world; the generic term is “simultaneous multithreading” or “SMT”), it was an attempt to speed computer processing by having another thread ready to run – and for the most part, it worked. I say “for the most part” because its advantage turned out to be highly workload dependent, speeding some workloads up dramatically and having a negative effect on others, <em>slowing them down considerably</em>. Many guides recommended disabling hyperthreading in the BIOS – particularly early on before software became hyperthreading-aware. Overall, however, hyperthreading has been a net gain, boosting performance (some say by 15%) for generic workloads, which why we still commonly see it on new processors today.</p>



<p>Hyperthreading is a hardware optimization to an old problem. Processors are often data-starved, waiting on I/O requests from slower storage. Operating systems solved this problem by giving the processor a different program or thread when the current one runs out of work: this is called a context-switch. The problem with context switches is that they are slow: the current state of the thread has to be copied from the CPU registers (super-fast memory locations within the CPU) back to main memory (RAM – very slow by comparison) and the new thread’s state has to then be copied into those registers. This process takes a few microseconds — a few thousand CPU cycles.</p>



<p>Hyperthreading solved this problem by having a second set of these super-fast registers already loaded and ready to go. This second set of registers, which only increases the processor die size by 5%, is presented to the computer as a second CPU, utilizing the same SMP architecture designed for multiple-processors. Hyperthreading doesn’t double your performance because it doesn’t give you a second physical processing unit: instead you just get a second set of CPU registers masquerading as a second CPU.</p>



<p>There are many architecture-specific nuances when it comes to processor threads and their degree of autonomy. All implementations, however, have this in common: threads are dependent (at least partially if not entirely) on resources shared with other threads on the same core.</p>



<p>In summary:</p>



<ul><li><em>processor socket</em> — a package of processors sharing a physical connection to the motherboard</li><li><em>processor core</em> — an independent processor</li><li><em>processor thread</em> — a “logical processor” sharing resources with other threads on the same core</li></ul>



<p>The 4/8/16-processor computer in this post’s opening paragraph is a four-socket server with dual-core CPUs in each socket, each core having two threads. It has:</p>



<ul><li>4 processor sockets,</li><li>8 total processor cores, or</li><li>16 total processor threads.</li></ul>



<h2>So how many CPUs do I have?</h2>



<p>You can see the number of sockets, cores, and threads on a Linux server via the “lscpu” command and focusing on the “Thread(s) per core,” “Core(s) per socket” and “Socket(s)” lines:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="806" height="486" src="https://www.xtivia.com/media/Linux-lscpu.png" alt="Sockets, Cores, and Threads - Linux lscpu"></figure>



<p>The total number of processor threads can be calculated by multiplying the number of sockets by the number of cores per socket and the number of threads per core.</p>



<p>On Windows 10 you can see the breakdown under the Performance tab of the Task Manager (Ctrl-Shift-Esc to launch Task Manager; click “More details” if you don’t see tabs):</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="211" height="82" src="https://www.xtivia.com/media/Windows-SocketsCoresLogicalProcessors.png" alt="Sockets, Cores, and Threads - Windows-Sockets Cores Logical Processors"></figure>



<p>Note that, on Windows, processor threads are called “Logical processors” (arguably a better name). Task Manager shows total <em>Cores</em> (rather than cores-per-socket) and total threads (total <em>Logical processors</em>, rather than threads-per-core).</p>


<p>[*<em>Symmetric multiprocessing</em> (“SMP”) is specifically a computer architecture with two or more identical processors (CPUs) in which each processor can access all of the main memory equally, but since NUMA hadn’t hit the PC world yet we just thought of SMP support as multiprocessor support.]</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Before we begin, I have an announcement to make regarding the future of this podcast. Beginning February 1st, <em>The Grant Williams Podcast</em> will become part of the copper membership tier of my new website, <a href="https://grant-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grant-williams.com</a>. Now, the copper tier will include every future episode of the end game, the super terrific happy hour and the narrative game, as well as access to a series of special one-on-one conversations I’ll be having with a group of truly extraordinary people throughout the rest of this year, beginning with my dear friend and mentor, Anthony Deden of Edelweiss Holdings. At the site, you’ll also find a silver tier, which in addition to access to <em>The Grant Williams Podcast</em>, will include a year subscription to my monthly newsletter, <em>Things That Make You Go Hmmm…</em> But you can find out a lot more about all that by visiting <a href="https://grant-williams.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grant-williams.com</a>. And now on with the show.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Something that’s fascinated me over the last 12 months has been how keen people are to hear my views on cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular. I’ve tried to lay out my position as clearly as I can over that year. And I’ll do the same again here. I understand the bull case for crypto very, very well. In many ways, it’s a similar case to the one I’ve been making myself over the years for gold. Because of that, I’ve been predisposed to be bullish on Bitcoin, but like anything I come across that looks interesting, I maintain what I view as a healthy level of skepticism until I’ve had any fears allayed. As far as Bitcoin goes, I’m just not quite there yet. There are things which concern me about its long-term viability. And so until I can have those questions answered to my satisfaction, Bitcoin, to me, remains a highly speculative asset.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>The difficulty I’ve found in getting my questions answered stems largely from the binary opinion set that I’ve found wherever I’ve searched for those answers. Bitcoin, it seems is either going to eat the world or it’s a complete Ponzi scheme. And finding a space between those two opinions where my possible answers might lie, has proven very difficult for me. Last week, an extremely negative article about Tether, the supposedly dollar-backed stablecoin, did the rounds and from the commentary and discussion around that article, the idea of a debate rose organically on FinTwit, a debate that I was asked to moderate. Needless to say in my own search for answers to my questions, I was happy to oblige. And so here we are.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Joining me today are Mike Green of Logica Funds, a man with a towering intellect and a decidedly negative view of Bitcoin (and Tether for that matter). And Nic Carter, co-founder of Castle Island Ventures &amp; CoinMetrics and another man in position of some serious intellectual firepower, but who sees Bitcoin in a completely different and extremely positive light. But the idea here is to offer both sides of the Bitcoin debate, a chance to speak and engage respectfully with the other, in the hopes of providing anybody listening with something to either challenge their own assumptions, answer nagging questions they might have, or simply provide them with some good old fashioned confirmation bias. The goal isn’t to change anybody’s mind about Bitcoin, although who knows, maybe that can actually happen in either direction, but rather to have a thoughtful, respectful conversation about what is… No matter which side of the debate you find yourself on the hottest topic in finance right now. So let’s get to it. A conversation with Mike Green and Nic Carter.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Gentlemen, welcome both of you to this special podcast that kind of arose organically. And I’m absolutely delighted that the two you were willing to take the time to come on and talk about this because there’s been so much said and written about Bitcoin, obviously, on both sides and right at the top of the show, I’m going to position myself and explain to everybody where I am because I think that’s important for the guy in the middle to understand. I like to refer myself as a ‘bit skeptic’. I understand the potential promise of Bitcoin. I’ve heard some very smart people say very smart things about… A lot of which resonates with me from my time in the precious metals space, but I have questions that I just don’t really… There are things that just don’t quite click with me.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>There are problems that I worry about and what I’ve found when I’ve been on the fringes of this space is that, it’s difficult to get thoughtful, considered answers that… Particularly on Twitter. Thoughtful, considered answers, that don’t just degenerate very quickly into a slanging match from both sides. So to have two thoughtful guys like you, join me on the podcast is a real treat for me. So thank you both for doing that.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>What we’re going to do, I think, is start talking about Bitcoin. And then as part of the conversation that I want to discuss, however, briefly, or however long it takes, the recent Tether piece, the doomsday piece, which got everybody’s in a flat a few days ago. So I think what I might do is start with you, Nic. And just to give us really your kind of introduction to Bitcoin and your thoughts on what it is and what it potentially could be. And perhaps any of the things that trouble you about it, if there is anything, in fact.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>Sure. Yeah. And thanks so much for moderating, Grant. I’m a big fan of your show. And Mike, thanks for agreeing to the debate as well. I’m really excited to talk with you. A fan of yours as well. So from my perspective, I’ve been sort of professionally involved in Bitcoin probably since about 2017. It was when I joined Fidelity as their Bitcoin analyst, right. So I was probably one of the first folks on Wall Street sort of be a dedicated Bitcoin guy. Prior to that, I was just an enthusiast, right. I was an amateur Bitcoiner. I mean, there wasn’t really a crypto industry before that, right. And now, my current affiliation is partner at a venture fund and we invest in startups building on public blockchains. So, I certainly believe in this stuff, putting my capital to work, and I believe in the vision of the future that includes cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>The way I see Bitcoin is, it’s kind of two things in one. It is a protocol for sending value through communications medium and encoding value and information. And it’s also an asset. It’s a monetary asset and I would compare it to commodity. So I would say it’s a non-state monetary commodity. It’s something that stores value over time and space. And it’s an independent system of property rights where rather it proposes a state independent system of property rights. So you don’t need an established legal system or a police force or the state to enforce the rights. The rights are enforced through cryptography. And so in that respect, it’s sort of contextually important. So in some cases where you have a functioning financial system, functioning legal system, that has no risk of expropriation, you have no need for Bitcoin, right.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>So in the US, that would characterize most people. They’re puzzled by it. They don’t really see the need for a Bitcoin because everything works great here for now, at least. In other countries where property rights are not really respected and you have inflation or devaluations, or just simply people’s funds, banks accounts get seized on a frequent basis, then maybe there is more of a need for a non-state system. So those are the countries where we’re seeing some adoption of Bitcoin. You also see plenty of Americans getting exposure to it, maybe an anticipation of a future time when it becomes super relevant or just out of the speculative mania too.</p><p>Nic Carter:</p><p>But quite briefly, that’s how I see it. I think it’s important for there to be non-state monetary technologies. I think Bitcoin is extremely promising and it improves upon gold in some really critical respects, particularly along the domain of auditability, verifiability and taking physical settlement, which is where I think it really improves upon gold. But I think if you are positively disposed towards gold, you should probably take a look at Bitcoin because it’s really similar in some of its critical features. Although, of course, not the same thing by any means. So that’s my sort of very short description of Bitcoin.</p><p>Grant Williams:</p><p>Yeah. It’s really interesting. And I think my time spent in the precious metal space where my… I was originally exposed to Bitcoin, I saw the similarities between the Bitcoin proposition as it was then, and the things that gold has. I definitely have a few questions about those supposed improvements upon gold, which we’ll get into later on. But I want to turn it over to Mike. Mike, just if you can, your… Because, obviously, your view on Bitcoin is the polar opposite to Nic’s. And so I’m curious to get an overview of that and the things that concern you the most. And then we can perhaps dive into some of these things.</p><p>Mike Green:</p><p>So it’s interesting because I actually don’t think that we are necessarily polar opposites. I think that we have very strongly divergent opinions in terms of the value of it. So my introduction to Bitcoin happened back in 2012, my wife likes to point out that she expressed interest in buying it at $25 and wanted to put $10,000 in. And I said, “Well, why don’t we actually put money in that matters?” And so do $100,000. And she, of course, said that’s far too much and did nothing with it, right. Now, my view on Bitcoin for a very long time was get yourself to neutral. Own enough that it’s not going to make you crazy rich and own enough that you’re not sitting there with an incredible amount of FOMO as you watch others get rich around you.</p><p>Mike Green:</p><p>I changed that view in 2020 for a very, very simple reason, which is, as I began to see the dynamic of Americans express the view that Bitcoin was the solution to an overly aggressive central …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <article>
    <p>In the beginning of 2020, I left my job at <a href="https://www.vara.ai/">Vara</a>, where I worked as a Software Engineer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/farewell-socker-mom-evghenii-kondratenko/">Soccer
Mom</a> and Regulatory Affairs Person. I didn’t really know what to do next. While I enjoyed
the Coding and Soccer Mom Duties, one thing was for sure: No more regulatory work, ever.</p>

<p>Fast-forward one year. I spent the year doing regulatory work. <em>What the hell?</em></p>

<p>I worked as a regulatory consultant at Ada, MindPeak, imvaria and countless of other, lesser-known startups.</p>

<p><em>But.. why? And what the hell is regulatory consulting?</em></p>

<p>If you develop medical software, lots of regulations suddenly apply to you. Historically, they were created to
prevent you from killing patients with your software. A sensible goal. Unfortunately, those regulatory
requirements are written in a very generic, unhelpful way. It’s not really their fault, either: They simply
have to handle all sorts of edge cases. Like, the same rule may have to cover breast implants and machine
learning software.</p>

<p>That’s where regulatory consultants come in. And that’s where I came in when I joined my first few clients in
February 2020.</p>

<p>I was very transparent about my knowledge. Like, <em>Hey, listen, I appreciate that you want to hire me, but I
accomplished this goal exactly once (at Vara) and I have no clue how much knowledge I’m lacking</em>.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, all of them continued to hire me. And even more surprisingly, I saw the work which other
consultants had done before me and noticed.. it was bad. Wait, does that mean I was better? That doesn’t sound
right.</p>

<p>I certainly didn’t know the regulations very well. So I couldn’t be better.</p>

<p>But then I learnt: Knowing regulations very well doesn’t mean you’ll be a great regulatory consultant. Just
like knowing medical textbooks well won’t make you a great doctor, and perfect programming skills won’t make
you a great developer. Developing software is not about writing code, it’s about solving problems.</p>

<p>Certainly, those <em>hard</em> skills don’t hurt, but unless they’re coupled with sufficient <em>soft</em> skills, they’re
useless. Also, the hard-skill-soft-skill classification doesn’t work very well here, as essentially, we’re
talking about multiple <em>hard</em> skills.</p>

<p>For regulatory consulting, those are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Project management:</strong> How the hell can we accomplish a huge task which needs input from almost everyone
in the company?</li>
  <li><strong>Pragmatism:</strong> We’re only a three-person startup. How can we become compliant with minimal effort?</li>
  <li><strong>Concreteness:</strong> Don’t give us a talk about how things work. Show us how to fill out those documents!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t have project management skills, you’ll never get done. The idea of the magical consultant who
comes in, sits in a corner, creates a pile of documents and leaves again (after charging a huge sum of money)
is just that, magical. It doesn’t work. Compliance is an all-team effort.</p>

<p>If you don’t have pragmatism, you’ll get caught up in regulatory overengineering. Like working on a document
for more than a day. Does that mean you should be sloppy?  No - meticulous work is important. But look, you
might have to fill out 80 documents, and if you spend two days on one, you can do the maths and see when
you’ll be done with the remaining 79. You can always go back and improve stuff when you’re done. But if you’re
never done, you’ll never go to market and your company will run out of money.</p>

<p>And finally, if you don’t have concreteness, you end up being something like an in-house lecturer. Always
happy to give workshops and answer theoretical questions, but when it comes to actually <em>doing</em> stuff, like
filling out documents, then things get tricky.</p>

<p>Many consultants are lacking in those areas.</p>

<p>Please note: I’m not ranting or bashing consultants here! I think that this combination of skills is very
rare, regardless of industry. And startups are a part of the problem - because, if those skills are so
important, why are they not selecting consultants with exactly those skills?</p>

<p>That’s the thing. Startups who hire consultants don’t really know what they need. It’s a misunderstanding of
the job to be done: Startups don’t need someone with perfect regulatory knowledge. They need someone to make
them compliant. Sounds like the same, but it is not.</p>

<p>Making a company compliant includes all of the above and more. It’s a huge problem, and nobody has solved it
well. In the meantime, Healthcare startups are struggling.</p>

<p>I think it can be solved well. That’s why I choose regulatory consulting.</p>

<hr>

<p>So - how can we solve regulatory compliance for startups? The problem is complex, but we can roughly decompose
it into two sub-problems:</p>

<p>From the startups perspective:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What the hell do we need to do?</li>
  <li>How the hell do we do it?</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before I dive into how we currently “solve” these problems, it’s worth mentioning that Germany has
recently launched a program for apps to become reimbursable by public insurances. Of course, it’s highly
regulated. But in this case, there’s a <a href="https://www.bfarm.de/EN/MedicalDevices/DiGA/_node.html">comprehensive, modern website</a> which even includes a
<a href="https://www.bfarm.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/MedicalDevices/DiGA_Guide.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2">128-page pdf guide</a> in easily-understandable language with lots of examples. Awesome!
Things are moving in the right direction for sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, before we get too optimistic, let’s turn our attention back to medical device compliance. There’s no
shiny website and no readable pdf. So how do we solve the two problems above?</p>

<p>The state-of-the-art answer of regulatory consultants is <em>billable hours</em>: Let’s do a 8-hour workshop and
we’ll explain it to you. Unfortunately, that often only answers question 1), what needs to be done. It still
remains unclear <em>how</em> to actually do it.</p>

<p>That’s where <em>templates</em> come in. Templates are a custom set of pre-written documents which consultants “sell”
to their clients by implicitly sharing them only when a longer-term contract (billable hours) is signed. That
answers question 2), how to achieve regulatory compliance. By filling out the templates.</p>

<p>Now, I’m trying not to sound negative here, I’m simply stating the facts. I think workshops are a viable way
of sharing this sort of highly-customized, it-depends-on-your-company knowledge. And sharing templates only
with your clients makes sense, because you always need to heavily customize them. Because every company is a
unique snowflake. Right?</p>

<p><em>Right?</em></p>

<p>Or maybe not. Maybe every company isn’t a unique snowflake.</p>

<p>Maybe there is a common denominator of regulatory things which apply to every company. Maybe there is a common
set of knowledge, and a common set of minimalistic templates which can be re-used.</p>

<p>And if something can be re-used - shouldn’t it be shared?</p>

<p>Consultants like to think that openly sharing knowledge and templates is a zero-sum game: The more you share,
the more people can do by themselves, the less billable hours you have.</p>

<p>That may be true. Maybe not. In any case, I think it’s a huge misalignment of incentives. Why are we here in
the first place? To bill hours? Or to bring medical innovation to patients? What if we have the choice between
bringing one device to market while getting paid, or bringing ten devices to market, for free?</p>

<p>I’d choose the ten devices, any time, as long as I have enough money to pay my bills. And right now I do.</p>

<p>I think that sharing knowledge (and technology) for free is <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/open-source-beyond-the-market/">not a zero-sum
game</a>. If I publish my knowledge, will that cost me money every time
someone reads it? Of course not. Will it reduce my billable hours? Maybe. But then again, I’m tired of
regulatory consulting because a large chunk of it is repetitive and mind-numbing.</p>

<p>So, today, I’m launching <a href="https://www.openregulatory.com/">OpenRegulatory</a>. It’s a place where I’ve started brain-dumping all
my consultant knowledge and templates, for free. And it’s my new company.</p>

<p>It’s not complete, but it’s a start. The <a href="https://openregulatory.com/templates/">templates</a> are mostly done, and there’s a
<a href="https://openregulatory.com/blueprint-certifying-medical-software/">step-by-step guide</a> on how to certify software as a medical device.</p>

<p>If you want to talk to other Healthcare startup people, there’s a friendly <a href="https://openregulatory.com/community/">Slack
Community</a> full of people willing to share their experiences.</p>

<p>If you need even more concreteness, there are <a href="https://openregulatory.com/screencasts/">videos in which you can watch me create
documentation</a> from scratch.</p>

<p>And finally, most obviously, being a software developer at heart, there’s a
<a href="https://openregulatory.com/formwork/">software</a> which automates many of the most tedious tasks.</p>

<p>If we want medical device innovation to scale, sharing knowledge openly is the only way forward. Let’s see if
we’re up to the challenge.</p>

<p>This trains a simple <a href="https://nn.labml.ai/">transformer</a> model for auto-regression.
We try different variants for the <a href="https://nn.labml.ai/transformers/feed_forward">position-wise feedforward network</a>.</p>
<p><em>This is a simpler implementation that doesn’t use <a href="https://nn.labml.ai/transformers/glu_variants/experiment.html"><code>labml.configs</code></a> module.
We decided to write a simpler implementation to make it easier readers who are not familiar.</em></p>

<h3>[ 2020-September-07 16:07 ]</h3>
<p>We build software on a huge stack of pre-existing software. This raises the question of when do we update those dependencies? The policy that emerges if you do nothing is that dependencies are updated when you have a clear need, such as requiring a feature that is only available in the latest version. Otherwise, you keep using the version of the operating system, libraries, and tools you installed when you first needed them. In my opinion, this is a bad policy. For projects actively being developed, I believe it is well worth the effort to use the latest stable release of your dependencies. This means you need to constantly spend some effort to stay up to date. However, I believe this <em>saves</em> effort in the long run, by avoiding bugs and reducing the total time spent applying updates. In the rest of this article, I will explain my position. As with most software engineering topics, I'm going to argue based on my own experience, and without any data.</p>


<h2>Disadvantages of updating dependencies</h2>

<p>There are two disadvantages to updating your dependencies. First, any change to a software system has some risk of introducing errors. Even if the update is a bug fix (e.g. going from version 1.0.2 to 1.0.3 in <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>), it might break your program. Your code might depend on some behaviour that was changed by the "fix," causing your program to break (see: <a href="https://www.hyrumslaw.com/">Hyrum's Law</a>). Hence, the least risky thing to do when maintaining an application is change it as little as possible. That means not updating dependencies.</p>

<p>The second disadvantage is that it takes effort, and does not provide any user-visible improvement. The argument is that instead of spending the time to update your dependencies, you should spend that time doing something that directly benefits users instead. While the effort may be small, there is usually <em>some</em> work involved, even if it is just  changing version numbers. If your process is automated, then you've spent the effort in the past to build and maintain the automation, so it still cost something. Even worse, on the rare case that an update breaks your software, you will need to debug it, which might be the worst of all, since you don't suspect it and usually can't plan for it. At least incompatible major versions usually give you a hint that you may need to spend some effort, so you can plan for it. At the extreme, you might be depending on a feature that has been removed in the latest version, which means you cannot update without substantial effort.</p>


<h2>Advantages of updating dependencies</h2>

<p>The first advantage of updating is that you avoid some unknown bugs. A well-managed software project generally improves over time. While that "improvement" may be uneven, and some releases may regress, if a project isn't improving, it dies. Hence, if you stay current, you are avoiding some bugs in your dependencies. Unfortunately, you will never know which bugs you avoided. On the other hand, you always know exactly what things broke by updating, because you will need to fix it. The fact that the benefits are invisible is what contributes to the perspective that updates don't provide value. However, on rare occasions you can notice the opposite problem: you will discover a bug in a dependency, and find out it has already been fixed in the latest version.</p>

<p>The second advantage to staying up to date is that it is easier to get support for the most recent release. In this context, I mean "support" in the broadest sense. You will find better documentation, it is easier to search for answers on the Internet, and can more easily get help with bug reports. If you are using an older version, it is common for someone to ask you to try it again with the latest version. This "support" cost is very small, and spread across your entire development effort.</p>

<p>The final advantage of updating is that I believe applying regular smaller updates actually takes less total effort than applying big updates less often. This is a bit counter-intuitive: If there is some amount of fixed "per update" effort (e.g. running the "update my dependencies" tool), then shouldn't it be <em>less</em> effort to do one big update instead of a sequence of small updates? In particular, you get to skip updates, which should safe effort. However, I believe the sequence of small updates is more efficient. One big reason is that when you find a problem, it is isolated to a smaller update, so finding and fixing the problem takes less time. When you find a problem in a big batch of updates, the first step tends to try the sequence of smaller updates anyway. Another reason smaller updates are more efficient is if you do it regularly, you get better at it. It forces you to document the process, or write some basic tests or automation for it.</p>


<h2>Opinionated advice about how to do updates</h2>

<p>In my opinion, a well-run software project should regularly update all their dependencies to the latest stable version. However, the exact schedule for how to do this, or how often, will depend on the project and the organization. At the extreme end, you can fully automate the process, which is what parts of the Chrome web browser seem to do <a href="https://skia.googlesource.com/buildbot/+/master/autoroll/README.md">Skia's AutoRoll documentation</a>). A middle ground is to provide a script that generates the update change, but requires some manual approval or shepherding of the change through a build process (e.g. see <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:DEPS">Chrome's DEPS file instructions</a>). I would say that you probably need to be doing this more often than once a year, to avoid some dependencies from not being the most recent "stable" release.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://github.com/micha-lmxt/descent-ripple">descent-ripple</a> package provides an easy way to add ripple animations to buttons and button-like UI elements. That means when you click on a button, or whatever UI-component you add this effect to, a short animation will start at the position of the click, which is bound by the borders of the button. This looks nice and also gives the user the feel of a responding UI. It is especially helpful for touch interfaces since it gives the user some feedback about the click position.

<h2 id="h2465289">Getting started
    </h2>

<p>The package can be used with any javascript framework, or even without. Here I will show you how to use it with React, Svelte, or without Framework. The package is written using <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> and is already compiled and minimized, so there is no overhead or requirement.
    </p>
<p>You can import the library using:
    </p>
<pre><p><code><span><span>npm</span><span> </span><span>install</span><span> </span><span>descent</span><span>-</span><span>ripple</span></span></code></p>
      
    </pre>
<p>Then, depending on your framework, you can add the ripple:
    </p>

      <div id="Svelte36502">
<pre><p><code><span><span>// MyButton.svelte</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;script&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>    import ripple from 'descent-ripple';</span></span>
<span><span>    let rippleOptions = </span><span>{}</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>&lt;button</span><span> </span><span>use</span><span>:</span><span>ripple</span><span>={</span><span>rippleOptions</span><span>}&gt;</span><span>click me </span><span>&lt;/button&gt;</span></span></code></p>

<p>That's all you need to add the effect and all the examples below just adjust the <code><code>rippleOptions</code></code> object.
    </p>
<blockquote><div><p>&gt;</p>
        <p>The ripple function usually adds the needed CSS to your button. If the result is not well-positioned, it could be that your framework is overriding the style property of your button/component. Try to manually add "position:relative" to the style of your button, if the ripple is not in place, and "overflow:hidden", if the ripple draws out of boundaries.
    </p></div>

<h3 id="h3136629">nLines and nCircles
    </h3>

<p>The ripple animates lines and/or circles. With <code><code>nLines</code></code> you say, how many lines you want. Lines are spaced equally around the center. You can have both circles and lines. More than one circle will make sense later when we know how to use delay.

<h3 id="h3308172">lineProps and circleProps
    </h3>

<p>Lines and circles are svg-path and svg-circle elements. Colors are defined by the <code><code>stroke</code></code> and <code><code>fill</code></code> property. Other interesting attributes, especially for the lines, are <code><code>stroke-linecap</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-linejoin</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-miterlimit</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-opacity</code></code>, <code><code>stroke-width</code></code>. You can apply the same props to all circles and lines, or handle each individually. To do that, supply a function of the index:

<h3 id="h3677242">lineBreakDist and rotation

<p>Each path is split into several segments via lineBreakDist. A larger distance means fewer breaks. With <code><code>rotation</code></code>, you can make the lines bend circularly. You can supply a single value or a function on the line-break index. <code><code>rotation</code></code> is measured in degrees.

<h3 id="h3129929">Animation and AnimationProps

<p>By default descent-ripple supports the following animation types from <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/src/runtime/transition/index.ts">Svelte</a>:
<code><code>"draw"</code></code>, <code><code>"scale"</code></code>, <code><code>"fade"</code></code>, <code><code>"blur"</code></code> and <code><code>"fly"</code></code> plus <code><code>"draw-reverse"</code></code>. All these animations can take props, which typically include <code><code>{delay:number, duration:number, easing: (t:number)=&gt;number}</code></code>, you can look them up on <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/master/src/runtime/transition/index.ts">Svelte</a>. <code><code>"draw-reverse"</code></code> accepts the same props as <code><code>"draw"</code></code>. You can change in and out animations for circles and lines and the props can be passed as a function of the circle/line index.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div>
<p>Every build has a story to tell - Tamperproof provenance for your code and CI/CD pipeline</p>
<p>Quickstart here: <a href="https://timestamp.codenotary.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://timestamp.codenotary.com</a></p>
<p>The combination of our free, lightning-fast and always-on timestamp service and the easy to use cli tool, gets you started in a minute.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.codenotary.com/images/blog/mascot_timestamp.png" width="350"></p><h2 id="what-means-trusted-timestamping">What means trusted timestamping</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Trusted timestamping</a> is the process of securely keeping track of the creation and modification time of a document. Security here means that no one—not even the owner of the document—should be able to change it once it has been recorded provided that the timestamper's integrity is never compromised.
CodeNotary uses its immutable open source database <a href="https://github.com/codenotary/immudb" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immudb</a> to provide this service that includes cryptographic verification and immutable data history.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<p>This timestamping service provides full immutability for all data ever written and unique data checksum ever stored including its history. As a trust level comes with the timestamp, you can change your mind over time (unsupport, untrust) without touching the code or binary. As the complete trust and timestamping history is stored for any digital identity (SHA-256 checksum), you can easily create workflows and decision trees in your CI/CD recipes.</p>
<p>There are plenty of different use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a trusted timestamp to code</li>
<li>Add an immutable timestamp to electronic signatures</li>
<li>Seal the data integrity and your trust level at a given point in time</li>
<li>Prove the existence of elecronic data at a specific point in time</li>
<li>CI/CD integration - notarize all outgoing assets, authenticate all incoming</li>
<li>Store provenance for you own sources</li>
<li>Unsupport deprecated versions of your software and run update checks bases on the latest timestamp</li>
<li>Revoke trust (untrust) at any time without the need to touch your code or binaries</li>
<li>Trust or remove trust for digital assets and act on the status (within your script or pipeline)</li>
<li>Simply timestamp files and sources to doublecheck at any time in the future if these are still the same (backup/restore)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Simply request your API key and get started within a minute! This service is free forever and was built using Open Source!</strong> </p>
<p>Notarized assets informations is stored in a tamperproof ledger with cryptographic verification backed by <a href="https://codenotary.com/technologies/immudb/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">immudb</a>, the immutable database.</p>
<h3 id="obtain-an-api-key">Obtain an API Key</h3>
<p>To provide access to our timestamping service a valid API Key is required. If you don't have one yet, simply signup here <a href="https://timestamp.codenotary.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CodeNotary Timestamp</a>
This API Key is bound to your email address and it's required during vcn login.</p>
<h2 id="quick-start">Quick start</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Installer</strong> In case you use Linux or macOS, the quickest start is our install script:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code><span>bash</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>(</span><span>curl</span> https://getvcn.codenotary.com -L<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can also <a href="https://github.com/vchain-us/vcn/releases/latest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">download the latest release</a></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Login</strong> to <a href="https://timestamp.codenotary.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">timestamp.codenotary.com</a></li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>vcn login --lc-host timestamp.codenotary.com 

<span>VCN_LC_API_KEY</span><span>=</span><span>&lt;</span>Your-API-Key vcn login --lc-host timestamp.codenotary.com
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Notarize existing digital objects</strong> Once you have an account you can start notarizing digital assets to give them an identity.</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>vcn n <span>&lt;</span>file<span>|</span>dir://directory<span>|</span>docker://dockerimage<span>|</span>git://gitdirectory<span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Authenticate digital objects</strong> You can use the command as a starting point.</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><code>vcn a <span>&lt;</span>file<span>|</span>dir://directory<span>|</span>docker://dockerimage<span>|</span>git://gitdirectory<span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>For detailed <strong>command line usage</strong>, just run <code>vcn help</code>.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<h4 id="wildcard-support-and-recursive-notarization">Wildcard support and recursive notarization</h4>
<p>It's also possible to notarize assets using a wildcard pattern.</p>
<p>With <code>--recursive</code> flag the utility can recursively notarize inner directories.</p>

<h4 id="notarization">Notarization</h4>
<p>Start with the <code>login</code> command. <code>vcn</code> will walk you through login and importing up your secret upon initial use.</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn login --lc-host timestamp.codenotary.com
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once your secret is set, you can notarize assets like in the following examples:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn notarize &lt;file&gt;
vcn notarize dir://&lt;directory&gt;
vcn notarize docker://&lt;imageId&gt;
vcn notarize podman://&lt;imageId&gt;
vcn notarize git://&lt;path_to_git_repo&gt;
vcn notarize --hash &lt;hash&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Change the asset's status:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn unsupport &lt;asset&gt;
vcn untrust &lt;asset&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="authentication">Authentication</h4>
<div><pre><code>vcn authenticate &lt;file&gt;
vcn authenticate dir://&lt;directory&gt;
vcn authenticate docker://&lt;imageId&gt;
vcn authenticate podman://&lt;imageId&gt;
vcn authenticate git://&lt;path_to_git_repo&gt;
vcn authenticate --hash &lt;hash&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>To output results in <code>json</code> or <code>yaml</code> formats:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn authenticate --output=json &lt;asset&gt;
vcn authenticate --output=yaml &lt;asset&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h4 id="authenticate-a-docker-image-automatically-prior-to-running-it">Authenticate a Docker image automatically prior to running it</h4>
<p>First, you’ll need to pull the image by using:</p>

<p>Then use the below command to put in place an automatic safety check. It allows only verified images to run.</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn authenticate docker://hello-world &amp;&amp; docker run hello-world
</code></pre></div>
<p>If an image was not verified, it will not run and nothing will execute.</p>
<h4 id="authenticate-multiple-assets">Authenticate multiple assets</h4>
<p>You can authenticate multiple assets by piping other command outputs into <code>vcn</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>ls | xargs -n 1 vcn authenticate
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>The exit code will be <code>0</code> only if all the assets in you other command outputs are verified.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="authenticate-by-a-specific-signer">Authenticate by a specific signer</h4>
<p>By adding <code>--signerID</code>, you can authenticate that your asset has been signed by a specific SignerID.
You can find your own signer id in the output of <code>vcn n</code> or <code>vcn a</code> (Signer).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A SignerID is the signer public address (represented as a 40 hex characters long string prefixed with <code>0x</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<div><pre><code>vcn authenticate --signerID 0x8... docker://hello-world
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="authenticate-using-the-assets-hash">Authenticate using the asset's hash</h4>
<p>If you want to authenticate an asset using only its hash, you can do so by using the command as shown below:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn authenticate --hash fce...
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="unsupportuntrust-an-asset-you-do-not-have-anymore">Unsupport/untrust an asset you do not have anymore</h4>
<p>In case you want to unsupport/untrust an asset of yours that you no longer have, you can do so using the asset hash(es) with the following steps below.</p>
<p>First, you’ll need to get the hash of the asset from your CodeNotary Ledger Compliance dashboard or alternatively you can use the <code>vcn list</code> command. Then, in the CLI, use:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn untrust --hash &lt;asset's hash&gt;
# or
vcn unsupport --hash &lt;asset's hash&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="notarization-within-automated-environments">Notarization within automated environments</h4>
<p>First, you’ll need to make <code>vcn</code> have access to the <code>${HOME}/.vcn</code> folder that holds your secret (the private key).
Then, set up your environment accordingly using the following commands:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>VCN_LC_API_KEY</span><span>=</span>Your-API-Key
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once done, you can use <code>vcn</code> in your non-interactive environment using:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn login --lc-host timestamp.codenotary.com
vcn notarize &lt;asset&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Other commands like <code>untrust</code> and <code>unsupport</code> will also work.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="add-custom-metadata-when-signing-assets">Add custom metadata when signing assets</h4>
<p>The user can upload custom metadata when doing an asset notarization using the <code>--attr</code> option, e.g.:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn n README.md --attr <span>Testme</span><span>=</span>yes --attr <span>project</span><span>=</span><span>5</span> --attr <span>pipeline</span><span>=</span>test
</code></pre></div>
<p>This command would add the custom asset metadata Testme: yes, project: 5, pipeline: test.</p>
<p>The user can read the metadata back on asset authentication, i.e. using the <code>jq</code> utility:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn a README.md -o json <span>|</span> jq .metadata
</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="inspect">Inspect</h4>
<p>Inspect has been extended with the addition of new filter: <code>--last</code>, <code>--first</code>, <code>--start</code> and <code>--end</code>.
With <code>--last</code> and <code>--first</code> are returned the N first or last respectively.</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn inspect document.pdf --last <span>10</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>With <code>--start</code> and <code>--end</code> it's possible to use a time range filter:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn inspect document.pdf --start <span>2020</span>/10/28-08:00:00 --end <span>2020</span>/10/28-17:00:00
</code></pre></div>
<p>If no filters are provided, only a maximum of 100 items are returned.</p>
<h4 id="signer-identifier">Signer Identifier</h4>
<p>It's possible to filter results by signer identifier:</p>
<div><pre><code>vcn inspect document.pdf --signerID Cyg<span>..</span>.
</code></pre></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

    </p>
  

  <br>

  
    




  

  <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS RDS</a> is a cloud relational database. It’s suitable for both early-stage startups and <em>Web-Scale</em> companies. One catch is that it’s possible to <em>irreversibly</em> loose all your data if you’re using it. In this blog post, I’ll describe why the default backup system offered by RDS is insecure and how to improve it.</p>

<h2 id="one-simple-trick-to-kill-your-startup">One simple trick to kill your startup…</h2>

<p>It’s about as <em>“clickbaity”</em> as it can get but bear with me.</p>

<p>RDS offers a robust backup system. Every database has a continuous backup allowing you to revert it to a specific point in the past. Additionally, point-in-time snapshots are automatically created every day and whenever you perform an action like upgrading the database, etc.</p>

<p>So, where’s the catch here?</p>

<p>Your account. All the backups are stored within a single account. Unless you’re a company with mature security practices, I guess that all your developers use <code>AdministratorAccess</code> or <code>PowerUserAccess</code> IAM policies. It’s not straightforward to fine-tune IAM policies for every single developer, especially when working on more obscure parts of the AWS stack. It’s understandable that unless you’re hiring a full-time AWS security specialist applying admin access for every developer is a sane default.</p>

<p>Why is that an issue?</p>

<p>Everyone with admin access to AWS CLI or console can easily remove all the backups. For most companies losing all data would probably mean that everyone can pack their bags and go home.</p>

<p>Let that sink in. <strong>EVERYONE</strong> in your company with AWS admin access can <strong>IRREVERSIBLY</strong> remove your database and all its backups. Every developer, support agent, an external consultant with admin access is a single point of failure that can destroy your startup. Imagine the following scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CLI credentials are leaked to a public GitHub repo</li>
  <li>dev mistakes staging for production environment during the cleanup</li>
  <li>the fired developer decides to take the company down with him</li>
  <li>admin’s cat walks on a keyboard and triggers a destructive shell script</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>The list goes on and on. Better safe than sorry. Let’s learn how you can significantly improve the security of RDS backups.</p>

<h2 id="free-ebook">How to add redundant backups to RDS database [free eBook]</h2>

<p>The good news is that you can protect yourself from these tragic scenarios. Here’s how:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Periodically upload the newest database dump to an S3 bucket in your primary account.</li>
  <li>Replicate data to a bucket in a separate AWS account that only necessary users can access.</li>
  <li>Profit.</li>
</ol>

<p>With the following mechanism in place, even if your primary account is compromised and your data eradicated, you can still restore your project.</p>

<p>You can grab a free eBook describing step-by-step on how to set it up. You’ll receive a link to the eBook just after subscribing to my newsletter.</p>




<p>This eBook covers backups for PostgreSQL, but with few changes to the backup script, it is applicable to all the database engines.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>From my experience, unfortunately, teams only become more security-aware after the actual incident. Secondary <em>“panic”</em> backups is a simple best practice that can save your company from disaster.</p>

<article id="content">
  

  <div>
    <p>I’ve been a contributor to GNU projects for many years, notably both GCC and GNU libc, and recently I led the effort to make the first release of Autoconf since 2012 (<a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf/2020-12/msg00002.html">release announcement for Autoconf 2.70</a>). For background and context, see <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/834682/">the LWN article my colleague Sumana Harihareswara of Changeset Consulting wrote</a>.</p>
<p>Autoconf not having made a release in eight years is a symptom of a deeper problem. Many GNU projects, including all of the other components of the Autotools (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/">Automake</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/">Libtool</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/">Gnulib</a>, etc.) and the software they depend upon (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/">GNU M4</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a>, etc.) have seen a steady decline in both contributor enthusiasm and user base over the past decade. I include myself in the group of declining enthusiasts; I would not have done the work leading up to the Autoconf 2.70 release if I had not been paid to do it. (I would like to say thank you to the project funders: Bloomberg, Keith Bostic, and the GNU Toolchain Fund of the FSF.)</p>
<p>The Autotools are in particularly bad shape due to the decline in contributor enthusiasm. Preparation for the Autoconf 2.70 release took almost twice as long as anticipated; I made five beta releases between July and December 2020, and merged 157 patches, most of them bugfixes. On more than one occasion I was asked why I was going to the trouble—isn’t Autoconf (and the rest of the tools by implication) thoroughly obsolete? Why doesn’t everyone switch to something newer, like <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a> or <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/">Meson</a>? (See the comments on Sumana’s LWN article for examples.)</p>
<p>I personally don’t think that the Autotools are obsolete, or even all that much more difficult to work with than some of the alternatives, but it <em>is</em> a fair question. Should development of the Autotools continue? If they are to continue, we need to find people who have the time and the inclination (and perhaps also the funding) to maintain them steadily, rather than in six-month release sprints every eight years. We also need a proper roadmap for where further development should take these projects. As a starting point for the conversation about whether the projects should continue, and what the roadmap should be, I was inspired by Sumana’s book in progress on open source project management (<a href="https://changeset.nyc/resources/getting-unstuck-sampler-offer.html">sample chapters are available from her website</a>) to write up a <q>strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats</q> analysis of Autotools.</p>
<p>This inventory can help us figure out how to build on new opportunities, using the Autotools’ substantial strengths, and where to invest to guard against threats and shore up current weaknesses.</p>
<p>Followup discussion should go to <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/autoconf">the Autoconf mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2 id="strengths">Strengths</h2>
<p>In summary: as the category leader for decades, the Autotools benefit from their architectural approach, interoperability, edge case coverage, standards adherence, user trust, and existing install base.</p>
<ul>
<li>Autoconf’s feature-based approach to compiled-code portability scales better than lists of system quirks.</li>
<li>The Autotools carry 30+ years’ worth of embedded knowledge about portability traps for C programs and shell-based build scripting on Unix (and to a lesser extent Windows and others), including variants of Unix that no other comparable configuration tool supports.</li>
<li>Autoconf and Automake support cross-compilation better than competing build systems.</li>
<li>Autoconf and Automake support software written in multiple languages better than some competing build systems (but see below).</li>
<li>Autoconf is very extensible, and there are lots of third-party <q>macros</q> available.</li>
<li>Tarball releases produced by Autotools have fewer build dependencies than tarball releases produced by competing tools.</li>
<li>Tarball releases produced by Autotools have a predictable, standardized (literally; it’s a key aspect of the <q><a href="https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/index.html">GNU Coding Standards</a></q>) interface for setting build-time options, building them, testing them, and installing them.</li>
<li>Automake tries very hard to generate Makefiles that will work with <em>any</em> Make implementation, not just GNU make, and not even just (GNU or BSD) make.</li>
<li>The Autotools have excellent reference-level documentation (better than CMake and Meson’s).</li>
<li>As they are GNU projects, users can have confidence that Autotools are and will always remain Free Software.</li>
<li>Relatedly, users can trust that architectural decisions are not driven by the needs of particular large corporations.</li>
<li>There is a large installed base, and switching to a competing build system is a lot of work.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h2>
<p>In summary: Autoconf’s core function is to solve a problem that software developers, working primarily in C, had in the 1990s/early 2000s (during the Unix wars). System programming interfaces have become much more standardized since then, and the shell environment, much less buggy. Developers of new code, today, looking at existing configure scripts and documentation, cannot easily determine which of the portability traps Autoconf knows about are still relevant to them. Similarly, maintainers of older programs have a hard time knowing which of their existing portability checks are still necessary. And weak coordination with other Autotools compounds the issue.</p>
<h3 id="autoconf">Autoconf</h3>
<ul>
<li>Autoconf (and the rest of the Autotools) are written in a combination of four old and difficult programming languages: Bourne shell, the portable subset of Make, Perl, and M4. Competing build systems tend to use newer, more ergonomic languages, which both makes it easier for them to get things done, and makes it easier for them to attract new developers.</li>
<li>All the supported languages except C and C++ are second-class citizens.</li>
<li>The set of languages that are supported has no particular rationale. Several new and increasingly popular compiled-code languages (e.g.&nbsp;Swift and Rust) are not supported, while oddities like Erlang are.</li>
<li>Much of that 30 years’ worth of embedded knowledge about portability traps is obsolete. There’s no systematic policy for deciding when some problem is too obsolete to worry about anymore.</li>
<li>Support for <em>newer</em> platforms, C standard editions, etc. is weaker than support for older things.</li>
<li>Autoconf’s extensibility is unsystematic; many of those third-party macros reach into its guts, and do things that create awkward compatibility constraints on core development. Same for existing <code>configure.ac</code>s.</li>
<li>The code quality of third-party macros varies widely; bad third-party macros reflect poorly on Autoconf proper.</li>
<li>Some of the ancillary tools distributed with Autoconf don’t work well; most importantly, autoupdate (which is <em>supposed</em> to patch a <code>configure.ac</code> to bring it in line with current Autoconf’s recommendations) is so limited and unreliable that it might be better not to have it at all.</li>
<li>Feature gaps in GNU M4 hold back development of Autoconf.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-autotools-as-a-whole">The Autotools as a whole</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are few active developers and no continuing funders.</li>
<li>GNU project status discourages new contributors because of the paperwork requirements and the perceived lack of executive-level leadership.</li>
<li>There is no continuous integration and no culture of code review. Test suites exist but are not comprehensive enough (and at the same time they’re very slow).</li>
<li>Bugs, feature requests, and submitted patches are not tracked systematically. (This is partially dependent on <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/sysadmin/the-fsf-tech-team-doing-more-for-free-software">FSF/GNU infrastructure improvements</a> which are indefinitely delayed.)</li>
<li>There’s a history of releases breaking compatibility, and thus people are hesitant to upgrade. At the same time, Linux distributions actively want to force-upgrade everything they ship to ensure architecture support, leading to upstream/downstream friction.</li>
<li>Guide-level documentation is superficial and outdated.</li>
<li>Building an Autotools-based project directly from its VCS checkout is often significantly harder than building it from a tarball release, and may involve tracking down and installing any number of unusual tools.</li>
<li>The Autotools depend on other GNU software that is not actively maintained, most importantly GNU M4, and to a lesser extent GNU Make.</li>
<li>Coordination among the Autotools is weak, even though the tools are tightly coupled to each other. There are portions of codebases that exist solely for interoperability with other tools in the toolchain, which leads to overlapping maintainer and reviewer responsibility, slow code review and inconvenient copyright assignment processes multiplying, and causing confusion and dropped balls. For instance, there is code shared among Autoconf, Automake, and/or Gnulib by copying files between source repositories; changes to these files are extra inconvenient. The lack of coordination also makes it harder for tool maintainers to deprecate old functionality, or to decouple interfaces to make things more extensible; maintainers do not negotiate policies with each other to help. For instance, Autoconf has trouble knowing when it is safe to remove internal kludges that old versions of Automake depend on, and certain shell commands (e.g.&nbsp;aclocal) are distributed with one package but abstractly belong to another.</li>
<li>Division of labor among the Autotools, and the sources of third-party macros, is ad-hoc and unclear. (Which macros should be part of Autoconf proper? Which should be part of Gnulib? Which should be part of the Autoconf Macro Archive? Which should be shipped with Automake? Which tools should autoreconf know how to run? Etc.)</li>
<li>Automake and Libtool are not nearly as extensible as Autoconf is.</li>
<li>Unlike several competitors, Automake <em>only</em> works with Make, not with newer build drivers (e.g.&nbsp;Ninja).</li>
<li>Because Automake tries to generate Makefiles that will work with <em>any</em> Make implementation, the Makefiles it generates are much more complicated and slow than they would be if they took advantage of GNU and/or BSD extensions.</li>
<li>Libtool is notoriously slow, brittle, and difficult to modify (even worse than Autoconf proper). This is partially due to technical debt and partially due to maintaining support for completely obsolete platforms (e.g.&nbsp;old versions of AIX).</li>
<li>Libtool has opinions about the proper way to manage shared libraries that Linux distributions actively disagree with, forcing them to kludge around its code during package builds.</li>
<li>Alternatives…</li></ul></div></article></div></div>

<li>If you can’t resolve any hostnames you might be using local unbound on the host. Edit /etc/resolv.conf and add a public DNS server.</li>
<li>If you run this jail on a production server you might want to limit memory usage <code>bastille limits poudriere memoryuse 8G</code>.</li>
<li>The packages will be under /usr/local/poudriere/data/packages/‘jailname’-‘portsname’. You can add the directory to any webserver and point your *pkg.conf to that URL.</li>
<li>You can update the ports tree using <code>poudriere ports -u</code></li>

It seems to me to be mainly used as a corrective against: 1) the Cartesian notion of an immaterial mind, and 2) the materialist tendency to place the mind in the brain. But what are the main positive claims that defenders of embodiment are making?&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>I think that the meaning of the term “embodiment” in philosophical circles is deceptively diverse, and that those who champion the concept are motivated by concerns that overlap less than is often appreciated. If they are unified by one thing, it is a rogues’ gallery of common enemies. Although Descartes is the most reviled of these, his errors are often traced back to some original sin perpetrated by Plato. However, in order to make sense of these conceptual crimes, it’s worth first distinguishing the <span>explanatory</span> concerns of cognitive science and artificial intelligence from the <span>normative </span>concerns of political and social theory, while acknowledging that both of these are downstream from more general <span>metaphysical</span> concerns regarding the difference and/or relation between matter and mind. So, though there are many purely metaphysical objections to the Platonic dualism of intelligible and sensible worlds, and the Cartesian dualism of mental and physical substances, what really unites the embodiment paradigm is their objection to the outsized role that Plato, Descartes, and their inheritors give to “the life of the mind” in explaining how we make our way in the world, and establishing which aspects of it we should value. For want of a better word, we might call this “intellectualism”.</p>



<p>This “life of the mind” is distinguished by the capacity for <span>abstract thought</span>. This is to say that it abstracts away from concrete features of the context in which thinking occurs: it is <span>theoretical</span>, or unconstrained by the practical problems posed by our bodily environment; and it is <span>contemplative</span>, or independent of the sensorimotor capacities through which we interact with this environment. Both Plato and Descartes take mathematics to exemplify this sort of thinking, and on that basis, thought <span>as such</span>. Mathematical theorems are not strictly about anything in our physical environment, and they can be verified even if they’re not applicable to it, in ways that needn’t involve interacting with it. This being said, what really distinguishes Descartes from Plato is his conviction that the physical world can be accurately <span>represented</span> by mathematical models, and thus that our experiences can be treated as internal representations akin to such models. There are other problematic aspects of the Cartesian picture, but this will do for now.</p></div><section id="comp-kiemep621"><div data-testid="columns"><div id="comp-kiemep64"><div data-mesh-id="comp-kiemep64inlineContent" data-testid="inline-content"><div data-mesh-id="comp-kiemep64inlineContent-gridContainer" data-testid="mesh-container-content"><p id="comp-kiemep661" data-testid="richTextElement"><h2><span>WHAT REALLY DISTINGUISHES DESCARTES FROM PLATO IS HIS CONVICTION THAT THE PHYSICAL WORLD CAN BE ACCURATELY REPRESENTED BY MATHEMATICAL MODELS</span></h2></p></div></div></div></div></section><div id="comp-kiemep68" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>So, what are the main explanatory objections to intellectualism?</span></p>



<p>There are two. On the one hand, its opponents claim that intellectualism ignores the vast majority of human cognition: most of our lives are spent carrying out tasks and navigating obstacles whose contours are determined by the way our body fits into its environment, rather than reasoning our way from premises to conclusions. Making a cup of tea in an unfamiliar kitchen is a more representative instance of our problem-solving capacity than demonstrating the infinity of primes. On the other, they claim that intellectualism has its priorities backwards: rather than treating this sort of “skilled coping” as a deficient form of abstract cognition, we can only understand the latter by showing how it emerges from the former. Even our ability to imagine complex geometric constructions has at some point been bootstrapped from a basic bodily grasp of orientation and gesture.</p>



<p>The most important targets of these complaints are the classical computational theory of mind in cognitive science and what gets called “good old-fashioned AI” (GOFAI). These see cognition as principally a matter of rule-governed symbol manipulation not unlike mathematical reasoning. They are opposed by a range of “4E perspectives”, so called because they emphasise some combination of the <span>embodied</span>, <span>embedded</span>, enactive, and <span>extended</span> dimensions of cognition. The extent to which these diverge from traditional views varies, but, in rough order, the points of contention are: 1) the extent to which cognition is dependent on features of the body outside of the brain (e.g., the structure of sensory organs), and features of the environment outside of the body (e.g., the availability of cognitive resources), 2) whether the concepts of computation and representation are irredeemably intellectualist (e.g., if they can account for pre-linguistic “meaning”), and 3) whether dependence implies constitution (e.g., if my notebook is part of my mind).</p>



<p><span>What about the normative objections?</span></p>



<p>Again, there are two. On the one hand, opponents claim that intellectualism reflects and reinforces implicit social hierarchies: those who have historically enjoyed the luxury of theoretical contemplation have done so because the practical problems and bodily processes it abstracts away from have been taken care of for them, often by groups who have been systematically <span>identified</span> with their bodies and bodily capacities, such as women, slaves, and colonised peoples. The disembodied Cartesian ego is an illusion engendered by ignorance and privilege. On the other, they claim that intellectualism devalues significant sources of human knowledge: there are forms of “lived experience” and “situated knowledge” that are valuable even if they aren’t (and possibly can’t be) articulated in a manner that divorces them from the embodied contexts in which they occur (e.g., their emotional valence). This Cartesian false-consciousness doesn’t simply impact the way we treat others, but even the way we treat ourselves, potentially disconnecting us from our embodied existence.</p>



<p>The idea that privileging the mind over the body is associated with other sorts of illicit privilege (e.g., economic, racial, sexual, etc.) is now fairly widespread in contemporary feminist and critical theory. However, there are a variety of philosophical frameworks drawn from the Continental tradition that get used to articulate, elaborate, and offer solutions to this problem. Roughly speaking, the main strands are Spinozist (Deleuze, Affect Theory, etc.), Nietzschean (Foucault, Butler, etc.), and phenomenological (Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, etc.), though there is much cross-pollination. The first is characterised by the metaphysical tenor of its critique, proposing some form of materialist monism as an alternative to the dualisms of Plato and Descartes. The second is characterised by its focus upon social dynamics, providing an analysis of the way bodies are “ensouled” by the internalisation of patterns of thought and action. But the last provides the greatest point of overlap with the explanatory concerns discussed above, as it provides a detailed introspective analysis of the body’s involvement in the constitution of experience. Phenomenology has had a marked influence on 4E approaches to cognition, and is responsible for the concept that straddles and sometimes connects all these varying concerns, namely, “the lived body”.</p></div><div id="comp-kiemep6b" data-testid="richTextElement"><p><span>The idea of the lived body suggests that the body is not just a causal bridge between ourselves and the world, but rather that the body is our engagement with the world in a way that serves as a condition for the emergence of our subjectivity. This suggests that only a “proper” body will be fit for this purpose – no ersatz or artificial alternative will do. Embodiment is in fact “real meat” embodiment. Is this a fair picture, both in phenomenology and in the other frameworks you discuss above?</span></p>



<p>Though not every proponent of embodiment will go so far as to insist on an essential link between mind and meat, I think it’s fair to say that this is where the rhetoric of embodiment leads. To some extent, this is because it aligns with other philosophical and political goals, such as undermining pernicious distinctions between human and animal or diagnosing dangerous fantasies implicit in the very suggestion that minds could be uploaded into computer simulations. However, there are some arguments for the claim, and I’ll try to tease out the general pattern of these as I see it. But first, it’s worth saying something more about the idea of the lived body.</p>



<p>The cornerstone of the phenomenological tradition is the idea that the<span> content</span> of explicitly articulated representations, such as declarative sentences or mathematical models, depends upon a more primitive form of <span>meaning</span> implicit in ordinary conscious experience. This gets formulated in slightly different ways by Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty, but they essentially agree that our many and varied representations are able to pick out the same <span>object</span> (e.g., galaxies, spleens, recessions) across changes in time, shifts in perspective, differences of opinion, and diverging interests, only because the referential frameworks they deploy (e.g., star charts, anatomy, econometrics), are so many layers arranged on top of those simple <span>unities</span> that tie together our everyday activities (e.g., places, obstacles, tools). My coffee cup is unified as something I can reach out and grasp, but this grasping is not a carefully planned sequence of muscle movements guided by a mechanical understanding of shapes and forces, it is a single fluid movement in which my fingers fit themselves to the cup’s contours without so much as a second thought. What distinguishes the “lived body” from the “biological body” is not simply that it is not yet an object of scientific representation, but rather that it is what ties everything together in the last instance. It is the <span>origin</span> of all intentional …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Recently I've come to know the concept of <strong>memory-mapped files</strong> while watching a lecture of the course <a href="https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2019/">Intro to Database Systems</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo">Andy Pavlo</a> on database storage. One of the main problems a database storage engine has to solve is <strong>how to deal with data in disk that is bigger than the available memory</strong>. At a higher level, the main purpose of a disk-oriented storage engine is to manipulate data files in a disk. But if we assume that the data in the disk will eventually get bigger than the available memory, we cannot simply load the whole data file into memory, do the change, and write it back to disk.</p><p>This is not a new problem in Computer Science. When operational systems were being developed in the early 1960s, a similar problem was faced: <strong>how can we run programs stored in disk that are larger than the available memory?</strong> A solution to this problem was made by a group in Manchester, implemented on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(computer)">Atlas Computer</a>, in 1961. It was called <em>virtual memory</em>. The <em>virtual memory</em> gives a running program the illusion that it has big enough memory, despite the fact that the computer does not have enough.</p><p>We are not going to go deep on how <em>virtual memory</em> works. Just have in mind that when a program is accessing memory it is accessing the <em>virtual memory</em>. And maybe the data the program is trying to access is not actually in memory, but it does not matter. The operational system will make pretend that it is by going to disk, and putting it there, and replace an old chunk of memory that is not going to be used.</p><p>So, one of the ways a database storage engine can solve the larger than memory problem is to make use of <em>virtual memory</em> and the concept of <strong>memory-mapped files</strong>.</p><p>In Linux, we can make this use by using the system call <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a> that lets you map a file, no matter how big, directly into memory. If your program needs to manipulate the file, all it needs is to manipulate the memory. The operating system handles the writes to disk for you.</p><p>In some occasions, programmers find this method more convenient than the usual system calls: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html">open</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html">read</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html">write</a>, <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</a> and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/close.2.html">close</a>.</p><h3 id="a-simple-demonstration">A simple demonstration</h3><p>Here is a small example of how you can take advantage of this in Go using the package <a href="https://github.com/edsrzf/mmap-go">mmap-go</a>:</p><pre><code>package main

import (
	"os"
	"fmt"
	"github.com/edsrzf/mmap-go"
)

func main() {
	f, _ := os.OpenFile("./file", os.O_RDWR, 0644)
	defer f.Close()
	
	mmap, _ := mmap.Map(f, mmap.RDWR, 0 )
	defer mmap.Unmap()
	fmt.Println(string(mmap))
	
	mmap[0] = 'X'
	mmap.Flush()
}</code></pre><figure><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/pRS8PvTRHksnCVQgSOWvPBF3a.svg" alt="asciicast"></figure><p>The beauty is that we could have a much bigger file, and the solution would still work. We would not have to worry about managing memory in order to avoid it filling up.</p><h3 id="detailing-mmap-capabilites">Detailing <em>mmap</em> capabilites</h3><p>We're going to explore more <em>mmap</em> functionalities from the point of view of the API provided by <a href="https://github.com/edsrzf/mmap-go">mmap-go</a>. There are probably more features that the <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix#Mmap">native syscall</a> provides that this library does not implement.</p><h4 id="the-prot-argument">The <code>prot</code> argument</h4><p>Here is the <code>mmap.Map</code> signature</p><pre><code>func Map(f *os.File, prot, flags int) (MMap, error) 
</code></pre><p>Let's look at <code>prot</code> first. The <code>prot</code> argument lets you specify the protection levels of your mapping: <code>RDONLY</code>, <code>RDWR</code>, <code>EXEC</code> are the options provided for <code>mmap-go</code>. These levels are pretty straightforward, <code>RDONLY</code> means you can only read from the mapping, <code>RDWR</code> means you can also write, and <code>EXEC</code> means you can execute code on that mapping. &nbsp;Here is the description of <code>prot</code> from the Linux <code>man</code>:</p><pre><code>The prot argument describes the desired memory protection of the
mapping (and must not conflict with the open mode of the file).
It is either PROT_NONE or the bitwise OR of one or more of the
following flags:

PROT_EXEC
    Pages may be executed.

PROT_READ
    Pages may be read.

PROT_WRITE
    Pages may be written.

PROT_NONE
    Pages may not be accessed.
</code></pre><p>In the <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix">unix package</a>, those flags are: <code>unix.PROT_EXEC</code>, <code>unix.PROT_READ</code>, <code>unix.PROT_WRITE</code> and <code>unix.PROT_NONE</code>.</p><h4 id="experimenting-with-prot_exec-flag">Experimenting with <code>PROT_EXEC</code> flag</h4><p>I've become intrigued by the <code>EXEC</code> flag and wanted to see an example of how that works. I've Google and could not find any example. So I tried a search in Github by <code>PROT_EXEC</code> and found a good example in <code>C</code>: <a href="https://github.com/onesmash/MMapExecDemo">MMapExecDemo</a>. I replicated this example in <code>Go</code> using <code>mmap-go</code>.</p><p>The first step was to create a function that I wanted to be put in memory by <code>mmap</code> allocation, compile it, and get its assembly opcodes.</p><p>I created the <code>inc</code> function in <code>inc.go</code> file</p><pre><code>package inc

func inc(n int) int {
	return n + 1
}

</code></pre><p>compiled it with <code>go tool compile -S -N inc.go</code>, then got its assembly by calling <code>go tool objdump -S inc.o</code>.</p><pre><code>func inc(n int) int {
  0x22b                 48c744241000000000      MOVQ $0x0, 0x10(SP)
        return n + 1
  0x234                 488b442408              MOVQ 0x8(SP), AX
  0x239                 48ffc0                  INCQ AX
  0x23c                 4889442410              MOVQ AX, 0x10(SP)
  0x241                 c3                      RET
</code></pre><p>With this, we can build represent our function in bytes on our code</p><pre><code>code := []byte{
        0x48, 0xc7, 0x44, 0x24, 0x10, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
		0x48, 0x8b, 0x44, 0x24, 0x08,
		0x48, 0xff, 0xc0,
		0x48, 0x89, 0x44, 0x24, 0x10,
		0xc3,
}
</code></pre><p>We allocate our memory with <code>mmap</code>.</p><pre><code>memory, err := mmap.MapRegion(nil, len(code), mmap.EXEC|mmap.RDWR, mmap.ANON, 0)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
</code></pre><p>In this call, we're using a more complete function called <code>MapRegion</code> that lets you specify how much memory you are allocating (<code>Map</code> allocates the size of the underlying file) and the offset of the file.</p><p>In the beginning, we said that the main purpose of <code>mmap</code> was to create a mapping between a file and memory. But in this call we are not indicating any file. <code>mmap</code> can be used just a regular memory allocater by setting <code>nil</code> to the <code>*os.File</code> argument and <code>mmap.ANON</code> to the <code>flags</code> argument. We will talk about more <code>mmap.ANON</code>. Since we are not mapping any file, the offset is <code>0</code>.</p><p>So we have memory allocated with the same size of our code <code>len(code)</code>. Since we set the flag <code>mmap.RDWR</code>, we can copy our <code>code</code> to <code>memory</code>.</p><pre><code>copy(memory, code)
</code></pre><p>We have the code of our <code>inc</code> function in memory. In order to execute it, we have to cast that memory address to a function with a signature that matches the signature of our compiled <code>inc</code>.</p><pre><code>memory_ptr := &amp;memory
ptr := unsafe.Pointer(&amp;memory_ptr)
inc := *(*func(int) int)(ptr)
</code></pre><p>When we call <code>inc</code>, we are executing the code we put in memory. That only works because of the flag <code>mmap.EXEC</code>. If that flag was not set, a <code>segmentation violation</code> would occur.</p><pre><code>fmt.Println(inc(10)) // Prints 11
</code></pre><p>I don't know if this is a real use case. I just wanted to see what it meant to execute code that you put in memory. And there are probably other ways of achieving the same with regular memory allocation and calls to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mprotect.2.html">mprotect</a>.</p><p>One question that may come up is: but the code is already in the <code>code</code> variable, can't we just execute it? No, because the memory static allocated to <code>code</code> is not executable. Can we make it executable? I've tried to use <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mprotect.2.html">mprotect</a> on it but still got <code>segmentation violation</code>.</p><p>Here is the full working <a href="https://gist.github.com/brunoac/b9ff4ad46c27926e5e4f078133d0de79">gist</a>.</p><h4 id="the-flags-argument">The <code>flags</code> argument</h4><p>We can have many processes mapping the same memory region. This argument lets us decide about the visibility of the updates happening in the mapping. There are many flags, and you can check them out at <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</a>. The important ones are <code>unix.MAP_SHARED</code>, <code>unix.MAP_PRIVATE</code> and <code>unix.MAP_ANON</code>.</p><p><code>MAP_SHARED</code> means that changes to the mapping are visible to all processes and will also occur at the underlying mapped file, although we cannot control when.</p><p><code>MAP_PRIVATE</code> means the changes are private and other processes will not see them. And also, they are not carried through to the underlying file.</p><p><code>MAP_ANON</code> means that there is not going to be a mapped file. It is useful for sub-processes communication with shared memory.</p><p>I've got confused about the <code>mmap-go</code> library implementation. It only provides the <code>mmap.ANON</code> flag, that we used in the above example. If you want your mapping to be private, you can set the <code>mmap.COPY</code> flag to the <code>prot</code> argument. Anyways, you can always use the flags provided by the <code>unix</code> package implementation.</p><h4 id="locking-and-flushing">Locking and flushing</h4><p>Two other nice methods, <code>Lock</code> and <code>Flush</code>, are provided by the API of <code>mmap-go</code>. The <code>Lock</code> method calls the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mlock.2.html">mlock</a> system call that prevents the mapping to be paged out to disk. And the <code>Flush</code> method calls the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/msync.2.html">msync</a> system call that forces the data in memory to be written to disk. This is a good way to trying to have more control over how and when data is flushed to disk.</p><h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h3><p>I felt kind of stupid of knowing about <code>mmap</code> after so long. I don't remember it being brought in my college class. For some reason, I felt amazed by it and its capabilities and decided to dig deeper. I like databases and I'm aiming to get a better grasp of them. This means that <code>mmap</code> cannot go unnoticed from my learning. For future posts, I'll try to bring about the benefits and drawbacks of using <code>mmap</code>, which projects use it, and what kind of problems it is suited for.</p><p>Even though the <code>mmap</code> can be used to solve that database problem we stated in the beginning, and many modern databases use it, <a href="https://twitter.com/andy_pavlo">Andy Pavlo</a> advocates against it and have three lecture on how to databases, that don't use <code>mmap</code>, manage data.</p><p>If you like this kind of content, follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/brunocalza">twitter</a>.

<p>Most of the 300,000 + plant species have leaves, and the function of all of them is to perform photosynthesis.&nbsp; They are the ultimate source for all of the oxygen and food for the rest of the food chain and help regulate the global carbon and water cycles.&nbsp; They are also nutrition superstars.&nbsp; To figure out why greens are good for you and whether all leaves are equal in this regard, we need to take quick look at global leaf structural variability and broad evolutionary patterns in the species that make their way onto our tables.<span id="more-937"></span></p>

<p>Across the global flora leaves are extraordinarily structurally variable.&nbsp; They vary in size from a tiny duckweed leaf to a huge palm frond, and in thickness from a thin lettuce leaf to a thick leaf of a succulent aloe or pine needle.&nbsp; We don’t fully understand yet why leaves are so structurally variable across species. My colleagues and I <a title="Osnas et al. Science 2013" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2013/03/27/science.1231574" target="_blank">recently published a paper</a> demonstrating that across the global flora leaf nutrient concentrations and physiological rates of maximum photosynthetic carbon gain and respiratory carbon loss change in proportion to leaf area more strongly than they change in proportion to leaf mass.&nbsp; We demonstrate the consequences of this area-proportionality of leaf traits for how we measure, analyze and use these leaf traits in models of the global carbon cycle.</p>

<p>Of relevance here, however, is that the high area-proportionality of leaf traits simply means that the parts of the leaf that are most beneficial for humans (digestible protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, digestible fiber) are likely proportional in many species to the leaf’s photosynthetic apparatus, which is clustered in a relatively thin band of cells beneath the epidermis (see image). &nbsp;Adding thickness to a leaf doesn’t necessarily add nutritious tissue and might instead add mostly fibrous, indigestible structural material (see agave photo below). &nbsp;This does not mean that the thinner the leaf, the more nutritious it is; this is just a general tendency across all plants. &nbsp;Scaled up to the level of the whole plant, though, we see that leaves have the highest ratio of nutritious material (digestible protein, vitamins and minerals, fiber) to indigestible material (for most species). &nbsp;Some fruits probably come close, but fruit is rare, and leaves are abundant.</p>

<p>One of the key variables modulating area- vs mass-proportionality of leaf traits is leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA), which increases with leaf thickness and density. &nbsp;Lettuce leaves have very low LMA, pine needles and holly leaves have high LMA.&nbsp; Although there is very little data on the subject, the leaves that we eat tend to fall on the low end of the global LMA spectrum, shown here for a global dataset of more than 2500 wild species.</p>

<p>Leaf tenderness—reducing LMA–is certainly a trait that has undergone selection in cultivated varieties.&nbsp; In species with varietals that have undergone selection on different structures, the varieties in which selection has been directed at the leaves invariably have more tender, less bitter, and larger leaves than do varieties in which selection has been directed at different structures, such as the roots.&nbsp; For example, chard has larger and more tender greens than do beets (both <i>Beta vulgaris</i>, Caryophyllales); celery grown for stalks and leaves is more tender than the aboveground portion of the celery varietal grown for its root (both <i>Apium graveolens</i>, Apiales); and Siberian kale varieties have more tender leaves than do rutabaga varieties (both <i>Brassica napus</i>, Brassicales).</p>

<p>Kale and collards, grown for their leaves, have leaves that are more tender than those of conspecific <i>Brassica oleracea</i> grown primarily for other structures:&nbsp; kohlrabi, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts (and for those of you keeping track at home, in the <a title="The extraordinary diversity of Brassica&nbsp;oleracea" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/the-extraordinary-diversity-of-brassica-oleracea/" target="_blank"><i>B. oleracea</i></a>, <a title="Thanksgiving turnips and the diversity of the genus&nbsp;Brassica" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/598/" target="_blank"><i>Brassica</i></a>, and<a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/" target="_blank"> Brassicaceae posts</a>,<i> </i>I erroneously lumped all kales into <i>Brassica oleracea</i>—<a title="Brassica napus kales" href="http://seedambassadors.org/Mainpages/still/napuskale/napuskale.htm" target="_blank">some of them are <i>B. napus</i></a>, including my favorite variety: Red Russian kale).&nbsp; Don’t dare throw out your beet, celeriac, rutabaga or <i>B. oleracea </i>greens, though, if you’re lucky enough to get them—they need a bit more cooking or tenderizing, but they’re still delicious and nutritious.&nbsp; At least put your celery root greens in stock.&nbsp; LMA also varies within a varietal based on growing conditions.&nbsp; Leaves grown in sun have higher LMA than leaves grown in shade.&nbsp; The impact of growing conditions within species, however, will have to wait for another time.</p>
<p>LMA is hardly the only determinant of which species make it onto our plates.&nbsp; Otherwise, we’d have our pick of hundreds of species on the low-LMA end of the global curve.&nbsp; Instead, we can put most of our greens species on a fairly legible phylogenetic tree in need of only a few disclaimer paragraphs of omissions.</p>

<p>Like many phylogenetic trees of more than a handful of species, this tree of our “greens species” commits sins of both commission and omission in the interest of producing a readable image. Omission because the species on the tree do not comprise an exhaustive list of species whose leaves people around the globe regularly consume. Commission because I included a few unusual items, such as sweet potato leaves (<i>Ipomoea</i>, Solanales), and pea shoots (Fabales), and a few taxa are single representatives of a large group.&nbsp; Sister to sweet potato on the tree, for example, is the entire family Lamiaceae, the mints.</p>

<p>We mostly use leaves from the mints as herbs and spices:&nbsp; peppermint and spearmint (<i>Mentha </i>sp.), basil (<i>Ocimum</i> sp.), thyme (<i>Thymus</i> sp.), oregano and marjoram (<i>Origanum</i> sp.), rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus</i> sp.), lemon balm (<i>Melissa</i> sp.), lavender (<i>Lavandula</i> sp.), shiso (<i>Perilla frutescens</i>), bee balm (<i>Monarda</i> sp.), and mountain mint (<i>Pycnanthemum</i> sp.).&nbsp; Also, scallions are the only representatives on the tree from the genus <i>Allium</i> in the monocot order Asparagles, which includes many edible species, the leaves of some of which are regularly employed:&nbsp; garlic, <a title="A look at&nbsp;leeks" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/a-look-at-leeks/" target="_blank">leeks</a>, ramps, and onions.</p>
<p>I included some of the more exotic greens in the greens tree both to avoid rousing the ire of their champions and because I was a bit shocked that some large, charismatic orders that feature prominently in the diet at large are reduced to single entries on the greens tree or are gone altogether, meaning we primarily use roots, stems, fruits or seeds from these clades, not leaves.&nbsp; Granted, this “greens tree” is mostly a tree of “greens obtained from Whole Foods and summer farmer’s markets in the continental United States.”</p>

<p>I’ve included a few weedy, wild things that I pick regularly and that one can actually occasionally pay money for at the farmer’s market:&nbsp; nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>, Rosales), chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>, Caryophyllales), miner’s lettuce (<i>Claytonia perfoliata</i>, Caryophyllales), purslane (<i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, Caryophyllales), and dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>, Asterales).&nbsp; Largely, however, I’ve omitted species whose leaves are technically edible, at least in small doses at some point in their life cycle, but that are reduced to curiosities at the modern American table, not staples.&nbsp; Therefore, please hold your fire if you’re shaking your fist at the tree because it omits the young beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>, Fagales), sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>, Laureles), or violet (<i>Viola odorata</i>, Malpighiales) leaves you like to nibble on when you hike east of the Mississippi. Fern fiddlehead (assorted Polypodiales) enthusiasts, too, forgive me. &nbsp;We use some leaves to prepare other food: &nbsp;banana leaves and corn husks to wrap&nbsp;<em>tamales</em>, and palm fronds and fig leaves to wrap fish for baking or grilling. &nbsp;I salute these leaves, but they’re not on the tree. &nbsp;Some are gone simply because I didn’t have room, such as many of the <a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/">crucifer greens</a>, and asterids chrysanthemum, borage and comfrey (although those last two haven’t been placed to order yet and would therefore have been difficult to place within the asterids anyway).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently I migrated this website from Gatsby to Next.js. During the migration, I also decided to migrate the content from Markdown to MDX. With the offical guides and resources I struggled a bit to set this up in a proper way. So after figuring all these small bits, I decided to write an article on how you can setup your Next.js page with MDX.</p><p>You can find a small cheat sheet at the end of the article that skips most of the explanations in this article. Also feel free, to check out the example repository containing the actual code here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/igeligel/remote-mdx-next">igeligel/remote-mdx-next</a>.</p><h2 id="what-is-mdx"><a href="#what-is-mdx" aria-label="What is MDX"></a>What is MDX</h2><p>If you read this article you probably know Markdown. It is a content format that you can use to style text. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">This markdown cheat sheet</a> shows this quite nicely. A problem for developers was always on how to include more complicated content in these files. Markdown supports HTML in most cases as well, but a problem is that modern development changed.</p><div><pre><div><p>3</p><p><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>SomeComplicatedInteractiveGraph</span><span> </span><span>data</span><span>=</span><span>{data}</span><span> </span><span>/&gt;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>5</p><p><span>Some longer text describing the graph.</span></p></div></pre></div><p>Styles are injected into React components directly or are rendered with styled-components or emotion. Another problem related to that is to use custom components for the markdown text. No one wants to write this for every paragraph:</p><p>Instead in markdown, you should be just able to write</p><p>And it should use a custom paragraph component somehow. Most markdown and MDX rendering engines support that via custom configurations. Some engines had some problems with the interpretation and compilation of styles that we will look at later.</p><p>When looking for solutions regarding MDX, you will most likely find this blog article: "<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown">Markdown/MDX with Next.js</a>" by Lee Robinson. The blog article is really good but fails at some point. The problems appear with “Remote Markdown and MDX” which will be covered now. For that, we need to set up a quick project. So let me run you through.</p><h2 id="creating-the-next.js-project"><a href="#creating-the-next.js-project" aria-label="Creating the Next.js Project"></a>Creating the Next.js Project</h2><p>Since we will create the base ourselves and will use TypeScript, I will explain how to setup a basic TypeScript/Next.js project as well. You can find the documentation <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/docs">here</a>.</p><div><pre><div><p>4</p><p><span></span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> next react react-dom</span></p></div><div><p>5</p><p><span></span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> @chakra-ui/react @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion</span></p></div><div><p>6</p><p><span></span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> gray-matter @mdx-js/react @mdx-js/runtime</span></p></div><div><p>7</p><p><span></span><span>yarn</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> -D typescript @types/react and @types/node @types/mdx-js__react</span></p></div></pre></div><p>Next, we need to add some commands to our package.json file.</p><p>Now we can start creating a page. Let us create a folder called pages first. In the folder, a file should be created that is called index.tsx. The content should be like this:</p><div><pre><div><p>2</p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>This</span><span> </span><span>is</span><span> </span><span>Home</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div></pre></div><p>That should render a home page on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://localhost:3000/">localhost:3000</a>.</p><figure><p><img alt="Webview of a basic home page" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9122d2236f9f6d2728d24b6136d15b7000da8a8c/0a803/remote-mdx-first-screen.png" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Webview of a basic home page</figcaption></figure><h2 id="laying-out-the-different-pages"><a href="#laying-out-the-different-pages" aria-label="Laying out the different pages"></a>Laying out the different pages</h2><p>So you are probably reading this article to get to know how MDX is now rendered. As explained in the official blog article linked above, MDX can be rendered in different ways. If you really just have static pages and do not really care about layouting feel free to use the mentioned approach in the documentation. My setup was a bit more sophisticated. So let us focus on what we want to achieve:</p><figure><p><img alt="Architecture of the MDX remote rendering application" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/54789238a3d3e24a87ded377869340f0fa293d74/c0173/remote-mdx-1.svg" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>Architecture of the MDX remote rendering application</figcaption></figure><p>So there is a generic post page. The generic in this sense means that Next.js is actually doing something during the generation phase of the HTML to check if a path is valid. The feature is called dynamic routes and documentation can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes">here</a>.</p><p>So the workflow for our page should be similar to this:</p><ol role="list"><li><span>User opens <code>/some-random-path</code></span></li><li><span>Our server looks up if it can find <code>some-random-path.mdx</code></span></li><li><span>If successful, it will render the MDX as HTML and send it to the client</span></li></ol><p>The unhappy path can be done by responding with a 404, but this will already happen if you decide to statically export the pages which we will try here.</p><p>So now we can actually start with creating the page. In the pages directory, create another file that is called <code>[post].tsx</code>. The content, for now, should look like the following:</p><div><pre><div><p>1</p><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticPaths</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticProps</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"next"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>4</p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Test</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>7</p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticProps</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticProps</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>11</p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticPaths</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticPaths</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>14</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"some-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>15</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"alternative-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div></pre></div><p>There are many things that are different now. So let us focus on some parts first. First we should look at what functions are defined here:</p><ul role="list"><li><p><span><code>Post</code>: This our usual Page React component.</span></p></li><li><p><span><code>getStaticProps</code>: This function is normally used to fetch data. This data is getting fetched during build time. So normally during your deployment. After the deployment this data will not changed. It is static.</span></p></li><li><p><span><code>getStaticPaths</code>: This functionality is needed when using <code>getStaticProps</code>, so Next.js knows for which paths it should generate data. This is because the component name is <code>[post].tsx</code>. The <code>[post]</code> is the placeholder for all URLs you define under <code>getStaticPaths</code>.</span></p></li><li><p><span><code>export default Post</code>: Just the <code>Post</code> React component exported.</span></p></li></ul><p>So in our example, you should start looking at the exported object in <code>getStaticPaths</code>:</p><div><pre><div><p>1</p><p><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticPaths</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticPaths</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>4</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"some-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>5</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"alternative-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div></pre></div><p>The two highlighted lines are the exported paths for this component. This means <code>[post].tsx</code> actually relates to <code>/some-random-path</code> and <code>alternative-random-path</code>. The important part here is to have the key in the object named the same as the file it will relate to. Something like the following will <strong>not</strong> work:</p><div><pre><div><p>1</p><p><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticPaths</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticPaths</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>4</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> slug</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"some-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>5</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> slug</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"alternative-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div></pre></div><p>So what happens is that Next.js exports the returned object from <code>getStaticPaths</code> and pass this object to the <code>getStaticProps</code> function as the <code>props</code> parameter. This will enable us to read the <code>post</code> property inside the <code>getStaticProps</code> function. That is great, because it will enable us to query the MDX and meta information about the page.</p><h2 id="getting-that-mdx-and-passing-it-to-the-component"><a href="#getting-that-mdx-and-passing-it-to-the-component" aria-label="Getting that MDX and passing it to the component"></a>Getting that MDX and passing it to the component</h2><p>Now we have a setup where <code>getStaticProps</code> has access to the <code>post</code> parameter. Its actually time to get the MDX. So currently we have the following folder structure:</p><p>Let us create another directory, called <code>content</code>. Inside there we create two files: <code>some-random-path.mdx</code>, <code>alternative-random-path.mdx</code>. The whole directory structure should look like the following:</p><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>alternative-random-path.mdx</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><p>Both of these files should have some content now. For simplicity let us just enter a heading and a small paragraph like the following:</p><h3 id="some-random-path.mdx"><a href="#some-random-path.mdx" aria-label="some-random-path.mdx"></a>some-random-path.mdx</h3><h3 id="alternative-random-path.mdx"><a href="#alternative-random-path.mdx" aria-label="alternative-random-path.mdx"></a>alternative-random-path.mdx</h3><div><pre><div><p>1</p><p><span># Alternative Random Path</span></p></div><div><p>3</p><p><span>Some politician is really nice.</span></p></div></pre></div><p>So now that there is content we can begin to read that MDX content and pass it to the proper component. To understand how this works, let us have another look at the <code>getStaticProps</code> function. Currently, this function just returns an object with the property <code>props</code> that is empty. The object in <code>props</code> will be then passed to the component <code>Post</code> and is available when the component is being rendered. So let us assumed the following:</p><div><pre><div><p>1</p><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"react"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>2</p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticPaths</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticProps</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"next"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>5</p><p><span>  someTestProperty</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>string</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>8</p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>FC</span><span>&lt;</span><span>PostProps</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>9</p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>someTestProperty</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>12</p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticProps</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticProps</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>15</p><p><span>      someTestProperty</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Hello World"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div></pre></div><p>In that case, you can clearly see how <code>someTestProperty</code> is being passed to the component to be actually rendered in the page. For that just open <code>http://localhost:3000/some-random-path</code>:</p><figure><p><img alt="A screenshot from the Hello World page" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ddd447e7f61ab163ea5f6eca7a6ce548edf6c5d8/e603e/remote-mdx-second-screen.png" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>A screenshot from the Hello World page</figcaption></figure><p>So if this works, we can also read the MDX in that function and pass it to the component. We can use the node packages <code>fs</code> and <code>path</code> to read the actual content and pass it to the component. Remember you need to call <code>toString()</code> in this case because an MDX file by itself is not serializable. We are just doing it in this step to make it work. The component should look like the following then:</p><div><pre><div><p>1</p><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"react"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>3</p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> path </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"path"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>4</p><p><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticPaths</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticProps</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"next"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>10</p><p><span></span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>Post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>FC</span><span>&lt;</span><span>PostProps</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>11</p><p><span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>{</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>mdx</span><span>}</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>14</p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticProps</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticProps</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>15</p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> folderPath </span><span>=</span><span> path</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>cwd</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"content"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>16</p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> filePath </span><span>=</span><span> path</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>folderPath</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>${</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>}</span><span>.mdx</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>18</p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> source </span><span>=</span><span> fs</span><span>.</span><span>readFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>filePath</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>21</p><p><span>      mdx</span><span>:</span><span> source</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>26</p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticPaths</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticPaths</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>29</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"some-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>30</p><p><span>      </span><span>{</span><span> params</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> post</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"alternative-random-path"</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div></pre></div><p>That will now just render the MDX as text. Nothing we want. But hey, we got the first part working. Passing the MDX content to the frontend. You can view the content on <code>http://localhost:3000/some-random-path</code></p><figure><p><img alt="A screenshot showin the raw MDX content rendered as text in a web page" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9112a7a82fd838f12574d296dc11e5a7d9af62c2/b8e7d/remote-mdx-third-screen.png" loading="lazy"></p><figcaption>A screenshot showin the raw MDX content rendered as text in a web page</figcaption></figure><h3 id="reading-meta-information"><a href="#reading-meta-information" aria-label="Reading Meta information"></a>Reading Meta information</h3><p>MDX and Markdown both support the Meta information tag inside the content files. You can simply define it with like the following:</p><div><pre><div><p>2</p><p><span>seoTitle: "This is a nice title"</span></p></div></pre></div><p>As you can see the first part is denoted by <code>---</code>. This means that this is the meta information and actually should not appear in our rendered page. We need to extract it. Fortunately, someone has solved this already for us. Simply install <code>gray-matter</code>:</p><p>That dependency is exporting a simple function that takes the MDX source code and splits it into two parts: The meta information and the actual content. So let us change our <code>getStaticProps</code> function. Hint: You might need to adjust types as well.</p><div><pre><div><p>1</p><p><span>import</span><span> matter </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"gray-matter"</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>5</p><p><span></span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>const</span><span> getStaticProps</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>GetStaticProps</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>6</p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> folderPath </span><span>=</span><span> path</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>process</span><span>.</span><span>cwd</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"content"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>7</p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> filePath </span><span>=</span><span> path</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>folderPath</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>${</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>params</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>}</span><span>.mdx</span><span>`</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>8</p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> rawFileSource </span><span>=</span><span> fs</span><span>.</span><span>readFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>filePath</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>10</p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> content</span><span>,</span><span> data </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>matter</span><span>(</span><span>rawFileSource</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></div><div><p>15</p><p><span>      metaInformation</span><span>:</span><span> data</span><span>,</span><span></span></p></div></pre></div><p>That should also return us the meta information. …</p></div></div>

                    <p>An alarm clock for the rest of us</p><p>It’s a brand new year, which means I should really start writing a new post.
I’ve been wanting to for a while, but we’ve been in lockdown for two months now and Google Analytics is the only indication that I’m not alone on the planet, and most of that is bots anyway.
I’ve decided to take a page out of the book of my friend, <a href="https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/">James Stanley</a>, who both does cool things <em>and</em> actually writes about them, so I’m starting to document all my projects again.</p>
<p>Given my non-frenetic, slow-paced lifestyle, I’ve long had a non-burning need.
I don’t use an alarm to wake up, as I start work late, but I still want to know what time it is when I wake up, just to see if it’s way too early and I can go to sleep again.
A few days a week I have tennis and need to get up early, but if it’s windy or rainy or very cold, the practice gets canceled and I want to know before I’m awake enough to not be able to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>To accommodate this lifestyle, I’ve traditionally turned to my mobile phone, but that has some disadvantages.
Namely, the screen is too bright and wakes me up when I check the time, and I’m too obsessive to not check all my messages instead of falling asleep when I see the notifications on the screen.
I’ve long thought that a bedside alarm clock would be perfect for me, but I couldn’t find one that fulfilled all my requirements:</p>
<!-- break -->

<ul>
<li>I needed something that had a screen that would always be always lit, so I could check the time with one eye and half a brain awake, in the complete darkness of the bedroom.</li>
<li>A screen that wasn’t too bright and wouldn’t disturb sleep, but that would also be legible in direct sunlight, so I could see the time during the day.
This meant adaptive brightness.</li>
<li>Octagonal shape so I can lay it down on its side (or at 45°) instead of having to crane my neck up to check the time when lying down (I really did think of everything).</li>
<li>Weather forecast for the next hour or two, so I can reliably fail to wake up for tennis when not necessary.</li>
<li>Annoying beeper for alarms.</li>
<li>Less annoying built-in LEDs that would increase in brighness for a few minutes before an alarm went off, so I can wake up less annoyed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot2-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at this sexy thing.</span></p></div><p>Sexy.</p>
<h2>Designing this thing</h2>
<p>Conceptually, making an alarm clock to fulfill these requirements isn’t hard.
You take a small OLED screen, an ESP8266, connect them together, add some LEDs and a buzzer, and you’re done!
Since the hardware was more-or-less straightforward, I started with designing the octagonal case:</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back.png" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/clock-back-small.png"></a></p><p><span>The back of the clock.</span></p></div><p>The OLED screen has four mounting holes, so I designed the mount around them.
For the ESP8266, I use a WeMos D1 Mini board, as it’s quite small and nice to work with.
I initially thought I’d have to connect the WeMos to the four pins of the screen with wires, but I discovered that if you kinda squint, you can get four of the ESP8266’s pins to match up with the screen’s pins and in the correct order, which means I could solder the ESP8266 behind the screen module directly, which simplified the wiring by a lot.</p>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/mockup-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>Look at that subtle off-white coloring.</span></p></div><p>While designing the clock, I created a quick mockup of the screen as I wanted it to show.
I decided I wanted the hour to be displayed in as big letters as possible, since this screen is small, and the other elements I wanted were wind speed, temperature and weather forecast for the next hour.</p>
<p>The other components left to add were a photoresistor (for sensing ambient light), a buzzer and a LED strip.
They were all straightforward to add, the resistor is connected to the ESP8266’s analog pin, and the buzzer and LED strip to some other free pins.</p>
<h2>The software</h2>
<p>The software was the slightly trickier part in this build, although that was pretty straightforward too.
I needed multiple components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the time somehow (there’s no real-time clock on the ESP8266 and I didn’t want to add one).</li>
<li>Dimming the screen in a pleasing manner.</li>
<li>Getting the weather forecast and current weather.</li>
<li>Connecting to WiFi and autoupdating.</li>
<li>Annoying me into wakefulness in a satisfactory manner.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The clock</h3>
<p>There’s an old Chinese saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>To know the time, you must first connect to the internet.</p>
<p>– Sun Inc</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, connecting to the Internet is very easy with tzapu’s <a href="https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager">excellent WiFiManager</a> library.
The clock creates an access point, you join it with your phone or computer, give it your WiFi network’s password, and you’re done.</p>
<p>After connecting, an NTP library can fetch the time every so often from the closest server, so the clock is always up to date.
It was important to me that this clock is solid enough to trust with my most important wake-up alarms, and it achieves this goal admirably (unless the internet connection is down).</p>
<p>That also takes care of autoupdates, since I have a simple, secure autoupdate machine I set up using <a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/espota-server">ESPOTA-server, an autoupdate server I wrote for the ESP8266</a>.
The clock checks for a new update every day, and automatically downloads and installs it.
This way, distributing updates will work reliably, even to millions of devices, for when you realize that collecting all the users’ personal data is slightly monetizable.</p>
<h3>The dimming</h3>
<p>After a bit (or a lot) of searching, I finally found how to dim the OLED screen, and another important feature was well on the way of being implemented.
Because it was rather hard to find, I’ll post the code here, along with the appropriate SEO keyword for people to be able to find it.
Here is the code for dimming an SSD1306-compatible, I2C 128x64 OLED screen:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>void</span> <span>brightnessTask</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>brightness</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Set the brightness of the SSD1306 OLED screen with this hack.</span>
    <span>// From https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFpXfSnDNSY.</span>
    <span>// `brightness` should be a value between 5 (for some reason) and 255.</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETCONTRAST</span><span>);</span> <span>//0x81</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>brightness</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETPRECHARGE</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xD9</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>

    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>SSD1306_SETVCOMDETECT</span><span>);</span> <span>//0xDB</span>
    <span>display</span><span>.</span><span>ssd1306_command</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Once I discovered that, the rest of the dimming was easy:
I would just read the ambient light from the photoresistor and set the screen’s brightness according to the photoresistor’s value.</p>
<p>Another job <del>well</del> done.</p>
<h3>The weather</h3>
<div><p><a href="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery"><img src="https://www.stavros.io/posts/do-not-be-alarmed-clock/glamorshot1-small.jpg"></a></p><p><span>What a beauty.</span></p></div><p>Getting the weather was easier than I thought.
<a href="https://openweathermap.org/">OpenWeather</a> has a simple API, which accepts a pair of coordinates and gives you the current weather and forecast for that location.
It only took a few minutes to fetch that data on the clock, and then I spent some time positioning them on the screen and turning the forecast into an appropriate icon so it could be displayed on the small screen.</p>
<p>To display the icons, I used <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-gfx-graphics-library/overview">Adafruit’s always helpful GFX library</a> and converted the OpenWeather icons to a format more suitable for display on a monochrome screen.
This took a bit of trial and error, as I wanted the icons to be easily distinguishable at a glance, even though their size was 12x12 pixels and just one color.
In the end, I think they worked out well, as it’s easy to tell if it’s raining or not.</p>
<h3>The wakefulness</h3>
<p>So the initial plan here was to have a buzzer buzz loudly and annoyingly in an attempt to wake me up.
However, I am a pretty light sleeper, and I hate loud and annoying sounds (surprisingly), so I wanted this to be a last resort.
The solution I came up with here is the following:</p>
<p>Say I want to set the alarm for 9:30, just in time to be ten minutes late for tennis.
The LEDs would start glowing very faintly at 9:20, slowly increasing in intensity over the next ten minutes, at which point they’d reach maximum.
If I still wasn’t up by then, the buzzer would begin beeping at the top of its lung, hopefully waking me up reliably.
This seemed like a pretty good algorithm, and one that would both wake me up pleasantly and reliably.</p>
<p>There was only one problem:
The clock doesn’t have any buttons or controls or any way for me to enter the alarm time.
I could create a web server where I could configure alarms, but I figured I’d rather get a rooster instead, so I did neither and just made an alarm clock that cannot alarm.
This symbolizes the futility of human existence and its incessant search for meaning in a cold and unfeeling universe that’s ultimately profoundly devoid of such, and then you die.</p>
<p>Not having to wake up to a buzzer is cool, though.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with this clock!
I can now open an eyelid, look at the time and fall asleep again, which is a massive quality-of-life improvement over the previous “fuck sleep I’ve got Instagram likes” situation.
The octagonal shape is a killer feature, I keep the clock angled 45° (as in the photo) and it really is the perfect angle for reading it while lying down.</p>
<p>One thing I’d like to improve in the future is to add a battery, because right now it’s solely USB powered and will obviously die if there’s a power outage. Adding a small LiPo battery and a charger circuit will be pretty easy and will ensure that the clock can keep running for hours even without power.</p>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed">https://gitlab.com/stavros/do-not-be-alarmed</a></p>
<p>It’s not very complete, so use it at your own risk, and I haven’t really added deployment details, but it should be very easy to build with one PlatformIO command.</p>

							<p><em>TLDR: DuckDB now has full-text search functionality, similar to the FTS5 extension in SQLite. The main difference is that our FTS extension is fully formulated in SQL. We tested it out on TREC disks 4 and 5.</em></p>

<p>Searching through textual data stored in a database can be cumbersome, as SQL does not provide a good way of formulating questions such as “Give me all the documents about <strong>Mallard Ducks</strong>”: string patterns with <code>LIKE</code> will only get you so far. Despite SQL’s shortcomings here, storing textual data in a database is commonplace. Consider the table <code>products (id INT, name VARCHAR, description VARCHAR</code>) - it would be useful to search through the <code>name</code> and <code>description</code> columns for a website that sells these products.</p>

<p>We expect a search engine to return us results within milliseconds. For a long time databases were unsuitable for this task, because they could not search large inverted indices at this speed: transactional database systems are not made for this use case. However, analytical database systems, can keep up with state-of-the art information retrieval systems. The company <a href="https://www.spinque.com/">Spinque</a> is a good example of this. At Spinque, MonetDB is used as a computation engine for customized search engines.</p>

<p>DuckDB’s FTS implementation follows the paper “<a href="https://hannes.muehleisen.org/SIGIR2014-column-stores-ir-prototyping.pdf">Old Dogs Are Great at New Tricks</a>”. A keen observation there is that advances made to the database system, such as parallelization, will speed up your search engine “for free”!</p>

<p>Alright, enough about the “why”, let’s get to the “how”.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-the-data">Preparing the Data</h3>
<p>The TREC 2004 Robust Retrieval Track has 250 “topics” (search queries) over TREC disks 4 and 5. The data consist of many text files stored in SGML format, along with a corresponding DTD (document type definition) file. This format is rarely used anymore, but it is similar to XML. We will use OpenSP’s command line tool <code>osx</code> to convert it to XML. Because there are many files, I wrote a bash script:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>
<span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> latimes/xml
<span>for </span>i <span>in</span> <span>$(</span><span>seq</span> <span>-w</span> 1 9<span>)</span>
<span>do
        </span><span>cat </span>dtds/la.dtd latimes-<span>$i</span> | osx <span>&gt;</span> latimes/xml/latimes-<span>$i</span>.xml
<span>done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This sorts the <code>latimes</code> files. Repeat for the <code>fbis</code>, <code>cr</code>, <code>fr94</code>, and <code>ft</code> files.</p>

<p>To parse the XML I used BeautifulSoup. Each document has a <code>docno</code> identifier, and a <code>text</code> field. Because the documents do not come from the same source, they differ in what other fields they have. I chose to take all of the fields.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>duckdb</span>
<span>import</span> <span>multiprocessing</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now that we have a dataframe, we can register it in DuckDB.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># create database connection and register the dataframe
</span><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>=</span><span>'db/trec04_05.db'</span><span>,</span> <span>read_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>register</span><span>(</span><span>'documents_df'</span><span>,</span> <span>documents_df</span><span>)</span>

<span># create a table from the dataframe so that it persists
</span><span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"CREATE TABLE documents AS (SELECT * FROM documents_df)"</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>close</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is the end of my preparation script, so I closed the database connection.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-search-engine">Building the Search Engine</h3>
<p>We can now build the inverted index and the retrieval model using a <code>PRAGMA</code> statement. The extension is <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/full_text_search">documented here</a>. We create an index table on table <code>documents</code> or <code>main.documents</code> that we created with our script. The column that identifies our documents is called <code>docno</code>, and we wish to create an inverted index on the fields supplied. I supplied all fields by using the ‘*’ shortcut.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>con</span> <span>=</span> <span>duckdb</span><span>.</span><span>connect</span><span>(</span><span>database</span><span>=</span><span>'db/trec04_05.db'</span><span>,</span> <span>read_only</span><span>=</span><span>False</span><span>)</span>
<span>con</span><span>.</span><span>execute</span><span>(</span><span>"PRAGMA create_fts_index('documents', 'docno', '*', stopwords='english')"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under the hood, a parameterized SQL script is called. The schema <code>fts_main_documents</code> is created, along with tables <code>docs</code>, <code>terms</code>, <code>dict</code>, and <code>stats</code>, that make up the inverted index. If you’re curious what this look like, take a look at our source code under the <code>extension</code> folder in DuckDB’s source code!</p>

<h3 id="running-the-benchmark">Running the Benchmark</h3>
<p>The data is now fully prepared. Now we want to run the queries in the benchmark, one by one. We load the topics file as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># the 'topics' file is not structured nicely, therefore we need parse some of it using regex
</span><span>def</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span> <span>tag</span><span>):</span>

<span>topic_dict</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
<span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>'../../trec/topics'</span><span>,</span> <span>'r'</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>

    <span>for</span> <span>top</span> <span>in</span> <span>bs_content</span><span>.</span><span>findChildren</span><span>(</span><span>'top'</span><span>):</span>
        <span>top_content</span> <span>=</span> <span>top</span><span>.</span><span>getText</span><span>()</span>
        <span># we need the number and title of each topic
</span>        <span>num</span> <span>=</span> <span>after_tag</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>(</span><span>top</span><span>),</span> <span>'num'</span><span>).</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>' '</span><span>)[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>

        <span>topic_dict</span><span>[</span><span>num</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>title</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This gives us a dictionary that has query number as keys, and query strings as values, e.g. <code>301 -&gt; 'International Organized Crime'</code>.</p>

<p>We want to store the results in a specific format, so that they can be evaluated by <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval.git">trec eval</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># create a prepared statement to make querying our document collection easier

        SELECT docno, score
        FROM scored_docs

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>Now that we have created our ‘results’ file, we can compare them to the relevance assessments <code>qrels</code> using <code>trec_eval</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>./trec_eval <span>-m</span> P.30 <span>-m</span> map qrels results
map                     all 0.2324
P_30                    all 0.2948
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not bad! While these results are not as high as the reproducible by <a href="https://github.com/castorini/anserini/blob/master/docs/regressions-robust04.md">Anserini</a>, they are definitely acceptable. The difference in performance can be explained by differences in</p>
<ol>
  <li>Which stemmer was used (we used ‘porter’)</li>
  <li>Which stopwords were used (we used the list of 571 English stopwords used in the SMART system)</li>
  <li>Pre-processing (removal of accents, punctuation, numbers)</li>
  <li>BM25 parameters (we used the default k=1.2 and b=0.75, non-conjunctive)</li>
  <li>Which fields were indexed (we used all columns by supplying ‘*’)</li>
</ol>

<p>Retrieval time for each query was between 0.5 and 1.3 seconds on our machine, which will be improved with further improvements to DuckDB. I hope you enjoyed reading this blog, and become inspired to test out the extension as well!</p>

<p>Synth, our UI framework for implementing Neumorphic designs, is now open-source. We are excited to see how the community uses this and eventually, as they always do, turn Neumorphism from a ‘just a trend’ into the next big chapter in product design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Access our Synth library through the following:<br></span><span>For Android: <a href="https://github.com/CRED-CLUB/synth-android">Here</a><br></span><span>For iOS: <a href="https://github.com/CRED-CLUB/synth-ios">Here</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span>What really is Neumorphism?</span></h3>
<div><p>Neumorphism is a recent breakaway from the more common Skeuomorphic designs, one which focuses on the colour palette. What this helps achieve is a realistic, physical feel to the product along with an appealing visual quality that makes the product feel more ‘real.’ </p><p>Here’s how it looks like on CRED</p></div>

<h3><span>How it all began</span></h3>
<p><span>Experimentation is the way of life at CRED. Neumorphism is an aesthetic style that only came into the design scene over a year back. It piqued the interest of a few of our designers, and as a side project, they made mockups of CRED based on this aesthetic. Long story short: we just loved how beautiful our product look with this aesthetic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While similar stories would have ended there, we saw this as a good enough reason to turn it from an experiment into a full-fledged project; to not just have a few screens but the entire product adopt the Neumorphic aesthetic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Equal amounts exciting and difficult. That’s how we know an experiment is worth pursuing and this one ticked off both.</span></p>
<h3><span>The process</span></h3>
<p><span>Scaling the designs to the entirety of the product did crop up some problems. Since this design philosophy is heavily dependent on visual aesthetics, we had to optimize for lights, shadows, gradients, and more in our framework. The fixes compounded, and now we have a framework that is incredibly stable and consistent throughout the product.</span></p>
<p><span>Just like we picked up Neumorphism, we wanted to have a design system in place that would make it easier for us to adopt and experiment with any other design philosophy in the future. Our new design system does just this: With the upgrade, our mobile framework could evolve into an array of offerings that we wished to build. And as an engineering framework, it also enables us to put any skin over our defined template engine making sure iterations come easy for both design and engineering teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>The next step: open sourcing the library</span></h3>
<p><span>Adopting Neumorphism was a successful experiment for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But we realize the current restrictions on implementing it are stopping others from experimenting with this design philosophy. And we believe this is depriving the world of so many great product experiences.</span></p>
<p><span>We believe the way forward for Neumorphism won’t be decided by us, but the world’s design community, which is why we are making Synth, our UI framework for implementing Neumorphic designs, open-source.</span></p>
<p><span>With this release, anyone in the world can use this framework to implement Neumorphic designs throughout their product and do it at scale. The possibilities for Synth’s use are endless, and at CRED, we are excited to see all of them.<br></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lately, there’s been renewed interest in clean, simple technology
built to help us focus. Protocols like <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://gemini.circumlunar.space/">Gemini</a> strip away
the chaos of the web. Hardware hackers fit screens in
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://onezero.medium.com/smarter-mirrors-and-how-theyre-made-327997b9eff7">mirrors</a> and build beautiful minimalist displays to
<a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-morning-paper-revisited-35b407822494">read the news</a>, display data neatly in a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://onezero.medium.com/meet-accent-352cfa95813a">picture
frame</a>, or provide a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://healeycodes.com/hacking-together-an-e-ink-dashboard/">daily summary</a>. Hidden amongst
these many awesome projects is the <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/">reMarkable 2</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been using the reMarkable for the past month or so and it is a
seriously solid device. I use it mainly to take notes, at which it
excels. The e-ink display is the best I have ever seen, barely ever
refreshing the entire screen and almost entirely without the temporary
artifacts that plague similar devices. The pencil is comfortable to
use – slightly fuzzy – and, interestingly, entirely passive: it never
needs to charge. Given that it’s meant to replace your paper, it
shouldn’t be too surprising that the tablet’s also incredibly thin.</p>
<h2 id="cornellnotes"><a href="#cornellnotes" aria-label="Anchor link for: cornellnotes">##
</a>
cornellNotes</h2>
<p>In one of my classes, I’m required to take Cornell notes. On what may
be a related note, it’s a terrible class. Regardless, I need to get an
A and so notes I shall take. The reMarkable comes with a built-in
Cornell notes template. It’s slightly different than the format I’m
used to, but it fits the bill well enough.</p>
<p>It’s hard to describe the experience of using the device. I would
say that it feels shockingly natural. Using it to take notes feels
like writing on a clipboard with none of the usual annoyances – the
paper sliding, having finite pages; and all the benefits of a digital
device – sending files via email, OCR, a select-and-drag tool, etc.
It’s convenient, feels nice, and performs well. Most importantly, it
makes me <em>excited</em> to use it every time I turn it on.</p>
<h2 id="worksheet"><a href="#worksheet" aria-label="Anchor link for: worksheet">##
</a>
workSheet</h2>
<p>In another class, the instructor distributes worksheets every once in
a while to complete during class. Now that we’re in distance learning
due to COVID, these are <code>pdf</code>s – perfect for use with the reMarkable.</p>
<p>I download them onto my laptop, upload them through the app, and
voila. Look Mom, no scratch paper! I can write directly on the
worksheet. I’ve only started doing it this week, and it’s amazing.
Sure, there are programs on the computer that allow you to write
on a <code>pdf</code>, but doing math with a trackpad sounds like torture. With
the reMarkable, it’s enjoyable.</p>
<p>That’s the device’s biggest impact. I used to hate writing by hand.
I would beg my teachers to let me type assignments so I didn’t have
to use a pencil – what am I, a caveman? Now, my paper has superpowers.</p>
<h2 id="notkindle"><a href="#notkindle" aria-label="Anchor link for: notkindle">##
</a>
notKindle</h2>
<p>It’s also a suprisingly good reading device, with native support for
<code>epub</code>s and <code>pdf</code>s. It doesn’t have a backlight, but to be fair
neither do actual books so I’m not too bothered. The default font size
is quite large, and the UI is really minimal which makes for peaceful,
undistracted reading. I own two Kindles already, but I’ve taken to
using the reMarkable instead for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>There’s no ads or tracking. On Kindle there’s an ad on the bottom
of the homescreen, which expands to the whole screen when you turn it
off – plus it sends every move you make to live forever with Big Papa
Bezos. Not so with the reMarkable.</li>
<li>The screen on the reMarkable is physically larger. Though sometimes
the compact size of my Kindle comes in handy, like when traveling,
having a nice big display is definitely an advantage. My Kindle is
closer to a large phone, and the reMarkable is definitely a tablet.</li>
<li>The reMarkable is a fairly open device. The Kindle, on the other
hand, is locked down and dripping with DRM (fairly easy to break but
still an encumberance).</li>
</ol>
<p>The developers have also made a browser extension for Chromium-based
browsers called <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-on-remarkable/bfhkfdnddlhfippjbflipboognpdpoeh">Read on reMarkable</a>, which I would love to see
the insides of but is unfortunately closed-source. Basically, it takes
any webpage, turns it into an <code>epub</code>, and sends it off to your device.
I love it and use it near constantly: whenever I run into anything on
HN that is either really long, or I just want to save for later, I
hit a button and it sends it to the tablet. Again, just incredibly
convenient.</p>
<h2 id="jailbreak"><a href="#jailbreak" aria-label="Anchor link for: jailbreak">##
</a>
jailBreak</h2>
<p>This section is titled “jailbreak,” which is actually a bit of
misnomer because the reMarkable runs Linux and you can <code>ssh</code> into it
with ease. It’s also not too fitting because I’m not just going to
talk about modifying the device, but also about official accessories.
My device came with a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/folios">Book Folio</a> and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkable.com/store/remarkable-2/markers">Marker</a> in the
box, which is pretty good value. I did find out while writing this
that they offer a “Marker Plus” that comes with a built-in eraser. It
is, unfortunately, out of stock currently but I plan on buying it once
it returns in “January 2021,” so supposedly sometime in the next week
or so.</p>
<p>Ok now time for the jailbreak-y stuff. There’s an active community on
Freenode, an unofficial <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://remarkablewiki.com/">wiki</a>, and an <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable">Awesome list</a>.
All of these are really great resources for cool stuff you can do with
your device, and I’m planning to begin experimenting with them in the
coming weeks. My first goal is to get <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/koreader/koreader">KOReader</a> running so I
can sync my extensive Calibre library to the device. I’m going to
avoid adding any <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable#games">games</a> so as not to add additional complexity
to a device that aims to remove distractions, and proceed slowly so I
don’t brick my fancy new toy. Stick around to see how that goes.</p>
<h2 id="ps"><a href="#ps" aria-label="Anchor link for: ps">##
</a>
pS</h2>
<p>The recently published fairly viral <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/index.html">Ditherpunk article</a>
by <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://surma.dev/">Surma</a> gives a really interesting overview of image
dithering. After reading the article, I noticed that the reMarkable
itself uses dithering to “fade off” your writing and make it look
like pencil. Neat.</p>
<p>Also, comparing the reMarkable to the Kindle makes me want to
jailbreak that too – I’ll find some time to look into that soon.</p>

            <div>
                


<div>
<p>- Our preliminary conclusion is that Grindr has shared user data to a number of third parties without legal basis, said Bjørn Erik Thon, Director-General of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.</p>
<p>Grindr is a location-based social networking app for gay, bi, trans, and queer people. In 2020, <a href="https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/complaints-against-grindr-and-five-third-party-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Norwegian Consumer Council filed a complaint against Grindr</a> claiming unlawful sharing of personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. The data shared include GPS location, user profile data, and the fact that the user in question is on Grindr.</p>
<p>Our preliminary conclusion is that Grindr needs consent to share these personal data and that Grindr’s consents were not valid. Additionally, we believe that the fact that someone is a Grindr user speaks to their sexual orientation, and therefore this constitutes special category data that merit particular protection.</p>
<p>- The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that this is a serious case. Users were not able to exercise real and effective control over the sharing of their data. Business models where users are pressured into giving consent, and where they are not properly informed about what they are consenting to, are not compliant with the law, said Bjørn Erik Thon, Director-General of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority.</p>
<h2>Invalid consents</h2>
<p>The Norwegian Data Protection Authority considers that as a general rule, consent is required for intrusive profiling and tracking practices for marketing or advertising purposes, for example those that involve tracking individuals across multiple websites, locations, devices, services or data-brokering. The same applies where a commercial app wishes to share data concerning users’ sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Users were forced to accept the privacy policy in its entirety to use the app, and they were not asked specifically if they wanted to consent to the sharing of their data with third parties. Furthermore, the information about the sharing of personal data was not properly communicated to users. We consider that this was contrary to the GDPR requirements for valid consent.</p>
<p>- Grindr is seen as a safe space, and many users wish to be discrete. Nonetheless, their data have been shared with an unknown number of third parties, and any information regarding this was hidden away, Thon added.</p>
<h2>Could result in highest Norwegian DPA fine to date</h2>
<p>An administrative fine should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</p>
<p>- We have notified Grindr that we intend to impose a fine of high magnitude as our findings suggest grave violations of the GDPR. Grindr has 13.7 million active users, of which thousands reside in Norway. Our view is that these people have had their personal data shared unlawfully. An important objective of the GDPR is precisely to prevent <em>take-it-or-leave-it</em> “consents”. It is imperative that such practices cease, Thon emphasised.</p>
<p>We have found that Grindr has a worldwide annual turnover of at least USD $ 100&nbsp;000&nbsp;000. This means that our proposed fine will constitute approximately 10 % of the company’s turnover.</p>
<p>Our investigation has focused on the consent mechanism in place from the GDPR became applicable until April 2020, when Grindr changed how the app asks for consent. We have not to date assessed whether the subsequent changes comply with the GDPR.</p>
<h2>Not a final decision</h2>
<p>The document we have issued to Grindr is a draft decision. Grindr has been given the opportunity to comment on our findings within 15 February 2021. We will make our final decision once we have assessed any remarks the company may have.</p>
<p>Our draft decision concerns the free version of the Grindr app.</p>
<p>The Norwegian Consumer Council also filed complaints against five of the third parties receiving data from Grindr: MoPub (owned by Twitter Inc.), Xandr Inc. (formerly known as AppNexus Inc.), OpenX Software Ltd., AdColony Inc., and Smaato Inc. These cases are ongoing.</p>

<p>Let’s imagine a small server running an application out in the wild. The application is small–it requires only a backend server, a database, and some static frontend code–but despite its size, the traffic on this server has been increasing in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>As the traffic continues to grow, response times grow slower and users begin complaining about the application’s slowness. Thankful that the application is seeing increased traffic, the main developer of the application uses a late night to increase CPU and memory on the server (a vertical scale), which succeeds without issue.</p>
<p>This happens a few more times as traffic continues to grow, but soon increasing the VM’s size becomes infeasible; the developer is tired of doing the scaling in the middle of the night and the increasing sizes provide diminishing improvements in response time.</p>
<p>Tired of repeatedly increasing the size of the server, the developer explores the idea of running multiple servers of the same application (horizontal scaling). After discussing it with a few colleagues and reading some articles, the developer remembers why she did the vertical scaling in the first place: the overhead of moving towards horizontally scaled deployment seems annoying. What should the developer do?</p>
<p>If you work or have worked at a company that ships products that people use, this situation might sound familiar. A deployment process that seemed easy and straightforward becomes toilsome and stressful, often spread across numerous servers, creating heavy cognitive load. However, when surveying all the alternatives for horizontal deployments, one can quickly become overwhelmed with the array of options and tools.</p>
<p>So how does a single server become 2, 3, 4+ with the same initial setup? Should one just stick a load balancer between the two instances? Does a simple blue/green deployment with 2+ server instances get the job done? How about using some kind of container deployment service that is triggered every time code is merged into the main branch? What happens if one of the servers goes down?</p>
<p>While the example above is simplistic, it underlines the main point of this article: deploying production-grade applications is inherently challenging. To keep services chugging and meeting expectations, there are many things to keep in mind.</p>
<h2 id="production-application-non-negotiables">Production Application Non-negotiables</h2>
<p>Deploying production-grade applications is a daunting task, and it requires planning for (at least) the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Networking (DNS, IP, certificates, load-balancing, etc.)</li>
<li>Compute (the “server”)</li>
<li>Scaling (vertical &amp; horizontal)</li>
<li>Persistence, Queues, &amp; Key-Value Store</li>
<li>Roles &amp; Policies (who can do what?)</li>
<li>Application Configuration &amp; Secrets</li>
<li>Logging, Alerting, &amp; Health Checking</li>
<li>Packaging, Bundling, Dependencies &amp; Artifacts</li>
<li>Deployments</li>
<li>Other aspects I forgot to include…</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day, the items in the list above are production non-negotiables. If the non-negotiables aren’t implemented or implemented poorly, the application won’t run, will become unreachable, or will die without any warning or insight. But the extent to which you “see” these non-negotiables depends on where the application is deployed, and subsequently, how much you are paying for it.</p>
<p>Unless you are running everything on bare metal, on Raspberry Pis in your bedroom/garage, or “on-prem” (😱), your cloud provider likely offers a myriad of services to get your application stood up on their machines.</p>
<p>And this brings us to Kubernetes. Reaching for Kubernetes begins to make sense when faced with the cloud provider mishmash for deploying production applications; instead of cobbling together a rag-tag group of proprietary, cloud-based services, it might be better to harness the power of an open-source, highly-tested, hugely-supported solution built from Google’s internal experience of running highly available services.</p>
<p>Kubernetes has a million descriptions, but at its core, it is a first-class set of objects and APIs that handle a wide range of the production deployment non-negotiables. The fact that Kubernetes is (nearly) the whole package is one reason that all cloud providers offer their form of Kubernetes-as-a-service. Many cloud providers provide their version of hosted services, such as databases, Elasticsearch, Redis, etc. but few services cover the kind of breadth Kubernetes does.</p>
<p>Since Kubernetes is one of the most popular choices for deploying scaled applications, cloud providers build their solutions to plug into the Kubernetes API. This means that creating the same Kubernetes object in clusters on different cloud providers often creates provider-specific resources, all while these resources look the same on the Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, let’s say you want to create a load balancer on two clusters that exist in two different cloud providers. In the land of Kubernetes, you might be create a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">“Service” object</a> (which allows different services to reach each other by DNS instead of IP inside the cluster), which might subsequently create a cloud provider-specific, like an application or network load balancer.</p>
<p>But the beauty here is that you are thinking in terms of Kubernetes objects–a Service–and not in terms of AWS application load balancers or Google Cloud Engine GKE Ingress. In the land of the clouds, change is the only constant, and it is difficult to keep up with them. Having a frame of thinking about setup through the lens of Kubernetes objects can be advantageous.</p>
<h2 id="when-kubernetes-might-be-a-good-fit">When Kubernetes Might Be a Good Fit</h2>
<p>So when should you use Kubernetes? Like everything in software, there are no hard-and-fast rules. That said, the following might be a place to start:</p>
<p><strong>1. Your application has substantial traffic</strong></p>
<p>Kubernetes has many features for handling zero-time deployments and the restarting of non-responsive/unhealthy services. While well-designed services can handle substantial traffic, it can be advantageous to have full control over how zero-downtime deployments will be rolled out.</p>
<p><strong>2. You are using a microservice architecture</strong></p>
<p>If running a microservice architecture, it’s almost guaranteed that these services need to talk to each other. This will likely be a nightmare on Kubernetes, but likely will be an even larger nightmare without it</p>
<p><strong>3. There are problems with your current deployment process–and there are enough resources and will to change it</strong></p>
<p>There will always be issues with an application’s deployment strategy. However, there are times when these issues impact the business side of things. Kubernetes will of course in no automatically solve deployment-related issues (and could possibly even make them worse if the team has too little Kubernetes experience). But if implemented well, Kubernetes can iron out what otherwise might have been a toilsome deployment process.</p>
<p><strong>4. You have a considerable understanding of your application’s needs and how it might best be deployed</strong></p>
<p>What does the application require? Which components should be deployed in the cluster and which should be managed services? If these questions have relatively clear answers, Kubernetes could be an appropriate choice.</p>
<p><strong>5. You want to learn about Kubernetes!</strong></p>
<p>There is no better way to learn about something by doing it, so if you’re curious about Kubernetes, get a cluster running locally and poke around.</p>
<h2 id="the-kubernetes-threshold">The Kubernetes Threshold</h2>
<p>The list above is in no way exhaustive, and in reality, every deployed application is its own snowflake. If you or the company already has guardrails for deploying production applications, and there aren’t huge problems with this existing setup, it is likely prudent to do deploy the “old” way. This assumes that many/all of the production non-negotiables have been met, and the way they are implemented isn’t causing business-critical issues. Sometimes it is enough to simply set up a load balancer and deploying a second VM with an additional instance of your application, for example.</p>
<p>The decision to deploy on Kubernetes, whether it’s managed or not, should not be taken lightly. Understanding the trade-offs between the services/resources necessary for a non-Kubernetes setup vs. those necessary for a Kubernetes setup is paramount before rolling out a new Kubernetes cluster. The point at which it makes “more sense” to deploy on Kubernetes is what we might call the Kubernetes threshold.</p>
<p>Every situation is different, and every situation’s Kubernetes threshold will be different. By considering this as early as possible, it will provide benefits to people on all sides of the application. If your applications aren’t already running on Kubernetes, imagining where your project and organizational Kubernetes threshold lies will benefit you and your team as your work continues.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The training time of a neural network is a topic that is under discussed in machine learning academic literature, but is super important in practice. By making training time faster, one reaps the benefits of (A) reducing their compute budget and (B) being able to test hypothesis faster. </p>



<p>For the purposes of this post, I’m assuming the neural network of interest has already achieved the inference runtime and performance requirements, and now the focus is purely on optimizing the training time. When I am speeding up training time, I usually find myself alternating between solutions that are either primarily software or hardware related.</p>



<h2>Software Solutions</h2>



<h3>1. Optimizer and Schedules</h3>



<p>The software solution that I tune the most is definitely the optimizer and its associated hyper parameters. I find that after almost any other change it is worth double checking that your optimizer and its hyperparameters are still optimal for your new setup.</p>



<p>When first prototyping a network, I prefer to use SGD with a constant learning rate and momentum. This reduces the number of optimizer hyperparameters to just setting the learning rate.</p>



<p>Once a network prototype is achieved, a reliable trick to boost performance is to introduce learning rate step drops when the learning appears to have stalled out. However, determining the exact iteration at which to perform the learning rate step can be nuanced.</p>



<p>I personally have had great success with the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07120">One Cycle learning rate policy</a>. However, it opens up a lot of new knobs to potentially tune (min/max lr, exact lr curve, etc). I strongly recommend using AdamW + <a href="https://fastai1.fast.ai/callbacks.one_cycle.html">Fast.ai One Cycle schedule</a> (which follows a cosine annealing) as a starting policy and tuning from there.</p>



<h3>2. Initialization</h3>



<p>The proper initialization of a neural network can have a large impact on the training speed. There are three major options:<br>1. <strong>Random initialization</strong>. A standard choice is <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/paper/delving-deep-into-rectifiers-surpassing-human">Kaiming initialization</a> with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002">Focal Loss bias</a>.<br>2. <strong>Pretraining w/ other datasets</strong>. This includes data from other tasks (ie use <a href="http://www.image-net.org/">ImageNet</a> for backbone pretraining when doing object detection) or from same task but different source (ie always doing object detection, but generalizing from <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#home">COCO</a> to <a href="https://www.nuscenes.org/">nuScenes</a>). <br>3. <strong>Pretraining w/ same dataset</strong>. If one has determined that some subset of a dataset is less valuable for training, it could still serve a useful role in pretraining. See next section on Curriculum for ideas on how to determine the usefulness of data.</p>



<h3>3.  Curriculum</h3>



<p>Given a fixed dataset, there is still an open question on the best way to present the data to the neural network. While the default to define an epoch as one random pass through the dataset works great as a starting point, there are lots of potential improvements in the selection and presentation of a curriculum for the neural network.</p>



<p>Some ideas in this area include:<br>1. <strong>Sampling of data</strong>. Not all data samples are equally valuable, for example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03195">repeat factor sampling</a> can be used to prioritize rare annotations.<br>2. <strong>Multitask prioritization. </strong>When <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09796">teaching a neural network multiple tasks</a>, one strategy is to teach those tasks from easiest to hardest.<br>3. <strong>Progressive resizing. </strong>When training image based tasks with a fully convolution neural network, one approach is to start with small resolution images and <a href="https://www.fast.ai/2018/08/10/fastai-diu-imagenet/">progressively increase the size</a>.</p>



<p>I have found that the effort to reward ratio favors spending a significant amount of time on tuning the curriculum.</p>



<h3>4. Architecture</h3>



<p>Since I am assuming that one has already achieved the required inference runtime, the neural network architecture may not need to be optimized further. However, if you are using a stochastic step during training like <a href="https://jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html">drop out</a>, the removal of this step can significantly speed up your training time. Otherwise, tuning the architecture for training speed is usually not worth a large time investment.</p>



<h2>Hardware Specific Solutions</h2>



<h3>1. Better Hardware</h3>



<p>If you just sit still, your training time likely will go down from the continued advances in CPUs, GPUS, RAM, etc. A great way to set yourself up for these changes is by not owning your own hardware but instead training in the cloud.</p>



<h3>2. Data Serving</h3>



<p>The goal is to keep your GPUs fed, so one should push your non-GPU code to be slightly faster than your GPU step so that your GPUs are always busy. Be prepared to often revisit this step as you make advances in optimizing other parts of your training time. There is no way around it, solving this step is often difficult since there is no one size fits all solution. Instead, you will constantly need to find a nuanced solution that depends on your specific hardware and dataset.</p>



<h3>3. GPU Utilization</h3>



<p>Modern neural network architectures favor 2D CNNs which are highly optimized for GPUs. And if you can show how to simplify a complicated architecture to a 2D CNN, <a href="https://n2infinityandbeyond.com/2019/01/07/pointpillars-fast-encoders-for-object-detection-from-point-clouds/">you might get a paper out of it</a> ;). </p>



<p>So personally I have found the effort to be put into GPU utilization to be highly bimodal. If you have an architecture that is not GPU efficient, go all in on making it more efficient, the rewards are huge! But if you have already optimized for inference runtime, you likely already have a modern architecture that efficiently utilizes GPUs. Once you have the right architecture, then you often only need to make minor tweaks to the batch size to fully utilize the GPU.</p>



<h3>4. Mixed Precision Training</h3>



<p>With the correct hardware, training with mixed precision (float32 and float16) is <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/automatic-mixed-precision">an easy way to cut training time in half</a>, and <a href="https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/0.4.9/Trainer/Distributed%20training/">modern libraries make it as simple as a single setting</a>. The only catch is that you may make your training more unstable. But if you can tame the extra training noise, this is a no brainer.</p>



<h3>5. Multiple GPUs</h3>



<p>Eventually, once you have pulled off all the other speedups, you will be left with one real option: scale up your compute! If you can really push the number of GPUs you can leverage, you can pull off crazy headlines like:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02677.pdf">Accurate, Large Minibatch SGD: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour</a> (cool in 2017)</li><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11205.pdf">Highly Scalable Deep Learning Training System with Mixed-Precision: Training ImageNet in Four Minutes</a> (cool in 2018)</li></ul>



<p>Distributed computing has been and will continue to be a hot topic for years to come.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I hope this helps shed light on some of the potential ways to speed up your neural network training. Let me know what type of training speedups you can achieve with this advice!</p>

<p>We made it into Iceland today! (No pictures of me in this post – I have horrible bed head at the moment, recovering from jet lag.)</p>



<p>As Americans, if we want to visit Iceland, we have a few choices:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Just drop in as a tourist for 90 days</strong> – except this is off-limits now due to the COVID19 travel bans</li><li><strong>Get a work permit and stay for years</strong> – this is what we’d originally planned to do when <a href="https://ozar.me/2020/10/were-planning-to-move-to-iceland-for-a-while/">I first shared that we were moving to Iceland for a while</a>. I had signed on to work part-time for an Icelandic company, a few days per month, in order to get a conventional work permit. However, my soon-to-be-employer had a shakeup, and rather than find another employer, we opted to…</li><li><strong>Get <a href="https://work.iceland.is/working/icelands-remote-work-long-term-visa">Iceland’s new teleworker visa</a></strong> – which lets you stay for 6 months per year as long as you’re from a country that wouldn’t normally need a tourist visa, and you can prove that you have a remote job that makes at least around $100K USD per year.</li></ul>



<p>The good news of using the teleworker visa:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Iceland">Iceland’s internet infrastructure</a> is fantastic, with full 1Gbit/sec fiber available all over the country, making it easy to work remotely</li><li>I don’t have to work for someone else, and I don’t have to go into an office, so I can limit my possible exposure to COVID19</li><li>It doesn’t affect our tax status – we don’t have to pay extra income taxes in Iceland, just our normal US income taxes back home</li></ul>



<p>The bad news:</p>



<ul><li>It’s only good for 6 months per year – they’ve talked about raising that, but for now it’s still just 6 months</li><li>It’s not eligible for a permanent residency permit – if I’d have had a regular work permit and stayed for 4 years straight (less vacations), we could have gotten a permanent residency permit, so we were planning to build a house in Iceland – that’s off for now</li></ul>



<h3>The teleworker visa application process</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.utl.is/index.php/en/long-term-visa-for-remote-workers-and-their-family-members">teleworker visa application</a> is pretty simple, but can’t be done online: you have to send over real paper forms and passport photos. I would highly recommend shipping your application via a shipping company that includes signed proof of delivery and tracking. If you need help with the application process, <a href="https://www.workfromiceland.com/remotework">WorkFromIceland.com</a> offers an advisory package, but it costs thousands of dollars. (We didn’t use it, but I was tempted.)</p>



<p>After Iceland’s Directorate of Immigration receives your application, it goes into a bit of a black hole. We didn’t get email confirmation that our application was received, and <a href="https://www.utl.is/index.php/en/processing-time-and-applications-being-processed">Iceland’s immigration status page</a> doesn’t show what range of teleworker visas they’re working on. That page is only updated about once a month – if you apply, I’d recommend using a service like <a href="https://distill.io/">distill.io</a> to watch the page for changes.</p>



<p>We received approval via email after 5 weeks to process, but we had a few folks talking to the Iceland government on our behalf, so that might have sped things up. As we worked through the final logistics with the Directorate of Immigration, we found out that we were literally the very first people to get approvals for this new visa!</p>



<p>Iceland sends you a signed email confirmation, at which point you’re eligible to enter the country. You show this email to passport control as you enter Iceland, they check their databases, and in you go.</p>



<h3>Quarantining in Iceland</h3>



<p>Obviously this situation is very fluid, and I’m writing about the January 2021 situation. If you’re reading this later, check <a href="https://www.covid.is/english">covid.is</a> for the latest coronavirus travel restrictions.</p>

<p>72 hours before you fly into Iceland, you have to <a href="https://visit.covid.is/">register for your free COVID19 test</a> and download the <a href="https://www.covid.is/app/en">Rakning C-19 app</a>. Iceland tracks you by your cell phone number, and the app helps the country do contact tracing.</p>



<p>When you arrive, you get a free COVID19 test at the airport. Because they’ve got testing gear centralized in one location, you get your results back in the app quickly – ours took just about 8 hours.</p>



<p>From the airport, you have to go into quarantine for 5 days. There are a set list of hotels that accept quarantining guests, or you can go to your house. You’re allowed to pick up a rental car, and if you have a long drive ahead of you, you can stay overnight in a quarantine hotel first before setting off on your journey – but only one night. Because there are storms in the north where we need to go, we decided to just do the whole quarantine at an approved hotel instead. Room service!</p>



<p>After 5 days, you get another free COVID19 test. (The date, time, and location are sent to you via email &amp; via the Rakning-C19 app within a day of you starting quarantine.) After you receive the all-clear from your second test’s results, then you’re done with quarantining. We’ll drive up north, settle into our rental house, set up my home studio. I’m teleworking again, teaching training classes starting February 1. Oh I think I’m supposed to say 1 Feb now. I’m European. (raises pinkie finger)</p>



<p>I’m not teleworking too hard though: during our stay here, we’re working 2 weeks a month, and spending the rest of the time seeing the amazing sights of Iceland.</p>



<p>If you’ve got any questions about the application process or arriving into Iceland, let me know.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
						
<p>I have a hobby. I like citing papers that provide strong evidence that is directly in opposition to what the authors claim. Lucky me, because PNAS just published a paper that fits snuggly into this category. It’s titled <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2016976118#sec-13">“Experienced well-being rises with income, even above $75,000 per year”</a>. An even better title would have been “Income is a poor gauge for well-being; don’t bother”.</p>



<p>This is the central figure:</p>



<figure><a href="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1024x1013.png" alt="" width="475" height="469" srcset="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1024x1013.png 1024w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-300x297.png 300w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-768x760.png 768w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-202x200.png 202w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image.png 1034w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px"></a></figure>



<p>Whoa! The paper doesn’t fail to mention (multiple times) how this is virtually a perfect linear relationship between well-being and log(income). The authors conclude that people with higher income are more satisfied with life and experience more well-being!</p>



<h2>The real-life version of this graph</h2>



<p>Let’s see what this graph looks like with a linear x-axis and with simulated raw data (see code below). The black dots are simulated individual participants from the study, assuming that statistical assumptions are met. Their exact distribution along the x-axis is not known (the author did not publish raw data), but that doesn’t matter. It only matters how the dots are dispersed for a given income. </p>



<figure><a href="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="462" src="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-1024x462.png" alt="" srcset="https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-1024x462.png 1024w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-300x135.png 300w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-768x346.png 768w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1-444x200.png 444w, https://lindeloev.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-1.png 1060w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></figure>



<p>You are one of the black dots. You could be one of the other black dots. But income does virtually nothing to lower or improve people’s well-being or life satisfaction. Income explained 1.5% and 4% of the variance in Well-Being and Life Satisfaction respectively (see code below).</p>



<blockquote><p>Income explained 1.5% and 4% of the variance in Well-Being and Life Satisfaction respectively</p></blockquote>



<h2>Extreme income rise = extreme happiness?</h2>



<p>Let’s study the most extreme case: you have an annual income of just $15,000. But now you get to jump into the life of a rich person all the way to the other side of the (linear) graph with an annual income of $480,000. The result of this 32-fold increase in income is expected to be:</p>



<ul><li>Life Satisfaction: 62% used to rate higher than you. Now only 35% does! But there’s a 24% chance that you will be <em>less</em> happy than before.</li><li>Experienced Well-Being: 58% used to rate higher than you. Now only 40% does! But there’s a 33% chance that you will be <em>less</em> happy than before.</li></ul>



<p>Hmm, hardly the extreme happiness rush that one might expect would expect from reading the paper and the ensuing media coverage. It’s a vanishingly small effect, considering the extremeness of this example. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I think it’s fairer to say that we’ve now learned that this paper is solid evidence that income is a really poor gauge for happiness. Someone once wrote a song about this:</p>



<figure><img src="https://25.media.tumblr.com/bf7724c5134e8d05cef1d8431e8c1ad1/tumblr_mh1jcs8zyE1rhssuho1_500.gif" alt="money can't buy me love the beatles gif"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://wifflegif.com/gifs/51599-money-cant-buy-me-love-the-beatles-gif">https://wifflegif.com/gifs/51599-money-cant-buy-me-love-the-beatles-gif</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2>Code</h2>



<p>Computing quantiles and probability of deterioration is simple. The z-score is your score relative to the whole population in units of standard deviations. So just the results for Life Satisfaction were obtained by reading off the extremes of the graph and computing the associated quantiles in R: <code>pnorm(-0.3)</code> and <code>pnorm(0.4)</code>. Probability of negative income change is then just <code>pnorm(-0.3, 0.4)</code>.</p>



<p>The plots are fairly straightforward too. First, let’s simulate the raw data:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group=""># Data
N = 33391  # Number of participants
incomes = exp(seq(log(15000), log(480000), length.out = N))  # x-axis of Figure 1
trend_wb = seq(-0.2, 0.25, length.out = N)  # Linear, read off Figure 1
trend_ls = seq(-0.3, 0.4, length.out = N)   # Linear, read off Figure 1
z_wb = rnorm(N, trend_wb)  # z-score is standard normal
z_ls = rnorm(N, trend_ls)  # z-score is standard normal

# Merge the data in long format
df = data.frame(
  incomes,
  z = c(rnorm(N, z_wb), rnorm(N, z_ls)),
  outcome = c(rep("Experienced Well-Being", N), rep("Life Satisfaction", N))
)
</pre>



<p>Now let’s plot it:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">ggplot(df, aes(x = incomes, y = z)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, size = 0.3) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = c(trend_wb, trend_ls), color = outcome), lwd = 2) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 75000, lty = 2, lwd = 1, color = "#555555") + 
  facet_wrap(~outcome) + 
  #scale_x_continuous(trans = "log", breaks = c(15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480) * 1000) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480) * 1000, labels = scales::label_number_auto()) + 
  labs(x = "Houshold income", y = "z-scored well-being") + 
  theme_bw(13) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
</pre>



<p>If you want to verify other results, you can fit the linear models to the (simulated) data and see that we can approximately replicate the r-values reported in the paper (r = 0.17 and r = 0.09) and that this correspond to 4% and 1.5% variance explained, respectively:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="r" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">summary(lm(z_ls ~ log(incomes)))
summary(lm(z_wb ~ log(incomes)))</pre>



<p>I leave it as an exercise to the reader to filter out <code>nonlow_incomes = incomes[incomes &gt; 30000]</code> and assess the predictive performance (<code>lm(z_ls ~ log(nonlow_incomes)</code>).</p>

<p>The first month of 2021 is a bad month to begin with, I always say to myself that we need to fail fast and fail quickly, but failing is not a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>In November we started developing a health information management system (HIMS) for a laboratory service. Which will computerise their already paper based POS, reporting, patient registering system.</p>
<p>Me and my co founder was easterly working on the project for the last 2 months. We had thought we had everything we needed to nail this project.</p>
<ul><li>We had to knowledge about the domain, and we knew what are the problems faced by the people in the health industry</li><li>We had negotiated with a client, so we had a customer</li><li>And there was product market fit for a solution like this, with both health institutes and us benefiting by the service</li></ul>
<p>We quickly made a MVP, did some internal testing and it was working alright. Then we wanted to implement a parallel testing with the institute, with their current paper based system, and our cloud based system running in parallel to so we can get an idea on how we can improve our MVP.</p>
<p>However, when I tried to reach out to the client about implementing our service in parallel with their own paper based system, they were not interested on a computerised system anymore. </p>
<p>I don’t understand what changed their minds, maybe due to the pandemic their income might have reduced, which might have made them think twice about an investment. Maybe they are happy with their current paper based solution, and don’t see the value of a modern computer based system.</p>
<p>Even though no matter how much I believe that the benefit they gain from replacing a paper based system will not do anything, unless the clients can’t see the benefit and can’t be convinced. </p>
<p>Either way, me and my partner have two options,</p>
<ul><li>Look for a potential new candidate who is interested in using the system</li><li>Terminate the project and think about starting something new</li></ul>
<p>I will try to find potential customers who will be interested in a similar system until the end of the month, however if I was unable to find a suitable client, I might have to terminate the project and start something fresh. </p>
<p>Maybe failing fast and filing quickly has its benefits because, if we would have put more time and effort in creating the perfect solution, a rejection like this would have wasted lot of our time and effort.</p>
<p>What would you do if you are in my situation? Do you believe in fail fast and fail quickly? </p>

January 25, 2021 | https://amitness.com/2020/05/data-augmentation-for-nlp/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://amitness.com/2020/05/data-augmentation-for-nlp/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>Unlike Computer Vision where using image data augmentation is standard practice, augmentation of text data in NLP is pretty rare. Trivial operations for images such as rotating an image a few degrees or converting it into grayscale doesn’t change its semantics. This presence of semantically invariant transformation made augmentation an essential toolkit in Computer Vision research.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/semantic-invariance-nlp.png" alt="Challenge of Semantically Invariant Transformation in NLP"></p>
<p>I was curious if there were attempts at developing augmentation techniques for NLP and explored the existing literature. In this post, I will give an overview of the current approaches for text data augmentation based on my findings.</p>
<h2 id="nlp-data-augmentation-techniques">NLP Data Augmentation Techniques</h2>
<h2 id="1-lexical-substitution">1. Lexical Substitution</h2>
<p>This line of work tries to substitute words present in a text without changing the meaning of the sentence.</p>
<h3 id="a-thesaurus-based-substitution">a. Thesaurus-based substitution</h3>
<p>In this technique, we take a random word from the sentence and replace it with its synonym using a Thesaurus. For example, we could use the <a href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a> database for English to look up the synonyms and then perform the replacement. It is a manually curated database with relations between words.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-wordnet.png" alt="Thesaurus-based substitution"></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626">Zhang et al.</a> used this technique in their 2015 paper “Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification”. <a href="https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI16/paper/download/12195/12023">Mueller et al.</a> used a similar strategy to generate additional 10K training examples for their sentence similarity model. This technique was also used by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11196">Wei et al.</a> as one of the techniques in their pool of four random augmentations in the “Easy Data Augmentation” paper.</p>
<p>For implementation, NLTK provides a programmatic <a href="https://www.nltk.org/howto/wordnet.html">access</a> to WordNet. You can also use the <a href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html#wordnet-integration">TextBlob API</a>. Additionally, there is a database called <a href="http://paraphrase.org/#/download">PPDB</a> containing millions of paraphrases that you can download and use programmatically.</p>
<h3 id="b-word-embeddings-substitution">b. Word-Embeddings Substitution</h3>
<p>In this approach, we take pre-trained word embeddings such as Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, Sent2Vec, and use the nearest neighbor words in the embedding space as the replacement for some word in the sentence.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10351">Jiao et al.</a> used this technique with GloVe embeddings in their paper “<em>TinyBert</em>” to improve the generalization of their language model on downstream tasks. <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D15-1306.pdf">Wang et al.</a> used it to augment tweets needed to learn a topic model.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-embedding.png" alt="Nearest Neighbors with Word Vectors"></p>
<p>For example, you can replace the word with the 3-most similar words and get three variations of the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-embedding-example.png" alt="Augmenting text with word embeddings"></p>
<p>It’s easy to use packages like Gensim to access pre-trained word vectors and get the nearest neighbors. For example, here we find the synonyms for the word ‘awesome’ using word vectors trained on tweets.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span># pip install gensim
</span><span>import</span> <span>gensim.downloader</span> <span>as</span> <span>api</span>

<span>model</span> <span>=</span> <span>api</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>'glove-twitter-25'</span><span>)</span>  
<span>model</span><span>.</span><span>most_similar</span><span>(</span><span>'awesome'</span><span>,</span> <span>topn</span><span>=</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You will get back the 5 most similar words along with the cosine similarities.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>[(</span><span>'amazing'</span><span>,</span> <span>0.9687871932983398</span><span>),</span>
 <span>(</span><span>'best'</span><span>,</span> <span>0.9600659608840942</span><span>),</span>
 <span>(</span><span>'fun'</span><span>,</span> <span>0.9331520795822144</span><span>),</span>
 <span>(</span><span>'fantastic'</span><span>,</span> <span>0.9313924312591553</span><span>),</span>
 <span>(</span><span>'perfect'</span><span>,</span> <span>0.9243415594100952</span><span>)]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="c-masked-language-model">c. Masked Language Model</h3>
<p>Transformer models such as BERT, ROBERTA, and ALBERT have been trained on a large amount of text using a pretext task called “Masked Language Modeling” where the model has to predict masked words based on the context.</p>
<p>This can be used to augment some text. For example, we could use a pre-trained BERT model, mask some parts of the text, and ask the BERT model to predict the token for the mask.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-bert-mlm.png" alt="Masked Word Prediction"></p>
<p>Thus, we can generate variations of a text using the mask predictions. Compared to previous approaches, the generated text is more grammatically coherent as the model takes context into account when making predictions.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-bert-augmentations.png" alt="Text Augmentation using BERT"></p>
<p>This is easy to implement with open-source libraries such as <a href="https://huggingface.co/transformers/">transformers</a> by Hugging Face. You can set the token you want to replace with <code>&lt;mask&gt;</code> and generate predictions.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>transformers</span> <span>import</span> <span>pipeline</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>However, one caveat of this method is that deciding which part of the text to mask is not trivial. You will have to use heuristics to decide the mask, otherwise, the generated text might not retain the meaning of the original sentence.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01970">Garg. et al.</a> use this idea for generating adversarial examples for text classification.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/bae-adversarial-attack.jpeg" alt=""><br>
Figure: MLM augmentation via replacement or insertion (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01970">Source</a>)</p>
<h3 id="d-tf-idf-based-word-replacement">d. TF-IDF based word replacement</h3>
<p>This augmentation method was proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12848">Xie et al.</a> in the Unsupervised Data Augmentation paper. The basic idea is that words that have <span>low TF-IDF scores</span> are uninformative and thus can be replaced without affecting the ground-truth labels of the sentence.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-tf-idf-word-replacement.png" alt="TF-IDF based word replacement"></p>
<p>The words that replace the original word are chosen by calculating TF-IDF scores of words over the whole document and taking the lowest ones. You can refer to the <a href="https://github.com/google-research/uda/blob/master/text/augmentation/word_level_augment.py">code implementation</a> for this in the original paper.</p>
<h2 id="2-back-translation">2. Back Translation</h2>
<p>In this approach, we leverage machine translation to paraphrase a text while retraining the meaning. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12848">Xie et al.</a> used this method to augment the unlabeled text and learn a semi-supervised model on IMDB dataset with only 20 labeled examples. Their model outperformed the previous state-of-the-art model trained on 25,000 labeled examples.</p>
<p>The back-translation process is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take some sentence (e.g. in English) and translate to another Language e.g. French</li>
<li>Translate the French sentence back into an English sentence</li>
<li>Check if the new sentence is different from our original sentence. If it is, then we use this new sentence as an augmented version of the original text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-back-translation.png" alt="Idea of Back-Translation"></p>
<p>You can also run back-translation using different languages at once to generate more variations. As shown below, we translate an English sentence to a target language and back again to English for three target languages: French, Mandarin, and Italian.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-backtranslation-multi.png" alt="Multi-step Back-Translation"></p>
<p>This technique was also used in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/discussion/52557">1st place solution</a> for the “Toxic Comment Classification Challenge” on Kaggle. The winner used it for both training-data augmentations as well as during test-time where the predicted probabilities for English sentence along with back-translation using three languages(French, German, Spanish) were averaged to get the final prediction.</p>
<p>For the implementation of back-translation, you can use TextBlob. Alternatively, you can also use <a href="https://amitness.com/2020/02/back-translation-in-google-sheets/">Google Sheets</a> to apply Google Translate for free. You can also use <a href="https://amitness.com/back-translation/">MarianMT</a> for back-translation.</p>
<h2 id="3-text-surface-transformation">3. Text Surface Transformation</h2>
<p>These are simple pattern matching transformations applied using regex and was introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04718">Claude Coulombe</a> in his paper.</p>
<p>In the paper, he gives an example of transforming verbal forms from contraction to expansion and vice versa. We can generate augmented texts by applying this.</p>

<p>Since the transformation should not change the meaning of the sentence, we can see that this can fail in case of expanding ambiguous verbal forms like:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/nlp-aug-contraction-ambiguity.png" alt="Ambiguity in verbal form expansion"></p>
<p>To resolve this, the paper proposes that we allow ambiguous contractions but skip ambiguous expansion.</p>

<p>You can find a list of contractions for the English language <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3aList_of_English_contractions">here</a>. For expansion, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/kootenpv/contractions">contractions</a> library in Python.</p>
<h2 id="4-random-noise-injection">4. Random Noise Injection</h2>
<p>The idea of these methods is to inject noise in the text so that the model trained is robust to perturbations.</p>
<h3 id="a-spelling-error-injection">a. Spelling error injection</h3>
<p>In this method, we add spelling errors to some random word in the sentence. These spelling errors can be added programmatically or using a mapping of common spelling errors such as <a href="https://github.com/makcedward/nlpaug/blob/master/model/spelling_en.txt">this list</a> for English.</p>

<h3 id="b-qwerty-keyboard-error-injection">b. QWERTY Keyboard Error Injection</h3>
<p>This method tries to simulate common errors that happen when typing on a QWERTY layout keyboard due to keys that are very near to each other. The errors are injected based on keyboard distance.</p>

<h3 id="c-unigram-noising">c. Unigram Noising</h3>
<p>This method has been used by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02573">Xie et al.</a> and the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12848">UDA</a> paper. The idea is to perform replacement with words sampled from the unigram frequency distribution. This frequency is basically how many times each word occurs in the training corpus.</p>

<h3 id="d-blank-noising">d. Blank Noising</h3>
<p>This method has been proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02573">Xie et al.</a> in their paper. The idea is to replace a random word with a placeholder token. The paper uses “_” as the placeholder token. In the paper, they use it as a way to avoid overfitting on specific contexts as well as a smoothing mechanism for the language model. The technique helped improve perplexity and BLEU scores.</p>

<h3 id="e-sentence-shuffling">e. Sentence Shuffling</h3>
<p>This is a naive technique where we shuffle sentences present in a training text to create an augmented version.</p>

<h3 id="f-random-insertion">f. Random Insertion</h3>
<p>This technique was proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11196">Wei et al.</a> in their paper “Easy Data Augmentation”. In this technique, we first choose a random word from the sentence that is not a stop word. Then, we find its synonym and insert that into a random position in the sentence.</p>

<p>This technique was also proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11196">Wei et al.</a> in their paper “Easy Data Augmentation”. The idea is to randomly swap any two words in the sentence.</p>

<p>This technique was also proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.11196">Wei et al.</a> in their paper “Easy Data Augmentation”. In this, we randomly remove each word in the sentence with some probability p.</p>

<p>This technique was introduced by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11241">Luque</a> in his paper on sentiment analysis for TASS 2019. It is inspired by the chromosome crossover operation that happens in genetics. <br>
In the method, a tweet is divided into two halves and two random tweets of the same polarity(i.e. positive/negative) have their halves swapped. The hypothesis is that even though the result will be ungrammatical and semantically unsound, the new text will still preserve the sentiment.</p>

<h2>The software contract</h2>



<p>We software engineers love the metaphor of the <em>contract</em> when describing software behavior: <em>If I give you X, you promise to give me Y in return</em>. One example of a contract is the signature of a function in a statically typed language. Here’s a function signature in the Kotlin programming language:</p>


<pre title="">fun exportArtifact(exportable: Exportable): DeliveryArtifact
</pre>


<p>This signature promises that if you call the <em>exportArtifact</em> function with an argument of type <em>Exportable</em>, the return value will be an object of type <em>DeliveryArtifact</em>.</p>



<p>Function signatures are a special case for software contracts, in that they can be enforced mechanically: the compiler guarantees that the contract will hold for any program that compiles successfully. In general, though, the software contracts that we care about can’t be mechanically checked. For example, we might talk about a contract that a particular service provides, but we don’t have tools that can guarantee that our service conforms to the contract. That’s why we have to test it.</p>



<p>Contracts are a type of <em>specification</em>: they tell us that if certain <em>preconditions</em> are met, the system described by the contract guarantees that certain <em>postconditions</em> will be met in return. The idea of reasoning about the behavior of a program using preconditions and postconditions was popularized by C.A.R. Hoare in his legendary paper <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare69.pdf">An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming</a>, and is known today as Hoare logic. The language of <em>contract</em> in the software engineering sense was popularized by Bertrand Meyer (specifically, <em>design by contract</em>) in his language <em>Eiffel</em> and his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Software-Construction-Book-CD-ROM/dp/0136291554">Object-Oriented Software Construction</a>.</p>



<p>We software engineers like contracts they they help us reason about the behavior of a system. Instead of requiring us to understand the complete details of a system that we interact with, all we need to do is understand the contract. </p>

<p>Contracts, therefore, are a form of abstraction. In addition, contracts are <em>composable</em>, we can feed the outputs of system X into system Y if the postconditions of Y are consistent with the preconditions of X. Because we can compose contracts, we can use them to help us build systems out of parts that are described by contracts. Contracts are a tool that enable us humans to work together to build software systems that are too complex for any individual human to understand.</p>



<h2>When contracts aren’t useful</h2>



<p>Alas, contracts aren’t much use for reasoning about system behavior when either of the following two conditions happen:</p>



<ol><li>A system’s implementation doesn’t fully conform to its contract.</li><li>The precondition of a system’s contract is violated by a client.</li></ol>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One time the build of Google’s dashboarding system broke because someone imported a Python math library to perform some regression analysis inside of graphs and this imported all of FORTRAN which pushed the total number of individual dependencies above the 60K threshold.</p>— Alex Hidalgo (@ahidalgosre) <a href="https://twitter.com/ahidalgosre/status/1299477186777358337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div><figcaption>An example of a contract where a precondition (number of allowed dependencies) was violated</figcaption></figure>



<p>Whether a problem falls into the first or second condition is a judgment call. Either way, your system is now in a bad state.</p>

<p>A system that has gotten into a bad state is violating its contract, pretty much by definition. This means we must now deal with the implementation details of the system in order to get it back into a good state. Since no one person understands the entire system, we often need the help of multiple people to get the system back into a good state. </p>

<p>Since contracts can’t help us here, we deal with the complexity by leveraging the fact that different engineers have expertise in different parts of the system. By working together, we are pooling the expertise of the engineers. To pull this off, the engineers need to coordinate effectively. Enter the Basic Compact.</p>



<h2>The Basic Compact and requirements of coordination</h2>



<p>Gary Klein, Paul Feltovich and David Woods defined the <em>Basic Compact</em> in their paper <a href="http://jeffreymbradshaw.net/publications/Common_Ground_Single.pdf">Common Ground and Coordination in Joint Activity</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>We propose that joint activity requires a “Basic Compact” that constitutes a level of commitment for all parties to support the process of coordination. The Basic Compact is an agreement (usually tacit) to participate in the joint activity and to carry out the required coordination responsibilities.</p></blockquote>



<p>One example of a joint activity is… when engineers assemble to resolve an incident! In doing so, they enter a Basic Compact: to work together to get the system back into a stable state. Working together on a task requires coordination, and the paper authors list three primary requirements to coordinate effectively on a joint activity: <em>interpredictablity, common ground, </em>and <em>directability.</em></p>



<blockquote><p><em>The Basic Compact is also a commitment to ensure a reasonable level of interpredictability. Moreover, the Basic Compact requires that if one party intends to drop out of the joint activity, he or she must inform the other parties.</em></p></blockquote>



<p><em><strong>Intepredictability</strong></em> is about being able to reason about the behavior of other people, and behaving in such a way that your behavior is reasonable to others. As with the world of software contracts, being able to reason about behavior is critical. Unlike software contracts, here we reasoning about agents rather than artifacts, and those agents are also reasoning about us.</p>



<blockquote><p>The Basic Compact includes an expectation that the parties will repair faulty knowledge, beliefs and assumptions when these are detected.</p></blockquote>

Keeping mutual beliefs up to date requires coordination work.</figcaption></figure>



<p>During an incident, the responders need to maintain a shared understanding about information such as the known state of the system and what mitigations people are about to attempt. The authors use the term <em><strong>common ground</strong></em> to describe this shared understanding. Anyone who has been in in an on call rotation will find the following description familiar:</p>



<blockquote><p>All parties have to be reasonably confident that they and the others will carry out their responsibilities in the Basic Compact. In addition to repairing common ground, these responsibilities include such elements as acknowledging the receipt of signals, transmitting some construal of the meaning of the signal back to the sender, and indicating preparation for consequent acts. </p></blockquote>



<p>Maintaining common ground during an incident takes active effort on behalf of the participants, especially when we’re physically distributed and the situation is <em>dynamic</em>: where the system is not only in a bad state, but it’s in a bad state that’s changing over time. Misunderstandings can creep in, which the authors describe as a <em>common ground breakdown</em> that requires repair to make progress. </p>



<p>A common ground breakdown can mean the difference between a resolution time of minutes and hours. I recall an incident I was involved with, where an engineer made a relevant comment in Slack early on during the incident, and I missed its significance in the moment. In retrospect, I don’t know if the engineer who sent the message realized that I hadn’t properly processed its implications at the time.</p>



<blockquote><p>Directability refers to deliberate attempts to modify the actions of the other partners as conditions and priorities change.</p></blockquote>



<p> Imagine a software system has gone unhealthy in one geographical region, and engineer <em>X</em> begins to execute a failover to remediate. Engineer <em>Y</em> notices customer impact in the new region, and types into Slack, “We’re now seeing a problem in the region we’re failing into! Abort the failover!” This is an example of <em><strong>directability</strong></em>, which describes the ability of one agent to affect the behavior of another agent through signaling.</p>



<h2>Making contracts and compacts first class</h2>



<p>Both contracts and compacts are tools to help deal with complexity. People use <em>contracts</em> to help reason about the behavior of software artifacts. People use the <em>Basic Compact</em> to help reason about each other’s behavior when working together to resolve an incident.</p>



<p>I’d like to see both contracts and compacts get better treatment as first-class concerns. For contracts, there still isn’t a mainstream language with first-class support for preconditions and postconditions, although some non-Eiffel languages do support them  (<a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2009/12/21/clojures-pre-and-post/">Clojure</a> and <a href="https://dlang.org/articles/cppcontracts.html">D</a>, for example). There’s also <a href="https://docs.pact.io/">Pact</a>, which bills itself as a <em>contract testing</em> tool, that sounds interesting but I haven’t had a chance to play with.</p>



<p>For coordination (compacts), I’d like to see explicit recognition of the difficulty of coordination and the significant role it plays during incidents. One of the positive outcomes of the growing popularity of <em>resilience engineering</em> and the <a href="https://www.learningfromincidents.io/">learning from incidents in Software</a> movement is the recognition that coordination is a critical activity that we should spend more time learning about.</p>



<h2>Further reading and watching</h2>



<p><a href="http://jeffreymbradshaw.net/publications/Common_Ground_Single.pdf">Common Ground and Coordination in Joint Activity</a> is worth reading in its entirety. I only scratched the surface of the paper in this post. <a href="https://twitter.com/allspaw">John Allspaw</a> gave a great <a href="https://paperswelove.org/2016/video/john-allspaw-common-ground/">Papers We Love talk</a> on this paper.</p>



<p>Laura Maguire has done some recent PhD work on <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3380779">managing the hidden costs of coordination</a>. She also gave a <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/incident-command-system/">talk at QCon</a> on the subject.</p>



<p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1363742">Ten challenges for making automation a “team player” in joint human-agent activity</a> is a paper that explores the implications of building software agents that are capable of coordinating effectively with humans. </p>

		<p>The Seattle City Council is fast-tracking an emergency <a href="https://seattle.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4754242&amp;GUID=80536722-1338-426A-A175-DCF61CCAF08F">ordinance</a> that would require large grocery store companies to pay their Seattle-based retail workers an extra $4 per hour hazard pay through the end of the COVID-19 emergency.</p>
<p>Passing progressive, labor-friendly legislation is their strong suit. Doing the math and working out all the details… not so much.</p>


<p>Let’s cover the nuts and bolts of what this <a href="https://seattle.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4754242&amp;GUID=80536722-1338-426A-A175-DCF61CCAF08F">legislation</a> does.</p>
<p>It applies to all grocery stores in Seattle that are owned by a company with at least 500 employees worldwide, and where the store is either greater than 10,000 square feet and mainly sells groceries (like a Safeway or QFC) or greater than 85,000 square feet and at least 30% of the square footage is dedicated to groceries. It does not cover convenience stores, food marts, drug stores, or farmers markets. All employees of such a store who are covered by the city’s minimum wage ordinance must be given an additional $4 per hour; that would include a bookkeeper working in the back office (with the not-unreasonable logic that they share a break room with the other store employees, and are equally exposed to COVID).</p>
<p>The ordinance contains most of the usual rules and regulations in the Council’s labor ordinances:</p>

<li>There are record-keeping and notice requirements that the employer must follow;</li>
<li>The hazard pay must be listed as a separate line-item on an employee’s paystub, so it’s clear that they are getting it;</li>
<li>Employers may not game it by reducing employees’ regular pay;</li>
<li>The Office of Labor Standards will be tasked with enforcing it, with no budget increase for additional staff (OLS seems to be ok with this, because it overlaps at some level with the minimum wage and secure scheduling enforcement work);</li>
<li>Employers may not retaliate against employees who take action to ensure that they are getting paid the extra hazard pay;</li>
<li>The ordinance will stay on the books for three years after the hazard pay is no longer required, to allow for employees to file complaints for back pay they did not receive;</li>
<li>Employees have a private right of action to sue their employer if the hazard pay is not paid.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some special aspects of this ordinance:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ordinance specifies that the Council intends to review it after it has been in effect for four months, to see what the impact has been;</li>
<li>Employers who have already been giving their employees hazard pay or “appreciation pay” get credit for that against the $4 per hour — though they need to carefully document it all.</li>
<li>This is emergency legislation, so it would go into effect as soon as the Mayor signs it — and according to the sponsor, Councilmember Mosqueda, the Mayor has signaled her support for it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mosqueda is moving this bill through quickly. It had its one and only hearing last Friday, where the other four members of Mosqueda’s Finance and Housing Committee enthusiastically signed on as co-sponsors and quickly voted it out of committee. Normally any bill passed out of committee after noon on Thursday must wait an extra week before going on the agenda for final passage at a Monday afternoon Full Council meeting, but the committee and Council President Gonzalez suspended that rule so that it can be adopted Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://seattle.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;ID=9085981&amp;GUID=CEC0C318-BE51-4A5E-A626-2470446BD22D">42-page bill</a> begins with ten full pages of recitals and findings related to all of the context of COVID-19, Seattle’s labor laws, and the fact that several other cities (mostly in California) are contemplating similar bills right now. That last point is one that Mosqueda has repeatedly hammered on, naming Long Beach, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland as some of the other jurisdictions working along the same path. And in case you’re wondering, it is no coincidence that suddenly several cities are working on this; the efforts tie back to a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/windfall-profits-and-deadly-risks/">report</a> published last November by the Brookings Institution’s <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/program/metropolitan-policy-program/">Metropolitan Policy Program</a> called <em>“Windfall profits and deadly risks: How the biggest retail companies are compensating essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.”</em> The abstract for the report speaks for itself:</p>
<p><em>As the number of new COVID-19 infections smashes daily records, the pandemic has entered its deadliest phase yet. With a dark winter looming, millions of frontline essential retail workers face grave risks to their health, often for very low wages and without the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-covid-19-hazard-continues-but-the-hazard-pay-does-not-why-americas-frontline-workers-need-a-raise/">hazard pay</a> they were earning at the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, the biggest retail companies in the country continue to earn eye-popping profits.</em></p>
<p><em>In this report, we examine this inequality from two perspectives. As frontline retail workers at top companies face unprecedented risks on the job, what compensation should they earn, and what have they earned so far during the pandemic? And as those large retail companies earn unprecedented profits, how have they balanced investing in their workers and their profits?</em></p>
<div>
<p><em>We find that while top retail companies’ profits have soared during the pandemic, pay for their frontline workers—in most cases—has not. In total, the top retail companies in our analysis earned on average an extra $16.7 billion in profit this year compared to last—a stunning 40% increase—while stock prices are up an average of 33%. And with few exceptions, frontline retail workers have seen little of this windfall. The 13 companies we studied raised pay for their frontline workers by an average of just $1.11 per hour since the pandemic began—a 10% increase on top of wages that are often too low to meet a family’s basic needs. On average, it has been 133 days since the retail workers in our analysis last received any hazard pay.</em></p>
<p><em>At most of the biggest retail companies in America, the gap between the struggles and sacrifices of low-wage frontline workers and the wealth they create for their employers and shareholders is wider than ever.</em></p>
</div>
<p>The conclusion from the report is that all retail companies should be paying their frontline workers at least $2 per hour in hazard pay during the COVID pandemic, and preferably considerably more. It provides no hard data to support a specific per-hour rate, just a few quotes from retail workers who feel that their employers are raking in billions while they take all the risks, and that $2 an hour isn’t nearly enough.&nbsp; Mosqueda’s bill, for that matter, provides no data or math to justify a $4 per hour hazard pay increase, though she has mentioned several times that the other jurisdictions are contemplating either $4 or $5. After several days of trying to get an answer from Mosqueda as to how she arrived at $4, she finally dropped into my Twitter DM’s Friday night with the following response:</p>
<p><em><span>I think the answer is a few things: </span></em></p>
<p><em><span>1) early on lots of folks did hazard pay differently anywhere between $2-5. $4 is somewhere in between. </span></em></p>
<p><em><span>2) if average grocery wage is somewhere between 16-20 and average shift is 4-6 hours. Getting an extra $4 per hour roughly leaves you with an extra hour to hour and a half of pay added to each work shift. Like other cities have concluded, this seems like right compensation for extra donning a doffing time, sanitizing etc. that grocery workers have had to do in pandemic.</span></em></p>
<p>This seems like a stretch — other than donning and doffing masks and gloves to go to and from work at the beginning and ends of shifts, changing masks and gloves during a shift is time that employees are already being paid for. And this demonstrates the difficulty in this conversation: the more compelling argument for hazard pay is the hazard itself and the accompanying risk that retail workers face, but it’s challenging to put a dollar figure on that.</p>
<p>The Brookings report, on the other hand, spends almost all of its time trying to make the argument that retail companies are&nbsp; rapacious corporate monsters taking advantage of their employees while raking in billions and profiteering from the pandemic.&nbsp; To do so it leans on mid-2020 corporate earnings statements and stock prices, as well as potential stock buybacks, to paint a negative picture of the companies. But there are several reasons why the report’s analysis doesn’t hold up well under scrutiny, especially when trying to decide on a hazard-pay rate for grocery workers in Seattle:</p>
<ul>
<li>The report relies on figures for the entire retail sector, not just grocery stores. And as we’ll review later, the grocery sector is one of the lowest-profit segments of the retail business.</li>
<li>As mentioned earlier, it uses mid-year figures. 2020 was quite the roller-coaster ride, and some of the mid-year highs turned out to be short-term anomalies.</li>
<li>Stock prices are a poor indicator of profitability, especially during an economic upheaval when investors look for safe harbors more than profits.</li>
<li>Likewise, in an economic upheaval, stock buybacks mean something different. When companies are looking for good liquid investments for their cash (and 2020 was a great time to have cash on hand), but other short-term cash investments like money-market accounts have rock-bottom interest rates (because everyone wants to be in cash), your own company looks like a great investment. The company can either retire the shares and thus increase the value of the remaining outstanding shares, or keep them around, use them for acquisition deals, or sell them off to raise raise cash later. Anyone who thinks that companies do stock buybacks only to artificially inflate their stock price doesn’t understand how public corporations work.</li>
<li>The report’s authors clearly haven’t done the full math on how much a $4/hour hazard pay increase will cost — and how that compares to the company’s profits.</li>
<li>The report uses national wage figures, when in fact Seattle already has a much higher minimum wage in place — higher than any of the other cities that Mosqueda cites as contemplating a new hazard pay requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p>So let’s dive in.</p>
<hr>

<p>There are three major retail grocery chains operating in Seattle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kroger, which owns Fred Meyer and QFC;</li>
<li>Albertsons, which owns Safeway and Albertsons;</li>
<li>Costco.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the ones …</p></div></article></main></section></div></div></div>

        <section>
            <p>Dropbox is always one of the first things I install when I setup a new computer - I have come to rely on it for storing important documents, photos and media that I can then access from anywhere. Recently my Dropbox subscription expired, and instead of renewing I decided to take a shot at replacing it with a homemade solution, and in this article I’m going to be walking you through how to do it yourself.</p>

<p>Here’s an outline of what we’re going to do:</p>

<h3 id="1-choosing-a-location-to-store-files-remotely">1. Choosing a location to store files remotely</h3>

<p>First, we have to decide where we want our files ultimately stored. When you use Dropbox, your files are of course stored within their storage infrastructure, which is what you’re paying for.</p>

<p>This was a simple decision for me, as I am already renting a few private servers with DigitalOcean that host my work. A private server, or VPS, is the perfect place for us to store our remote files, and while there are other storage solutions that could work, the power and flexibility of a full-fledged VPS will be crucial later on in this process.</p>

<p>If you don’t already have access to a VPS instance, setting one up takes just a few minutes and there are many providers to choose from. <a href="https://m.do.co/c/af8074d7d775">DigitalOcean</a> is my go-to choice, and you can rent a basic VPS starting at $5 per month.</p>

<p>You’ll need to get your VPS and SSH configured before moving on - <a href="https://sidia.li/2020/03/05/creating-configuring-ubuntu-vps/">follow this guide on how to do that</a>, and then return here to pick up where you left off.</p>

<p>If you already have SSH access to a VPS, or once you have SSH access setup and running smoothly on a new instance, we can move forward to picking out our storage location. I went with <code>/home/adam/docs</code> - go ahead and create your directory now. Be sure to replace the path <code>/home/adam/docs</code> in the following steps with the path you have picked for your directory.</p>

<p>Your storage location will then look like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">&lt;IP&gt;:/home/adam/docs</code></pre></figure>

<p>where <code>&lt;IP&gt;</code> is the IP address of your VPS instance.</p>

<h3 id="2-setting-up-a-sync-mechanism-between-storage-locations">2. Setting up a sync mechanism between storage locations</h3>

<p>Just like when deciding where to store our files, there are several options for how we can proceed in actually syncing them between our local filesystem and the remore VPS filesystem.</p>

<p>One popular option for this task would be <code>rsync</code>.</p>

<p><code>rsync</code> is a Unix utility for copying files and directories between systems. It can also be used to setup synchronization between two directories in different locations - just what we’re looking for.</p>

<p>However, there’s another option we can go with that you’re probably already familiar with: Git.</p>

<p>Git is a powerful cross-platform protocol for synchronizing, and more specifically versioning, files across multiple peers. By using Git over <code>rsync</code>, we will be able to do things like recover or roll back our files and manage file versions across multiple devices.</p>

<p>Let’s initialize our remote storage directory as a git repository. Make sure that you’re logged into your VPS, and run the following commands (don’t forget to swap paths as needed):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> <span>cd</span> /home/adam/docs
<span>$ </span> git init <span>--bare</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now, we will be able to check files into our git repository from our local system via git over SSH! Pretty sweet.</p>

<p>Exit your VPS and choose a location on your local machine to “install” or checkout your new file service with the following commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> <span>cd</span> /path/to/local/dir/
<span>$ </span> git clone &lt;USER&gt;@&lt;IP&gt;:/home/adam/docs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ve finished setting up our repository and are ready to start syncing.</p>

<h3 id="3-configuring-remote-update-to-trigger-on-change-in-local-files">3. Configuring remote update to trigger on change in local files</h3>

<p>Listening for changes to a filesystem is an interesting challenge, and what we’ll need to do in order to trigger an update to remote whenever our files are changed.</p>

<p>While each operating system exposes a different event notification engine, such as inotify on Linux-based systems, there are again several options of cross-platform libraries that have been created to listen to and interact with those notification engines agnostically.</p>

<h4 id="entr">Entr</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/eradman/entr/">Entr</a> is one such library, and is available for all major operating systems. I started out with Entr as I found the syntax to be very approachable over the alternatives.</p>

<p>Entr worked great for all but one use case, and that was listening for additions of new files or directories. There is a specific mode you can run Entr in built for this purpose using the <code>-d</code> argument, but unfortunately I was unable to get that to work as expected- see this issue on Github.</p>

<h4 id="fswatch">FSWatch</h4>

<p>The next best option I found was <a href="https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch">FSWatch</a>, seemingly the more mature of the two projects with a slightly more complex CLI syntax, also cross-platform, so I gave that a shot.</p>

<p>You can install FSWatch with the following commands:</p>

<h6 id="on-macos">On macOS</h6>


<h6 id="on-ubuntu-1804">On Ubuntu 18.04</h6>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The <code>fswatch</code> package is only available through the Ubuntu 18.04 official repositories. If you are running a less up-to-date version, you will need to update to 18.04 at a minimum before being able to install <code>fswatch</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you have FSWatch installed, we are going to create a script to be executed when changes are detected in our repository. In your repository or anothr preferred location, create a file called <code>sync-repo.sh</code> and copy in the following script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span>repo</span><span>=</span>/path/to/your/local/dir

<span>cd</span> <span>$repo</span>
git add <span>.</span>
git commit <span>-m</span><span>"auto-triggered sync"</span>
git pull origin master
git push origin master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that, run this command to make the sync script executable:</p>



<p>Now, using our sync script, we can run this FSWatch command to begin listening for changes in our repo directory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> fswatch <span>-o</span> /path/to/local/directory <span>--event</span> Created <span>--event</span> Updated <span>--event</span> Removed <span>--event</span> Renamed <span>--event</span> OwnerModified <span>--event</span> AttributeModified <span>--event</span> MovedFrom <span>--event</span> MovedTo <span>--exclude</span> <span>".git"</span> | xargs <span>-n1</span> <span>-I</span><span>{}</span> ./sync-repo.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What is this mouthful, you ask? Let’s break down how we’re configuring FSWatch to run:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>-o /path/to/local/directory</code> tells FSWatch what directory to listen to events in.</li>
  <li><code>--event &lt;EVENT-NAME&gt;</code> tells FSWatch to filter output to only this type of event. You can use multiple event flags with FSWatch to listen for multiple event types, as we are doing.</li>
  <li><code>--exclude ".git"</code> tells FSwatch to ignore the Git source directory and just to sync everything else.</li>
  <li>we finish off by piping updates from FSWatch into <code>xargs</code> which then processes and runs our <code>sync-repo</code> script.</li>
</ul>

<p>After running FSWatch with the above command, we’re ready to give it a try: go ahead and create or copy in a test file into your local repository directory, and you should immediately see output from FSWatch regarding a new git commit! Nicely done. Now, whenever FSWatch is running with the above command, any changes in your local directory will automatically be synced to the remote repository.</p>

<p>Of course, the whole point of this post is to sync your files between computers. If you have a second computer available, go ahead and checkout your git repository with the URL we used to check it out above, and then install and start FSWatch with the same command. Now that machine should also be in sync with any changes to your repository!</p>

<h3 id="4-configuring-local-updates-to-trigger-on-change-in-remote-files">4. Configuring local updates to trigger on change in remote files</h3>

<p>We are missing one last part, though, and it just happens to be the trickiest part. Our remote repository is now being updated whenever our files change, that’s great. But what about updates to our local files when the remote repository is updated? Right now, the only updates that our local repository is aware of is ones that have originated from that same computer. We need to setup a mechanism to push updates to all local copies of the repository whenever the remote repository changes.</p>

<h6 id="git-hooks">Git Hooks</h6>

<p>To do this, we’re going to utilize Git hooks, a built-in feature of Git that allows us to execute a script upon a specified event in the given repository. We’re going to take advantage of the <code>post-receive</code> hook, which will execute after any new updated has been fully received and checked into the git remote repository.</p>

<p>Log into your VPS, navigate to your git repository, and then into the <code>hooks</code> subdirectory, and create the <code>post-receive</code> script file with the following commands:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> <span>cd</span> /home/adam/docs
<span>$ </span> <span>cd </span>hooks
<span>$ </span> <span>touch </span>post-receive
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this script, we will want to 1) SSH into any local clones of our repository, and then 2) pull the latest updates in from the remote repository.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: You will need to assign each one a static IP address to be able to SSH into them from outside of your home network. If you don’t already have a static IP, you can get one a few different ways - <a href="">follow the steps in this article</a> to setup a static IP address for your computer, and then return back here to finish up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you’re ready, copy this script into your new <code>post-receive</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/bash</span>

<span># Home Computer</span>

<h3>Anna Novakov and T. Novakov</h3>
<p><em>like a yellow silken scarf, the thick fog hangs along the quay[1]</em></p>
<p>In the 1880s, London’s frequent and well-documented episodes of fog were a phenomenon unique to England’s most densely populated, diverse, and industrialized urban center. The spectacular nature of the embankment fog, often described by eyewitnesses as changeable and even colorful, caught the imagination of many artists and writers who saw in these atmospheric manifestations a symbol of modernity and the role of industrialization on an evolving urban space. While the illusive city, shrouded in winter fog, created the perfect backdrop for mysterious, criminal activity, it also proved to be a compelling inspiration for those who read the fog as a more positive symbol of London’s cosmopolitan status. In this essay, we seek to interrelate some artistic and literary references to the fog with contemporary explanations addressing the causes of this atmospheric phenomenon. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we hope to shed light on the physical, artistic and even psychological implications of Victorian air pollution.[2]</p>
<p>Expansions of industrial activity during the later half of the 19th century resulted in frequent and severe air pollution episodes. In London, the smoke that billowed as a result of domestic and industrial coal burning began mixing with existing natural fog. Charles Dickens wrote in Bleak House that “smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes –- gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of the sun.”[3] The resulting smog (word coined from smoke + fog), was often sited by both visitors and locals as an optical experience unique to London. These low-laying fogs reduced visibility in the city to less than a mile while resulting in the loss of up to fifty percent of the sunshine in the winter months.[4] Thomas Hardy mentions it is in his 1900 poem “The Darkling Rush” as</p>
<p>I leant upon a coppice gate,<br>
When Frost was spectre-gray,<br>
And Winter’s dregs made desolate<br>
The weakening eye of day.<br>
The tangled bine-stems scored the sky<br>
Like strings of broken lyres,<br>
And all mankind that haunted nigh<br>
Had sought their household fires.[5]</p>
<p>While writer Arthur Symons wrote that “In London, men work as if in darkness, scarcely seeing their own hands . . . and not knowing the meaning of their labour.”[6] French writer Joris-Karl Huyseman likewise wrote in 1884 that “A rainy, colossal London smelling of molten metal and of soot, ceaselessly streaming and smoking in the fog now spread out before his eyes . . . All this was transpiring in vast warehouses along the river banks which were bathed by the muddy and dull water of an imaginary Thames . . . while trains rushed past at full speed or rumbled underground uttering horrible cries and vomiting waves of smoke, and while, through every street, monstrous and gaudy and infamous advertisements flared through the eternal twilight.”[7]</p>
<p>In Jayati Gupta’s essay “London Through Alien Eyes,” published in Literary London: Interdisciplinary Studies in the Representation of London, he references Madame Krishnabhabini Das’ 1880s London experiences. She noted that “this sort of fog persists through the day and assumes different hues – sometimes ashen – sometimes black – sometimes yellow.” Another eye witness L.C.W. Bonacina gave this insightful description of yellow fog’s evolution “A really bad nineteenth century fog appeared early in the morning as a thick white mist, like the country fog, only dirtier. With the lighting of the fires it would soon become yellow and pungent, irritating the throat and eyes, till midday the continued outpouring of chimney products would have turned the fog a sooty brownish black causing the darkness of night.” Furthermore he added that, “During summer months major fogs were virtually unknown in the nineteenth century just as they are in the twentieth.”[8]</p>
<p>These, and other more contemporary reports most often described the yellow hue prevalent in London fog. Oscar Wilde noted the yellow hue in his poem “Impression du Matin”:</p>
<p>The Thames nocturne of blue and gold<br>
Changed to a Harmony in grey:<br>
A barge with ochre-coloured hay<br>
Dropt from the wharf: and chill and cold<br>
The yellow fog came creeping down<br>
The bridges, till the houses’ walls<br>
Seemed changed to shadows and St. Paul’s<br>
Loomed like a bubble o’er the town.[9]</p>
<p>Bonacina’s chromatic observations can certainly be credited to the predominance of domestic coal burning. Tars from low temperature coal combustion in the morning were yellow. The yellow tar, created in the morning, was soluble in fog water and thus colored the fog droplets creating the appearance of chromatic fog. Later in the day, emissions from industry, steam locomotives and ships increased coinciding with the darkening fogs. Tar produced in these higher temperatures took on a dark brown coloration. Atmospheric chemist Peter Brimblecombe proposed the following three possible origins for the yellow fog: (i) light scattering by smoke particles above the fog such that it was illuminated by yellowish light, (ii) the gas and weak electric light gave the fog a yellowish hue at night, and (iii) tarry compounds actually colored the fog, giving preference to the latter possibility.[10]</p>
<p>Victorian writers, noted with some frequency additional chromatic effects produced by the modern fog. In 1899, an article was published in The Artist magazine that read “There’s nothing to be seen like it ever – in any town in Europe. They say it’s due to the smoke and it may be; but just look at it. Look at the purple and crimson, the scarlet and gold . . . until with just the tiniest fleck of pink it sinks into the palest green.”[11] Aaron Watson, in an article in the Magazine of Art, suggests that the city “enfolds all ugliness in a purple haze.”[12] Charles Dickens in his novel Our Mutual Friend notes that “Even in the surrounding country it was a foggy day, but there the fog was great, whereas in London it was, at about the boundary line, dark yellow, and a little within it brown, and then browner, and then browner, until at the heart of the City — which call Saint Mary Axe – it was rustic black.”[13]</p>
<p>Visual artists, such as French painter Claude Monet, witnessed the yellow fogs as well as a variety of additional chromatic atmospheric effects. For Monet, London’s varied fogs were a spectacular manifestation of turn-of-century city life -– an optical phenomenon that he captured in a well documented and frequently referenced series of canvases.</p>
<p>London was a magical place for Monet. He beamed “I so love London! But I love it only in winter. It’s nice in summer with its parks, but nothing like it is in winter with the fog, for without the fog, London wouldn’t be a beautiful city. It’s the fog that gives it its magnificent breadth. Those massive, regular blocks become grandiose within that mysterious cloak.”[14] In 1900 he added that “The weather is magnificent but unsettled . . . I can’t begin to describe a day as wonderful as this. One [colored] marvel, after another each lasting less than five minutes, it was enough to drive one mad. No country could be more extraordinary for a painter.”[15]</p>
<p>The constantly changing chromatic effects of London’s fog were unusual and bear little resemblance to contemporary atmospheric phenomena. To understand this unique development it is vital to discuss the evidence for these chromatic fogs. Taking into account the lack of scientific, measurement-based observations, we would like to employ artistic production, such as Monet’s Thames series, as indirect evidence –- source material that forms the basis for a broader explanatory discussion of this form of air pollution.</p>
<p>Between 1898 and 1901, Monet made numerous extended trips to London. Working from an upscale Savoy Hotel suite, he created numerous paintings of the Waterloo and Charing Cross Bridges. As an accomplished and sensitive colorist, Monet found himself captivated by London’s fog and its spectacular optical appearance, which he referred to as l’enveloppe. Of particular relevance to this essay is Monet’s description “The fog in London assumes all sorts of colors; there are black, brown, yellow, green, [and] purple fogs.”[16] Was the colored fog depicted in these paintings and referenced in written accounts a subjective interpretation of the London’s cityscape or documentary evidence of London’s timely and transient atmospheric effects?</p>
<p>These hazy, colorful paintings are certainly marvelous Impressionist interpretations of the city’s skyline. The chromatic effects that Monet was trying to capture in the bridge scenes were fleeting and momentary. The changeable weather conditions of the morning fog and winter color palette, forced the artist to work on stacks of canvases at the same time. Monet recalled that “At the Savoy Hotel . . . from which I looked at my points of view, I had up to a hundred canvases under way –- of the same subject. By searching among the sketches feverishly, I chose one of them that didn’t differ too much from what I saw; despite everything, I altered it completely. When work was finished, I would notice, in moving my canvases, that I had overlooked precisely the one that would have suited me best and which I had at hand.”[17] Monet’s artistic output and his frantic attempts to capture fleeting effects are visual evidence of the changing and colorful atmospheric effects he witnessed.</p>
<p>For Monet, the Waterloo Bridge took on many manifestations depending on the time of day and visual effects of the fog. The bridge appears as mauve semi-circles in the Chicago Art Institute’s version of the Waterloo Bridge. The painting foreground focuses our eye on surface effects of undulating droplets of colored water. Receding into the background, factory chimneys reinforce the arches of the bridge while further bisecting Monet’s composition. …</p></div></article></div></div></section></div></div></div>

A <strong>Platformer</strong> investigation has found:</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Signal appears to have more than 40 million users, up from approximately 20 million last month</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The company is actively developing features related to user names and cryptocurrency payments, potentially creating new avenues for abuse</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>At least one employee quit Signal in recent weeks over concerns that the 6-year-old company does not have a content policy and has resisted developing one</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton has become heavily involved in daily operations, interviewing engineers and writing code</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>CEO Moxie Marlinspike tells Platformer: “The thing about software is that you never can fully anticipate everything. We just have to be willing to iterate.”</strong></p></li></ul><p>On January 6th, WhatsApp users around the world began seeing a pop-up message notifying them of upcoming changes to the service’s privacy policy. The changes were designed to enable businesses to send and store messages to WhatsApp’s 2 billion-plus users, but they came with an ultimatum: agree by February 8th, or you can no longer use the app.</p><p>The resulting furor sparked a backlash that led Facebook-owned WhatsApp to delay the policy from taking effect until May. In the meantime, though, tens of millions of users began seeking alternatives to Facebook’s suite of products. Among the biggest beneficiaries has been Signal, the encrypted messaging app whose development is funded by a nonprofit organization. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/signal-brian-acton-talks-about-exploding-growth-monetization-and-whatsapp-data-sharing-outrage/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">according to one research firm</a>, the six-year-old app had about 20 million users worldwide. But in a 12-hour period the Sunday after WhatsApp’s privacy policy update began, Signal added another 2 million users, an employee familiar with the matter told me. Days of temporary outages followed.</p><p>The pace has hardly relented since. Signal leapt to No. 1 in the app stores of 70 countries, and it continues to rank near the top of most of them, including the United States. While the company won’t confirm the size of its user base, a second employee told me the app has now surpassed 40 million users globally. And while Signal still has a small fraction of the market for mobile messaging — Telegram, another upstart messenger, <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1352368555711365121">says it added 90 million active users in January alone</a> —&nbsp;the rapid growth has been a cause for excitement inside the small distributed team that makes the app.</p><p>Adding millions of users has served as a vindication for a company that has sought to build a healthier internet by adopting different incentives than most Silicon Valley companies.</p><p>“We're organized as a nonprofit because we feel like the way the internet currently works is insane,” CEO Moxie Marlinspike told me. “And a lot of that insanity, to us, is the result of bad business models that produce bad technology. And they have bad societal outcomes.” Signal’s mission, by contrast, is to promote privacy through end-to-end encryption, without any commercial motive.</p><p>But Signal’s rapid growth has also been a cause for concern. In the months leading up to and following the 2020 US presidential election, Signal employees raised questions about the development and addition of new features that they fear will lead the platform to be used in dangerous and even harmful ways. But those warnings have largely gone unheeded, they told me, as the company has pursued a goal to hit 100 million active users and generate enough donations to secure Signal’s long-term future.</p><p>Employees worry that, should Signal fail to build policies and enforcement mechanisms to identify and remove bad actors, the fallout could bring more negative attention to encryption technologies from regulators at a time when their existence is threatened around the world.</p><p>“The world needs products like Signal — but they also need Signal to be thoughtful,” said Gregg Bernstein, a former user researcher who left the organization this month over his concerns. “It’s not only that Signal doesn’t have these policies in place. But they’ve been resistant to even considering what a policy might look like.”</p><p>Interviews with current and former employees, plus leaked screenshots of internal deliberations, paint a portrait of a company that is justly proud of its role in promoting privacy while also willfully dismissing concerns over the potential misuses of its service. Their comments raise the question of whether a company conceived as a rebuke to data-hungry, ad-funded communication tools like Facebook and WhatsApp will really be so different after all.</p><p><strong>II.</strong></p><p>Like a lot of problems, this one started with an imperative familiar to most businesses: growth.</p><p>Encrypted messaging has been a boon to activists, dissidents, journalists, and marginalized groups around the world. Not even Signal itself can see their messages —&nbsp;much less law enforcement or national security agencies. The app saw a surge in usage during last year’s protests for racial justice, even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280112/signal-face-blurring-tool-ios-android-update">adding a tool to automatically blur faces</a> in photos to help activists more safely share images of the demonstrations. This kind of growth, one that supported progressive causes, was exciting to Signal’s roughly 30-member team.</p><p>“That's the kind of use case that we really want to support,” Marlinspike told me. “People who want more control over their data and how it's used — and who want to exist outside the gaze of tech companies.”</p><p>On October 28th, <a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-links/">Signal added group links</a>, a feature that has become increasingly common to messaging apps. With a couple of taps, users could begin creating links that would allow anyone to join a chat in a group as large as 1,000 people. And because the app uses end-to-end encryption, Signal itself would have no record of the group’s title, its members, or the image the group chose as its avatar. At the same time, the links make it easy for activists to recruit large numbers of people onto Signal simultaneously, with just a few taps.</p><p>But as the US presidential election grew closer, some Signal employees began raising concerns that group links could be abused. On September 29th, during a debate, President Trump had told the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys to “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-chris-wallace-0b32339da25fbc9e8b7c7c7066a1db0f">stand back and stand by</a>.” During an all-hands meeting, an employee asked Marlinspike how the company would respond if a member of the Proud Boys or another extremist organization posted a Signal group chat link publicly in an effort to recruit members and coordinate violence.</p><p>“The response was: if and when people start abusing Signal or doing things that we think are terrible, we'll say something,” said Bernstein, who was in the meeting, conducted over video chat. “But until something is a reality, Moxie's position is he's not going to deal with it.”</p><p>Bernstein (disclosure: a former colleague of mine at Vox Media), added, “You could see a lot of jaws dropping. That’s not a strategy —&nbsp;that’s just hoping things don’t go bad.”&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike’s response, he told me in a conversation last week, was rooted in the idea that because Signal employees cannot see the content on their network, the app does not need a robust content policy. Like almost all apps, its terms of service state that the product cannot be used to violate the law. Beyond that, though, the company has sought to take a hands-off approach to moderation.</p><p>“We think a lot on the product side about what it is that we're building, how it's used, and the kind of behaviors that we're trying to incentivize,” Marlinspike told me. “The overriding theme there is that we don't want to be a media company. We’re not algorithmically amplifying content. We don’t have access to the content. And even within the app, there are not a lot of opportunities for amplification.”</p><p>At the same time, employees said, Signal is developing multiple tools simultaneously that could be ripe for abuse. For years, the company has faced complaints that its requirement that people use real phone numbers to create accounts <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9kaxge/how-to-use-signal-without-giving-out-your-phone-number-a-gendered-security-issue">raises privacy and security concerns</a>. And so Signal has begun working on an alternative: letting people create unique usernames. But usernames (and display names, should the company add those, too) could enable people to impersonate others — a scenario the company has not developed a plan to address, despite completing much of the engineering work necessary for the project to launch.</p><p>Signal has also been actively exploring the addition of payments into the app. Internally, this has been presented as a way to help people in developing nations transfer funds more easily. But other messaging apps, including Facebook and China’s WeChat, have pursued payments as a growth strategy.</p><p>An effort from Facebook to develop a cryptocurrency, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Facebook%20announced%20that%20Calibra%20has%20a%20new%20name%2C%20Novi.&amp;text=The%20Libra%20blockchain%20is%20supposed,%E2%80%9Cvia%E2%80%9D%20(way).">now known as Diem</a>, has been <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/11/05/libras-regulatory-hurdles-appear-taller-after-house-hearing/">repeatedly derailed</a> by skeptical regulators.</p><p>Marlinspike has served as an adviser to MobileCoin, a cryptocurrency built on the Stellar blockchain designed to make payments simple and secure —&nbsp;and, potentially, impossible to trace. “The idea of MobileCoin is to build a system that hides everything from everyone,” <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/">Wired</a></em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/"> wrote of the project in 2017</a>. “These components make MobileCoin more resistant to surveillance, whether it's coming from a government or a criminal.”</p><p>People I spoke with told me they regard the company’s exploration of cryptocurrency as risky since it could invite more bad actors onto the platform and attract regulatory scrutiny from world leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>Marlinspike played down the potential of crypto payments in Signal, saying only that the company had done some “design explorations” around the idea. But significant engineering resources have been devoted to developing MobileCoin integrations in recent quarters, former employees said.&nbsp;</p><p>“If we did decide we wanted to put payments into Signal, we would try to think really carefully about how we did that,” Marlinspike said. “It’s hard to be totally hypothetical.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>III.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Signal’s growth imperatives are driven in part by its unusual corporate structure. The app is funded by the Signal Foundation, which was created in 2018 with a $50 million loan from WhatsApp co-founder …</p></div></div>

The printer just works, there’s nothing more to add.</p><div><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://whynot.fail/img/1a1ff1fb-250b-48bc-a1aa-fe6da47cb05c_hu4eb9d5740a354d14096c2353ceda08ff_1440909_858x480_fit_q75_box.jpg" alt="Prusa holding a poker face after the Ender 3 told it what it went through"></p><a href="https://whynot.fail/img/1a1ff1fb-250b-48bc-a1aa-fe6da47cb05c_hu4eb9d5740a354d14096c2353ceda08ff_1440909_1920x1080_fit_q75_box.jpg" itemprop="contentUrl"></a><figcaption><p>Prusa holding a poker face after the Ender 3 told it what it went through</p></figcaption></figure></div><p>But getting through so much, I can now fully appreciate my printer and do the best I can to keep it happy and a big part of that is to buy good quality filament (I use Prusament and Devil Design) and keep it dry (around 20% humidity and below 60C, for almost all filaments and materials).</p><h2 id="how-to-keep-the-filament-dry">How to keep the filament dry</h2><p>There are many ready made solutions to keep your filaments dry. Either purpose-built <a href="https://www.printdry.com/">filament dryers</a> or generic vertical food dehydrators to dry a filament before use or after misplacing it inside your pool, but they don’t take care of the permanent/long term storage.</p><p>There are also filament containers, which take care of storage as well. This is the most used type as you just set the target humidity and forget it. Of course there are both <a href="https://www.printdry.com/">ready made</a> storage solutions and <a href="https://blog.prusaprinters.org/dryboxes-and-alternative-spool-holders-not-only-for-multimaterial-upgrade_30525/">DIY</a>.</p><p>Dehydrating filament boils (hehe) down to more or less the following building blocks:</p><ul><li>Moisture absorbers (silica gel, the small non-edible salt packs that you get with electronics)</li><li>Heat - just heat it up and moisture will evaporate</li><li>Dehydrator - no idea how they work, so I’ll market it as “magic boxes that lower humidity”</li><li>(There’s also vacuum that I just learned at the time of writing but not at the time of project planning. More info: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqQRN9TUw08" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqQRN9TUw08">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqQRN9TUw08</a>)</li></ul><p>I wanted something that integrates with my lab (no random plastic containers here and there) and be dirt cheap with stuff I had around - I had just spent a lot on a new printer and my lab starts to seem like a garbage disposal place from the various random parts I’ve collected over the years for “future projects” - lets make this one of them. So it’s set, I’ll build something on my own.</p><h2 id="what-do-we-have-around">What do we have around</h2><p>The printer was laying on a perfectly sized nightstand and it was a very good fit. The filaments were placed on the first drawer and random prints awaiting use as well as some spare parts were sitting on the second drawer. I just needed to somehow create a controlled climate on the first drawer.</p><p>My target was to use as much “building blocks” as possible (aka have around), so heat &amp; silica gel.</p><p>Silica gel requires no further explanation - as packages from all over the world arrive at your house, you’ll gonna build a big stock of them and never run out.</p><p>For the heat part though, I took an interesting turn: Use the small heatbed I had when I tried to make a <a href="https://whynot.fail/factory/plastic-v01/">delta printer</a> and then spent thousands in therapy for PTSD.</p><p>The electronics to control the heatbed was the easiest part - I instantly knew I’d use one of the thousands ESP8266 WeMos Minis I had lying around (I had no need for WiFi or the horsepower, but it’s a buck each and I had thousands), with a DHT22 temperature &amp; humidity sensor and probably a screen to have a view on what’s going on</p><p>So the plan was the following:</p><ul><li>Make the temperature/humidity controller using the ESP</li><li>Install the heatbed and wire it to the ESP</li><li>Throw in silica gel bags</li></ul><h2 id="building-the-climate-controller">Building the climate controller</h2><p>For this recipe you’re going to need:</p><ul><li>WeMos Mini</li><li>DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor (the white one, the blue is garbage)</li><li>PCD8544 screen (Nokia 3310 screen)</li><li>Some wire</li><li>(optionally) WeMos Dual Base</li></ul><p>Lego time! 🙂</p><p>3 minutes later I had both my debugging and (almost) finalized hardware.

Just buy a bunch of WeMos shields from aliexpress for a couple of euros each and never go back. It’s fun!</p><p>I should point out that for no apparent reason, my obsession kicked in and I “had” to make a shield for the 5V voltage regulator (I wanted to feed from the same 12V line that I was gonna feed the bed) and a “backpack” shield on the relay that breaks out 2 pins to connect the bed thermistor to. I don’t know why I didn’t use a breadboard. My overengineering could not be tamed.</p><h2 id="programming-the-climate-controller">Programming the climate controller</h2><p>Another cheat mode I used in this project apart from WeMos is <a href="https://esphome.io/">ESPHome</a>. I love this lil fella!</p><p>ESPHome is a firmware for the ESP family that transforms it to an IoT device. It’s the programming equivalent of Lego (TM) for sensor-based projects in YAML. Definitely check it out - it’s easier than you think and it does not need (but is able to talk to) any other home automation services, devices or bridges.</p><p>I say that it’s a cheat as there’s no need for WiFi capability per-se (although it’s nice to watch the humidity on your phone) but I didn’t NOT want it and ESPHome made the whole project much easier and give the ability to program/update it over the air for free (as in beer, freedom, time, the boobs and the rest). Noice.</p><p>The resulting YAML I used (reading the thermistor was a tad tricky and I was stupid enough to lose the forum link that explained it):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="yaml"><span>esphome</span>:

    <p>Over the past several weeks, GameStop stock has traded more like a cryptocurrency than a failing mall-based retailer.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/gme.png" alt="GameStop"></p>

<p>What is going on here?</p>

<p>In one sentence: Institutional investors short GameStop (i.e., the prevailing wisdom, at least until the past few weeks) are playing a game of chicken with retail investors &amp; contrarian institutions who are long. [1]</p>

<h3 id="the-current-situation">The Current Situation</h3>

<p>GameStop is a video game retailer; it has been in decline for several years now. Video games have moved to an online, direct-to-consumer distribution model. Foot traffic in malls (where most GameStops are located) was down even before COVID; many mall-based retailers are struggling.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, over the course of 2020 this led to GameStop becoming one of the <a href="https://www.highshortinterest.com/">most shorted stocks</a> on Wall Street.</p>

<p>However, there were early signs that GameStop was undervalued. Michael Burry (of <em>The Big Short</em> fame) <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-michael-burry-big-short-stock-next-gen-discs-2019-8">took a large long position in 2019</a>, claiming video game discs are not entirely dead. In August 2020, Roaring Kitty (a.k.a. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/">u/DeepFuckingValue</a> on Reddit) published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alntJzg0Um4">video</a> detailing why GameStop was a good play based on its fundamentals – a future short squeeze would just be the icing on the cake.</p>

<p>On January 11th, Ryan Cohen (founder of <a href="https://www.chewy.com/">Chewy</a>, which sold to PetSmart for $3.35 billion), <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chewy-co-founder-joins-gamestops-board-after-pushing-overhaul-11610378574">joined GameStop’s board</a> after his investment firm built up a 10% stake in the company. At this point, retail investors, especially those on the popular subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/">Wall Street Bets</a> went crazy. They highlighted that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/">GameStop was now a growth play</a>. It is now led by a previously successful founder, its online business is growing at a 300% rate, and it is in the process of turning around its core business. [2] As such, GameStop should be valued at a Venture Capital multiple of 10x+ revenue, rather than a measly 0.5x revenue.</p>

<p>This narrative is compelling. Despite short sellers warning otherwise, GameStop has continued to climb in price. All of the GameStop options issued (with a high strike price of $60) were in the money on Friday (1/22/2021), trigging a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2txra/that_was_a_margin_call/gk87z17/">gamma squeeze</a> as institutions who had written the options rushed to cover their positions. GameStop closed Friday at $65.01.</p>

<p>On Monday (1/25/2021), GameStop opened at $96.73, spiked at $159.18 (likely because of another gamma squeeze), [3] then crashed with pressure from institutional shorts, closing at $76.79 (still up 18% day-over-day).</p>

<p>But the bulls aren’t finished with GameStop. These gamma squeezes are nothing compared to what will be coming: the near-mythical “Infinity Squeeze”. Most famously seen with <a href="https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/">Volkswagen in 2008</a>, when short sellers are forced to cover their positions due to a margin call, the price of the stock rapidly rises (hypothetically to infinity) since the number of shares shorted exceeds the number of shares available to buy.</p>

<h3 id="the-allure-of-wall-street-bets">The Allure of Wall Street Bets</h3>

<p>Can a subreddit comprised of retail investors really move the market like this? I doubt it – all of the big swings in this stock have been caused by institutions. What this subreddit does is <strong>control the narrative</strong>.</p>

<p>First unveiled to the mainstream finance world in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-26/reddit-s-profane-greedy-traders-are-shaking-up-the-stock-market">February 2020 Bloomberg article</a>, Wall Street Bets is profane (as I’m sure you’ve noticed if you clicked any of the links in this post). But Wall Street Bets isn’t some sinister, market-manipulating entity. Rather, it is a virtual water cooler for individual retail investors to post memes – and emojis, oh so many emojis – about their investments.</p>

<p>Reading Wall Street Bets feels like the discussion at a middle school cafeteria table circa 2000. Redditors on Wall Street Bets (who refer to themselves affectionately as “autists” or “retards”) [4] encourage one another to have “diamond hands” (💎 🤲), the will to stay strong and not sell a stock when things are going poorly. Contrast this with the “paper hands” (🧻 🤲) of those who are weak-willed and sell a stock based on market sentiment. Companies are headed “to the moon” (🚀). Bears are not mentioned without the adjective “gay” (🌈 🐻). Self-deprecating cuckold references to “my wife’s boyfriend” abound.</p>

<p>Despite this language (or perhaps because of it), Wall Street Bets is one of the most entertaining and informative places on the internet. People post meaningful analysis of companies that are undervalued and why they are investing. Browsing the subreddit, you get a crash course on concepts that you would otherwise learn only at a buy-side firm or working as an options trader: EBITDA multiple, book value, delta hedging, implied volatility.</p>

<p>But the most compelling aspect of Wall Street Bets is in its name: the bets. The ability to gain (or lose) a life-changing amount of money – with screenshots to prove it – creates an environment similar to that of the casino floor. And if Wall Street Bets is the casino floor, then Wall Street itself is the house.</p>

<p>The same emotion that caused us to root for the thieves in <em>Ocean’s 11</em> is what makes Wall Street Bets so enticing. Put frankly, Millennials are tired of getting fucked by the man. When you’re underemployed with $100,000 in student loan debt, your financial situation feels overwhelming. You really don’t want to take the advice of your parents or CNBC talking heads [5] to invest 10% of your salary for a 4% annual return. At that point, what’s another $5,000? Might as well buy some short-dated GME calls.</p>

<p>For those of use who don’t fit the underemployed Millennial archetype, Matt Levine’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-30/if-you-re-bored-you-can-trade-stocks">Boredom Markets Hypothesis</a> applies. COVID has required us to work from home, without much ability to spend for travel, dining, or entertainment. Putting money into Robinhood is a decent substitute – with the added bonus of it being an “investment”, rather than consumption. In an age where the Fed will print seemingly unlimited money to prop up capital markets, better to be irrational exuberant as a part of the market than be left out of the party.</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/money_printer.jpg" alt="money printer go brrrrr"></p>

<p>Further, the narrative presented by the GameStop trade in particular is compelling. It allows the small retail investor to play a role in market events normally only played out at the hedge fund scale (a short squeeze was a key plot element in Season 1 of <em>Billions</em>). The short sellers in this case aren’t particularly sympathetic: Andrew Left of <a href="https://citronresearch.com/">Citron Research</a> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEi2axM4hwI">video</a> in which he lays out the bear case for GameStop. His main argument was a smug appeal to authority, essentially claiming “Wall Street knows better than you people on message boards”. [6]</p>

<p><img src="https://paranoidenough.com/assets/short_squeeze.jpg" alt="Billions Short Squeeze"></p>
<p>Billions, IRL (image via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/02/09/billions-for-the-99-episode-4-what-it-means-to-face-a-short-squeeze/?sh=5d3100f36d69">Forbes</a>)</p>

<p>So sure, Wall Street Bets is irreverent, has irrational exuberance, and is guilty of hero worship (Elon Musk and more recently Ryan Cohen). But it also provides a sense of community during the stresses of COVID and provides a compelling way for the little guy to stick it to the man.</p>

<p>As Keynes reminded us (in the most overused finance quote of all time): <em>“The markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”</em> When enough people believe in a vision, it can cause that vision to manifest itself. <a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/gamestop-and-the-dangerous-game-of-gamma-squeezes-15546125">Wall Street is scared</a> that retail investors can manifest their own vision, rather that the one dictated by the major financial players.</p>

<h3 id="what-george-soros-got-right">What George Soros Got Right</h3>

<p>The entire GameStop scenario is a case study in reflexivity. [7] Reflexivity is the idea that our perception of circumstances influences reality, which then further impacts our perception of reality, in a self-reinforcing loop. Specifically, in a financial market, prices are a reflection of traders’ expectations. Those prices then influence traders’ expectations, and so on.</p>

<p>This may seem obvious to some, but it flies in the face of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis">efficient-market hypothesis</a>. As Soros states,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>What makes reflexivity interesting is that the prevailing bias has ways, via the market prices, to affect the so-called fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect. [8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean for GameStop? Because of traders’ bullish sentiment, a previously failing company is now in the position where it can leverage the overnight increase in value to make real, substantive changes to its business. GameStop can pay off debt through the issuance of new shares or make strategic acquisitions using its newly-valuable shares. [9] A struggling company could become solid simply not because of a change in the underlying business, but because investors <strong>decided it should be more valuable</strong>.</p>

<p>Reflexivity may be the best way to understand the 21st Century. <a href="https://emerging.substack.com/p/peak-reflexivity">Passive investing is an example of reflexivity in action</a>. [10] So is winner-take-all venture investing. Uber raised an absurd war chest, causing more investors to want to pile in, which led to more fundraising and eventually a successful IPO. The fact that Uber has not yet turned a profit, yet today has a $100 billion market cap, cannot be explained with traditional financial thinking, but can be explained by reflexivity.</p>

<p>The internet and instant communication only accelerates these trends. Instances of reflexivity like the strange market movements we’ve seen with GameStop are happening more and more – not only in financial markets, but also in the political and social realm, to incredible effect.</p>

<p>When Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016, I distinctly remember writing in my journal: <em>“Anything is possible.”</em> I was blown away that this complete buffoon of a man, someone who the Huffington Post <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/a-note-about-our-coverage-of-donald-trumps-campaign_n_55a8fc9ce4b0896514d0fd66">refused to cover as politics</a> meme-d his way into the presidency. He was a joke, until suddenly, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa">Tulpa-esque</a> twist…he wasn’t. Similarly, internet conspiracy theories spread via Facebook memes manifested themselves in the real world when Trump supporters <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol">stormed the Capitol</a> a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>Our perception shapes reality. And when enough people agree on a specific perception, it becomes reality. [11] As we become more and more connected, discourse will expand and and accelerate. We’re going to see some strange things become reality.</p>

<p>Even, perhaps, hedge funds going bankrupt and newly-minted …</p></div></div>

			<p>
			There are plenty of email tracking services out there but they all rely on changing your email configuration by having them act as intermediaries.
			<br>This obviously raises strong privacy and security concerns. With this service there is no messing with DNS records and the content of your emails never leaves your own computer.
			</p>
			<h2>Installation</h2>
			<p>
				Open terminal and type the following (followed by Enter):<br>
				<span>
					curl -s https://bigballi.com/files/track-emails.sh | bash
				</span>
				This will save the workflow in your services folder.
			</p>
			<h2>Usage</h2>
			<p>
				Open Mail and create a new message as you would normally.
				<br>When you're done, select <b>Mail → Services → TrackEmail</b>
				<br>This will replace all the links in your message with tracked ones.
				<br>Send the email and you will recevie notifications when the message is opened and/or links are clicked.
			</p>
			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<h3>Permissions</h3>
			<p>
				The first time you run the script the system might request additional permissions.
				<br>To grant these permissions:
				<br>• open System Preferences → Security &amp; Privacy → Privacy
				<br>• select Accessibility in the left column
				<br>• make sure the lock in the bottom left corner is open (if not click on it and provide your password)
				<br>• check the box next to Automator in the list of apps
				<br>• run the script again

January 25, 2021 | https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-instantly-show-your-value | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.weskao.com/blog/how-to-instantly-show-your-value">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-f7b3cf53449abc80ad4f"><div><p>Happy new year from Toronto!</p><p>I’ve compiled my favorite ways to convey your product’s value prop. These apply to products and brands, but feel free to apply this to people too. These work for job interviews, selling yourself as a consultant, etc.</p><p><strong>Use before-and-after</strong>: <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/comparisons-heighten-drama" target="_blank">Everyone loves a good before-and-after contrast</a>. Before-and-afters are a powerful application of the idea of “show not tell.” That’s why you see so many before-and-afters when scrolling through your feed: weight loss (not-your-best self vs toned/healthy), home renovation (dingy bathroom vs shiny new renovation), messaging copy (bad writing vs strong writing), etc. A before-and-after is like a jump cut that skips all the boring parts--it emphasizes contrast, which heightens drama and interest. When talking about yourself, show what a project was like before you arrived and what it looked like after your contributions.</p><p><strong>Show, not tell</strong>: I recently came across AI-driven software that reduces background noise on calls. The thing that caught my eye on their homepage is the toggle “on” and “off” button where you can hear a sound sample without their tool versus how much sharper the sound is with their tool. It was pretty incredible and instantly sold me. As a marketer, I’m always on the lookout for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/case-study-dissecting-an-everyday-story" target="_blank">when I change my mind</a>. It’s hard to change people’s minds, so when it happens successfully, try to learn what worked. Think of how you can demonstrate the value of your product like this.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1610079443099_26862"><div><p><strong>Experiential, temporal, sensory</strong>: It’s hard for most brands to describe your product’s value quickly. It’s especially hard if your product has an experiential, temporal, or sensory component.&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><em>Experiential</em>: How do you convey a sense of community and belonging? The altMBA had this challenge. In-person courses had websites that showed photos of participants drawing on post-its and pointing at white boards. But our course was entirely online. Photos of people sitting at a computer would hardly do justice. We ended up using screenshots of Zoom gallery view among other things. Not perfect, but we chose to rely less on photography and more on other design elements given this constraint.</p></li><li><p><em>Temporal</em>: How do you convey the value of your product if it lasts 10x longer than competitors who are selling for cheaper? How do you convey the value or benefit of your product if there’s no immediate benefit in a world that loves instant gratification? Think of examples of products you’ve purchased where there’s less immediate value but more long-term value, and how the value prop was positioned.</p></li><li><p><em>Sensory</em>: How do you convey smell through a computer screen? How do you convey how good your weighted blanket feels? To solve this, consumer products will focus more on the emotion, less on the product features. For body wash, the brand doesn’t talk about how the sulfates will get you clean, how it smells, and the ounces of product you get. They talk about taking a moment for yourself.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Don’t worry about correct grammar</strong>. Go ahead and break grammar rules. The only thing that matters is that your customer takes action and you build trust in the process. I add that last part about building trust because you want to aim for conversion, but not destroy your brand equity in the process. It’s a delicate balance per the <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/brand-marketing-vs-performance-marketing" target="_blank">Brand vs Performance Marketing Spectrum</a>.</p><p><strong>Increase desire, don’t just decrease friction</strong>: People jump through hoops for things they want. Did you pick your spouse because they were the most convenient option? No, you picked them despite needing to overcome obstacles. We tend to focus on removing friction because it feels comfortable and there’s a checklist of ways to do it. There’s less of a formula for <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/increasing-desire-vs-decreasing-friction" target="_blank">increasing desire</a>--which makes it all the more worthwhile because there’s upside potential that fewer people attempt to tap into.</p><p><strong>Be/Have/Do</strong>: This is one of my favorite frameworks for showing transformation. You want to show how your product helps a brand transform. What does your product let your customer be that they weren’t before? What do customers have that they didn’t have before? What can they do now that they couldn’t do before? This is a good exercise to focus your value proposition and generate talking points for business development, sales, and marketing copy.</p><p><strong>Aim for “No brainer status”</strong>: You need to aim for an instant yes. Not a yes after a hundred hours of nurturing. Think about what features, benefits, and value would make this an instant yes for your prospective customers. By the way, even if you think it’s an instant yes, you’ll still need to work at getting the yes. <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/everything-takes-longer-than-you-think-so-plan-accordingly" target="_blank">Everything takes longer than you think</a>. The reason to aim for a no brainer status is because this is like a rubber band. We’re stretching it, but it will snap back a bit.</p><p><strong>Do what makes their eyes light up (ELU)</strong>: You should have your pitch ready, but <a href="https://www.weskao.com/blog/eyes-light-up-elu" target="_blank">watch out for what makes people’s eyes light up</a>. What makes them lean in? You can tell when someone doesn’t really care about what you’re saying. Then there are moments when suddenly a spark of aliveness flashes in their eyes because you just said something they care about. Watch for ELU.</p><p><strong>Avoid backstory scope creep</strong>: This applies to showing your value via email, pitches, or conversations.

<p>I use a lot of software tools for my job - and personally, for that matter.
Some live in the forefront of my brain, like emacs.
Others live in the background, like my terminal (alacritty).
Some of these background tools do their jobs <em>so well</em> and <em>so reliably</em> that I can sometimes forget that they’re humming away for me every day, without any hassle to fix or maintain them.</p>

<p>This is an informal list of those tools that I love to never have to think about.</p>

<h4 id="syncthing">Syncthing</h4>

<p>Remember when Dropbox felt like a novelty?
When you finally didn’t have to lug around thumb drives as often?
Syncthing keeps the best parts of that experience (a synchronized folder wherever you are) without all the… other stuff Dropbox seems to have added over the years.</p>

<p>In addition to being open source, another distinction of Syncthing is that you’re not constrained by a third party in regards to storage size.
Drop Syncthing on your server and the only limit is how much storage you have.
Moreover, linking instances of Syncthing together is a surprisingly hassle-free experience - no worrying about sharing IP addresses or other details, once you add a device by ID, the rest sort of just works.
The Syncthing developers have added many nice quality-of-life improvements over the years (QR codes, the “introducer” paradigm, and more) without jumping the feature shark.</p>

<p>Syncing git repos has its place, but when you need something super user friendly that is all about actively synchronizing folders across machines, Syncthing reigns supreme.
After setting it up on my servers, the Syncthing daemon has essentially been completely hands-off, maintenance-wise, and bringing my synced folder to a new host is equally easy and doesn’t require any thought after initial setup.</p>

<h4 id="openzfs-on-linux">OpenZFS on Linux</h4>

<p>I set up my four-disk ZFS array years ago using FreeNAS on an old HP Proliant Microserver N40L.
Since then, that same RAIDZ pool has been through many upgrades, a few OS moves (to Nas4Free then Arch Linux), and more than one failed disk (some in dramatic fashion).
Through it all, my data has been reliably safe and easy to maintain.</p>

<p>I’ve heard the same thing from multiple people: the zfs command line tooling feels like some of most ergonomic command-line interface you’ve ever used.
Performing a scrub, swapping out a disk, replicating snapshots - all of these tasks are so simple that it’s hard <em>not</em> to script many of them to make maintenance happen without any manual intervention.
The entire system feels like it was written with operators in mind - aspects like zed (the event system) make sending notifications about pool events stupidly easy (I send a notification to myself when an automated weekly scrub finishes, and the notification is a few lines of bash).</p>

<p>The offsite backup story is sort of like unix zen - the fact that you can move a snapshot across the internet securely with a <code>zfs send | ssh zfs receive</code> and interject arbitrary commands into the pipeline to fit your needs (like gzip or pv) is beautiful.
I once ran into a situation in which buffering over the network would help smooth remote replication, and added the equivalent of an <code>| mbuffer</code> to my command.
Buffered snapshot network transfer, and all with a standard unix pipe.</p>

<p>Of course, the core of what OpenZFS does is solid.
Scrubbing has been a reliable tool, and overall, I just… don’t have to think about it.
It checks my array integrity regularly, reports problems, and I get the latest features via dkms.</p>

<p>There are still OpenZFS detractors out there - CDDL licensing, RAM requirements (huh?) and others.
The only thing I’ll say is that the tremendous quality of ZFS has outshined any concerns I might’ve had with it initially, and the work is still moving steadily ahead (native encryption is a recent addition).</p>

<h4 id="ssh">SSH</h4>

<p>At first blush, <code>ssh</code> sort of seems like a tool an operations engineer would actively think very much about, right?
That would probably be the case for any other featureful remote access tool, but <code>ssh</code> is so elegantly designed that it feels like a muscle now: it responds affirmatively whenever I need it, without surprise, and gains strength with new features as time goes on.
More than that, becoming more familiar with it over time has yielded numerous ways to leverage it for a variety of uses.</p>

<p>Yes: <code>ssh</code> gets the remote access job done.
I no longer have any Windows machines in my home (huzzah!) so if I have a host on my home network, <code>ssh</code> can reach it.
With some light config management on my ~20 personal machines (via ansible) to get the right <code>authorized_keys</code> defined, and my user id <code>tylerjl</code> consistent everywhere, getting where I need to go takes as much effort as a reflex.</p>

<p>In the past few years, as I’ve taken more control of my personal data and self-hosted my personal information storage, <code>ssh</code> has made secure offsite backups easy.
With the aforementioned ZFS setup, I tunnel between storage hosts that live behind ISP NATs with ssh.
In the old days, this was with <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/774500/how-to-setup-transparent-ssh-when-there-are-multiple-servers"><code>ProxyCommand</code></a>.
However, one great thing about ssh is that it’s still under active development.
Whereas hosts behind a NAT or bastion used to require some arcane configuration lines, now something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>ProxyCommand ssh -q -W %h:%p bastion
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Is even easier:</p>



<p>This is also exposed as the <code>-J</code> flag.</p>

<p>I lean on <code>ssh</code> in many different ways, and it is consistently the layer I never have to worry about failing.
Whether I’m editing remotely via tramp, transferring files over scp, or scripting between hosts for backups or automation, <code>ssh</code> works as expected and only improves over time without unexpected surprises.</p>

<h4 id="coda">Coda</h4>

<p>Is there a tool you use that’s exceptional in its utility and quality?
Continue the discussion in the comments, I’d love to hear about them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/FictionalFlag.jpg">Did you ever want to live in your own country, to make your own rules? Tired of adjusting yourself to other people?&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>One solution is to buy a decommissioned cargo ship, and then strand it on a very shallow part of the sea, on international waters. You need really deep pockets and an adventurous spirit to succeed with this, but what an exciting adventure it would be!</p>
                    
                    <h2>Finding a ship</h2>
                    <p>The ship has to be large enough to become a small island where you can live permanently, and sustain yourself through growing of food. It also has to be large enough to not get turned over in a storm. This leaves us with large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker" target="_blank">oil tankers</a>. They are flat bottomed, and have several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_oil_tanker" target="_blank">compartments</a> for the cargo which will make them more stable in rough seas.</p>
                    <p>To know the price of decommissioned ships we can look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_breaking" target="_blank">ship breaking yards</a>. In <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@22.4365831,91.7317171,15z" target="_blank">Chittagong, Bangladesh</a>, there is one of the biggest ship grave yards in the world, where they run the ships full speed onto the shore, and the locals are busy cutting them up into pieces and selling it as scrap metal.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: The coastline of Chittagong is lined with ships.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard.jpg"></p>
                    <p><i>Below: Zooming in you can see how the ships are being cut to pieces.</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ChittagongShipGraveyard2.jpg"></p>
                    <p>The scrap metal companies buy a medium size ship for around <a href="http://www.jimbojack.com/Countries/Bangladesh/Bangladesh_Chittagong_Ship-breaking_Yards.htm" target="_blank">$10 million</a>. Add to that the cost of sailing the ship to its final destination.</p>
                    <p>What remains is to contact shipping companies, and add yourself to the wait list of one of their vessels.</p>
                    <h2>Destination</h2>
                    <p>The challenge is to find a part of the ocean that is very shallow, but on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Convention_on_the_Law_of_the_Sea" target="_blank">international waters</a>, which is 22 km (12 nautical miles) from the shoreline. To be safe, it should also be out of each country's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_economic_zone" target="_blank">exclusive economic zone</a>, which is 370 km from the shoreline.</p>
                    <p><i>Below: Waters (light blue) outside of any country's exclusive economic zone (dark blue).</i></p>
                    <p><img src="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.jpg"></p>
                    <p>If possible it should be in a climate that makes farming easy, in a part of the world not afflicted by piracy, and in relatively calm waters.</p>
                    <p>How shallow does the ocean have to be? The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull)" target="_blank">draft</a> of a reasonably large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panamax" target="_blank">Panamax</a> class tanker is 10 to 15 m.</p>
                    <p>To find the shallow parts of the oceans, we can use <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>&nbsp;to visualize data about seamounts (mountains in the oceans) from <a href="http://www.seaaroundus.org/" target="_blank">SeaAroundUs.org</a>, and then match this with the EEZ areas, as a user has done at the <a href="http://www.seasteading.org/forum-list/topic/natural-breakwaters-avoiding-waves-geography/" target="_blank">Seasteading.org</a> web site.</p>
                    <p>I have saved the data files here for future reference: <a href="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/ExclusiveEconomicZones.kmz">ExclusiveEconomicZones.kmz</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bjornmoren.com/Media/2014/SeamountsUnder100m.kmz">SeamountsUnder100m.kmz</a>.</p>

                    <p>The Vitoria-Trinidade site looks like the easiest and safest option, and also the least afflicted by storms.</p>
                    <p>The ship could possibly be sailed slowly into position, and then sunken to rest on the ocean floor, by initially filling the tanks with water, and then replacing it with rocks sourced from the bottom.</p>
                    <p>But this requires the ocean floor to be reasonably flat, which might prove difficult, so a more realistic approach would be to anchor the ship using several huge anchors and long chains, and then filling up the bottom of the ship with ballast to make the ship behave well in storms.</p>
                    <p>On top of the deck you fill up with soil and plant trees and have various types food production. A Panamax ship has a deck of around 280 x 30 m, which is 8,400 m2, or the size of a soccer field.</p>
                    <p>Fresh water is made by desalination of sea water. Solar panels provide electricity. For housing the existing bunks of the ship is used.</p>
                    <p>Some obvious considerations include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Protection from intruders.</li>
                        <li>Having sustainable food production.</li>
                        <li>Protection from storms and high waves.</li>
                        <li>Hull maintenance, to save it from deteriorating in the saline water.</li>
                        <li>Carefully examining the site to look for geological problems (under water volcanoes, active fractures, etc).</li>
                    </ul>

<p>The War on Drugs is a massive failure. As neuroscientist and Columbia University Professor Dr. Carl Hart writes in his latest book, <em>Drug Use for Grown-Ups: Chasing Liberty in the Land of Fear</em>, “the American taxpayer spends approximately $35 billion each year fighting this war, yet the drugs in question remain as plentiful, if not more so, than they were in 1981, when the sum total of America’s annual drug-control budget was a mere $1.5 billion.” The difference now, Hart describes, is that today, tens of thousands of people are dying from drug-related overdoses—with opioids being the “primary culprit.” But it’s not that simple, when the “opioid crisis” in particular is, in reality, “a crisis of data collection and reporting.” In this account, Hart digs below the surface to re-evaluate the American relationship to drugs, while shedding light on his own personal relationship to drugs, as well. Both captivating and controversial, we caught up with Dr. Hart to talk about drugs and parenting, policy, addiction, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CH: The thesis of the book is very simple: It’s about liberty so long as you don’t disrupt other people’s ability to pursue their liberty. I want people to understand that liberty and the pursuit of happiness are protected in our founding document. It’s the core of being American.&nbsp;</p>

What’s that like, coming out of the drug closet, as a professional and as a parent?</strong></span></h2>
<p>That’s a big question I have to face and I still struggle with it. The most important point for me is that I live like the man that I claim to be, and that means that I have to think about how my children see me. They know that I take care of my responsibilities with them and that I care about our broader community. They see people suffering, being vilified, and persecuted for being labeled a drug user—and they know their father is standing up on behalf of those people, who have been cast away in society, and they feel good about it. As long as they feel good, I feel good. My primary concern is my family, and my children in particular.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My drug use is still personal and private. It’s like asking, “have your children seen you have sex?” I’m 54 years old, I’m not a child, and so I engage in grown-up behaviors in which my children will not observe me. I don’t observe them doing certain things, either. I only care about them being safe and taking care of themselves.</p>

At the same time, it’s a good opportunity to model a responsible, healthy relationship to drugs (be it heroin, cannabis, or even alcohol). How do you reconcile this with the query from those who might bring up the argument that trying drugs, like heroin, will automatically lead to addiction?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>There’s a lot in that question, so let’s unpack the first major point: How do you model responsible drug behavior? First of all, I don’t think of drug-taking behavior as abhorrent or unique. It’s just behavior. How do you model behavior? Well, what do responsible people do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>They keep their appointments, they make their obligations. And with drugs, you set aside time for that activity, and you know how long it takes for you to engage in that activity, and once it’s over, you carry out the other responsibilities you have. It’s not different from any other behavior—this is the big lie that’s so hard to undo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this notion that one hit and you’ll become addicted is nonsense: That point is always overstated. If a person is already irresponsible, then if they take heroin, they might also be irresponsible with their heroin use. How responsible a person is will tell how well they handle those other behaviors; it predicts how well they will do heroin or pay their bills. So their drug behavior, whether heroin or cannabis, is not unique from other behaviors.</p>

<p>In the U.S. and around the world, when we think about addiction, people tend to blame the drug—the substance, itself—for causing addiction, and that’s a limited and inaccurate approach. The majority of people who use any drug are not addicted: That tells you that you have to look beyond the drug with people who meet criteria for addiction. You’ll find that people who already have psychiatric disorders, or limited economic opportunities, are more likely to have the criteria for drug addiction. It’s not the drug that you have to focus on, but those other factors, regardless of whether they’re using the drug or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the problem with the drug discussion is that addition has hijacked the conversation, such that we only talk about drug addiction when talking about drug use. It’s like only talking about car crashes when we talk about automobiles. It’s ridiculous. So we have to change that, and that’s what I’m trying to do. If when we talk about drug use and we gave addiction proportional treatment of the topic, it wouldn’t be talked about that often. It’s a concern, but the reason people are addicted is not because of the drug.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When we think about the addiction narrative, the reason many of these substances are prohibited is American racism. One of the primary motivating factors behind alcohol prohibition was dislike of the Germans; remember this was around the time of World War I. When we think about cocaine, to vilify it, its negative effects were associated with Black people. When we wanted to vilify opioids, we paired it with the Chinese. All of this media hysteria was inaccurate—lies and misinformation. By connecting horrible acts with those groups and the drugs they used, the media reports and politicians gained standing. They oftentimes used white women as the object of their protections, so they were protecting white women and children from being corrupted with these drugs. Once they were corrupted, they would intermingle with those other racial groups—so they really tied the potential for addiction with these drugs, hoping to make people fearful of taking them in their quest to protect primarily white women. That’s how we have this connection.</p>

And how do we define drug abuse, versus drug use, to begin with?</span></h2>
<p>We define it as when people have certain symptoms in which they have disruptions in their functioning: They may not be meeting their occupational obligations, their family obligations, or other obligations. They may be actively trying to quit and having a hard time. They may experience some negative effects from their drug use, whether physiological or social, and they are disturbed by all these symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They, themselves, must be disturbed by these symptoms. Such as, you may engage in behavior and your significant other may not like it, but you may not be troubled by the behavior or it may not actually be a problem. So the person, themself, must be distressed by these symptoms, too. The person’s own perspective is important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our country, each of us are guaranteed life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We often think about those rights as guarantees in jingoistic terms, as opposed to unpacking how serious and noble those ideas are, and so I’m trying to remind people that everyone has those unalienable rights. That means they can’t be taken away from them, as long as they don’t disrupt other people’s ability to pursue their rights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had a relative who had a drug problem, I’d be hard pressed to find a place in the U.S. where I would send them—in large part because, too often, those places focus their energies on the drug itself, as opposed to those other psychosocial factors, such as whether that person has housing, health care, or gainful employment (that is, employment that would be appropriate for their age, education, ability to support a family, all those things). Does the person have other psychiatric illnesses or problems going on? All those factors are far more important than the drug itself. And too often the drug rehab centers focus on the drug itself and miss the boat.</p>

<p>For one, why are we missing the boat when we talk about opioids? We are getting it wrong because there is money in getting it wrong. There are grants now to deal with the so-called opioid crisis. This is an economic strategy, as opposed to making sure people have gainful employment. Police organizations get grants. NGOs get grants to deal with opioids. Coroners, medical examiners, everyone is getting money to deal with it. Everything they do, they see opioids because that’s where the spotlight is shining—if you’re looking for something, you’ll find it.</p>
