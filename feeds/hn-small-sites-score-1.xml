<p>These days’ people find it so easy to replace quality with the quantity which in the long run leaves loopholes and challenges. Patching up which later costs higher than the quality but not up to the standard of the quality.</p>
<p>In my personal professional experience, people often offer services in my line of work for a ridiculously cheap price, and innocent people who fall for such end up spending above budget.</p>
<p>There was a client sometime back who came to inquire about a blog site, he said he doesn’t want a CMS (e.g. WordPress, Joomla, etc.) based blog but one that is built from scratch with custom features, so I gave him a quote of our quality service at the best price and he promised to call back.</p>
<p>When he did call back he was not calling for me to do the work anymore but to tell me he had given it to another person who has agreed to take a very cheap price from him but he wants me to check if the guy is giving him quality, I smiled at my own end and told him he will have to pay for consultation which is one of the services he knows we offer but he wanted it for free, I quickly objected and told him the price which was half the price in the first quote I gave him.</p>
<p>After he has paid for the consultation, I dug into the technologies used to develop the work and found it was the same Joomla which the client specifically said he doesn’t want, I brought this to his notice and he asked his guy about it, but guess what? The guy denied using a CMS to build the site and delivered the project like that. The client had to pay the amount in the first quote for me to redesign the work.</p>
<p>The total spending of the client amounted to 150% of our initial quotation plus the extra fee he paid the other guy. </p>
<p>Moral: Always be quality-oriented in your daily decisions.</p>

                    <h2>Feeling great</h2>
<p>What do you want people to feel when they talk to you? Happiness, sadness or maybe everything combined? </p>
<p>Do you want people to be inspired or motivated to tackle new and exiting problems? </p>
<p>Do you want to make the world a better place?</p>
<p>I think to understand your life purpose, you gotta understand yourself first. Not in a psychoanalytical way, but in a spiritual and reflectional way.</p>
<p>Don’t beat yourself up. Make yourself proud inside of you. If you are proud of what you do, then it means that you are following your heart. If you are following your heart, you are doing the best work you can, because there are too many people that do things for money. If you want to succeed, then there is no better strategy than that.</p>
<p>Live the life that you would feel proud about telling your grandchildren. Live the life that would inspire your children and will set a good role model for them. Be a person that is open to every opportunity, but chooses only those that align with their goals. Be open to success and closed for disappointment.</p>
<p>Shoot each time you have an idea, and don’t afraid to fail. You can miss and embers yourself just a little. Or you can never shoot and never achieve anything in life. Which one sounds worse?</p>
<h2>Understand your surrounding</h2>
<p>The most important part of being successful is in alignment with your surrounding.</p>
<p>Look around yourself. Do your habits improve it? Do people around you improve and getter better because of your actions? Are you on your way to helping others?</p>
<p>Humans are social beings, and the language that we have developed is the biggest indicator of that. If we could survive alone, we wouldn’t have needed a language to communicate. </p>
<p>You need to check up on others and help them. This will cause a domino effect, and in the end, you will benefit even more from that.</p>
<p>You are 5 people who you spend most of your time with. List those people and check if they are improving you and your well being, or are they destroying it? It is essential to make those 5 people stronger and better than you. This will allow you to grow, which will allow you that effect to trickle to other people, improving their lives.</p>
<h2>Don’t be afraid to try</h2>
<p>If you have a particular thing that you want to experiment, calculate how much will it cost. Mostly the things we are the most afraid of trying or doing we can try or do for less than $500 and the drawbacks are not irreversible.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to shoot and fail. Try and see how it goes. You can always roll back to the point of start.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

            <p>This post is about how I renamed a go module from
github.com/something/somethingelse to go.gianarb.it/somethingelse. It requires
zero infrastructure, just a static site that can run on GitHub.</p>

<p>I used one of the many projects I have that nobody cares about
<a href="https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc">gianarb/go-irc</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<p>You know, is one of those ideas you have in your mind for ages, but who cares?
At least for me that I don’t have any cool open source project under my name.</p>

<p>I am not one of those people who suffer when realizing that it is not escale. If
you end up having a project that gets traction and is tight to github.com
because you didn’t think about another way to go, you are stuck. And even if
GitHub today is cool, it won’t stay cool forever.</p>

<p>Filippo Valsorda <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a> today
<a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1327240411266641920">tweeted</a> about this
topic, and I looked at how he set up filippo.io/age to solve this little
dilemma.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<p>This is not about how to escape from GitHub but is about setting up a “vanity
URL” that won’t lock you or your project to GitHub. It does not require any
infrastructure, just a domain that you can point to a GitHub Pages.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Create a DNS record that points as CNAME to <code>&lt;github-handle&gt;.github.io</code>. I
used go.gianarb.it</li>
  <li>Create a repository; it will be the home for your static site. Mine is
<a href="https://github.com/gianarb/go-libraries">gianarb/go-libraries</a></li>
  <li>Set the repository up to be a <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub page</a> and
enable HTTPS. You can enable it via the repository Settings; we will push
HTML files to it directly, so I used the master branch as the GitHub page’s
source.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="add-your-first-library">Add your first library.</h3>

<p>If your library is already using go mod, you have to change the module name to
the new one. In my case, from was github.com/gianarb/go-irc to
go.gianarb.it/irc. I just searched and replaced with my editor in all the
project. Renaming a module is a bc break; I am not sure how to avoid or mitigate
that; if you know, let me know!</p>

<p>You can push a new file to your static site repository; I called my irc:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;html&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;meta</span> <span>name=</span><span>"go-import"</span> <span>content=</span><span>"go.gianarb.it/irc git https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;meta</span> <span>http-equiv=</span><span>"refresh"</span> <span>content=</span><span>"0;URL='https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc'"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
        Redirecting you to the <span>&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>"https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc"</span><span>&gt;</span>project page<span>&lt;/a&gt;</span>...
    <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Replace your URL accordingly, but as soon as you push this file and GitHub will
release it to your page, you will be able to import: <code>go.gianarb.it/irc</code>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This methods works as a safeguard if you decide to move your code out from
GitHub. The static site can be deployed to Netlify, S3 or served by Nginx. It
does not need to stay on GitHub.</p>

<p>Same for your code, if you decide to move from GitHub to GitLab you can do it
transparently.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Consider a team of engineers building a feature API for Snapchat. Let’s call them Ovah’s team. They’re facing two big problems: how to build it, and how long would it take.</p>

<p>If they can’t figure out how to build it, the feature is dead already. If they take too long to build it, the feature is as good as dead: Instagram would copy it before they’ve built it.</p>

<p>This post contains 4 different perspectives to look at the two problems. As you read through the perspectives, notice the tension in the examples. Both problems are vastly different, and some perspectives are better for one problem, and worse for another problem.</p>





<h2 id="the-outside-view">The Outside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_outside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the outside view, Ovah’s team compares this feature to other similar features they’ve built in the past. They built earlier features using Flask, and it took them 1 month to do it.</p>

<p>The outside view says that a good estimate for how long it would take is 1 month as well.</p>

<p>Further, the outside view says that a good estimate for how to build it is how you built it in the past: using Flask.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The outside view looks for similar problems in different contexts. It’s a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/gears-vs-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behaviour level model</a>: you look at things only from the outside. How things change from the outside are hints to what’s important on the inside.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that figuring out how long it takes might do well with the outside view, but the API design decisions - not so much. What’s different between the two problems?</p>

<p>Taking the outside view on API design decisions is like building a truck using a car model. Just because it has 4 wheels and behaves the same as a car doesn’t mean it’s used for the same purposes.</p>

<p>On the flip side, not taking the outside view for figuring out how long it would take is a fallacy. Daniel Kahneman writes about the outside view in <a href="https://amzn.to/3eVmTkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“People who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-inside-view">The Inside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_inside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the inside view, Ovah’s team looks at the components of the problem. They look at the requirements for the feature, and come up with a good design tailored exactly for this use case. It’s unique. They decide to go with Django instead of Flask, since it gets them authentication and other nice things out of the box.</p>

<p>The team figures that with Django, most things are done for them already, so it should take about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>The inside view looks at specifics of the problem. It’s a gears level model: you understand how things tick. You figure out how each component would work.</p>

<p>Taking both, the inside and outside view is better than just taking one. It’s like going to the eye doctor, where they show you unreadable letters on a lit-up screen. They add one lens on your eyes, and you begin to distinguish <code>o</code> and <code>e</code>. Then they add a second lens, and now you can even tell the difference between <code>h</code> and <code>n</code>! They add a third spherical lens, and the dots become sharper - you can now even see the dots over the i’s as circles, not blobs. Each lens is a perspective that sharpens your view. It helps you realise that you’re looking at <strong>e</strong>va<strong>n</strong>’s team, not <strong>o</strong>va<strong>h</strong>’s team: and then everything clicks.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>In this case, using Django was a good decision. However, it took much longer than 2 weeks: unexpected things went wrong, and the team’s imagination was limited by how things can go right.</p>

<p>I think engineers are better at designing APIs than they are at figuring out how long it would take, which hints at them being better at taking the Inside View. This makes taking the Outside View even more important: if no one else is thinking like you, you have a sharp lens no one else has, which makes all the difference.</p>

<p>At the same time, you need to beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maslow’s Hammer</a>: If you only take the Outside View on every problem, you’ll end up with a bad API design.</p>

<h2 id="the-birds-eye-view">The Bird’s eye View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_bird.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the bird’s eye view, Evan’s team looks at how this API should connect to other teams and clients. What are the other components involved? How can we best design things to work seamlessly with existing workflows?</p>

<p>The bird’s eye view looks at the problem as a part of a system, a part of other problems. This is different from the outside view, since it’s still the same problem in the same setting, but being looked at as an interface: how it connects to other things and other problems.</p>

<!-- Sometimes, tweaking the bigger picture can improve the interface, and subsequently the problem in the specific box you were working. -->

<p>Amazon is a company that internalises the bird’s eye view: Every team talks via interfaces! Every other team is their customer. You can’t go to your friend and ask them to open a backdoor for internal calls: it needs to be part of an interface anyone in the company can call. This means, not just clients, but also their colleagues and friends face the pain when the interfaces are hard to use.</p>

<p>What would it mean to take the bird’s eye view for the second problem? Evan’s team looks at how long their dependent teams would take, and when customers would be most likely to upgrade. So, they decide to launch with the next filters release, using that as a guiding factor: if the feature won’t get done by this time, build a smaller feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-worms-eye-view---genchi-genbutsu">The worm’s eye View - Genchi Genbutsu</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_worm.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genchi_Genbutsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genchi Genbutsu</a> means to “go and see”. Go to the problem, and see why it’s a problem.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup></p>

<p>For Evan’s team, this means looking at the team dynamics, and figuring out if Evan or others are somehow holding the team back. It also means figuring out if they have the required expertise in the team, and if not, how can they build it.</p>

<p>Like how the bird’s eye view zooms out to the interface between other teams, the worm’s eye view zooms in to the interface between people in the team. It’s one layer deeper than the problem of designing the API: it’s about how the team will go about it. You’re looking at the problem as a single engineer among other engineers working on the same problem.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>I’ve noticed that the Inside View, and the Bird’s eye view comes more naturally to people, while Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View are rarer. The more uncertainty and unknown unknowns involved in a problem, the more important Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View become.</p>

<p>The importance of taking these different perspectives shows up when you’re facing hard problems without an obvious solution: with the right combination of lenses, a blur turns into a sharp dot.</p>

				<p>Brought to you by the “I hate Mondays” department of Tales Of A Tech.</p>
<p>We would like to remind you that if there is a problem and you can’t seem to figure it out there’s always one solution to look to: It’s ALWAYS DNS.</p>

<p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>
<p>Last night I was trying to login to this site in order to make a post about my drone shenanigans (which, by the way, is <a href="https://talesofatech.com/2017/03/drone-shenanigans/">here</a>). &nbsp;I was already super frustrated because Mass Effect: Andromeda is coded by a team of (apparently) monkeys who don’t understand how to make working autosave features (my autosave files are all corrupt, causing me to lose 5+ hours of gameplay) and the site wasn’t being cooperative. &nbsp;I was reaching “blow-your-top” levels of frustration. &nbsp;I was finally able to connect and login but I immediately noticed things were running VERY slowly. &nbsp;It was weird, and I couldn’t figure out why. EVERYTHING seemed slow. &nbsp;Even the SSH connection was jittery and laggy.</p>
<p>At first I thought it was a problem with the network in the apartment. &nbsp;It happens from time to time. &nbsp;We run a lot of equipment in our apartment. &nbsp;I ran some speed tests and some other diagnostics and found that everything seemed to be working. &nbsp;Very weird.</p>
<p>Since I managed to SSH in I decided to check some logs. &nbsp;There didn’t seem to be anything in the apache log. &nbsp;fail2ban wasn’t being uncooperative. MySQL was running and seemingly accepting localhost connections. &nbsp;Very weird. &nbsp;I resorted to the only thing I could think of next: I rebooted the box.</p>
<p>Everything&nbsp;came back up (yay) but the site was still clunky and slow (not so yay).</p>
<p>I decided to enable verbose logging in apache and attempt to restart the service. &nbsp;It timed out. The hell?</p>
<p>I ran “journalctl -xe” per service failure message and noticed a peculiar entry:</p>
<pre>Mar 27 21:17:51 TalesOfAnAdmin systemd[1]: apache2.service: Start operation timed out. Terminating.
Mar 27 21:17:51 TalesOfAnAdmin systemd[1]: Failed to start The Apache HTTP Server.</pre>
<p>Failed to start due to timeout? &nbsp;Timeout of what? SO CONFUSED.</p>
<p>Digging back a little further I saw another confusing line:</p>
<pre>Mar 27 21:15:12 TalesOfAnAdmin apachectl[1860]: [Mon Mar 27 21:15:12.835322 2017] [core:error] [pid 1864] (EAI 2)Name or service not known: AH00547: Could not resolve host name maplerangers.com</pre>
<p>Huh. &nbsp;Weird.</p>
<p>I had a quick confab with Nick and he suggested I check if my websites were in my hostfile. &nbsp;They weren’t, so I added them. &nbsp;Apache startup became instantaneous. &nbsp;Things seemed to be improving. &nbsp;Cool.</p>
<p>I logged in to the website which was up and more responsive, but absolutely slow. &nbsp;Very weird still. &nbsp;I noticed an error on my WordPress Administration page: “curl error 28: operation timed out”</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>So back to the SSH I go. &nbsp;I try pinging wordpress.com: &nbsp;Unknown host. &nbsp;I try pinging google.com: Unknown host. &nbsp;I try pinging an IP Address for those sites: Working fine.</p>
<p>Grrrr!</p>
<p>I look at /etc/resolv.conf — I’m using Google DNS. &nbsp;Ok.</p>
<p>Let’s see if DigitalOcean has anything about this: Bingo!</p>
<blockquote data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Our engineering team is investigating reports of DNS connectivity issues while using the Google resolvers. During… <a href="https://t.co/cEpXMPJ3Nq">https://t.co/cEpXMPJ3Nq</a></p>

<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I edit the resolv.conf (and interfaces) to reflect a change to OpenDNS as the primary DNS with Google as the fallback DNS (as per the article linked later in the Tweet).</p>
<p>Restart networking.</p>
<p>Boom, everything is working.</p>
<p>It was DNS.</p>
<p><span><strong>It’s always DNS.</strong></span></p>
<p>-M, out.</p>

<p>An Egyptian scuba diver is believed to have set a new world record by remaining under water for nearly six entire days.</p>
<p>Saddam Al-Kilany, 29,&nbsp;completed the feat in the&nbsp;Red Sea off the Dahab coast.</p>
<p>Al-Kilany stayed underwater for 145 hours and 30 minutes, surpassing the current record&nbsp;of 142 hours, 47 minutes. The current world record was set by Cem Karabay in Cyprus.</p>
<p>Al-Kilany had&nbsp;originally planned to remain&nbsp;underwater for 150 hours, but the attempt was ended at 145 hours and 30 minutes due to concerns about his health.</p>
<p>Al-Kilany, who previously made headlines when he and his fiancee, Pia Legora, held their&nbsp;engagement ceremony&nbsp;underwater in September.</p>
<p>Video from the attempt and other documentation is being submitted to&nbsp;Guinness World Records&nbsp;for recognition.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Message queues are one of the critical components in any software architecture which helps different components talk to each other asynchronously. In this article let's discuss what message queues are, how they're used in modern architectures and what problems do they solve.</p>
<p>Let's say you want to withdraw some money from an ATM. An ATM machine can only allow one person to do transactions at a time. In this case, what do you do when you see there's a person already using the ATM machine? Do you wait in a queue or do you go back thinking you cannot withdraw money from this machine?</p>
<p>Exactly! You wait in a queue until your turn comes.</p>
<p>So when many people want to withdraw money they will have to wait in a queue and go to the ATM machine in the same order in which they entered the queue. This is one real world example of queues and message queues serve the same purpose in any software architecture.</p>
<p>We will talk about below topics in this article:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="#properties">Other properties of message queues</a></li>
<li><a href="#resources">Resources</a></li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-are-message-queues">What Are Message Queues?</h3>
<p>A queue is a First-In First-Out data structure. If you have a computer science background you know how a queue data structure works: the first element pushed into the queue is the first item extracted. It's basically the same concept as what we discussed in our ATM machine example.</p>
<p>A message queue is basically a queuing service used in micro services &amp; server-less architectures to decouple different components that are easier to develop, scale &amp; maintain in the long term. Message queues helps different components to communicate asynchronously by passing messages between them.</p>
<p>Generally in applications where message queues are used there are producers who create and put the messages into message queues. And there are consumers or worker processes which read those messages and take actions.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605504976290/uqTaa9q5A.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_4624157258.png"></p>
<p>A message is any data that is passed between two components. It contains all the information needed for the worker components to take actions.</p>
<p>Let's consider a use case where we have to recharge a customer's account. The worker component need to know these details: account_id, card_id, amount (in dollars).</p>
<p>The message the producer creates and puts into a message queues will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    <span>"account_id"</span>: <span>12345</span>,
    <span>"card_id"</span>: <span>567</span>,
    <span>"amount"</span>: <span>100</span>
}
</code></pre><p>As you can see, the above message contains all the information that a worker process needs to recharge this customer's account.</p>
<p>There are many third party message queueing services like Rabbit MQ, Kafka, Amazon SQS to name a few. Each one of them provide different features suitable for different use cases.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-message-queues-used-in-a-system">How Are Message Queues Used In A System?</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier message queues are used to decouple different components in a system. But what does it mean to decouple a system? It basically means the process of separating functions so that they're more independent and self contained.</p>
<p>Let's discuss it with an example. Let's say we need an application to generate invoices and send it to our customers at the end of the month. For the sake of this discussion let's assume that generating invoices is a time taking process and take anywhere between few seconds to a minute to generate one single invoice which involves doing the below steps in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get customer account details</li>
<li>Get customer billing details</li>
<li>Get data for different products used by the customer during the month</li>
<li>Apply any onetime charges and charge customers</li>
<li>Finally generate a invoice PDF and send it to the customer</li>
</ul>
<p>How would you implement such a functionality?</p>
<p>This is how a naive developer would approach it: Build a single REST service which accepts requests and does the above steps. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605506280058/Y03xhpEYG.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_8235631782.png"></p>
<p>This is a monolith architecture and has many problems with it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No Fault Tolerance:</strong> Fault tolerance is the ability for a system to continue operating without any interruption when one or more of its components fail. Since we have a single REST service, if the service goes down, the whole application stops working.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Components Cannot Be Scaled Independently:</strong> If we want to scale the application when the number of customers accounts increase, then we have to scale the whole application. This means more resources will be used since we cannot scale any individual component independently. So the use cases like Get Account Details will be scaled even though it is unnecessary because this components generally gets less traffic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No Freedom of Language:</strong> Since all the components are built using a single application, a single language / framework need to be used to build the complete application. We cannot use different languages for different components since the whole application is a single code repository which is built and deployed together.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Increase in Development and Deployment Time:</strong> Having all the components as one single codebase will increase the development time. Since this is a big application, it's possible that different teams would be working on different components of the system at any point in time. So all the teams need to take care of code consistency, code quality and also have to spend time in resolving merge conflicts since active development will be going on. This adds to the development time. Also with bigger codebase it takes more time to build and deploy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As seen above there are many problems if we go with a monolith architecture for the given problem statement. We need to divide the application into multiple components like Invoice Generation Service, Invoice Generation Service Worker, Account Service, PDF Generation Service etc.</p>
<p>Let's see how diving this into multiple services &amp; having a message queue to communicate between them will solve these problems.</p>

<h3 id="what-problems-do-message-queues-solve">What Problems Do Message Queues Solve?</h3>
<p>With micro services architecture, the architecture would look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605508126047/PhUZ4K-mV.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_2135728654.png"></p>
<p>In this architecture the Invoice Generation Service will create a message for every customer account. This message would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    <span>"account_id"</span>: <span>12345</span>,
    <span>"invoice_start_date"</span>: <span>"2020-10-01"</span>,
    <span>"invoice_end_date"</span>: <span>"2020-10-31"</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Therefore if we have 1000 accounts there will be 1000 messages pushed into the queue. The worker service will contain multiple workers. Each worker will pickup a message and start processing it. All the workers will be running concurrently. Each of these workers will talk to Account Service, Billing Service and PDF Generation Services which are micro services themselves.</p>
<p>Now let's see how each of the problems mentioned above will be solved with this architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> Fault Tolerance</strong>: If one of the component fails the other will work seamlessly. Let's say if Invoice Generation Service Worker is down for reasons, Invoice Generation Service will continue to work and keep pushing messages into the queue. It is not dependent on whether Worker service is up or not. If Invoice Generation Service is down, Worker service will continue to pull the messages from the queue and continue to generate invoices. So now there is fault tolerance in the system.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability:</strong> Now since the components are independent of one another they can be scaled independently too. All the heavy weight work is being done by the Worker service and Invoice Generation Service is just creating and pushing the messages into the message queue. So we need more computing power for the Worker service. So we can have powerful machines to run Worker service and we can add more tasks if the number of accounts increase in the future. Whereas the Invoice Generation Service can be run on less powerful machines. With this architecture we're able to scale the different components independently.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Freedom of Language:</strong> Having multiple components like this will give us the freedom to implement different components in different programming languages and frameworks. For example: Invoice Generation Service can be implemented in Java. Worker can be implemented in GoLang.
And if let's say we have another service which is responsible for generating invoice pdf, this can be implemented in Python. So having multiple components like this and having a message queue for communication between them will give us the flexibility over languages used in the architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved Developer Productivity &amp; Deployment Time:</strong> Since different components can be developed independently, the developer productivity will increase since they don't have to spend more time in co-ordinating when adding new features, resolving merge conflicts etc. Also the codebase of each of the component or service will be lighter and will have a separate deployment pipeline. So the quality, build and deployment time will decrease.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-properties-of-message-queues">Other Properties Of Message Queues</h3>
<p>Different message queuing services offer different message queues with properties like visibility timeout, message retention period, message size etc based on the popular use cases in the industry.</p>
<p>AWS provided message queuing service is called SQS (Simple Queue Service).</p>
<p>Let's discuss about SQS provided message queues and their properties in this section which gives you an idea on the different types of properties available with message queues in general.</p>
<p>AWS SQS offers two types of message queues:</p>
<h4 id="standard-queue">Standard Queue:</h4>
<p>Amazon SQS offers standard as the default queue type. Standard queues support a nearly unlimited number of API calls per second, per API action (SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, or DeleteMessage). Standard queues support at-least-once message delivery. However, occasionally (because of the highly distributed architecture that allows nearly unlimited throughput), more than one copy of a message might be delivered out of order. Standard queues provide best-effort ordering which ensures that messages are generally delivered in the same order as they're sent.</p>
<h4 id="fifo-queue">FIFO Queue:</h4>
<p>FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, …</p></div></div>

Meanwhile, China exported goods valued at nearly eight times as much. China’s top exports included products such as electrical machinery, appliances and equipment. While raw materials and products requiring less sophisticated manufacturing composed the majority of India’s exports.</span></p><p id="viewer-f2041"><span><strong>Mineral products, chemical products and precious metals and stones</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-9sv1v"><span>India’s top exports are dominated by mineral products (16 percent), chemical products (14 percent) and precious metals (12 percent). Mineral products include mineral fuels and oils, such as Manufacturing in India vs. Chinapetroleum.</span></p><p id="viewer-4t78m"><span>Chemical products include various organic and inorganic chemicals, soaps, tanning dyes, fertilizers, explosives and, most notably, pharmaceuticals.

Some of India’s leading exports in food and beverage include:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-citq4"><p>Basmati rice</p></li><li id="viewer-8o9ls"><p>Carabeef or meat of bovine animals</p></li><li id="viewer-f7e4l"><p>Frozen shrimp and prawns; and</p></li><li id="viewer-bqua5"><p>Refined sugar</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-3737a"><span>India’s broader agricultural sector accounts for 17 percent of the country’s economy and employs more than 60 percent of the population.</span></p><p id="viewer-7ql2u"><span><strong>Garments and textiles</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-bcu8t"><span>The garment and textiles industry is one of India’s fastest growing. Overall textiles exports were valued at $39 billion in 2018 and are expected to more than double by 2021.</span></p><p id="viewer-9shou"><span>Part of the growth comes from various government initiatives, such as a 2018 increase in basic customs duties from 10 percent to 20 percent on more than 500 textile products. Another contributor is India’s robust production of relevant input materials, such as cotton, which lend supply chain and cost advantages.</span></p><p id="viewer-faukb"><span>These exports include knitted, woven and crocheted textiles and apparel, carpets and textile floor coverings and man-made filaments.</span></p><p id="viewer-7r4hg"><span>Despite China’s current dominance in export value, India’s government is making serious efforts to invest in the country’s manufacturing sector. Though the manufacturing sector now contributes only 16 percent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP), the “Make in India” initiative aims to boost that contribution to 25 percent by 2022.</span></p><p id="viewer-caorn"><span>And companies like Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus are investing heavily in R&amp;D in India. “Our success in India has proven to be a great model for our growth in other regions,” says OnePlus CEO Pete Lau. “…We are now closer to making India as our second headquarters.”</span></p><h2 id="viewer-6tjmf"><span>COST AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED LABOR IN INDIA AND CHINA</span></h2><p id="viewer-fp3rq"><span>Differences in manufacturing wages, size and skill level of the labor force should be at the forefront of your decision to move production from China to India. Depending on your product type, some of these factors may highlight clear advantages for remaining in China.</span></p><p id="viewer-6tdee"><span><strong>Manufacturing wages</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-7q1sj"><span>Labor represents one of the main costs of manufacturing goods. And importers have watched China’s labor costs soar in recent decades, often growing by 10-15 percent annually. China’s minimum wages, which now range from about US$140 to US$346 per month, are set at the provincial level.</span></p><p id="viewer-5u605"><span>India’s minimum wages similarly vary across states and range from about US$66 to US$202. Mounting U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods over the past year have only strengthened the case for India as a cost-effective manufacturing alternative. And importers of labor-intensive products, like garments and textiles, are in the best position to realize cost savings by moving to India.</span></p><p id="viewer-2dtbl"><span><strong>Labor force size and skill level</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-5d337"><span>Among the many manufacturing locations opposing China, India is unmatched in the size of its labor force. According to September 2019 data from the World Bank, India’s labor force numbers about 519 million. China’s labor force is still much larger with 783 million strong. But Indonesia’s labor force, with 134 million workers, is a distant third for the region.</span></p><p id="viewer-fh5j3"><span>India falls behind many of its neighbors with regard to factors the World Economic Forum use to rank countries in their human capital report. India ranks 103rd overall, while China ranks 34th.</span></p><p id="viewer-3umpt"><span>One area where India suffers a deficiency is in “know-how”, which includes the breadth and depth of specialized skills at work. We see this directly at play in the quality and complexity of the country’s top export products. This metric also measures employers’ perceived ease at filling job vacancies.</span></p><p id="viewer-8obvp"><span>India also has room to grow with regard to its labor development rank. This rank considers access to and enrollment in formal education, opportunities to upskill and how well the education system fits the needs of a competitive economy.</span></p><p id="viewer-6aqg0"><span>Some have attributed the low development rank to India’s shortage of vocational schools.</span></p><p id="viewer-crl8q"><span>The relatively low labor participation rate in India—just 67 percent among the 25-54 age group as of 2017—also hurt the country’s human capital rank. India’s employment gender gap, one of the world’s largest, was another major contributor. In contrast, China achieved a labor participation rate of 88 percent for the same age group.</span></p><p id="viewer-3r1pr"><span>On the positive side, India has performed relatively well in terms of quality of education, staff training and economic complexity.</span></p><p id="viewer-aa1e7"><span>Read further at <a href="https://www.intouch-quality.com/blog/manufacturing-in-india-vs-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>https://www.intouch-quality.com/blog/manufacturing-in-india-vs-china</u></a></span></p><p id="viewer-1hgbn"><span><em><strong>If you are looking forward to source high-quality metal jewelry then reach out to us at </strong></em><a href="mailto:info@aliajewelery.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong><u>info@aliajewelery.com</u></strong></em></a><em><strong> &amp; we'll provide you with a free quote as per your requirement.</strong></em></span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

    <h3 id="are-we-living-in-a-simulation"><strong>Are we living in a simulation?</strong></h3>

<p>With the evident success of computer technologies 
this question raises more and more frequently.</p>

<p>Tech people mostly agree that this is a possible scenario, 
it could even be that we live in a multiple layers of simulations -
a simulation that runs in another simulation and so on.</p>

<p>While there is probably no way to disprove this hypothesis 
I argue that believing in such thing has a negative psychological effect 
on an individual and a society in general.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-we-mean-by-simulation"><strong>What do we mean by simulation?</strong></h3>

<p>In a process of simulation we are trying to model and imitate some real phenomena with the purpose of predicting or imposing the future outcomes. An imitation is generally much cheaper to perform than a real process. So we can trial a lot of different scenarios to find the best strategy before implementing it in reality.</p>

<p>It can be a computer modeling of a physical process or experiment. A repetition of some upcoming performance. Or even a thought process when we try to imagine a tree of possible events and our possible responses.</p>

<p>Virtual reality or a computer game also can be considered as a simulation since we model some elements of our real world (with some fictional elements, though) in a controllable and cheaper environment.</p>

<p>In general, all simulations are irrelevant when the best strategy is found.</p>

<p>But observe that in any case simulation is still part of the reality. Every completed game, no matter how useless it was, is still part of our world. And due to the butterfly effect every tiny event can have a huge impact in the future.</p>

<p>So, a simulation is always real, even if it predates the <em>real action</em>. It’s just way less important.</p>

<h3 id="why-would-we-prefer-to-think-that-we-live-in-a-less-important-world"><strong>Why would we prefer to think that we live in a less important world?</strong></h3>

<p>The simple answer is — people tend to downgrade what they see if they don’t like that. An irresponsible and childish person became a president of a powerful country? A girl has to tell to world leaders what to do with the Earth’s climate? No, this doesn’t imply that we live in some kind of game, or a part of a show. There are explanations and they are real. We just don’t know or understand them.</p>

<p>Another reason could be that the world became so big and interconnected that we feel ourselves in much less control. There are too many information, too many factors, too many actors. Also the pace of change is not making us more certain about the future. The world is less predictable than ever today.</p>

<p>Finally, downgrading reality is a psychological way to flee from our responsibilities in life. Why bother to do something if everything is not important?</p>

<h3 id="the-effects-of-such-belief"><strong>The effects of such belief</strong></h3>

<p>Believing that the world is just a simulation implies that we, our feelings and our actions are not that important either.</p>

<p>The is a huge amplifier of depression if a person has already lost their sense and purpose in life. Or this could be an excuse to live a meaningless life.</p>

<p>Now imagine that you live in a society that think the world around is not that important, including you, obviously. 
You could be an NPC (non-player character) in this game, after all. Just an AI script written by a programmer from the <em>true world</em>. Would you like to live in such community?</p>

<h3 id="conclusions"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>

<p>Do not downgrade <em>the reality</em> of what you see simply because you don’t like it, don’t understand or don’t control it. All your actions, your feelings, your views and your life in general are <em>matter</em>, as well as the life of others.</p>

  <section>
    <p>This is the 1967 Turing award lecture by Maurice V. Wilkes. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">Wikipedia</a>, Wilkes is best known as the builder and designer of the EDSAC, the first computer with an internally stored program. This lecture does a wide survey of computer as they were in 1968 and makes many accurate predictions. Yellow highlights/annotations are my own. <a onclick="disableHighlight()" href="#">You can disable them.</a></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Reminiscences on the early developments leading to large scale electronic
computers show that it took much longer than was expected for the first of
the more ambitious and fully engineered computers to be completed and prove
themselves in practical operation. Comments on the present computer field
assess the needs for future development.</p>

<p>I do not imagine that many of the Turing lecturers who will follow me will
be people who were acquainted with Alan Turing. The work on computable
numbers, for which he is famous, was published in 1936 before digital
computers existed. Later he became one of the first of a distinguished
succession of able mathematicians who have made contributions to the
computer field. He was a colorful figure in the early days of digital
computer development in England, and I would find it difficult to speak of
that period without making some references to him.</p>

<h2 id="pioneering-days">Pioneering Days</h2>

<p>An event of first importance in my life occurred in 1946, when I received a
telegram inviting me to attend in the late summer of that year a course on
computers at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering in Philadelphia. I
was able to attend the latter part of the course, and a wonderful experience
it was. No such course had ever been held before, and the achievements of
the Moore School, and other computer pioneers, were known to few. There were
28 students from 20 organizations. The principal instructors were John
Mauchly and Prosper Eckert. They were fresh from their triumph as designers
of the ENIAC, which was the first electronic digital computer, although it
did not work on the stored program principle. The scale of this machine
would be impressive even today  – it ran to over 18,000 vacuum tubes.
Although the ENIAC was very successful – and very fast  – for the
computation of ballistic tables, which was the application for which the
project was negotiated, it had severe limitations which greatly restricted
its application as a general purpose computing device. In the first place,
the program was set up by means of plugs and sockets and switches, and it
took a long time to change from one problem to another. In the second place,
it had internal storage capacity for 20 numbers only. Eckert and Mauchly
appreciated that the main problem was one of storage, and they proposed for
future machines the use of ultrasonic delay lines. Instructions and numbers
would be mixed in the same memory in the way to which we are now accustomed.
Once the new principles were enunciated, it was seen that computers of
greater power than the ENIAC could be built with one tenth the amount of
equipment.</p>

<p>Von Neumann was, at that time, associated with the Moore School group in a
consultative capacity, although I did not personally become acquainted with
him until somewhat later. The computing field owes a very great debt to yon
Neumann. He appreciated at once the possibilities of what became known as
logical design, and the potentialities implicit in the stored program
principle. That von Neumann should bring his great prestige and influence to
bear was important, since the new ideas were too revolutionary for some, and
powerful voices were being raised to say that the ultrasonic memory would
not be reliable enough, and that to mix instructions and numbers in the same
memory was going against nature.</p>

<p>Subsequent developments have provided a decisive vindication of the
principles taught by Eckert and Mauchly in 1946 to those of us who were
fortunate enough to be in the course. There was, however, a difficult period
in the early 1950s. The first operating stored-program computers were,
naturally enough, laboratory models; they were not fully engineered and they
by no means exploited the full capability of the technology of the time. <mark>It
took much longer than people had expected for the first of the more
ambitious and fully engineered computers to be completed and prove
themselves in practical operation.</mark> In retrospect, the period seems a short
one; at the time, it was a period of much heart searching and even
recrimination.</p>

<p>I have often felt during the past year that we are going through a very
similar phase in relation to time sharing. This is a development carrying
with it many far-reaching implications concerning the relationship of
computers to individual users and to communities, and one that has stirred
many people’s imaginations. It is now several years since the pioneering
systems were demonstrated. Once again, it is taking longer than people
expected to pass from experimental systems to highly developed ones that
fully exploit the technology that we have available. The result is a period
of uncertainty and questioning that closely resembles the earlier period to
which I referred. When it is all over, it will not take us long to forget
the trials and tribulations that we are now going through.</p>

<p>In ultrasonic memories, it was customary to store up to 32 words end to end
in the same delay line. The pulse rate was fairly high, but people were much
worried about the time spent in waiting for the right word to come around.
Most delay line computers were, therefore, designed so that, with the
exercise of cunning, the programmer could place his instructions and numbers
in the memory in such a way that the waiting time was minimized. Turing
himself was a pioneer in this type of logical design. Similar methods were
later applied to computers which used a magnetic drum as their memory and,
altogether, the subject of optimum coding, as it was called, was a
flourishing one. I felt that this kind of human ingenuity was misplaced as a
long-term investment, since sooner or later we would have truly
random-access memories. We therefore did not have anything to do with
optimum coding in Cambridge.</p>

<p>Although a mathematician, Turing took quite an interest in the engineering
side of computer design. There was some discussion in 1947 as to whether a
cheaper substance than mercury could not be found for use as an ultrasonic
delay medium. Turing’s contribution to this discussion was to advocate the
use of gin, which he said contained alcohol and water in just the right
proportions to give a zero temperature coefficient of propagation velocity
at room temperature.</p>

<p>A source of strength in the early days was that groups in various parts of
the world were prepared to construct experimental computers without
necessarily intending them to be the prototype for serial production. As a
result, there became available a body of knowledge about what would work and
what would not work, about what it was profitable to do and what it was not
profitable to do. While, looking around at the computers commercially
available today, one cannot feel that all the lessons were learned, there is
no doubt that this diversity of research in the early days has paid good
dividends. It is, I think, important that we should have similar diversity
today when we are learning how to construct large, multiple-access,
multi-programmed, multi-processor computer systems. <mark>Instead of putting
together components and vacuum tubes to make a computer, we have now to
learn how to put together memory modules, processors, and peripheral devices
to make a system</mark>.<label for="sn-1"></label>
<span>
S: What we now call as <em>computer architecture</em>.
</span>
I hope that money will be available to finance the
construction of large systems intended for research only.</p>

<p>Much of the early engineering development of digital computers was done in
universities. A few years ago, the view was commonly expressed that
universities had played their part in computer design, and that the matter
could now safely be left to industry. I do not think that it is necessary
that work on computer design should go on in all universities, but I am glad
that some have remained active in the field. Apart from the obvious
functions of universities in spreading knowledge, and keeping in the public
domain material that might otherwise be hidden, universities can make a
special contribution by reason of their freedom from commercial
considerations, including freedom from the need to follow the fashion.</p>

<h2 id="good-language-and-bad">Good Language and Bad</h2>

<p><mark>Gradually, controversies about the design of computers themselves died down
and we all began to argue about the merits or demerits of sophisticated
programming techniques; the battle for automatic programming or, as we
should now say, for the use of higher level programming languages, had
begun.</mark> I well remember taking part at one of the early ACM meetings – it
must have been about 1953 – in a debate on this subject. John Carr was also
a speaker and he distinguished two groups of programmers; the first
comprised the “primitives,” who believed that, all instructions should be
written in octal, hexadecimal, or some similar form, and who had no time for
what they called fancy schemes, while the second comprised the “space
cadets,” who saw themselves as the pioneers of a new age. I hastened to
enroll myself as a space cadet, although I remember issuing a warning
against relying on interpretive systems, for which there was then something
of a vogue, rather than on compilers. (I do not think that the term compiler
was then in general use, although it had in fact been introduced by Grace
Hopper.)</p>

<p>The serious arguments advanced against automatic programming had to do with
efficiency. <mark>Not only was the running time of a compiled program longer than
that of a hand-coded program, but, what was then more serious, it needed
more memory.</mark> In …</p></section></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This blog has never been a money-making endeavor. I’ve had a series of jobs in software engineering and leadership that have paid my rent since 2009. Nevertheless, it’s interesting to tinker with ways how this blog could pay for its own domain name renewal fees.</p><h3 id="itunes--amazon-2016-2018">iTunes &amp; Amazon (2016-2018)</h3><p>For a few years, I had affiliate links on the site, for iTunes and Amazon links. The <a href="https://appleservices-console.partnerize.com/login/appleservices/en_us">Apple partner program</a> is relatively unknown but was pretty easy to use. Sticking <code>&amp;at=1010lmEW</code> at the end of links to the iTunes store tagged them with your website as an origin, and they give some low percentage of application and music sales. In the time I used it, the total was around $30.</p><p>Amazon Affiliates is the most famous program of its type on the internet. For a while, whenever I linked to Amazon, I’d use those links. It yielded slightly more than iTunes, in total around $60 over the course of three years, or $20 a year.</p><p>I removed all of these links in 2018. Disclosing that <em>this site uses affiliate links</em> on the About page felt a little grimy, and the idea that I might be linking to something just to earn a buck – though it was never true – felt like something to be entirely avoided. Plus, linking to Amazon meant enriching a company that’s <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/article/the-truth-about-injuries-at-amazon/">really</a>, <a href="https://themarkup.org/2020/07/30/congressional-antitrust-tech-hearing-recap-facebook-amazon-alphabet-google-apple">really</a>, not on the right side of history.</p><h3 id="brave">Brave</h3><p>I set up this site with <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>’s rewards system in mid-2019. Brave, the browser, has a pretty complicated ecosystem around it: a <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">cryptocurrency, BAT</a>, a <a href="https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/">publisher-side interface</a>, and a bunch of details that they’re lining up to eventually have the Brave browser itself serve ads on webpages that allow it.</p><p>Setting up a site with Brave Publishers involves a text file <a href="https://macwright.com/.well-known/brave-rewards-verification.txt"><code>brave-rewards-verification.txt</code></a>, to link your account with your website, and then setting up an account on <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a>, a sort of cryptocurrency wallet, to convert your money to USD, some other sort of cryptocurrency, or, in the rarest case, use it to buy something with crypto.</p><p><img alt="Brave Rewards" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-11-15-mini-monetization-experiments-brave-rewards.png"></p><p>All-in-all, this site has earned 162 BAT, which, at $0.19 each, is about $30. <del>The reason <em>why</em> it makes any money from Brave is a total mystery to me. Sure, someone directly tipped 9.5 BAT, or about $2, but where did the rest come from? I didn’t use affiliate links to encourage people to use the Brave browser - I don’t use it myself at all, it seems fine though. The thing where Brave shows ads on webpages isn’t launched yet, as far as I can tell. It’s cool that money appeared somewhere, but it’s hard to say why.</del></p><p><a href="https://mostlysubjective.com/about/">Atanas Entchev</a> explains that Brave opens ads in separate tabs, which is where the ad revenue is coming from, and then those collected BAT tokens are distributed to sites like this one. Thanks!</p><h3 id="coil">Coil</h3><p>More recently, I set up <a href="https://coil.com/about">Coil</a> on this site. Like Brave, it requires you to sort of ‘confirm’ that you own the website and link it to your site. To do that, you get a sort of special code from Uphold and put that in a meta tag on the page:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;meta</span>
  <span>name=</span><span>"monetization"</span>
  <span>content=</span><span>"$ilp.uphold.com/Kk2HbEYgFH6K"</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Coil’s a very interesting sign of the times: a blockchain-powered technology behind a startup that is apparently trying hard to never mention blockchains or crypto. To me at least, that seems wise. The culture and thought around crypto and blockchains have been poisoned by scammers, techno-liberatarians, and all sorts of baddies.</p><p>I think the economics around Coil are a lot more straightforward than Brave: people install a browser extension or use the Puma Browser, and they pay $5 a month to fund websites that support it. It’s much newer and less popular than Brave, and as a result, so far…&nbsp;it earns about $0.04 a week.</p><h3 id="ko-fi">Ko-fi</h3><p>Finally, I’ve had a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/">Ko-fi</a> link up on the /about page for a while. It’s been nice, and is the simplest and most straightforward sort of option: every once in a while, someone enjoys an article and sends a few dollars my way.</p><p>I think that it’s a nicer fit for someone like me who doesn’t have a fixed topic or schedule. I write just when I feel strongly about something, or have something I think is interesting to share. I don’t want to crank out a weekly or month post about JavaScript or React or maps in order to fit a schedule, and disconnect my enthusiasm with my output.</p><h3 id="how-its-going">How it’s going</h3><p>My goal with monetization is to cover domain name registrations for this site and to keep a finger on the pulse of this “indieweb monetization” idea to see if it ever yields something worthwhile. I’m nearly paying for the domain names, but web monetization is still a pretty nascent field.</p><ul><li>Brave is neat because people passively fund your site, but it’s really opaque about where money comes from.</li><li>Ko-fi is great, very casual, and pretty low-tech: it’s just a fancy way to accept PayPal.</li><li>Coil is interesting and doesn’t try to do a fancy multi-sided market like Brave does, but very few people use it.</li></ul><p>What Brave and Coil have in common is a pretty high level of inefficiency and semi-hidden fees.</p><ul><li>When you get paid out for Brave’s rewards system, Brave takes a 5% fee that they bury in the UI.</li><li>When you’re paid from Coil, Uphold takes a 1.2% fee that they round up to the nearest penny, which in my case rounds it up to 16%.</li><li>You can’t spend BAT, the Brave currency, so you need to convert it to USD or another cryptocurrency, which means another fee, <a href="https://uphold.com/en-gb/get-started/service-fees">implemented as a spread</a>, that’s at least a few percent of the transaction.</li></ul><p>Ko-fi, which uses no crypto technology, charges zero fees on their transactions.</p><p>My goals for this site are very modest. If I were aiming higher, then I’d look to <a href="https://substack.com/">substack</a> or try writing on Medium or a syndicated blog. But I don’t want to lock away content, or lock myself into a publishing schedule or another set of expectations. So for those constraints, it seems like these systems for micropayments and little gratitudes will do the trick, without affiliating this site with a monopoly.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[A Short History of Romaji]]>

November 15, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/romaji-history.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/romaji-history.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently created a tool called <a href="https://github.com/polm/cutlet">cutlet</a> for converting Japanese to romaji.
While working on cutlet I was surprised at the difficulty of finding a good
guide to the difference between romaji systems, particularly their history and
usage, so I wrote this up.</p>
<h2 id="a-romaji-refresher"> A Romaji Refresher</h2>
<p>There are three relatively well-defined romaji systems. For a quick overview of
some of their differences:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>新橋</th>
<th>お茶漬け</th>
<th>富士山</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>Shinbashi (or Shimbashi)</td>
<td>ochazuke</td>
<td>Fujisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyazuke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyaduke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is the most widely used outside Japan, Kunreisiki is officially taught
to children in Japan. Nipponsiki is similar to Kunreisiki but older. Technically
Hepburn uses macrons for long vowels while Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki use
circumflexes, but usage isn't consistent and there's no difference in meaning
between them.</p>
<p>In recent years "wapuro" romaji, based on input when typing Japanese, are also
relatively common, but it's not systematized (except in as far as programs
either take or don't take certain sequences) and isn't used in any kind of
formal writing.</p>
<h2 id="particle-comparison"> Particle Comparison</h2>
<p>As another refresher, here's how non-phonetic particles are represented in the
various systems.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>は</th>
<th>を</th>
<th>へ</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>o</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>ha</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>he</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is phonetic except for <em>wo</em>, Kunreisiki is strictly phonetic, and
Nipponsiki is strictly orthographic.</p>
<h2 id="early-romaji"> Early Romaji</h2>
<p>Japanese was first written in the Latin alphabet in the 1600s, mainly by
Christian missionaries. It was used by the missionaries for recording and
learning the language, and also used in texts they produced to try to spread
Christianity. Since Christianity was later supressed in Japan, these forms of
romaji never had wide adoption, though they influenced later efforts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-hepburn-system"> The Origins of the Hepburn System</h2>
<p>In 1867, missionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Curtis_Hepburn#Missionary_work_in_Japan">James Curtis Hepburn</a> published a
Japanese-English dictionary in Yokohama. Naturally he needed some way to write
Japanese words for people who couldn't read Japanese, so he devised a system of
representing Japanese that reflected the pronunciation of English consonants.
His system wasn't designed from the ground up, but developed based on his
knowledge of existing systems by other missionaries as well as his own
knowledge of Japanese.</p>
<p>Somewhat later, in 1885, an organization known as the
<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E8%AB%96#%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E4%BC%9A">羅馬字会</a>
(Romajikai) was established. Mainly a society of Japanese academics, it was
interested in promoting the use of romaji as a replacement for kana and kanji.
Some motivations for getting rid of native writing systems included easier
international communication and improved domestic literacy. The principle
founders were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dkichi_Yatabe">Ryoukichi Yatabe</a>, a botanist and the first Japanese graduate of Cornell, and <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%96%E5%B1%B1%E6%AD%A3%E4%B8%80">Masakazu Toyama</a>, a <a href="https://ii.umich.edu/cjs/history-of-cjs.html">graduate of the University of Michigan</a> who
later occupied a high post at what would eventually become Tokyo University.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/4d041d6a/max-moritz-romaji.jpg"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/4d041d6a/img/max-moritz-romaji.jpg.l.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Romajikai published books to promote romaji, including this translation of Max and Moritz, titled "Wampaku Monogatari". This edition was reprinted in 1978. via <a href="https://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kotenseki/html/he22/he22_07214/index.html">Waseda University</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 1886 the Romajikai published <a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/862485">a romaji system</a>. Also in 1886
Hepburn published the third edition of his dictionary, which roughly used the
system.  I've had trouble finding the exact nature of the influence between
Hepburn's system and the Romajikai, but they were on friendly terms and
cooperating. Hepburn's dictionary's third edition took off, the romaji system
mainly came to be called by his name, and it became widely established,
particularly among foreigners dealing with Japan.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about Hepburn's dictionaries, a <a href="http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/mgda/waei/">wealth
of information</a> is available via Meiji Gakuin University
Library, including a comparison of romaji in all published versions and
manuscripts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-nipponsiki-system"> The Origins of the Nipponsiki System</h2>
<p>Around the time the Romajikai was established, one of the members, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakadate_Aikitsu">Aikitu
Tanakadate</a>, developed his
own romaji system, based on some existing informal conventions, that was
specifically designed to mirror the structure of Japanese kana without regard
to foreign pronunciation.</p>
<p>In 1885 Tanakadate proposed this new system to the Romajikai, but they
ultimately rejected his proposal in favor of keeping Hepburn. As a result
Tanakadate left the Romajikai and promoted Nipponsiki on his own. Before
becoming known as "Nipponsiki" this style of Romanization was known as
"Tanakadatesiki".</p>
<p>The disagreement between Tanakadate was only the first in a long series of
arguments between Hepburn and Nipponsiki proponents.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was around 30 when he invented this system, and most of his later
career was in physics. He worked with Lord Kelvin in Scotland and helped bring
about the adoption of the metric system in Japan. He used romaji in personal
writings and promoted it throughout his life. We'll be seeing him again later.</p>
<h2 id="standard-form-and-the-romaji-hirome-kai"> Standard Form and the Romaji Hirome Kai</h2>
<p>In 1905 the ローマ字ひろめ会 (Romaji Hirome Kai, "Society for the Advancement
of Romaji") was established. They published a magazine, called simply "Rômaji",
to create more reading material in romaji and spread its use within Japan.  By
this point Toyama and Yatabe had both passed away, and it's unclear if the
original Romajikai still existed in any capacity. An important early member of
the new society was <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%97%A4%E5%B2%A1%E5%8B%9D%E4%BA%8C">Katsuji Fujioka</a>, who wrote the
<a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/942994">羅馬字手引</a> (Romaji Tebiki), a kind of romaji dictionary.</p>
<p>Shortly after it was founded the Romaji Hirome Kai proposed a slightly modified
Hepburn and called it 標準式, or "Standard Form". Note that this is "Standard
Form" in general, not "Standard Hepburn", suggesting this was some kind of
official standard romanization system; this may have been a response to
Tanakadatesiki becoming known as "Nipponsiki", which could imply that other
romaji systems were "foreign". As we'll see in a bit, this rhetorical trick
ultimately didn't help official adoption.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to track down the original document with Standard Form, but
the Romaji Tebiki was already using it in 1906.</p>
<p>Standard Form replaced macrons with circumflexes and always romanized ん as
"n", rather than sometimes using "m" depending on the following consonant.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was still around and joined the Romaji Hirome Kai at some point, but
got fed up with their use of Hepburn, left, and founded his own organization in
1914.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-kunreisiki"> The Origins of Kunreisiki</h2>
<p>In 1930 the government formed a committee to evaluate various romaji systems
for official government use. At this point Tanakadate was a member of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Peers_(Japan)">House of Peers</a>, and Romaji Hirome Kai member and Hepburn proponent
Fujioka was not a politician, but had political influence due to his long and
prominent career as a linguist. Both were involved with the government
committee.</p>
<p>While the system used at this point varied considerably by government agency,
Hepburn was more popular, so it seemed slated for official adoption.  However,
in 1935 Fujioka died of illness. In 1937, following a recommendation from the
committee, a slightly modified version of Tanakadate's Nipponsiki, dubbed
Kunreisiki, was established as the official government romaji system.</p>
<p>The main difference between Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki is that kana that are not
pronounced differently in standard modern Japanese are spelled as their more
common counterpart (づ and ず are both <em>zu</em>), though there are other
differences, like how particles are represented, and how ambiguous phonetic
boundaries are written.</p>
<h2 id="the-war"> The War</h2>
<p>Despite the recent official adoption of a government-approved romaji system,
around 1938 a number of more radical romaji proponents were arrested as
potential (or actual) anti-nationalists. One example was Esperantist and
language researcher <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4%E7%A7%80%E4%B8%80">Hidekatsu Saitou</a>, who contracted tuberculosis in
prison and died in 1940.</p>
<p>Following World War 2, the occupying American forces rescinded the law making
Kunreisiki official and ordered the use of Hepburn for public signage and
documents. During the occupation, an American educational commission
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754081234191&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=28">recommended native Japanese writing be replaced with romaji</a>.
This never happened, though romaji became a standard component of post-war
education.</p>
<p>Post-war the development of romaji became less dramatic, as serious proponents
of replacing Japanese writing systems with romaji mostly disappeared. There
have been a number of laws and rules issued by the government over the years,
as well as a few special systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSL_romanization">unique system</a> developed for a
textbook called "Japanese: The Spoken Language", but Hepburn and
Nipponsiki/Kunreisiki remain the major systems.</p>
<p>There is also much to be written about interaction of romaji with computers,
but that's best left for another time.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-revised-hepburn%3F"> What About Revised Hepburn?</h2>
<p>Sometimes you'll see references to "Revised Hepburn", but nobody knows what
this is. It is used to mean, variously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hepburn's system in his third edition, in contrast to earlier editions</li>
<li>the 1905 version by the ローマ字ひろめ会 (properly 標準式 or "standard form")</li>
<li>a version introduced with Kenkyuusha's "New Japanese-English Dictionary" in 1954, subsequently <a href="https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/japanese.pdf">adopted by the American Library of Congress</a></li>
<li>other minor variants proposed at different times</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Library of Congress is surely consistent in their romaji usage, their
choice of a particular 1954 dictionary is a bit odd, and distinguishing it from
the similar 1905 system is a source of confusion. At one point it seemed like
Hepburn might become an ANSI standard, but instead Kunreisiki was adopted, and
that standard (Z39.11-1972) has since been deprecated. This lack of an official
standard contributes to inconsistency in what "Revised Hepburn" means.</p>
<p>In contrast, "traditional Hepburn" is somewhat reliably used to refer to the
system used in Hepburn's third edition as opposed to later forms.</p>
<p>Another common variant, "passport Hepburn" refers to the system previously
mandated for names on Japanese passports, which included some exceptions to
normal Hepburn, but those requirements are <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/toko/passport/pass_4.html#q17">no longer strictly in force</a>,
and you can use any romanization you want (such as "George" for what would be
"Jouji" in Hepburn) if you have …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/privacy-concerns-emerge-following-apple-ocsp-server-outage/">Following privacy concerns from Mac users after Apple’s Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) server went down, </a>thus causing third-party applications unable to open on Macs, Apple has now responded to the situation,&nbsp; exacerbated by a recent blog post by Jeffrey Paul.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>An Apple spokesperson told<em> iPhone in Canada</em> it had updated its support document, ‘Safely open apps on your Mac’, to now further detail its privacy protections.</p>
<p>“Gatekeeper performs online checks to verify if an app contains known malware and whether the developer’s signing certificate is revoked,” <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">explains</a> Apple. “We have never&nbsp;combined data from these checks with information about Apple users or their devices. We do not use data from these checks to learn what individual users are&nbsp;launching or running on their devices,” clarified the company.</p>
<p>“Notarization checks if the app contains known malware using an encrypted connection that is resilient to server failures,” says Apple, further emphasizing, “These security checks have never included the user’s Apple ID or the identity of their device. To further protect privacy, we have stopped logging IP addresses&nbsp;associated with Developer ID certificate checks, and we will ensure that any collected IP addresses are removed from logs,” details Apple.</p>
<p>On top of this, Apple says “over the next year we will introduce several changes to our security checks,” specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new encrypted protocol for Developer ID certificate revocation checks</li>
<li>strong protections against server failure</li>
<li>a new preference for users to opt out of these security protections</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple also gave some further technical information on the situation to <em>iPhone in Canada.</em> Certificate revocation checks occur to verify that Developer ID certificates used to sign an app have not been revoked by the company. The move is critical for security since a certificate may be pulled if a developer suspects it has been compromised by third parties, or is being used to sign malicious apps.</p>
<p>The industry-standard online certificate status protocol (OCSP) is used by macOS to verify that the Developer ID code signing certificate issued to an app developer has not been revoked. This OCSP request does not include the Apple ID of the user, or reveal a device or app being launched.</p>
<p>Apple says since OCSP is used to check other certificates, including those used to encrypted web connections, these requests happen over unencrypted HTTP, as normal throughout the industry.</p>
<p>HTTP is used to prevent&nbsp;situations where verifying the validity of the certificate that secures the connection to an OCSP server would potentially depend on the result of a request to that same&nbsp;OCSP server, creating a loop that would make it impossible to resolve the request, according to Apple.</p>
<p>Apple says on macOS Catalina and later, by default, all apps running are notarized by the company to note they have been checked by Apple for known malicious software. When an app launches, macOS will check to verify that the app has not been labeled as malicious by Apple since it was first notarized. These checks happen over an encrypted connection—and are resilient to server failures. Which is what happened the other day and users saw their apps hang and take forever to launch.</p>
<p>What caused the OCSP server problem? Apple says it was due to a server-side misconfiguration that specifically interfered with macOS being able to cache OCSP responses for Developer ID. This configuration error, along with an unrelated content delivery network (CDN) misconfiguration, is what caused the slow performance for apps to launch.</p>
<p>Apple explained to <em>iPhone in Canada</em> it has already fixed this performance issue through a server-side update, that will now allow macOS to cache Developer ID OCSP checks for a longer period. macOS users do not need to do anything to benefit from this Apple update.</p>
<p>App notarization checks are used to verify that apps being launched in macOS have not been found to be malicious by Apple, since they were first notarized. Apple says these checks take place over an encrypted connection and are immune to server failures. Notarization checks were not affected by the server-side issue that caused OCSP requests to fail.</p>

November 15, 2020 | https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/100-paying-customers/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/100-paying-customers/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span></span>
<span>172</span>
</p>
<p>Yesterday, we got our 100th paying customer for Hyvor Talk. As an independent bootstrapped product, this is a huge milestone.</p>
<h2>History of Hyvor Talk</h2>
<p>In 2018, I was learning web development and wrote my journey on my blog. I wanted to add comments to that blog and the most popular option was Disqus. I went with it, and Disqus started showing ads on my website after a while. That was not nice. I didn’t like Disqus’s UI either. And, Disqus has <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/move-away-from-disqus/">serious privacy concerns</a>. So, I coded my own commenting system. I didn’t have any plans to make it a SaaS product – I just needed commenting functionality for my blog. However, if someone wanted, I added an option to log in and use the system on their website.</p>
<p>I bought the <strong>hyvor.com</strong> domain a long time ago, having the dream of creating a successful brand called “Hyvor”. Even I wasn’t sure this side project was the way to build this brand, I published it as a product of Hyvor, naming it Hyvor Talk. Until 2020, it was free and a few bloggers used it. I published it on a few startup directories and got a little traction. But, the product wasn’t attractive at this time. And, it was just a side project with no intention of making money from it.</p>
<h2>Working Full-time and Adding Subscriptions</h2>
<p>In January this year (2020), I started working full-time on Hyvor Talk with my partner, Ishini. Both of us were just 19 years old, finished school, no much work to do. So, we could completely focus on Hyvor Talk. We added some cool features and created a better landing page.</p>
<p>The next thing was adding subscriptions. Here we stuck. Paypal and Stripe don’t support Sri Lanka. One option was registering the business in the US and using Stripe, which was expensive for us. However, thankfully, we found Paddle.com, which is built only for SaaS (We won’t be here without Paddle!)</p>
<p>Then, we added two paid plans: $40/month and $1000/month (Yes, not flexible). We worked so hard on the product (almost 16-18 hours a day) in January, sharing on forums, spamming on Facebook Groups. Nothing worked. At this time, we had zero knowledge of marketing. So, we struggled.</p>
<h2>It’s March, 1000s of Hours of Work, 0 Paid Users</h2>
<p>It was March. We’ve worked endless hours of work. No paid customers. Only a few free plan users, who just tested the system and went away. Maybe we were doing something wrong? Maybe the product wasn’t so good? Maybe there wasn’t a market for a new commenting platform? So many things came up to our minds. At this time, I was freelancing to make money and spending that for hosting, paid promotions, etc.</p>
<p>We made $0 in two months. In the first week of March, I asked Ishini “should we continue this?”. We were like yes, no, yes, no, yes, no… However, we decided not to give up because we believed in ourselves and our product. We made more features. Changed landing pages, tried different acquisition channels, and did everything we could.</p>
<h2>The First Paying User</h2>
<p>March 23rd was the day! We got our first paid customer who subscribed to our $40/month plan. We celebrated this like we just won the whole world. Now, we spend $5 for hosting and earn $40 per month. Yay, profitable (kind of). This made us feel very happy. Yes, $35 cannot do much, but if you are a bootstrapper, you know how it feels.</p>
<h2>Changing Pricing &amp; Growth</h2>
<p>We also made pricing more flexible in April. We added two types of plans called Premium (from $5/month) and Business (from $35/month). We got a few free plan users and paid customers. Still, we were on the edge of the sword. However, we started to see a growth in organic traffic to our articles on this blog.</p>
<p>Then, in May, our first employee, Rohitha, joined our team for content marketing. This had a huge impact on our growth. I could focus on the development part, Ishini did the designing and graphics, Rohitha worked on content writing, which is a great funnel for a small team like us.</p>
<p>At this moment, most of the new users come through Google. Besides that, we also see a lot of users directly coming to our website, starting the trial, and subscribing to paid plans on the first day of trial. Even I’m not sure, I think this is “word of mouth”.</p>
<h2>Removing the Free Plan</h2>
<p>When September started, we had 53 paying customers. At this point, we were fully profitable. After a lot of discussions, we made the decision to remove the free plan for some reasons. Since the start, we thought we would remove the free plan someday. However, it happened earlier than we thought because our free plan user base started to grow faster, and converting them to paid is a huge hassle (I’ll explain why it’s hard to have a free plan for a pageviews-based pricing model in a future post).</p>
<p>We removed the free plan on September 5th. And, our growth since then is tremendous. We had 56 customers then (from March to September, 6 months). We almost doubled the number in just 2 months.</p>

<h2>What to take from this story?</h2>
<p>If you are reading this article, probably you are an <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/start">indiehacker</a>, or willing to be one someday. Here are some things I believe as a bootstrapper, which might be helpful for you.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Learn but don’t imitate</strong>: Read other’s stories. But, do not imitate them! Create your own story. For example, product X shared their story to 1m ARR in 2 years. You don’t have to do the same thing. Do it at your own pace in your own way. Try everything and find the best way that fits you. Most importantly, don’t give up.</li><li><strong>Make decisions carefully</strong>: I turned down AppSumo promotion, multiple investing requests just to be fully independent. Also, removing the free plan (a very hard decision) accelerated our growth. You don’t have to do the same. Do what you think is correct. Don’t be afraid to make hard decisions in the first couple of months.</li><li><strong>Improve your product</strong>: Get feedback from your customers and improve the product. For example, we have a great discord community of ~100 website owners who give us feedback to improve our product. Our best features were suggested by these users.</li></ul>
<p>Finally, I want to thank each of our customers for believing in us throughout this journey. Leave any questions below in the comments section.</p>
<p>PS: We do not disclose our MRR/ARR.</p>

			<p>Do you remember the Guardian article written by a robot? It was the work of the new and powerful GPT-3.</p>
<h2><strong>What is GPT-3?</strong></h2>
<p>GPT-3 is a text generation technology developed by OpenAI, a well-known artificial intelligence research company founded by Elon Musk.</p>
<p>At the moment, not everyone can get access to it. OpenAI wants to ensure that no one misuses it. This is why it is available to only selected people.</p>
<p>As an SEO professional, I was excited to use GPT-3 in ways that can help the people in the SEO industry.</p>
<p>Before wasting any time, I decided to do whatever it takes to get my hands on GPT-3.</p>
<h2>Here is how I got access to GPT-3:</h2>
<h3><strong>OpenAI API waitlist form</strong></h3>
<p>I first applied for GPT-3 API through OpenAI’s official Waitlist form. On the form, I mentioned the intended purpose and the details about my project.</p>
<p><img src="https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access.jpg" alt="OpenAI API Access - How I Got Access to GPT-3 and How Can You too!" width="1868" height="851" srcset="https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access.jpg 1868w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-300x137.jpg 300w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1024x467.jpg 1024w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-150x68.jpg 150w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-768x350.jpg 768w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-500x228.jpg 500w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-800x364.jpg 800w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1280x583.jpg 1280w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1536x700.jpg 1536w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-848x386.jpg 848w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1140x519.jpg 1140w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1170x533.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1868px) 100vw, 1868px" title="How I Got Access to GPT-3 and How Can You too!"></p>
<p>After applying, I anxiously waited to get a response. Two days had passed, but no response came.</p>
<p>I sent a follow-up email. Still, no reply… A week had gone, though, no progress was made.</p>
<h3><strong>Go the extra mile and show that you are serious</strong></h3>
<p>My frustration was growing. But I thought there must be something missing. So, I thought of exploring Twitter and seeing if any users got access to it.</p>
<p>There, I read the tweets of a few people who were able to get GPT-3 access. Their advice was to ‘go the extra mile’ so that the OpenAI engineer or the Chairman can get your attention, and they can see that you are serious.</p>
<p>So, this is what I did:</p>
<ul><li>Purchased a fancy domain for my intended project.</li>
<li>Designed a demo landing page along with a small animation – just to give a glimpse of what’s in store. And how my idea can benefit people.</li>
<li>Tweeted about my project with a video and tagged OpenAI chairman. After only 10 minutes, I received a reply from him asking me for my email. And boom, I got access.</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/gdb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@gdb</a> Hi Greg. My <a href="https://t.co/iibYGMW3Xv" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/iibYGMW3Xv</a> project is still awaiting GPT-3 access.</p>
<p>Is there a way that you maybe able to expedite the process? <a href="https://t.co/J2NeDvbgHF" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/J2NeDvbgHF</a></p>
<p>— Ashar Jamil (@Asharjamil) <a href="https://twitter.com/Asharjamil/status/1317163403681693699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">October 16, 2020</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>It took some effort, but it was worth it. Filling the application form with beneficial intended purposes will not be enough. You will have to make an extra effort and show that you mean business.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to get access to GPT-3, my advice will be to showcase your project demo; and invest a little in your project so that it looks professional. It will increase your chances of getting access.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that you have to work for it.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>How AI Engineers Can Build Business-Centric Models</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.artiba.org/Content/Images/business-centric-models.jpg" title=""></p>

<p><i><b>Can AI engineers produce a model built to succeed? Is there a fine line between AI research ambitions and business goals?</b></i></p><p>We will see this and more here.</p><p>In pursuit of successes like Alibaba and Amazon, the business fraternity the world over is enraptured for AI models. AI is not the buzzword these days, it is THE word!</p><p>But, here is the flip side.</p><p>Many AI models fail to create a meaningful impact and stop at pilot projects or a single business process. Two common misalignments are at the root of this loss:</p><ul><li><p>AI model disconnected with business needs</p></li><li><p>Business leaders’ expectation of AI being a plug-and-play solution with immediate results</p></li></ul><p>AI models are costly, and their failure results in lost motivation and interest in future projects. So, it is both the privilege and the prerogative of AI engineers to lay all stones to success for their project.</p><p>Champions in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artiba.org/blog/ai-led-manufacturing-in-industry-4">Artificial Intelligence</a> have laid a common success route.  We’ve covered it here. Check it out. It can save the day for you.</p><h4>Types of AI Business models</h4><p>A business-aligned AI model is:</p><ul><li><p>Cost-effective</p></li><li><p>Quick</p></li><li><p>Useful</p></li></ul><p>Three types of AI business models are common:</p><h4>Bolt-on:</h4><p> In their deployments, these models resemble a product from a SaaS company. Bolt-on models build on top of other systems of record, like an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system or a customer relationship management (CRM) product. AI administers data flowing through these systems, feeding business improvements over time.</p><p> Use cases: Chorus AI, Gong, and Solvy</p><h4>Process enhancements:</h4><p>They turbocharge the performance of existing processes. These models are tricky to implement, and their sales cycles are long, but if successful they are incredibly successful in upselling. Their ROI can be unlimited.</p><p>Use cases: Ayasdi, IBM Watson, and H2O.AI</p><h4>Standalone models:</h4><p>These models work on their own with little human intervention. Hardware is costly and central to these models. They sell subscription packages to organizations.</p><p>Use cases: Kespry</p><h4> 6 Steps to Create the Best Performing AI Models</h4><p> The best way to approach an AI model is to minimize the process-associated risks. It can be done by following six steps.</p><p><img src="https://www.artiba.org/Content/Images/best-performing-ai-models.jpg" title=""></p><h4>#1. Plan</h4><p> Many <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artiba.org/blog/ai-chatbots-business-applications-for-ai-engineers">AI engineers</a> bypass this stage and jump straight to execution. Any disconnect at this stage means upping the chances of failure manifold.</p><p>  Before going forward with a concept, the AI engineer must identify the business need.</p><p> To do so, analyze recent customer journeys like discovery, sales, presales, and customer service. Understand the experience of your customers with your brand. Look for pain points. Ask who are going to be the end-users of your solution and interact with them.</p><p>  “Your business results depend on your brand’s ability to retain and add customers.” – Olive Huang, Research Director at Gartner</p><p> Zero in on specific business problems and find out how your model can solve those problems. Once you build an algorithm to solve a specific business problem, it can be easily adapted for use in other areas.</p><h4>#2. Validate:</h4><p>  Read ongoing research and successful use cases extensively. See if the problem has already been addressed by some other model. The annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) gives information on the latest developments.</p><p> Datasets could be another source of ideas. Look for open and your own datasets. Think if you need to remake your competitor’s processes, how would you make them? What new functions would you include?</p><h4>#3. Refine</h4><p>Once you pick an idea, develop it in these four steps:</p><p><b>Start simple:</b>Begin with mundane, manual tasks that can be done with little human thought.</p><p><b>Validate risks:</b> Evaluate the risk if the project fails.</p><p><b>Build a proof of concept:</b> Establish the feasibility of the project.</p><p><b>Take feedback from the user group:</b> Are they excited about the solution? If not, try to educate them. Your user groups are integral to the success of your model.</p><h4>#4. Implement</h4><p>Distribute the risks by working on multiple ideas at one time. Treat the failure cost as sunk investments. Invest more in less-risky ideas and stop the failing ones.</p><p> Take care of Time to Value and the Return on Investment. By doing so, you can keep the business stakeholders invested in your projects.</p><p>Don’t build everything from scratch. Consider using pre-made blocks. This will reduce the time to value.</p><p>Update yourself with the latest tools as they keep evolving.</p><p><img src="https://www.artiba.org/Content/Images/tool-use.jpg" title=""></p><h4>#5. Establish Controls:</h4><p>Fix control points in your research projects:</p><ul><li><p>Use clean data</p></li><li><p>Establish the success criteria as to when to stop because research can easily turn into an endless process.</p></li></ul><h4>#6. Educate as you Move Forward:</h4><p>Businesses look for 100 percent results; tech research doesn’t promise anything. Educate your users as you move ahead with your project.</p><p>To ensure the success of an AI model, both AI engineers and business stakeholders need to see the project from a similar vantage point.  Have you established one?</p>

<p>Automatic dependent surveillance–broadcast&nbsp;(ADS-B) technology enables aircraft to&nbsp;determine their position via satellite and periodically broadcast this location information. An ADS-B receiver system can be used to decode this broadcast signal to track airplanes. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1024x576.png" alt="" width="473" height="266" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px"><figcaption>The ADS-B System</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now let’s take a look at the various components of an ADS-B station, why they matter, and how to make improvements. </p>



<h2><strong>ADS-B Receiver</strong></h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/10/21/the-best-ads-b-receiver-for-2020-2021/">this article we previously discussed the different ADS-B receivers</a> on the market today. Systems like the one from <a href="https://amzn.to/36E08h1">Garmin</a> are completely closed and fully integrated and there’s not much opportunity to understand how they work or improve them. The best you can do is use them as per the manufacturer’s recommendation and that should result in the best performance for this product.</p>







<p>On the other hand, there’s plenty of opportunity to learn from open systems based on  either the <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> or the <a href="https://amzn.to/3kzQa59">Stratux ADS-B receivers</a>. </p>







<p>Both these systems use <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> as foundational building blocks. There’s a wealth of information online on the internal architecture and various experiments conducted on these products to understand their specifications, performance and how best to use them. There’s also a large online community to learn from and contribute to. </p>



<h2>How Much ADS-B Signal Do You Really Need?</h2>



<p>In general when a receiver processes signals, there is a range of optimal signal level over which it performs best. Anything lower will result in performance degradation – in other words, you will see fewer airplanes. Anything greater will have the same effect. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-1024x677.png" alt="" width="495" height="327" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-1024x677.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-300x198.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-768x508.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS.png 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px"><figcaption>Different ADS-B Signal Ranges </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the very extreme, signal levels higher than a certain level will damage the ADS-B receiver. The trick then is to optimize the signal level such that you can get to within the sweet spot of the ADS-B receiver. </p>



<h2><strong>A Note on Measuring Signals </strong></h2>



<p>In general, it is very difficult to predict actual wireless signal strengths received without making a measurement. Typically a spectrum analyzer is used to make signal measurements at any given frequency. However, not everyone can afford a spectrum analyzer or has access to one. Fortunately it is possible to use an application like SDR# with your receiver to determine how strong or weak various received signals actually are and the impact they might be having on performance.</p>



<p>Here is an example of signal measurement with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> as viewed in SDR#. The two views shown are the FFT view and the waterfall or spectrogram below it.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="593" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-1024x593.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-1024x593.jpg 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-768x445.jpg 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before.jpg 1916w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>FM signals measured with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>As you experiment with different antennas and other components below, tune across the frequency range of <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> to check out various signals and their strengths in the waterfall view. This will give you an idea of how your changes impact performance. It will for instance tell you approximately how much gain you need to add up front. It will also tell you if you actually need any amplification at all. In general avoid doing anything that increases the <strong><span>RED</span></strong> levels as these are very strong signals. </p>



<p>Now let’s take a look at the various parts of the ADS-B system and how they impact performance.</p>



<h2>Antennas</h2>



<p>The antenna is at the very front-end of your ADS-B system. You will need an effective <a href="https://amzn.to/3cyPXNr">antenna for ADS-B</a> as it is key to good signal reception. As is often said, garbage in, garbage out. If you use a lousy antenna, a good receiver isn’t going to compensate for it. You can read our complete <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/04/19/best-antennas-for-ads-b-reception/">review of ADS-B antennas</a>. The best antenna requires some effort for installation and optimization but it’s well worth the time spent. </p>



<h2>RF Cables</h2>



<p>If you’re looking to mount your antenna on your rooftop or on a tower for better reception, you will need to take the length of the RF cable from the antenna to your ADS-B receiver into consideration. Why is that?</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1024x576.png" alt="" width="553" height="311" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px"><figcaption>Installing an Antenna on your Rooftop</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As the frequency of the signal increases, so do the signal losses or attenuation due to any given length of cable. For instance, if you were to use <a href="https://amzn.to/36DJJcj">LMR-400 cable</a>, the loss at 30 MHz is only 0.7 dB for every 100 ft of cable. For the same length of cable, the loss at 1090 MHz is around 4 dB. This signal loss directly impacts the sensitivity of the system by 4 dB and therefore reduces the range of your ADS-B receiver by more than half relative to if you were to use a very short length of cable. That is quite significant.</p>



<h2>Amplifiers</h2>



<p>Fortunately there is a way to compensate for this degradation in sensitivity due to cable loss. It involves the use of a low noise amplifier (LNA). In general, any LNA with sufficiently low noise figure (typically less than 1 dB) and the required amount of gain can be used. </p>



<p>So the first question is – what is the required gain? </p>



<p>The answer depends on several factors some of which are:</p>



<ul><li>Amount of cable loss at 1090 MHz</li><li>Other RF signals are present in your environment – in particular strong ones</li><li>The dynamic and operating range of your ADS-B receiver</li></ul>



<p>As discussed, cable loss can be overcome with the use of an LNA. However, an LNA will amplify everything within its range of operation. It will amplify AM, FM and other signals. Consider a situation where an FM signal is stronger than the ADS-B signal of interest. The amplified signal will saturate the receiver if it exceeds the dynamic range. The signal will also possibly damage the receiver if you’re operating at signal levels that exceed the range of the receiver. The receiver will not be able to process the ADS-B signal of interest in either case.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1024x576.png" alt="Block diagram showing ADS-B signal amplified" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Amplifying an ADS-B signal</figcaption></figure>



<p>A solution to this problem is to use a Filtered LNA. This is an LNA with a filter integrated along with it as shown in the picture below.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1024x576.png" alt="Filtered LNA for ADS-B" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Filtered Low Noise Amplifier for ADS-B</figcaption></figure>



<p>The LNA is usually the first component and it is followed by a filter specific to the band of interest – in this case 1090 MHz for ADS-B. This product will reject all signals outside the ADS-B frequency range. For instance it will reject strong FM signals, 4G signals from cellular base stations, signals at 2.4 GHz from your Wi-Fi access point and more. </p>



<p>Here are a couple of ADS-B filtered LNAs that will work depending on your setup.</p>







<p>Use <a href="https://gpio.com/collections/filtered-low-noise-amplifier/products/ads-b-filtered-dual-low-noise-amplifier-lna-with-30-db-gain">this Filtered LNA with 30 dB gain</a> if you have a very long cable run and need to compensate for significant signal loss. Using the calculation for LMR400 above, this Filtered LNA can compensate for 700 ft of cable loss. </p>



<p>Use <a href="https://gpio.com/collections/filtered-low-noise-amplifier/products/ads-b-filtered-low-noise-amplifier-lna-with-15-db-gain">this Filtered LNA that provides 15 dB gain</a>, if you have a shorter cable run. </p>



<h3><strong>How to Install an LNA</strong></h3>



<p>It is best to place the LNA very close to the antenna. This will help minimize the noise figure and improve the sensitivity of your ADS-B receiver system. Since it’s difficult to get a power source or supply at the top of an antenna, <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/01/19/what-is-a-bias-tee/">a bias tee system</a> can be used. A bias tee at the receiver is used to send the DC voltage up to the LNA over the RF cable connecting the two. At the LNA there is a reciprocal bias tee that splits the DC and RF signals. The DC is used to power the LNA. The block diagram below shows a situation where the SDR has a built-in bias tee. This is indeed the case with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Use a Bias Tee to Power a Remote LNA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes when an LNA is connected the results look like in the following picture – amazing results with a tripling of the number of planes observed!</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement.jpg 940w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"><figcaption>Improvement in Number of Planes Tracked</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At other times, the addition of an LNA degrades performance and you will not be able to see any airplanes. Why does this happen? Let’s assume that your LNA is connected properly with the RF input end connected to the antenna and that it is powered correctly. There are then two possibilities:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Too much cable loss</strong> and the amount of LNA gain cannot help overcome this degradation. In this situation more gain is required and you can simply add another LNA. Remember to place the first LNA as close to the antenna as possible so as to minimize noise figure. Remember also to check signal levels so you can adjust the amplitude to be within the optimal range. </li><li><strong>Too much gain </strong>and you are likely saturating your receiver with strong signals. Note that even when using a filtered LNA, if the FM signals in your area are very strong, the out-of-band attenuation due to the filter might not be adequate to prevent receiver saturation. Once again you can check what’s going on with the spectrum analyzer view in SDR#. </li></ul>



<h3><strong>How to Optimize the Signal Levels into the RTL-SDR</strong></h3>



<p>There are three methods by which you can optimize signal levels going into the RTL-SDR after the addition of a Filtered LNA.</p>



<p>In the event that you have strong out-of-band signals, they should be attenuated to a reasonable level. The easiest way to do this is by adding an additional <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/gpio/ads-b-bandpass-filter-band-pass-1090-mhz-ads-b/">ADS-B bandpass filter</a> after the Filtered LNA.</p>



<p>Another way to optimize gain is to reduce the signal level across the band with an attenuator. Connect <a href="https://amzn.to/2K4a4IY">an inline fixed attenuator</a> to the output of the LNA. You can experiment with different values such as 30 dB, 20 dB, etc. until you start seeing output by way of planes. </p>







<p>The third method is to adjust the gain in the Flightaware stick digitally. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> stick is essentially an <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">RTL-SDR</a> and utilizes an R802T chipset. Below is a block diagram of the R802T.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-1024x689.png" alt="" width="540" height="363" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-1024x689.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-300x202.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-768x517.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block.png 1498w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"><figcaption>R802T Architecture</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see the user has the ability to modify the Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA). The range over which this can be varied is nearly 50 dB. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> powers up with maximum amplification in the system. So you essentially have to adjust it to a point where you get the best reception. <a href="https://discussions.flightaware.com/t/for-beginners-how-to-set-change-gain/30201">Here are instructions on how to modify the gain</a>. </p>



<p>Many experiments have been conducted and reported on the <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> discussion site. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://discussions.flightaware.com/t/gain-adjustment/18376/7" target="_blank">Here is one such discussion</a>. In the plot below, user BartJr has reported an improvement in reception with increase in amplification.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two days ago, macOS users experienced worrying hangs when opening applications not downloaded from the Mac App Store. Many users suspected hardware issues with their devices, but as they took to social media, they found it was a widespread problem. And it was no coincidence that it was happening so soon after the launch of macOS “Big Sur”.</p>

<p>Eventually, <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1326990296412991489">a tweet by Jeff Johnson</a> pinpointed the underlying issue. Apple’s “OCSP Responder” service was overloaded, therefore macOS was unable to verify app developers’ cryptographic certificates.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-tweet.png?style=centerme" alt="Jeff Johnson's tweet"></p>

<p>But why are OCSP Responders in the critical path of apps launching? This post will briefly discuss code signing, how Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) works, why it’s deeply flawed, and what are some better alternatives. Unlike other posts on this incident, I want to emphasise the practical crypto aspects (at a high level) and offer a balanced perspective.</p>

<h3 id="code-signing">Code Signing</h3>

<p>On their developer portal, Apple explain <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/">the purpose of code signing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code signing your app assures users that it is from a known source and the app hasn’t been modified since it was last signed. Before your app can integrate app services, be installed on a device, or be submitted to the App Store, it must be signed with a certificate issued by Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if developers want their apps to be trusted on macOS, they must sign them using their own certificate keypair. Keychain is used to generate a unique “Developer ID” certificate, which includes a private key for the developer to use, and a public key for distribution. After Apple have signed the Developer ID certificate, the developer can use the private key to produce cryptographic signatures on their apps as part of their release process.</p>

<p>When you run an app, its signature is verified against the public key of the developer’s certificate. Then, the certificate itself is verified, by checking that it hasn’t expired yet (certificates are typically valid for 1 year), and that it’s ultimately signed by Apple’s root certificate. There may also be intermediate certificates as part of the chain up to the root certificate. A “chain of trust” has been created, because the developer ID certificate signed an app, an intermediate certificate signed the developer ID certificate, and Apple’s root certificate signed the intermediate certificate. Any Apple device can verify this chain of trust and therefore approve an app to run.</p>

<p>This is similar to the TLS Public Key Infrastructure used on the internet. But it’s also fundamentally different since Apple has total control over its own chain of trust. Other certificate authorities are not allowed to issue valid certificates for code signing as all certificates must chain back up to Apple.</p>

<p>If the verification process wasn’t successful, then users will see a scary dialogue which is difficult to bypass:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-failed-verify.png?style=centerme" alt="Apple failed to verify popup"></p>

<h3 id="revocation">Revocation</h3>

<p>What happens when a developer is found to be breaching Apple’s rules, or loses control of their private key? A certificate authority needs to be able to instantly nullify bad certificates they’ve issued. If a certificate is being used maliciously, it’s not acceptable to wait days or months until it expires naturally, otherwise a leak of a high-profile private key would render the whole system useless.</p>

<p>This is where certificate revocation comes in. It’s an additional step in the signature verification process, which involves finding out from the certificate authority if a certificate is still valid.</p>

<p>Originally, at least on the web, this was done the simplest way you can imagine. The certificate authority would give you a Certificate Revocation List (CRL), containing serial numbers of all revoked certificates, and you could check the certificate you are currently verifying is not on the list. However, this approach stopped being used by web browsers since the list got longer and longer and failed to scale. Especially after terrifying exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> demanded mass revocation of certificates.</p>

<p>Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an alternative allowing real-time checking of certificates. Each certificate can include a baked-in “OCSP Responder”, a URL that you can query that will report whether the certificate has been revoked. In Apple’s case, that’s “ocsp.apple.com”. So now, in addition to verifying the cryptographic validity of the signature, each time you launch an app you’re performing a real-time check with Apple (subject to some caching) to ensure they still think the developer’s ID certificate is legitimate.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-availability-problem">OCSP’s Availability Problem</h3>

<p>There’s a huge problem with OCSP: it makes an external service a single point of failure. What happens if the OCSP Responder is down or unreachable? Do we just refuse to verify the certificate (hard-fail)? Or do we pretend that the check was successful (soft-fail)?</p>

<p>Apple are forced to use the soft-fail behaviour, otherwise apps wouldn’t work when you’re offline. As it happens, all major browsers also implement the soft-fail behaviour, since OCSP Responders have traditionally been unreliable, and browsers want to keep displaying websites even if certificate authorities’ responders are temporarily down.</p>

<p>But soft-fail isn’t great, because it means that an attacker with network control can block requests to the responder, and the revocation check will be skipped. In fact, that was the hotfix widely shared on Twitter during this incident: blackhole traffic to “ocsp.apple.com” by adding a line to <em>/etc/hosts</em>. A lot of people won’t be removing that line anytime soon, since disabling OCSP doesn’t cause any noticeable problems.</p>

<h3 id="the-incident">The Incident</h3>

<p>If Apple’s OCSP check was built to soft-fail, then why did apps hang when the OCSP Responder was down? Probably because this was actually a different failure case: the OCSP Responder was not completely down, it was performing badly.</p>

<p>Due to the load added by millions of users worldwide upgrading to macOS “Big Sur”, Apple’s servers slowed to a crawl, and although they weren’t properly answering OCSP queries, they were working just enough that the soft-fail didn’t trigger.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-privacy-problem">OCSP’s Privacy Problem</h3>

<p>In addition to OCSP’s availability problems, the protocol wasn’t initially designed with privacy in mind. A basic OCSP query involves an unencrypted HTTP request to the OCSP Responder with the serial number of the certificate. Therefore not only can the responder figure out what certificate you are interested in, but so can your ISP and anybody else intercepting packets. Apple could use this to build a timeline of which developers’ apps you are opening, as could third parties.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-ocsp-wireshark.jpg?style=centerme" alt="OCSP packet in wireshark"></p>

<p>Adding encryption is possible, and there’s a better, more private version called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling">OCSP stapling</a>, but Apple is not using either of these things. In fact OSCP stapling wouldn’t make sense in this scenario, but it illustrates how OCSP needs improvements to not leak data by default.</p>

<h3 id="a-better-future">A Better Future</h3>

<p>This incident has started a lively debate in the software community, with one side proclaiming <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">“Your Computer Isn’t Yours”</a> and the other arguing that <a href="https://www.security-embedded.com/blog/2020/11/14/application-trust-is-hard-but-apple-does-it-well">“application trust is hard but Apple does it well”</a>. This post aims to show that whichever side you agree with, OCSP is a terrible way to manage certificate revocation, and will lead to more availability and privacy incidents in future. In my opinion, it was a poor engineering decision for Apple to make app launching dependent on OCSP. In the short term at least they have mitigated the damage by <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/ocsp.html">increasing the time that responses are cached</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a better revocation method is reaching maturity. CRLite is a way to shrink down lists of all revoked certificates to a reasonable size. <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/crlite-finally-a-fix-for-broken-revocation/">Scott Helme’s blog</a> gives a good summary of how CRLite uses Bloom Filters to make the Certificate Revocation List approach – which OCSP superseded – feasible again.</p>

<p>Theoretically, macOS devices could pull updates to this list periodically and do certificate revocation checking on the device itself, addressing the availability and privacy problems with OCSP. On the other hand, since the list of revoked Developer ID certificates is much smaller than the list of all revoked PKI certificates, it’s worth asking why Apple haven’t opted to use CRLs in the first place. Perhaps they don’t want to reveal any information about which certificates they’ve revoked.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, the incident this week was a good time to reflect on the trust model that has been promoted by organisations like Apple and Microsoft. Malware has grown in sophistication and most people aren’t in a position to judge whether it’s safe to run particular binaries. Code signing seems like a neat way to leverage cryptography to determine whether or not to trust applications, and to at least associate apps with known developers. And revocation is a necessary part of maintaining that trust.</p>

<p>However, by adding several mundane failure modes to the verification process, OCSP spoils any cryptographic elegance the code signing and verifying process has. While OCSP is also widely used for TLS certificates on the internet, the large number of PKI certificate authorities and relaxed attitude of browsers means that failures are less catastrophic. Moreover, people are accustomed to seeing websites become unavailable from time to time, but they don’t expect the same from apps on their own devices. macOS users were alarmed at how their apps could become collateral damage for an infrastructure issue at Apple. Yet this was an inevitable outcome arising from the fact that certificate verification depends on external infrastructure, and no infrastructure is 100% reliable.</p>

<p>Scott Helme also has concerns about the power that Certificate Authorities gain when certification revocation actually works effectively. Even if you aren’t bothered about the potential for censorship, there will be occasional mistakes and these must be weighed against the security benefits. As one developer discovered when <a href="https://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-day-without-business/">Apple mistakenly revoked his certificate</a>, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In his video message on his prayer intention for November, Pope Francis emphasizes that progress in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) be oriented “towards respecting the dignity of the person and of Creation”.</p><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><b><i>By Vatican News staff writer</i></b></p> 
<p>During the month of November, Pope Francis draws our attention to the epochal change that humanity is experiencing thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. &nbsp;He, therefore, invites us to pray that this progress always “serve humankind,” respecting human dignity and taking care of Creation.</p> 
<h2><b>True progress</b></h2> 
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made exponential advances, as evidenced by its many applications in different fields of knowledge. Today, 37% of organizations in the world have implemented AI in some way (which represents a 270% increase in the past four years).</p> 
<p>In “<a href="https://thepopevideo.org/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">The Pope Video</a>” this month, Pope Francis clarifies that this progress in robotics and AI “can make a better world possible if it is joined to the common good.” &nbsp;In this sense, he hopes for technological progress that does not increase the inequalities in society.&nbsp; If it does, the Pope says, it will not be “true progress”.&nbsp; Such progress does not take into account the dignity of the human person and care for Creation.</p> 
<h2><b>Benefits</b></h2> 
<p>AI is capable of addressing many problems facing humanity, such as in evaluating the learning capacity of students, in order to detect opportunities for improvement.&nbsp; It can help people with visual or hearing impairments by developing better communication tools (such as converting text to speech or speech to text).&nbsp; AI can also speed up the collection, processing and diffusion of health data to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients, especially those living in remote areas.</p> 
<p>The same applies to the field of ecology. Through AI, it is possible to analyze data on climate change and create models that can help predict natural disasters. It can also be used to create intelligent and sustainable cities by reducing urban spending, improving the resilience of highways and increasing energy efficiency.&nbsp; There are vast possibilities for using this technological progress for the common good, and “The Pope Video” uses images from the Italian Institute of Technology and the Italian multinational energy company, Enel, to show some of these benefits.</p> 
<h2><b>Serving humanity&nbsp;</b></h2> 
<p>“Innovation,” says Enel’s CEO, Francesco Starace, “has placed at our disposition extraordinary tools that we need to be capable of using in the best possible way.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He continues, “As Pope Francis reaffirms, it is our task to ensure that the resulting benefits are distributed fairly and create opportunities and wellbeing.” Starace says, “In order to give a positive orientation to our actions and choices regarding the present and the future, we must put respect for people and for the environment at the centre, adopting a vision based on sustainability. Only in this way can technological evolution be an ally of humanity and create opportunities which, up until a few years ago, we couldn’t even imagine.”</p> 
<p>The Pope’s <a href="https://www.popesprayer.va/" rel="external">Worldwide Prayer Network</a> is responsible for the diffusion of the Pope’s monthly prayer intentions. &nbsp;In comments on the Holy Father’s prayer intention for November, the network’s international director, Jesuit Father Frédéric Fornos also speaks of the need to channel these rapid technological changes for the “good of all.”</p> 
<p>“This month’s prayer intention,” he says, “reinforces the idea that the benefit that humanity has obtained (and will continue to obtain) from technological progress must always take into account as well, and in parallel, ‘adequate development of responsibility and values’.”&nbsp; This, Fr Fornos says, has been underscored by the Pope in his encyclical <i>Laudato si’ </i>and now in his third encyclical, <i>Fratelli tutti,</i> where he says, “How wonderful it would be if the growth of scientific and technological innovation could come with more equality and social inclusion!”</p> 
<p>AI, robotics, and other applications of technology, says Fr Fornos, open great challenges for ethics and social justice. “This is why the Pope’s most recent petition is important: to pray that this progress will always ‘be human.’”</p> 
<p><b>The text of the November 2020 prayer intention:</b></p> 
<p><i>Artificial intelligence is at the heart of the epochal change we are experiencing.&nbsp; Robotics can make a better world possible if it is joined to the common good.&nbsp; Indeed, if technological progress increases inequalities, it is not true progress.&nbsp; Future advances should be oriented towards respecting the dignity of the person and of Creation.&nbsp;</i></p> 
<p><i>Let us pray that the progress of robotics and artificial intelligence may always serve humankind… we could say, may it “be human.”</i><br> </p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
      <div><p>If you're a lover of indoor gardening and still a newbie who don't understand how indoor gardening works, you first need to find different materials to learn from, right?</p><p>Well, during this learning process, you'll discover that indoor growth requires one piece of very essential equipment: <a href="http://www.medicgrow.com/" target="_blank" title="Medic grow led grow light" rel="noopener noreferrer">LED grow light</a>. Since these plants are grown in-house, they need a LED grow light that can mimic sunlight and drive photosynthesis.</p><p>You will see that many lights call themselves "best grow light," but there are actually four main types of these lights: Fluorescent grow lights, MH, HPS Bulbs, and LED lights.</p><p>If you read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grow_light" target="_blank" title="wikipedia grow light article" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia article about grow lights</a>, you'll find that LED&nbsp;lighting are by far the best ones. Needless to say, the first few traditional lamps have their own advantages; for example, they are cheap and can be bought just about anywhere. But their shortcomings are also obvious, like they emit too much heat, or the spectrum does not meet the needs of plants etc.</p><p>For some plants that require a lot of light to grow, those traditional lights&nbsp;can not compete with&nbsp;LED ones in some respects. In this blog we will list some basic knowledge on choosing a&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;LED plant-growth lighting.</p></div>
<h2>8&nbsp;Key Features&nbsp;You Should Know About&nbsp;LED Grow Lights</h2>
<h3><strong>1. PAR</strong></h3>
<p>PAR stands for "photosynthetic active radiation". <span>&nbsp;</span><span>It</span><span>&nbsp;is a metric used for plants while lumens are for humans.&nbsp; So plants don't care how bright your light fixture appears to you.&nbsp;PAR in lighting is the wavelength within the visible range of 400 to 700 nanometers (nm), and plants use this range to&nbsp;photosynthesise or grow.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/par-measurement.jpg?v=1605057977" alt="LED grow light PAR"></span></p>
<h3>
<br><strong>2. PPF&amp;PPFD</strong>
</h3>
<div><p>There are two phases related to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). These are photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD).</p><p>PPF simply describes the number of photons that led grow lamp produces in the PAR wavelength range within one second.</p></div>
<div><p>PPF is measured in units called micromoles (umol). You can use PPF to determine whether your grow light is "powerful enough" for your plants.</p><p>PPFD is the number of photons that hit the plant canopy in a given second. This is measured in micromoles (umols). The bigger of this value, the better.</p><p>The difference between PPF and PPFD is that PPF is the intensity of light when measured at the light source, while PPFD is the light intensity when measured at the surface of the plant.</p></div>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/ppf_and_ppfd_600x600.jpg?v=1605063210" alt="LED grow light PPF and PPFD"></p>
<h3>
<p><strong>3. Photon Efficacy</strong></p></h3>
<p>Photon efficacy is the measure of how well a light source produces visible light. The unit for efficacy is Joule per second (J/s). If you know the PPF and the input wattage of a light, you can easily calculate photon efficacy. The higher this number is, the more efficient a grow light is at converting electricity into photons. So be sure to check this out with a lighting manufacturer.</p>
<h3>
<br><strong>4. LED Chips</strong>
</h3>
<p><br>Chips are the most necessary and basic aspect of an LED grow lighting. Therefore, the manufacturing of chips must keep durability and efficiency in mind.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/products/IMG_20201023_152418_600x600.jpg?v=1604388543" alt="led chip"></p>
<div><p>The suitable LED chip will hardly show color inconsistency while maintaining voltage and intensity. A carefully crafted chip can produce effective and uniform LED lights that can support a variety of crops.</p><p>There are many LED chip brands you can pick from, such as Bridgelux, Philips, Epistar, CREE, or Osram. Among these, CREE and Osram are favored by many users due to their chip's durability and efficiency.</p></div>
<h3>
<br><strong>5. Spectrum</strong>
</h3>
<p>The spectrum refers to the electromagnetic wavelength of light generated by the light source to promote plant growth. In order to perform photosynthesis, plants use light in the PAR (photosynthesis active radiation) region, and the wavelength of this region (400nm-700nm) is measured in nanometers (nm).</p>
<div><p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/spectrum_600x600.jpg?v=1605063737" alt="LED grow light full spectrum"></p><p>The LED lighting stimulates the colors of the sunlight range from red and yellow to blue and violet, and plants use this full spectrum to undergo the process of photosynthesis.</p><p>The red and blue lights are the most critical for plants. Blue is for the vegetative stage while red is for blooming.</p></div>
<p>Other wavelengths besides red and blue are also beneficial for certain phases of plant growth.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet helps protect the plants from insects and diseases, and a bit more infrared light than normal makes your plants think they are covered by something so they need to grow taller to get more light.</p>
<div><p>Green light can penetrate farther into plants leaves and farther below the canopy than other wavelengths.</p><p>The ideal spectrum can help accelerate vegetation, increase flowering, speed up growth, etc. Whether or not the light source is supplementary (as with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse" target="_blank" title="greenhouse" rel="noopener noreferrer">greenhouse</a>) or the sole one will also affect which light spectrum should be used.</p><p>Therefore, getting an LED grow light with a full spectrum for your indoor plants means that it provides all the wavelengths present in natural light. All you need to do is switch the amount of light exposure the plants need during the different growth phases.</p></div>

<h3><strong>6. Heat Dissipation</strong></h3>
<p>Although LEDs emit less heat than other traditional grow lights, putting many LEDs together, they still need a heat dispassion system to keep the body cool at all times. Some best LED lights on the market have a heat sink to release extra heat. That means no noisy fans, and no wasted electricity by powering them.</p>
<h3>
<img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/Heat_Dissipation_600x600.jpg?v=1605065892" alt="LED grow light heat dissipation"><p><strong>7. Lighting Coverage</strong></p></h3>
<p>Each LED grow light you consider should have information regarding the lighting coverage. This refers to the coverage area, which is usually measured in square footage, of the light that falls onto the plants.</p>
<p>A good coverage area is essential, not only do the size and lenses of your LED grow light determine your coverage area, but so does hanging height. The further the distance between your lights and plants, the greater the footprint, but the lower the PPFD.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/led_grow_light_coverage_2_600x600.jpg?v=1605081160" alt="LED grow light coverage"></p>
<p>Let's say you have a lamp hanging at a 12-foot distance from your canopy. Then, you increase the hanging height to a distance of 24 feet. You will now have a light intensity that is&nbsp;much less of what it was before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why it's very important to pay attention to hanging height and coverage area when selecting an LED light.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Wattage</strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to LED grow-light wattage, this metric refers to two things. A 550w LED light can either indicate that it can truly pull 550w energy from the wall or it can deliver an equivalent power in brightness to a 550wMH/HID grow light.</p>
<p>So pay attention to exactly what is meant by an LED grow light's stated wattage. Our<a href="https://medicgrow.com/products/medic-grow-fold-8-led-grow-light" target="_blank" title="fold 8 led grow light" rel="noopener noreferrer"> LED grow light</a> can actually deliver what it says online.</p>
<h2>
<br>Conclusion</h2>
<div><p>If you're on a tight budget, you will need to pay attention to 1, 2, and 3. But if you have extra cash to spend, you can choose the best metric from 1 to 8. For indoor plants, artificial lighting is crucial as they have no access to natural sunlight.</p><p>Good lighting is an important factor that determines the yield of your plants as well as other factors, such as the strains you use and your planting experience etc.</p></div>
<p>If you focus on the above factors when picking an LED grow light, you can definitely get the best LED grow light for your plants. A suitable LED grow light will get the most bang for your buck when it comes to minimizing electrical costs while maximizing plant health.</p>

<p><strong><abbr title="Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act">PIPEDA</abbr> Report of Findings #2020-004</strong></p>
<p><strong>October 28, 2020</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc1">Overview</h2>
<p>The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (<abbr>OPC</abbr>), Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta (<abbr>OIPC AB</abbr>) and the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia (<abbr>OIPC BC</abbr>), collectively referred to as “the Offices” commenced a joint investigation<sup id="fn1-rf"><a href="#fn1"><span>Footnote </span>1</a></sup>,<sup id="fn2-rf"><a href="#fn2"><span>Footnote </span>2</a></sup> to examine whether The Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited (<abbr>CFCL</abbr>) was collecting and using personal information of visitors to its Canadian malls, without valid consent, via:</p>
<ol>
<li><!-- i. -->Anonymous Video Analytics (<abbr>AVA</abbr>) technology installed in “wayfinding” directories; and</li>
<li><!-- ii. -->mobile device geolocation tracking technologies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our findings in respect of these two issues are detailed below.</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> collected and used personal information, including sensitive biometric information, via the <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology without valid consent.</strong></p>
<p>The <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology: (i) took temporary digital images of the faces of any individual within the field of view of the camera in the directory (retained in computer memory briefly during processing); (ii) used facial recognition software to convert those images into biometric numerical representations of the individual faces (sensitive personal information that could be used to identify individuals based on their unique facial features); and (iii) used that information to assess age range and gender.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> represented that the numerical representations were not retained beyond processing. However, our investigation revealed that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> service provider had collected and stored approximately 5 million numerical representations of faces on <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s behalf, on a decommissioned server, for no apparent purpose and with no justification.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> explained that it collected information via <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> for purposes of monitoring foot traffic patterns and predicting demographic information about mall visitors. We found no evidence that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> had used the biometric information, including any of the retained numerical representations, for identification purposes.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> also retained approximately 16 hours of video recordings, some including audio, which it had captured during a calibration (or testing) phase of the technology at two malls.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> asserted that to the extent that it required consent, such consent was obtained via its privacy policy. We found that this was inadequate. Firstly, an individual would not, while using a mall directory, reasonably expect their image to be captured and used to create a biometric representation of their face, which is sensitive personal information, or for that biometric information to be used to guess their approximate age and gender. As such, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> should have obtained express opt-in consent. Further, we reviewed <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s privacy policy and determined that the language was overly broad, and buried in the middle of a 5,000 word document, which would not be easily accessible to individuals while they are engaging with a mall directory. We found that the privacy policy language was not sufficient to support meaningful consent for <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> practices.</p>
<p>Finally, we noted that while shoppers were directed, by stickers displayed at mall entrances, to visit guest services to obtain a copy of <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s privacy policy, when we asked a guest services employee at one of <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s malls for that policy, they were confused by the request.</p>
<p>As a result of these findings, we made several recommendations. We recommended that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> either: (i) obtain meaningful express opt-in consent and allow individuals to use its mall directories without having to submit to the collection and use of their sensitive biometric information; or (ii) cease use of its <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology. While <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> expressly disagreed with our findings, it advised that it had ceased use of the technology in July 2018, and that it had no current plans to resume that use. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> has also, pursuant to further recommendations by our Offices, deleted the numerical representations of faces and audio/video recordings in its possession which were not required for legal purposes. It has confirmed that what information has been retained will not be used for any other purposes outside of those required for compliance with the law. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> also provided privacy-related training to guest services employees. As a result, we found the matter to be <strong>well-founded and resolved</strong>.</p>
<p>Our Offices asked <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> to provide a commitment to follow our recommendations with respect to ensuring valid consent if they were to resume use of <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology in the future. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> indicated that if it did resume use of the <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology, it would obtain adequate consent, “in accordance with the applicable privacy legislation and consistent with the <em>Guidelines for obtaining meaningful consent</em>”. However, it refused to commit to obtaining <strong>express opt-in</strong> consent consistent with our recommendations. We find this concerning given that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> disagreed with our analysis and interpretation of the law in this case. For example, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> continues to maintain, contrary to our findings, that they were not collecting personal information via the <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology.</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> <em>did not</em> collect the location information of identifiable individuals via mobile device tracking technology in its malls, such that it did not require consent for the practice.</strong></p>
<p>We found that the information collected from mobile devices of shoppers, who were not logged into Wi-Fi in <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> malls, did not constitute personal information. More specifically, the hashed and randomized <abbr title="Media Access Control">MAC</abbr> address (device identifier), coupled with non-granular “zone” geolocation information collected using Wi-Fi triangulation, did not constitute personal information in this context, as there was not a serious possibility that this information could be linked, either alone or with other available information, with the mobile device holder.</p>
<p>With respect to individuals who log in to <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s free Wi-Fi service, via a process that required them to provide personal information, we originally understood, based on the evidence gathered during our investigation, including from <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> and its Wi-Fi service provider, that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> was collecting triangulated device geolocation information and linking it with identifiable device users’ Wi-Fi accounts. We therefore made certain preliminary recommendations to <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> with respect to the consent we would expect for this practice. However, in response to a preliminary report issued by our Offices, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> clarified, and its third-party Wi-Fi service provider verified, that the geolocation information described above could not in any practical manner be associated with, or linked to, logged-in Wi-Fi accounts, such that it was not personal information in that context. We therefore determined the matter to be <strong>not well-founded</strong>.</p>
<p>We did note, however, that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> was seeking consent for “special location-based offers”, despite the fact that it was not engaged in the practice. Further to our recommendation, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> did remove such language from its privacy policy, and added language making clear what limited location information is collected and associated with Wi-Fi accounts (i.e., only the <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> property in question).</p>
<p>Finally, we note that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s third-party Wi-Fi service provider offers the option to associate triangulated “zone” information to accounts, and that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> did include, in its privacy policy, the prospect of using geolocation information to deliver location-based offers. We therefore recommended that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> commit to implementing our preliminary recommendations should it decide to activate this functionality and associate geolocation information with Wi-Fi accounts in future. Specifically, we would expect <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> to: (i) support express consent for such geolocation practices via a clear and prominent notice on the Wi-Fi log-in page; and (ii) provide a clearly explained and easily accessible opt-out option. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> again refused, claiming that these recommendations were speculative.</p>
<h2 id="toc2">Background</h2>
<ol start="1">
<li><!-- 1. -->This report of investigation examines The Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited’s (“<abbr>CFCL</abbr>”) compliance with Canada’s <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em> (“<abbr>PIPEDA</abbr>”), Alberta’s’ <em>Personal Information Protection Act</em> (“<abbr>PIPA AB</abbr>”), and British Columbia’s <em>Personal Information Protection Act</em> (“<abbr>PIPA BC</abbr>”) – referred to collectively as the “Acts”.</li>
<li><!-- 2. --><abbr>CFCL</abbr> is one of the largest owners, operators and developers of offices, retail and mixed-use properties, including shopping malls, in North America.</li>
<li><!-- 3. -->This joint investigation was launched in the wake of numerous media reports that raised questions and concerns about whether <abbr>CFCL</abbr> was collecting, using and/or disclosing personal information using facial analytics technology, via in-mall directories, without adequate consent. The technology, which <abbr>CFCL</abbr> referred to as Anonymous Video Analytics (“AVA”) technology,<sup id="fn3-rf"><a href="#fn3"><span>Footnote </span>3</a></sup> was installed on digital wayfinding directories, which are effectively touch screen digital map systems that allow visitors to locate stores and find their way through <abbr>CFCL</abbr> shopping malls. In the context of this report, <abbr>AVA</abbr> technology covers all elements of the software suite and hardware elements involved in <abbr>CFCL</abbr>’s <abbr>AVA</abbr> implementation.</li>
<li><!-- 4. -->Initial media reports<sup id="fn4-rf"><a href="#fn4"><span>Footnote </span>4</a></sup> regarding <abbr>CFCL</abbr>’s use of <abbr>AVA</abbr> technology in its directories surfaced in July 2018, after an individual posted a photo<sup id="fn5-rf"><a href="#fn5"><span>Footnote </span>5</a></sup> on Reddit<sup id="fn6-rf"><a href="#fn6"><span>Footnote </span>6</a></sup> taken at <abbr>CFCL</abbr>’s Chinook Centre in Calgary, Alberta, showing a display screen with coding language that included “FaceEncoder” and “FaceAnalyzer” – leading the media to report that <abbr>CFCL</abbr> was using facial recognition technologies.</li>
<li><!-- 5. -->Satisfied that reasonable grounds existed to investigate these matters, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia and Information and …</li></ol></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>Corporate Development, Strategic Business Development, Corporate Business Development, or any other amalgamation – are likely all the same teams with small caveats. Traditionally, CorpDev’s mandate was to buy companies. That’s traditional. But it’s 2020 and we can all attest that business models have changed over the past years. These days CorpDev isn’t simply a team being told from the top-down what to go find and buy. More often than not it’s an assortment of functions baked into a multi-faceted team who brings the outside-in, from education to execution. This takes the form of helping business lines execute strategic partnerships, take stakes in venture investments, and yes the vanilla M&amp;A. That team could also be tasked with helping draft corporate strategy by informing business unit leaders of emerging threats given their overweighted exposure to the startup ecosystem. It’s exciting work!</p>

<p>This is why it’s disappointing to hear people say ‘don’t talk to CorpDev unless you’re ready to sell.’ (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://paulgraham.com/corpdev.html" target="_blank">Enter Paul Graham’s essay</a>) It’s short-sighted. It’s akin to having a VC reach out to a founder, ask for a conversation, and the founder says, “no thanks, we’re not currently raising.” The most likely response from the VC would be, “cool, I wasn’t looking to invest but wanted to create a connection.” </p>



<p>All of it is a relationship-driven business.  Executing partnerships, investments and acquisitions are more likely to happen if you previously knew the founders or investors in advance. And you don’t need to wait to talk to VCs or CVCs or ‘CorpDev’ until you’re ready – talk to them when you have mutual interests that could be beneficial to both parties.  Talk to them when you’re looking to network.  Don’t wait to talk to them until, and only until you’re ready to begin a raise or be sold. If you do so there’s a chance you’ll get a response like the following, “thanks for reaching out and happy to still connect, but we just did X 3 months ago and would have loved to connect back then.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>CorpDev benefits regardless if their company grows through in-organic ways. And if it’s a legit team, they’re involved regardless in everything of strategic value that’s in-organic. Outside engagement with the startup ecosystem is what that usually looks like. Even more so, transactions in my experience have happened by having existing relationships. This is the same team sitting at the leadership table adjacent to the business unit heads with a purview into the organization’s strategy – they know the players involved, and what is necessary to get something executed. If they’re good, they’ll be frank on timing and engagement strategy. For example, “our process takes 5 weeks to execute from soup to nuts, and you’ll know in the next week if X is possible.”</p>



<p>Additionally, having pre-existing relationships with CorpDev can help outside startups and companies bypass red-tape or headaches. I see this a lot: a Series A-C startup working with an individual at the firm already for the past two months, only to find out that that person who’s ‘in’ the business needs to go through procurement which includes an RFP process to get a contract signed off on. That individual didn’t know because it was the first time they were engaged in something like that, regardless of their passionate intentions. What the startup’s sales executive thought would be signing of the account in a quarter quickly turned into a 12-18 month procurement process that they now have the chance of losing. This usually comes to fruition as pen needs to be signed to paper and the individual who ushered them in is not the individual who’ll be signing off on the $50,000 PoC to test validity leading to production.</p>



<p>Having a contact at the firm’s CorpDev team can always quickly hash something like the aforementioned out over a 15-minute phone call at the beginning, providing a black and white picture of what they should expect and the best way to close. CorpDev understands who’s inside the organization.  CorpDev can help ‘herd the sheep’.  And if they’re good (respected) CorpDev can influence without direct authority.</p>



<p>Talk to CorpDev.   Talk to them when you’re curious.   Talk to them when you’re about to start raising.   Talk to them when you’re kicking off direct sales, auctions, and more.   Don’t wait. </p>

    <p>In my previous article about <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">Apple’s use of Swift and SwiftUI in iOS&nbsp;14</a>, I counted the number of built-in apps in iOS using Swift and SwiftUI. Several readers asked if I could provide a percentage rather than an absolute number.</p>
<p>In this new article, I will answer this question by measuring the total number of binaries in iOS. I will go one step further and also count the number of binaries using other programming languages: Objective-C, C++ and C.</p>
<p>Finally to be as complete as possible, I ran this analysis on all major iOS releases, from iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 to iOS&nbsp;14. This will provide a detailed overview of the evolution of the different programming languages over more than a decade of iOS development.</p>

<p>Before jumping into the analysis, let's clarify the scope. First I only analyzed what is commonly called ‘iOS’, i.e. everything above the kernel. The XNU kernel and low-level firmwares (SecureROM, Baseband, …) are not included in this analysis. On the other hand, I counted the frameworks located inside the dyld shared cache, a cache mechanism introduced in iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.1 and still used in iOS&nbsp;14.</p>
<p>Another point is that you may note the absence of Objective-C++. The approach I used can't really detect binaries using Objective-C++. So I counted such binaries as using both Objective-C and C++.</p>
<p>Finally you should take this analysis with a grain of salt. While I believe the overall picture to be accurate, my approach has some limitations due to the simple fact that I don't have access to the iOS source code and relied on imprecise compilation artifacts.</p>

<p>The first problem to tackle was to count the number of binaries in iOS. Because I ran the analyses off‑device, I could not rely on the permissions being properly set.</p>
<p>Instead I used the fact that a binary has to be a Mach-O file to be executable. Checking if a file is a Mach-O binary is trivial by using the <code>file</code> command line tool in a Bash script:</p>
<pre><code>#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Function to check if a file (passed as argument $1) is an executable
# It returns the number of occurrences of the string 'Mach-O' returned by
# the output of the file command. File would generally return a line like
# - Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e (/usr/bin/sysdiagnose)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library arm64e (/usr/lib/libobjc-trampolines.dylib)
# - Mach-O 64-bit bundle arm64e (/usr/lib/xpc/support.bundle/support)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamic linker arm64e (/usr/lib/dyld)
# - Mach-O 64-bit kext bundle arm64e (/System/Library/Extensions/AppleIDV.kext/AppleIDV)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library stub arm64e (/Applications/FTMInternal-4.app/libMobileGestalt.dylib)
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
isExecutable ()
{
	file $1 2&gt;/dev/null | grep -o "Mach-O" | wc -l
}
</code></pre>
<p>I ran this script through all the files of each major iOS release to count the number of binaries and to obtain the evolution over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/Binaries.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 contained quite a small amount of binaries. But iOS has become more and more complex and iOS&nbsp;14.0 now contains 20 times more binaries than iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0.</p>

<p>In my previous article on <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">Apple’s use of Swift and SwiftUI in iOS&nbsp;14</a>, I counted the built-in apps using Swift and SwiftUI. For this article I decided to go one step further and also count the number of binaries using Objective-C, C++ and C.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can mix different programming languages to create a binary. One example is to create an app that uses C++ for the low-level engine and Objective-C for the UI. Another good example is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237">Clatters</a> where I use some code written in Swift, SwiftUI, Objective-C and C, the most appropriate programming languages being used to solve each specific problem.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-swiftui">Detecting SwiftUI</h2>
<p>In my <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">previous post</a>, I explained how to detect if a binary uses SwiftUI by checking if it dynamically links against <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/Versions/A/SwiftUI</code>. This can be implemented in a Bash script like:</p>
<pre><code>isSwiftUI=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI\.framework/SwiftUI" | wc -l )
</code></pre>
<p>Although SwiftUI is not really a programming language but rather an user interface toolkit, I decided to include it in this article.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-swift">Detecting Swift</h2>
<p>Detecting the use of Swift can be done using a similar method, as <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2016/1101-apples-use-of-swift-in-ios-10-1-and-macos-10-12/">described in an older post in 2016</a>. The script is however slightly more complex due to the fact that the Swift libraries have been moved to different locations during the history of iOS:</p>
<pre><code>isSwift=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/swift/" | wc -l )
if [ ${isSwift} == 0 ]
then
	# On iOS 11, the Swift dylib were inside "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Swift/"
	isSwift=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Swift/" | wc -l )
	
	if [ ${isSwift} == 0 ] &amp;&amp; [[ $1 != */libswiftUIKit.dylib ]]
	then
		# On iOS 9, the Swift dylib were built into the app
		isSwift=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "@rpath/libswiftUIKit\.dylib" | wc -l )
	fi
fi
</code></pre>
<h2 id="detecting-objective-c">Detecting Objective-C</h2>
<p>Detecting if a binary uses Objective-C is pretty simple as explained in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/objective-c_runtime">Apple's documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Objective-C runtime is a runtime library that provides support for the dynamic properties of the Objective-C language, and as such is linked to by all Objective-C apps. Objective-C runtime library support functions are implemented in the shared library found at /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simple line can thus detect all apps using Objective-C:</p>
<pre><code>isObjectiveC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libobjc\." | wc -l )
</code></pre>
<h2 id="detecting-c">Detecting C++</h2>
<p>Similarly to Objective-C, we can rely on the fact that apps using C++ have to use the C++ standard library. On modern iOS versions, the C++ standard library libc++ is located at <code>/usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib</code>. On iOS&nbsp;7 and earlier, the gcc's libstdc++ was used and located at <code>/usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib</code>.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering why the exact path is not used in the script below, the reason is to mark <code>libc++abi.dylib</code> as using C++. <a href="http://libcxxabi.llvm.org/">libc++abi</a> is the low level support for the standard C++ library and appears to be written in C++.</p>
<pre><code>isCPP=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libc++" | wc -l )
if [ ${isCPP} == 0 ]
then
	isCPP=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libstdc++" | wc -l )
fi
</code></pre>
<h2 id="detecting-c-1">Detecting C</h2>
<p>Without entering into complex details, Objective-C and C++ are a superset of C. This means that an Objective-C or C++ app is using C code. So we can't know if an Objective-C or C++ app is using some pure C code. However some apps are written entirely in C. These are generally low-level command line tool, like <code>/usr/bin/zprint</code>.</p>
<p>How to detect such binaries? If a binary doesn't link neither to the Objective-C runtime library nor to the C++ standard library, but uses the standard C library <code>libc</code> located at <code>/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib</code>, then we can assume that this binary is entirely written in C. To detect apps entirely written in C, I ended up with these lines:</p>
<pre><code>isC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libSystem\." | wc -l )
if [ ${isC} == 0 ]
then
	isC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/system/" | wc -l )
fi
</code></pre>
<p>You will also notice that I hardcoded all the dynamic libraries located inside <code>/usr/lib/system/</code> as being written in C. These low-level libraries don't link to <code>/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib</code> but are most likely written in C.</p>
<h2 id="special-cases">Special cases</h2>
<p>In the final script, you will see a couple of special cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>/usr/lib/libobjc-trampolines.dylib</code>:
This library is entirely written in assembly and you can read its arm64 source code in this file <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/objc4/objc4-781/runtime/objc-blocktramps-arm64.s">objc-blocktramps-arm64.s</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/usr/lib/dyld</code>:
dyld is the dynamic linker and is a really special binary. Since <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/">it is open source</a>, we can easily confirm that it contains C++ code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.xpc/sdk.dylib</code> and <code>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.xpcd/xpcd_cache.dylib</code>:
These 2 libraries seem to be autogenerated libraries and part of dyld.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/System/Library/Extensions/*</code>:
There are a couple of (kernel?) extension used by iOS like <code>/System/Library/Extensions/AppleIDV.kext</code>. All these binaries appear to use C++.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/detectBinaries.sh">download here the complete script</a> that loops through all the files of a folder. This script prints the paths of all the binaries found and tells you the programming languages used, like:</p>
<pre><code>/Applications/AccountAuthenticationDialog.app/AccountAuthenticationDialog |Objective-C
/Applications/ActivityMessagesApp.app/ActivityMessagesApp |Objective-C
/Applications/ActivityMessagesApp.app/PlugIns/ActivityMessagesExtension.appex/ActivityMessagesExtension |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AnimojiStickers.app/AnimojiStickers |Objective-C
/Applications/AnimojiStickers.app/PlugIns/AnimojiStickersExtension.appex/AnimojiStickersExtension |Objective-C
/Applications/AppSSOUIService.app/AppSSOUIService |Objective-C
/Applications/AppStore.app/AppStore |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AppStore.app/PlugIns/ProductPageExtension.appex/ProductPageExtension |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AppStore.app/PlugIns/SubscribePageExtension.appex/SubscribePageExtension |Objective-C|Swift
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>I ran this script on all major releases of iOS from iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 to iOS&nbsp;14.0. If you are interested by the raw data, you can download them here:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>A few months back I was running down the San Francisco Bay, looking out over the dry docks and concrete factories, pondering organization structures… as you do.</p><p>I was wrestling with two pieces of seemingly contradictory management advice:</p><ol><li>In order to optimize communication structures, particularly in fast-paced environments, organizations should remain as flat as possible.</li><li>Managers shouldn’t have too many reports, if you want them to be able to adequately support their team.</li></ol><p>Having worked in a range of different sized organizations the first piece of advice intuitively resonated. As you add layers of hierarchy, coordination becomes more complex and information gaps start to emerge. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the “<a href="https://corporate-rebels.com/iceberg-of-ignorance/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Iceberg of Ignorance</a>,” where executives only see 4% of the problems experienced by front-line staff. So, aiming to reduce hierarchy where possible made sense.</p><p>But how do you balance that with the second piece of advice? If you reduce the number of direct reports each manager has, you inherently increase the depth of the hierarchy.</p><p>Experience from managing a team that grew from 20 to 60 told me that managers should really work with fewer than 8 reports, and that’s assuming no other responsibilities. If you’re expected to spend time coding, for example, I felt that it should be no more than five. But, having recently talked to a couple of managers with 25 reports each, I was starting to worry I was off base and wondered whether companies were in reality favoring high number of reports and flat org charts.</p><p>I resolved to gather more data, and went out to my network on Twitter and LinkedIn.</p><h3>Lucky Sevens</h3><p>I sent out a Google Form and after a couple of weeks had 129 responses. The majority came from people in leadership roles: 15 CXOs, 17 VPs, 26 directors, 42 managers. Many were from engineering functions — though there were a number of designers and people ops folks.</p><p>Responses spanned startups, public companies, and not-for-profits, with the largest segment being “growth stage” startups. One-third of respondents were at companies with under 150 people, while 10 were from 70,000+ person organizations.</p><p>It turned out that the average number of reports for both respondents and the respondent’s manager was 7, with a standard deviation of 5. Directors came in slightly higher than other roles with an average of 9 reports.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/54e1aa9e9da8ce47df281654551a12c22b372f8f-1130x685.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Average reports"></p><p>The biggest surprise was that when asked about the ideal number of reports — not for themselves, but as a general rule of thumb — the average was also 7, with a standard deviation of only 2.</p><p>This answer was pretty consistent across roles, with only CXOs and ICs offering a slightly lower number of around 6 reports per manager — which is perhaps a function of experience. When I dug deeper into these numbers, It wasn’t that people were self-reporting their own situation as being ideal, but on average it did mean that for this dataset the status quo was somewhat close to the perceived ideal.</p><blockquote>Across seniority levels, people reported that seven was the ideal number of reports and that 11 was an upper limit for most situations.</blockquote><p>In terms of maximum number of reports, most felt that 10 to 12 was an upper limit, with ICs reporting that 8 or 9 was the maximum number for a manager to be effective.</p><div><section><div><div><div><h3>Keep your team better connected</h3><p>Sign up for the Range newsletter</p></div></div></div></section></div><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/ce6a95de968e00fde739deae8430b437aa305ffc-1130x685.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Max reports"></p><h3>Nitty-gritty</h3><p>Many respondents noted that these “magic numbers” lack nuance.</p><p>There are no absolute rules and situational factors need to be considered when identifying the ideal ratio for your team: type of work, team structure, seniority of managers, how much hands-on work the manager is expected to contribute, etc.</p><p>Kean Wong, former VP Software Engineering at Pebble said:</p><blockquote>_Reporting relationships and the number of sustainable direct reports are directly related to the company structure, culture, size, and the team dynamics, and the other responsibilities of the manager. The magic number, skills and structures that worked effectively at Palm, Facebook, Pebble, Intel varied dramatically, and the number I could effectively manage also depended on factors like the locality of my reports and their teams, and my own responsibilities to the broader organization. This is why there is no single magic number of reports that works for every situation._</blockquote><p>Some respondents felt that senior reports required less attention, which would therefore give managers more capacity. Though several explicitly called this out as a common myth, including this Director of Engineering at a 200 person startup:</p><blockquote>_While some reports are "easy" it doesn't mean that you can lump on more and more reports. I find that easy and hard reports all need about the same amount of time just to ensure they are getting the attention and support they need._</blockquote><p>There are other practical constraints. Jason Goldman — former Chief Digital Officer for the White House — pointed out that 1:1s are a cornerstone managerial technique in modern organizations, and thus quickly becomes the most constraining factor.</p><p>Eight 30 minute 1:1s a week consumes 10% of your work week. It is possible to switch to every other week, but at around 12 to 15 even this starts to fall apart. Jason went on to say that he strongly believes that once you’re no longer having regular 1:1s with someone you’re not actually managing them.</p><h3>Doing the calculus</h3><p>Going back to the original question that plagued me during my dock-side run, how do these data points on manager reporting ratios affect organizational depth?</p><p>Using the above rule of thumb, let’s say that we want our leaders to average 7 direct reports. New managers may have 2-3 reports, while some managers will end off closer to 10 or 11 reports before needing to delegate some of their responsibilities.</p><p>With these ratios a team can get to nearly 60 people with two layers of management: VPE → Manager → Engineer. In my experience, this can still feel pretty flat, if you are intentional about communication and planning. Adding a Director layer gets you to 400 people, by which point you've crossed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number" rel="noopener" target="_self">Dunbar number</a> and are dealing with a whole new set of issues.</p><p>For larger organizations, the challenge really becomes how and when to subdivide in order to provide a feeling of alignment and cohesion. Four layers of management will get you to nearly 3,000 people, but this number of people laddering up to a single business unit or product division will cause alignment and communication issues that go beyond those that stem from just the deep management chain.</p><h3>Alternative reality</h3><p>When I joined Google in 2005 I reported to a Director with over a hundred direct reports. This certainly made the reporting hierarchy look flat, but the org chart didn’t reflect reality. Multiple products rolled up to this Director. I was on Gmail, and we broke out into backend and frontend teams; I think at that stage there was also a dedicated SRE team and a delivery team.</p><p>While situations such as this are hopefully relegated to historical anecdotes, it is increasingly true that the org chart does not reflect the real work. Teams are becoming increasingly cross-functional and it is becoming common for individuals to contribute to multiple efforts.</p><p>This is leading more companies to decouple their organizational structure from the management hierarchy. Which in turn is making it possible to maintain a relatively flat team hierarchy — or “hierarchy of purpose” — while ensuring supportive management structures are also in place.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Organizing people is hard, it’s a constant process of balancing different trade-offs and there really is no one size fits all solution. But there are principles, discovered through others’ real world experiences, we should learn from.</p><p>So if you see a manager with more than eight reports ask yourself: is this situation really serving everyone? And it may be that you need to look for other solutions to the communication challenges posed by deeper hierarchies.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<p>I see a lack of honesty in our industry when we share knowledge. Every post is intented to sell the legend because we are as great as the legend we create.</p>

<p>I’m going to try to be honest and share with you a simple initiative I’m trying out with my team. My objective is to solve some of the problems we have and improve our <strong>Engineering Excellence</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-engineering-excellence">What is Engineering Excellence?</h2>

<p>The truth is… nobody really knows. So nobody will give you a right answer. I went on <a href="https://twitter.com/stanete">twitter</a> and asked the community, I read a bunch of Medium posts and I had conversations with other technical leaders. Only to arrive at the conclusion that <strong>Engineering Excellence can only be improved; it cannot be achieved</strong>.</p>

<p>I found out that <strong>Engineering Excellence</strong> is about how a <em>Product Engineering</em> team approaches problems, breaks them into steps that add value, implements those steps and learns from how the solution is performing at a <em>Business</em>, <em>Product</em> and <em>Engineering</em> level. In three words: plan, build and learn.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/engineering_excellence.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Compound Returns on Engineering Excellence</strong> is just a mental model. A metaphor. A way of giving meaning to my quest of trying to improve my team by telling an interesting story. Compounding is about taking advantage of the returns your investments already generate by reinvesting them again. In other words, <a href="https://www.elkinvest.com/blog/compounding-returns-the-eighth-wonder-of-the-world-use-it-or-lose-it">compounding</a> is where you earn a return on returns that are already earned and reinvested.</p>

<p>With time, an <em>Engineering</em> team will improve their practices and systems if well though improvements are implemented. Every consecutive improvement will benefit from the last one. You must find your own story and give it the meaning your team needs. I work at a fintech so <em>compounding</em> seemed the right metaphor for us.</p>

<h2 id="its-dangerous-to-go-alone">It’s dangerous to go alone!</h2>

<p>In the the very first cave of <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>, an old man says: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_dangerous_to_go_alone!">It’s dangerous to go alone! Take this</a>. He gives Link a sword to help him on his quest to defeat Ganon and rescue Princess Zelda.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/mojo_jojo_thinking.png" alt=""></p>

<p>There is no way you can accurately find out what the team needs to improve by yourself. I picked up three of the people I trust most. They don’t have to be the most Senior Engineers; they only have to be people others can look at and see as role models. They will help you find out what the team needs to improve. They will also help you create a plan, lead initiatives and inspire others to join in your quest.</p>

<p>But before starting the journey, I shared the initiative with the people I trust. I tried to enlist them, make space for them so they can grow and that way I tried to build trust. You do that last one by being honest and transparent about the problems you will encounter on your jorney.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-improve">What to improve?</h2>

<p>There are many ways you can lead the people you have chosen to help you find it out. But the main idea is drawn from the <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/">Design Sprint</a> methodology: diverge and converge. You need to find spaces where you can together explore many possibilities, find out what others think, set clear objectives, ask for feedback, give everyone a role and make decisions. Other book that talks about how to approach a problem as a team, explore possible solutions and make a decision is <a href="https://www.amazon.es/Mastering-Collaboration-Working-Together-Productive/dp/1492041734">Mastering Collaboration: Make Working Together Less Painful and More Productive</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/engineering_excellence_diagram.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You will lead one initiative yourself to give example. But each one of those people you’ve chosen will also lead one. This is important because it will allow them to shine, inspire and involve other members of the team. Leading does not mean doing. It means persuing, involving others and making sure it happens.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-we-improving">What are we improving?</h2>

<p>After a couple of weeks of brainstorming, debating, analysing and asking for feedback, we decided to focus on three aspects we must improve in the short term:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Vertical Continuous Delivery</em>. The team’s ability to break big problems into small pieces so every step makes sense, adds value and reduces risk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Quality</em>. The team’s ability and processes to build simple yet testable, readable, maintainable and evolvable code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Observability &amp; Monitoring</em>. The team’s mindset to think and learn about what happens to the code after it is in one of the dark corners of the internet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The journey is broken down into three phases: <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari">Shu-Ha-Ri</a>. Nobody <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html">explains this</a> better than Martin Fowler so I’m not going to even try to do a better job.</p>

<p>Every team needs to improve different aspects of its <em>Engineering Excellence</em> throughout its life. Your team will have to follow its own path and battle its own demons.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/shu_ha_ri.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Make sure you have checkpoints along the journey so you can adjust your plans for the needs your team has. Also, make sure you can escape from the chaos and day to day histeria so you can have some time to think and reflect on the changes happening because this initiative.</p>

<h2 id="what-could-possibly-go-wrong">What could possibly go wrong?</h2>

<p>Everything. One of the most famous quotes in business is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if you’re starting to improve your team’s <em>Engineering Excellence</em> but you are not <a href="https://leaddev.com/scaling-software-systems/primer-engineering-delivery-metrics">measuring</a> anything yet (quantitatively or qualitatively)? Keep going. You don’t have time to measure first and improve later. You’ll need to do both at the same time. Actually, make the team understand why <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/can-you-measure-developer-productivity/">measuring themsleves is so damn important</a> as part of the journey.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/mojo_jojo_bunny.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you know something about <em>Engineering</em> teams and people in general you know there is no guarantee this initiative will succeed. But I would love to have a chat if you try this or something similar.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-when-you-finish">What to do when you finish?</h2>

<p>You never finish. When you do, if you do, you start over. But make sure you assess your team has actually improved their <em>Engineering Excellence</em> from time to time.</p>

<div itemprop="text">

<p>There are tons of interview myths floating around about the technical hiring process, mostly because it’s usually a black box to candidates. The inherent stress, inexperienced interviewers, tiring challenges, and unresponsive companies are valid reasons for candidates to have a negative view of hiring. Some of these myths work against a good interview experience and the candidates’ chances to get hired, so I’d like to call them out and refute them.</p>
<h2 id="about-me"><span id="About_me">About me</span></h2>
<p>I’ve interviewed a few hundred software engineering candidates in the past 10+ years and designed hiring processes. I’ve been supporting software engineers for 6+ years, working with ~40 engineers as their engineering manager. My experience is limited to startups and mid-sized companies, so take everything you read here with that in mind.</p>
<p>You might also be interested in <a href="https://ochronus.online/acing-the-tech-interview/">my guide to ace technical interviews.</a></p>
<h2 id="now-let-s-see-the-myths-and-misconceptions-"><span id="Now_lets_see_the_technical_interview_myths_and_misconceptions">Now let’s see the technical interview myths and misconceptions.</span></h2>
<h3 id="you-can-never-be-late-"><span id="You_can_never_be_late">You can never be late.</span></h3>
<p>Without question, do you best to be at your interview on time and plan things accordingly, but don’t worry, we know sh*it happens. If you can please let us know you’ll be late or you’d like to reschedule the interview, I promise you it’ll be fine. Nobody in their right mind would try to relate whether you were punctual or not on a single occasion to your future job performance.</p>
<h3 id="don-t-do-research-ahead-of-time-because-the-interviewer-will-tell-you-everything-you-need-to-know-"><span id="Dont_do_research_ahead_of_time_because_the_interviewer_will_tell_you_everything_you_need_to_know">Don’t do research ahead of time because the interviewer will tell you everything you need to know.</span></h3>
<p>False, for two reasons. While your interviewer will do their best to give you all the information&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;think is essential for you, there’s no way of exactly knowing what that is! The other reason is that if you don’t know anything about the company and the role, you’ll seem like someone who doesn’t care where they work and what they do. You probably don’t want that. You don’t need to overdo it and spend hours looking up who the founders’ grandparents were. Just make sure you understand the company’s market, look at the product(s) we offer (if you have time and you’re interested, even try them – we all love feedback!), and read the job description.</p>
<h3 id="they-are-looking-for-the-perfect-candidate-"><span id="They_are_looking_for_the_perfect_candidate">They are looking for the perfect candidate.</span></h3>
<p>No, we aren’t. We’re looking for a reasonably competent candidate with the right mindset who’s willing to take this journey of constant growth with us.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-not-ok-to-send-a-follow-up-email-after-my-interview-"><span id="Its_not_OK_to_send_a_follow-up_email_after_my_interview">It’s not OK to send a follow-up email after my interview.</span></h3>
<p>Sure it is! I even tell candidates explicitly to feel free to reach out to me if they have further questions or feedback! I really do value when folks reach out. I don’t mean “thank you” emails, but actual questions or feedback. Please, no brown-nosing, though – that’s really awkward for both of us and won’t get you anywhere.</p>
<h3 id="they-make-candidates-wait-a-lot-so-they-can-weigh-them-against-each-other-"><span id="They_make_candidates_wait_a_lot_so_they_can_weigh_them_against_each_other">They make candidates wait a lot so they can weigh them against each other.</span></h3>
<p>Hell, no we don’t! One quality of a good hiring process is that it should be able to help us decide whether we want to hire that specific candidate independently of others or not. As a hiring manager, I always do the interviews with my mind being set on that if we’re a good match, an offer is going out (unless, of course, headcounts changed in the meantime, but then we communicate that). If you’re waiting too long for us to come back to you, please, by all means, ping us! We might have dropped the ball somewhere – maybe someone is out sick and didn’t have time to ask others to help out, or we simply forgot something. It happens and we’re sorry – don’t assume malice, ask us, please. We should be proactively telling you when you can expect to hear from us and about the next steps, by the way! We do our best to keep those promises.</p>
<h3 id="recruiters-ghost-me-because-i-performed-badly-in-the-interview-"><span id="Recruiters_ghost_me_because_I_performed_badly_in_the_interview">Recruiters ghost me because I performed badly in the interview.</span></h3>
<p>While I can’t speak on behalf of all recruiters, in my experience, this is not the case! It should not happen. Sure, mistakes happen (recruiters are, believe it or not, humans, too), but the norm is that you get a timely answer whatever the interview outcome was. If you’re not getting that, ping them. Or ping the hiring manager. Probably someone dropped the ball on something. It happens. Ideally, we should be telling you when to expect us to come back to you, so you can know if we’re late or you’re just impatient 😉 – if you’re not getting that information from us, just ask at the end of the interview.</p>
<h3 id="if-my-interviewer-is-having-a-bad-day-i-will-probably-fail-the-interview-"><span id="If_my_interviewer_is_having_a_bad_day_I_will_probably_fail_the_interview">If my interviewer is having a bad day, I will probably fail the interview.</span></h3>
<p>Hopefully not. Sure, we are all humans, and our mood influences how we think and act, but a well-designed hiring process should protect against this. Unless I’m actively malicious (and why would I be?! I WANT to hire engineers!), my bias will be called out by other interviewers in the same step or another step, and I’ll need to argue for not hiring you. Honestly, even a good scorecard (the thing we fill out with some standard, guiding questions after the interview) will make me realize I’m just in a bad mood and then I can deal with it. If you only meet 1-2 interviewers during your process, the risk of bias is much higher. While you have no control over who interviews you, you can take a hint from this. While the scene might not yet be 100% rosy, companies are trying their best to stay competitive in the job market, and more and more realize that structured, unbiased, and humane interviews are one key to this.</p>

<h3 id="smaller-companies-blindly-copy-faang-hiring-methods-"><span id="Smaller_companies_blindly_copy_FAANG_hiring_methods">Smaller companies blindly copy FAANG hiring methods.</span></h3>
<p>Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google have some (in)famous hiring methods. While some companies probably blindly copy those, most don’t. It’d be stupid. They play on a different field with different goals and have a much higher volume of candidate influx. One example is focusing on algorithm and data structure knowledge – most FAANG technical interviews test this. It probably makes sense for them while it doesn’t make much sense for most other companies. Not only that, but it can have a negative effect (other than scaring away good candidates) – being biased towards two kinds of applicants: engineers who are working a lot with algorithms and data structures and fresh graduates, who still have muscle memory of this.</p>
<h3 id="culture-fit-we-want-people-exactly-like-us-"><span id="Culture_fit_we_want_people_exactly_like_us">Culture fit == we want people exactly like us.</span></h3>
<p>When we say “cultural fit”, we mean “value/principle fit”. I try to say that, by default, but industry terms die hard. We’re looking for teammates who believe in most of the same basic principles as we do, that’s all. Some examples of these principles are (for us, here at Contentful): transparency, growth mindset, customer focus and teamwork. I can reason why these are important and how they also relate to job performance and how they lead to a happy and scalable organization. It’s not fluffy stuff.</p>
<h3 id="my-resume-is-really-important-"><span id="My_resume_is_really_important">My resume is really important.</span></h3>
<p>Yes and no – yes, to get your foot in the door. It’s also a conversation starter but I’ll be interested in your stories instead when we talk. I look at resumes of candidates already in the loop only to find more information about them – things to talk about, to get some context. One thing about your resume though – it is also a piece of work from you, a signal for me. If it is seriously lacking in some aspect (eg it has serious spelling mistakes), I may see it as a sign of you not paying attention to your work’s quality or not asking for feedback (for someone to review it). By the way, there’s an excellent new book from Gergely Orosz in town about engineering resumes that can help you stand out to the next recruiter or hiring manager –&nbsp;<a href="https://thetechresume.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Tech Resume Inside Out</a>. If you don’t have too much time for this, just update your LinkedIn profile (a good move anyway!) and export your CV from LinkedIn – it is going to be much better than if you try to put it together in one evening alone.</p>
<h3 id="telling-the-recruiter-i-m-also-in-the-process-elsewhere-is-a-bad-move-"><span id="Telling_the_recruiter_Im_also_in_the_process_elsewhere_is_a_bad_move">Telling the recruiter I’m also in the process elsewhere is a bad move.</span></h3>
<p>You might think we’ll feel you’re not dedicated to us – but why would you be?! We just started talking 🙂 Nobody’s expecting you to focus on one company! On the other hand, if we really like you and you signal urgency we’ll have the chance to speed things up or even be more generous with our offer to convince you to join us 😉</p>

<p>Yup, after a few hundred interview sessions I still practice conversations in my head, I still worry I’ll make a bad impression and that I’ll mess things up. Many other people you will meet are doing much fewer interviews than me. I’m representing both myself and my company in each and every interview. I feel personally responsible for providing a good experience for you and I want you to remember the interview as “Well that was surprisingly good!”.</p>
<h3 id="not-getting-hired-is-not-a-failure-"><span id="Not_getting_hired_is_not_a_failure">Not getting hired is not a failure.</span></h3>
<p>Nobody in the hiring process will think of you like that! Trust me on this one. And yes, please do try again! The fact that you made it to the Nth step this time means that we see potential in you. If you reach out I’m more than happy to give tips and advice on where and how to grow.</p>
<h3 id="we-are-matchmakers-not-judges-"><span id="We_are_matchmakers_not_judges">We are matchmakers, not judges.</span></h3>
<p>My goal is to find a good match between the role I’m hiring for and the candidate applying. This truly goes both ways. I do my best to make sure the candidate would be successful and happy if we hired them.</p>

<div itemprop="text">

<p>Even though interviewing for a software engineering job can be intimidating and frustrating (with whiteboard exercises, remote coding challenges, and even full days of onsite interviews), it’s a lot easier when you know what to expect and are well-prepared.</p>
<p>I’ve interviewed a few hundred software engineering candidates in the past 10+ years and designed hiring processes. My experience is limited to startups and mid-sized companies, so take everything you read here with that in mind. My advice may not get you into <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/facebook-life/how-we-hire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://careers.google.com/how-we-hire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> but will definitely increase your chances at mid-sized companies with a good culture!</p>
<p>In the first part of this article, I’ll give some context, then give you an actionable list to improve your experience and chances in your next interview</p>
<p>If you’re only interested in the actionable list, feel free to skip ahead to it.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-think-about-the-technical-interview-might-be-incomplete"><span id="What_you_think_about_the_technical_interview_might_be_incomplete">What you think about the technical interview might be incomplete</span></h2>
<p>First and foremost, a technical interview is almost never only technical. Up to a certain (and honestly, very useful!) level growing as a ‘coder’ is not that complicated. Many candidates perform pretty well if we purely look at their coding skills.</p>
<p>The thing is, you’ll rarely work alone in isolation on your own codebase. You’ll have teammates, you’ll need to agree on things with them, you’ll build on others’ code and others will build on your code. You’ll need to build solutions with a certain level of quality, in a future-proof way, for extensibility, and with performance in mind. Depending on your role and level, you’ll need to architect systems. You’ll need to mentor other engineers. You’ll need to onboard new team members. You’ll need to proactively reach out to other teams in the company and understand their points of view and problems. You’ll talk to product managers, UX researchers, designers, even customers sometimes. You’ll need to manage projects, make tradeoffs and decisions, and align other engineers with that.</p>
<p>Read my article about&nbsp;<a href="https://ochronus.online/technical-interview-myths/">the most common 11 technical interview myths</a> – you’ll get a better view of how people think on the other side of the table.</p>
<h2 id="types-and-stages-of-technical-interviews"><span id="Types_and_stages_of_technical_interviews">Types and stages of technical interviews</span></h2>
<p>Most companies use a combination of these steps:</p>
<ul><li>Screening call with a recruiter – We’re interested in your basic motivations; we’d like to have a gut feeling about what you’re looking for and do some sanity check here. You might get asked about your salary requirements, support you need for visa or relocation, timelines (when could you start, etc.). Some recruiters will also ask you whether you have applied elsewhere, so they know how urgent this is for them and you.</li><li>Screening call with the hiring manager – Expect some deeper dive into your experience on multiple fronts – tech and ‘soft skills’ alike. As a hiring manager, I’ll prepare by checking out your CV for talking points, maybe even your LinkedIn profile, and definitely GitHub. I’m not trying to judge you; I’m just looking for points of connection. I’ll answer any questions you have about the role, the company, the culture, potential teams you’d be joining, etc. My ultimate goal with this is twofold: would we be a good match for your (and vice versa) and whether I think you’d be successful in the role.</li><li>Remote technical screening – An alternative, or at some places precursor to the online coding exercise. This is with a human on the other end of the line – solving tech problems together; usually, you walk them through your solution.</li><li>Online coding exercises (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.) – I know you all hate this. We need such a step to filter out people who can’t even code at all early on. You’d be surprised about the number of such applicants. I avoid algorithm/data structure exercises here and try to come up with somewhat interesting ones. Some companies use a much heavier set of exercises and judge your technical skills solely on this. While I disagree with that strategy, you need to get prepared for this, too.</li><li>Take-home assignment – this is one of the most polarizing interview steps for engineers. Some hate it, claiming it’s just free labor for the companies, and it takes too much time. Others love it because they feel they have the freedom to give it much time, really showing off their skills in their own comfortable environment. <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/take-home-assignment-mistakes-which-will-guarantee-someone-else-gets-the-job-36bcee1cec1d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whichever camp you’re in</a>, you can expect some companies requiring this. You usually get a somewhat specified problem to solve, and you’re given different levels of freedom on how to solve it – some companies don’t mind you choosing whichever stack you like; others will even specify the framework.</li><li>Onsite workshop / remote workshop – I think this is the most interesting of all steps (well, for me, at least). It’s about solving problems together with people from the company in a simulated environment. You’ll need to show your communication, decision-making, and even prioritization skills here. Sure, people will look at your code’s quality, too, but ‘soft skills’ are just as important here. We’ll get strong signals about how it would be to have you on the team.</li></ul>

<p>Take the guesswork out of the equation. If you feel you don’t have enough information to prepare for your technical interview, just ask for more! We’re here to help you succeed. I really mean it. Sometimes we aren’t doing a great job with sharing enough information proactively about the interview steps but that’s not intentional! I’m always happy to help you prepare better – ask about anything, please. You’re doing both of us a favor with that. Simply ask during the previous technical interview step or just drop me or the recruiter an email at any time.</p>

<p>Make sure you arrive at your technical interview on time. If you can’t, for some reason, please let us know, we’ll happily reorganize for another time, no hard feelings (sh*t happens). Showing up on time isn’t only about respecting each other’s schedule – interview time slots are usually 100% utilized and by arriving 10 minutes late you’re reducing your own chance to be successful. You’re also making it more stressful for yourself than necessary. If you need time for commute or for your Zoom/Google Meet setup, think ahead and give yourself a buffer before the start. You’ll also love the extra 10 minutes before the interview to tune in and get calmer.</p>

<p>The biggest mistake you can do is thinking you understand the problem or what’s asked of you and jumping right into coding in the technical interview. Take your time, carefully read the problem statement, distill it, don’t think of solutions just yet. When you feel you understand what’s asked of you or when you thought about clarifying questions to ask, communicate. <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/paraphrasing-summarizing.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paraphrase</a> what you understood from the problem statement so you can verify it with your interviewers. Only when you’re on the same page can you shift into solution mode. Even if you come up with the best solution ultimately if you skip this step I’ll remember and have doubts about how it’d be to work with you. Thinking aloud is really useful here – it will help you and help me too to understand what’s on your mind.</p>

<p>Even if you know your trade and you’re the best engineer in the world, if you fail to communicate clearly during the technical interview we’ll have no way of knowing. This takes practice for most people, so take your time and prepare! Use standard terms that other engineers can relate to, avoid passive voice, and be able to articulate what’s going on in your mind while you’re thinking. If you need some time to think quietly, say so, don’t just fall silent suddenly. We’re trying our best to communicate our expectations around this but it might be a bit late when you’re in the interview. Trust me on this one, practice here goes a long way.</p>

<p>While you’d think the technical interview is about you answering questions, expect that you will need to ask a lot of them, too! When you are in the interview and something is not clear don’t default to thinking “Oh god, I should know this, I should understand” – sometimes we are interested in how you behave in such situations, and sometimes we’re just simply not good enough in giving enough context. If you’re stuck, a good technique is to ask for clarification! It’s also 100% OK to say things like “I didn’t quite get that. Could you rephrase please?” or “I’m not sure I understand what you’re asking”. These are good signals! I expect my team members to behave like this. These are not signals of you failing. I know it feels like that, but trust me, it’s just your brain playing tricks on you. I highlight this during the interview several times, to make sure the candidate feels safe asking such questions. Another technique I wholeheartedly welcome is paraphrasing – e.g. “What I understood from what you said is that I should implement this using co-monads” (said nobody ever).</p>

<p>Make us see that you’re deeply proficient in at least one technology. This can be a programming language, for example. Also, demonstrate that you know the adjacent technologies – most companies are looking for so-called <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidmichels/2019/09/27/going-pi-shaped-how-to-prepare-for-the-work-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T-shape</a> engineers. This means that mentioning other aspects of the problem and the solution goes a long way. For example, if you’re asked to implement a service in NodeJS, mention how you’d deploy, monitor, and scale it, even if that’s not explicitly asked. No need to go into too many details (unless people ask you). If you’re only focused on a single piece of the puzzle I’ll have a hard time seeing how you’d perform well in a changing environment (where you’ll need to make connections and work on multiple zoom levels and be ready). This is a very generic statement and might not be true in the case of highly specialized roles, of course. On the other hand, …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Consider a team of engineers building a feature API for Snapchat. Let’s call them Ovah’s team. They’re facing two big problems: how to build it, and how long would it take.</p>

<p>If they can’t figure out how to build it, the feature is dead already. If they take too long to build it, the feature is as good as dead: Instagram would copy it before they’ve built it.</p>

<p>This post contains 4 different perspectives to look at the two problems. As you read through the perspectives, notice the tension in the examples. Both problems are vastly different, and some perspectives are better for one problem, and worse for another problem.</p>





<h2 id="the-outside-view">The Outside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_outside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the outside view, Ovah’s team compares this feature to other similar features they’ve built in the past. They built earlier features using Flask, and it took them 1 month to do it.</p>

<p>The outside view says that a good estimate for how long it would take is 1 month as well.</p>

<p>Further, the outside view says that a good estimate for how to build it is how you built it in the past: using Flask.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The outside view looks for similar problems in different contexts. It’s a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/gears-vs-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behaviour level model</a>: you look at things only from the outside. How things change from the outside are hints to what’s important on the inside.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that figuring out how long it takes might do well with the outside view, but the API design decisions - not so much. What’s different between the two problems?</p>

<p>Taking the outside view on API design decisions is like building a truck using a car model. Just because it has 4 wheels and behaves the same as a car doesn’t mean it’s used for the same purposes.</p>

<p>On the flip side, not taking the outside view for figuring out how long it would take is a fallacy. Daniel Kahneman writes about the outside view in <a href="https://amzn.to/3eVmTkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“People who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-inside-view">The Inside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_inside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the inside view, Ovah’s team looks at the components of the problem. They look at the requirements for the feature, and come up with a good design tailored exactly for this use case. It’s unique. They decide to go with Django instead of Flask, since it gets them authentication and other nice things out of the box.</p>

<p>The team figures that with Django, most things are done for them already, so it should take about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>The inside view looks at specifics of the problem. It’s a gears level model: you understand how things tick. You figure out how each component would work.</p>

<p>Taking both, the inside and outside view is better than just taking one. It’s like going to the eye doctor, where they show you unreadable letters on a lit-up screen. They add one lens on your eyes, and you begin to distinguish <code>o</code> and <code>e</code>. Then they add a second lens, and now you can even tell the difference between <code>h</code> and <code>n</code>! They add a third spherical lens, and the dots become sharper - you can now even see the dots over the i’s as circles, not blobs. Each lens is a perspective that sharpens your view. It helps you realise that you’re looking at <strong>e</strong>va<strong>n</strong>’s team, not <strong>o</strong>va<strong>h</strong>’s team: and then everything clicks.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>In this case, using Django was a good decision. However, it took much longer than 2 weeks: unexpected things went wrong, and the team’s imagination was limited by how things can go right.</p>

<p>I think engineers are better at designing APIs than they are at figuring out how long it would take, which hints at them being better at taking the Inside View. This makes taking the Outside View even more important: if no one else is thinking like you, you have a sharp lens no one else has, which makes all the difference.</p>

<p>At the same time, you need to beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maslow’s Hammer</a>: If you only take the Outside View on every problem, you’ll end up with a bad API design.</p>

<h2 id="the-birds-eye-view">The Bird’s eye View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_bird.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the bird’s eye view, Evan’s team looks at how this API should connect to other teams and clients. What are the other components involved? How can we best design things to work seamlessly with existing workflows?</p>

<p>The bird’s eye view looks at the problem as a part of a system, a part of other problems. This is different from the outside view, since it’s still the same problem in the same setting, but being looked at as an interface: how it connects to other things and other problems.</p>

<!-- Sometimes, tweaking the bigger picture can improve the interface, and subsequently the problem in the specific box you were working. -->

<p>Amazon is a company that internalises the bird’s eye view: Every team talks via interfaces! Every other team is their customer. You can’t go to your friend and ask them to open a backdoor for internal calls: it needs to be part of an interface anyone in the company can call. This means, not just clients, but also their colleagues and friends face the pain when the interfaces are hard to use.</p>

<p>What would it mean to take the bird’s eye view for the second problem? Evan’s team looks at how long their dependent teams would take, and when customers would be most likely to upgrade. So, they decide to launch with the next filters release, using that as a guiding factor: if the feature won’t get done by this time, build a smaller feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-worms-eye-view---genchi-genbutsu">The worm’s eye View - Genchi Genbutsu</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_worm.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genchi_Genbutsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genchi Genbutsu</a> means to “go and see”. Go to the problem, and see why it’s a problem.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup></p>

<p>For Evan’s team, this means looking at the team dynamics, and figuring out if Evan or others are somehow holding the team back. It also means figuring out if they have the required expertise in the team, and if not, how can they build it.</p>

<p>Like how the bird’s eye view zooms out to the interface between other teams, the worm’s eye view zooms in to the interface between people in the team. It’s one layer deeper than the problem of designing the API: it’s about how the team will go about it. You’re looking at the problem as a single engineer among other engineers working on the same problem.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>I’ve noticed that the Inside View, and the Bird’s eye view comes more naturally to people, while Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View are rarer. The more uncertainty and unknown unknowns involved in a problem, the more important Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View become.</p>

<p>The importance of taking these different perspectives shows up when you’re facing hard problems without an obvious solution: with the right combination of lenses, a blur turns into a sharp dot.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <amp-auto-ads type="adsense" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1298191191396779" i-amphtml-layout="container"></amp-auto-ads><p>One problem with all the trials of statins is that they look at the probability of still being alive after x years. But that’s not really the question patients want answered. Patients want to know how much longer they can expect to live if they take a statin every day for the rest of their lives. Is it weeks? months? years? decades?</p><p>Considering that statins do have known side effects, with muscle pain being the most common and widely recognized, and considering that many people think it’s annoying to have to take a pill every day, they generally want to know the size of the benefit before they decide whether to take the drug or not. Unfortunately, the answer to that question is hard to extrapolate from the studies, due to the way in which they have been designed. Saying that a drug decreases your risk of dying by x over five years doesn’t really tell you anything about how much longer you can actually expect to live.</p><p>In 2015, a group of researchers looked at the data from the statin trials and re-calculated the effect in terms of increased longevity. The <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/9/e007118.long" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study was published in the British Medical Journal</a>, and it was funded by the University of Southern Denmark. One of the authors had significant conflicts of interest, having received money from multiple different pharmaceutical companies that produce statins.</p><p>All randomized trials comparing statins to placebo, and that also fulfilled the following three criteria, were included: They had to have at least 1,000 participants, they had to follow patients for at least two years, and they had to provide a survival curve. The reason a survival curve was necessary was because the increase in longevity was extrapolated by calculating the area between the survival curves for the statin group and the placebo group. I think the other two criteria are also reasonable – statin studies looking at mortality with less than 1,000 participants and that don’t even follow patients for two years are leaving too much up to chance.</p><p>The authors identified eleven studies that fulfilled the criteria, of which six were investigating statins for primary prevention (i.e. to treat people without known atherosclerotic disease) and five were investigating statins for secondary prevention (i.e. to treat people who had already had heart attacks, or in some other way clearly manifested atherosclerotic disease). These eleven studies together included a total of 92,135 patients, so the data are robust. Participants in the studies were followed for between two and six years. Most of the major statin trials (4S, WOSCOPS, ALLHAT, LIPID, ASCOT-LLA, JUPITER) were included in the analysis.</p><p>So what were the results?</p><p>Life was prolonged by between -5 and 19 days in the primary prevention trials (yes, that’s -5, as in minus five. In one of the studies people taking a statin lived five days shorter than people taking a placebo). In the secondary prevention trials life was prolonged by between -10 and 27 days (yes, again that’s -10, as in minus ten).</p><p>When everything is averaged out, people taking a statin for primary prevention lived three days longer than people in the placebo group. People taking a statin for secondary prevention lived four days longer than people in the placebo group. The average follow-up period in these studies was around four years, so if you assume that statins have a linear life-prolonging effect that grows with time (rather than petering off after a while, which is likely), then you can expect to live around one day longer for each year of treatment.</p><p>Huh? That’s disappointing. You take a drug dutifully, which your doctor has told you is vitally important, and it prolongs your life by mere days. The results are especially disappointing when you consider that most of the eleven trials were industry funded, and industry funded trials usually show better results than are seen in the real world. So most likely the real world benefit is even smaller than the tiny benefit found in these trials.</p><p>And remember, this analysis was done by people with financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry. If even people who are friendly with industry say that statins only prolong life by mere days, we can probably trust that the benefit really is that tiny.</p><p>As mentioned at the beginning of the article, statins are not completely free of side effects. So even if you are willing to take a drug every day that has an extremely marginal effect on longevity, then that benefit needs to be weighed against the risk of side effects.</p><p>You might also enjoy my article <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/07/28/do-statins-save-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about whether statins save lives</a>, or my article <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/09/08/is-the-cholesterol-hypothesis-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about whether the cholesterol hypothesis is dead</a>.</p><section id="blog_subscription-17"></section><div><div><p> I am a practicing physician in Stockholm, Sweden.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h4>What is the demo doing?</h4>
        <p>Neural networks achieve superhuman performance in many areas, but they are easily fooled.</p>
        <p>In the demo above, we can force neural networks to predict anything we want. By adding nearly-invisible noise to an image, we turn "1"s into "9"s, "Stop" signs into "120 km/hr" signs, and dogs into hot dogs.</p>
        <p>These noisy images are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning#Specific_Attacks_Types">adversarial examples</a>. They break the integrity of machine learning systems, and the illusion of their superhuman performance.</p>

        <h4>Why does this matter?</h4>
        <p>Our world is becoming increasingly automated, yet these systems have strange failure modes.</p>
        <p>If machine learning systems are not properly defended, attackers could:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Impersonate others in facial recognition systems</li>
          <li>Force autonomous vehicles to misrecognize street signs &amp; obstacles</li>
          <li>Bypass content moderation and spam filters in social networks</li>
          <li>Inject adversarial bytes into malware to bypass antivirus systems</li>
          <li>Digitally alter numbers on a check in a mobile banking app</li>
          <li>(and more)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Is this limited to image classification with neural networks?</h4>
        <p>No. Adversarial examples exist for almost every machine learning task: <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/code/audio_adversarial_examples">speech recognition</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07998.pdf">text classification</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3308558.3313533">fraud detection</a>, <a href="https://www.ericswallace.com/imitation">machine translation</a>, <a href="https://adversarialpolicies.github.io/">reinforcement learning</a>, ....</p>
        <p>Moreover, all machine learning models (not just neural networks) are vulnerable. In fact, simpler models such as logistic regression are <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf">even more easily attacked</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally – beyond adversarial examples – there are many more adversarial attack vectors, including data poisoning, model backdooring, data extraction, and model stealing.</p>

        <h4>How do I defend against adversarial examples?</h4>
        <p>There are several proposed defenses, including adversarial training and admission control.</p>
        <p>However, no defense is universal and many have proven ineffective, so work with an expert to quantify your risks and invest in defenses appropriately.</p>
        <p>(What happens if someone can make your system predict anything they want?).</p>

        <h4>Where can I learn more?</h4>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h3>Getting Things Done</h3><p><time datetime="2020-11-09"><small>9 Nov, 2020</small></time></p><p>I'm writing this blog post at 21:45 on a weekday after an intense day at work and a full evening of looking after my daughter and cooking pizza. I was in three video conferences and chatted with two colleagues in Teams, all while having my kid run around me all day because the daycare is closed. Now's the time to do something for <strong>me</strong>. Wouldn't it be nice to have some help to juggle all these different things and not feel overwhelmed?</p><p>In the next weeks, I'm trying out the Getting Things Done (GTD for short) method. I have tried GTD for short periods off and on over some years. Without knowing the concept, I used <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things">Things</a> but abandoned it after some time. That was over 10 years in my studies. A few years back, I read the original book and re-read it last year. So why try again? Didn't I learn my lesson?</p><p>No - I didn't :-). Although I've never completely adopted it, I've soaked up more and more of its practices. This time around I'll try to apply <em>all</em> its techniques as well as I can and see where that leads me.</p><h2 id="gtd-in-a-nutshell">GTD in a nutshell</h2><p>Quoted with small changes from the book:</p><ol><li>Capture all the things that might need to get done or have usefulness for you - now, later, someday, big little, or in between -- in a logical and trusted system outside your head and off your mind.</li><li>Direct yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the "inputs" you let into your life so that you will always have a workable inventory of "next actions" that you can implement or renegotiate in the moment.</li><li>Curate and coordinate all of that content, utilizing the recognition of the multiple levels of commitments with yourself and others you will have at play at any point in time.</li></ol><p>There are already many concise and complete introductions to the basics of GTD, so I won't repeat them here. Read <a href="https://hamberg.no/gtd">Erlend Hamberg's well-structured one: GTD in 15 minutes</a>. It's a quick and well-written guide.</p><p>In a sense, GTD is very American because I have the feeling (North) Americans are obsessed with lists. Many clickbait articles you come across have titles like "top X things" where X is more often than not simply the number somebody came up with. Although I must admit the last example was from a German site <a href="https://t3n.de/news/wordpress-hosting-anbieter-vergleich-604474/">13 WordPress-Anbieter</a>.</p><p>GTD has a list of the next actions one wants to look at. This is different from a todo list in that there are stricter rules on what a good entry can be. For example, it has to be a physical action and not a whole project. GTD also prescribes reviews (every day and every week) to keep on top of these lists. There's a comfort to know you'll triage a pressing question or inspiring article the next day or at least at your weekly review. This relief is at the heart of GTD: knowing that nothing will fall through the cracks you can relax from time to time.</p><p>One pays for a generally more relaxed general outlook by following a couple of small practices very closely. To capture all things, David Allen means that all emails or collected snippets are processed and collected too. I found it especially significant that one should collect references and notes on everything that might come in handy later. Collecting things comes <strong>very</strong> naturally to me; as a kid, I liked to collect buttons -- of all things -- and to keep many books around. When at long last I got my own computer I immediately started collecting <em>all the things</em>. My <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> accounts probably had more than a thousand collected links when it was shut down. GTD emphasizes to collect references for later usage. A lot of input is not useful at the moment and only potentially later at some point, but still, you can rely on your system to keep it for you.</p><h2 id="is-gtd-for-everybody%3F">Is GTD for everybody?</h2><p>David Allen originally "discovered" it in his work as a consultant and executive coach. I would argue that it's useful when you're already pretty organized. If you're in a routine job with little need for interaction with others it might be overkill for you. A simple todo list and some basic tricks to fight procrastination could be enough. There are fewer and fewer routine jobs. Most office workers are expected to be as "agile" when shifting many responsibilities as executives two decades ago.</p><h2 id="besides-gtd">Besides GTD</h2><p>In summary, I've mentioned that a convenient "setup" serves me better than vague "hacks". It can increase motivation and/or remove distractions. For my productivity, I still find it crucial to avoid news sites as much as possible. I've replaced them with a collection of RSS feeds from newspapers and some blogs. With a configured update interval of four hours, refreshing it every few minutes is less attractive. Turning off communication tools, the popular Pomodoro technique or simply walking to another room, still help me. I like that you can still apply many other ideas and still refine my <em>personal</em> system. If I had <strong>nothing</strong> to procrastinate on, that would be sad too, right?</p><p>I think getting rid of distractions is more important than having the perfect productivity system/todo tool. Cal Newport's ideas from his books (especially <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">"Deep Work"</a> and <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/">"Digital Minimalism"</a>) and his <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/">blog</a> immediately come to mind. <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/everyday-systems/">Here are some ideas from developer Tania Rascia</a> that I can relate to.</p><h2 id="how-to-implement-gtd">How to Implement GTD</h2><p>You have to decide if you want to go analog or digital. David Allen suggests in his book to keep lists and folders analog first. Digital tools realize GTD with more or less sophistication. I've never tried to use only paper although I tried working a lot with my Moleskine notebook. At some point, I had also used Things but only used it as a fancy todo list.</p><p>For me a very text-centric simple note-taking app called <a href="https://nvultra.com/">nvUltra</a> has worked well. It lets me write lists in different files synced between my laptop and smartphone. It's not very adapted to GTD but I like that it is an excellent reference system too. nvUltra is the commercial successor to the excellent open-source <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvAlt</a>. This in turn evolved from <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a>. There are also cross-platform implementations such as <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy">nvPY</a>.</p><p><a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done">todoist</a> is a sophisticated tool for GTD too. <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> has been around very long and has been refreshed over time. Other general-purpose note-taking tools can be adapted for GTD too, such as Evernote, Notion, or OneNote. <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a> is an alternative plain text file format that's more powerful than Markdown. It's mostly used with the Emacs editor and supports notes and todos as well.</p><h2 id="gtd-horizons">GTD horizons</h2><p>One distinguishing feature of GTD on top of todo management is more abstract and longer-term levels of focus. rom the day-to-day "ground" level, David Allen introduces the level of longer projects at horizon 1 and goes up to the purpose of your life with horizon 5. In his <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2015/05/podcast-01-david-allen-talks-about-the-new-edition-of-getting-things-done/">podcast</a>, David Allen mentions that for many it takes years to reach these longer-term perspectives. It takes a long time to integrate them into the system. He suggests one should start off with the day-to-day and form long-term plans bottom-up.</p><p>GTD horizons with their increased abstraction remind me of Eastern religions such as buddhism. In stoicism as well one works towards a very distant ideal of "enlightenment". This is not far-fetched as David Allen is a black belt karateka and used his experience in the conception of GTD. The book mentions having a "mind like water" to be ready for anything that may come to you as a concept from martial arts. There's also a blog by David Allen with <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2019/05/10-reasons-gtd-is-like-karate/">10 more similarities</a>.</p><h2 id="is-it-simply-self-exploitation%3F">Is it Simply Self-Exploitation?</h2><p>"Increasing productivity" also has a stale 19th century factory worker exploitation aspect to me. At least the basis of management "science" had very questionable origins. Managers "scientifically" noted how long some workers took to complete a task. They noted the fastest and decided to increase work quotas for everybody. Even then short-term exploitation didn't have long-term lasting positive effects.</p><p>One could argue that a personal productivity system only serves as self-exploitation. Where managers exploited industrial workers, we do it ourselves now. I haven't read or though much about this, but a <a href="https://dev.to/tinmanjk/the-curious-case-of-self-exploitation--303j">dev article by Ivan Petrov raises some interesting points</a>. They emphasize:</p><blockquote><p>What I have learned and forgotten and re-learned is that the power NOT to do (negative potency) seems to be the only weapon.</p></blockquote><p>This at least we can take to heart by filtering out many actions. We can also try to move away from "outside" areas of (work) focus and focus on our own values and vision.</p><h2 id="trial-period">Trial Period</h2><p>For the next month until December 6th, I'm implementing GTD and revisiting its techniques. For me some questions still remain unanswered:</p><ul><li>When to "uncover" the following project "next action"? As soon as a previous one is done? At the daily or weekly review?</li><li>Should I track project "next actions" in the same list of individual "next actions"? Wouldn't this create a lot of extra overhead to copy tasks from files to files?</li><li>Can I effectively attach project and action reference material with my bare-bones plain-text system? nvUltra doesn't have support to easily attach images or other files.</li><li>Should I keep some references available for all completed actions for later reference?</li><li>Are the tickler files something I can implement digitally? Should I use it for habits and routines?</li><li>Will I have the discipline to postpone work tasks (that often overwhelm my todo list)?</li><li>Should I copy information from other tracking tools that I use with others, e.g. JIRA?</li><li>How exactly to keep track of deadlines (with tickler files or also in projects)?</li><li>Should I handle personal or professional tasks differently after all?</li><li>What are my higher horizons like "areas of responsibility", "objectives", "vision" and "purpose"?</li></ul><h2 id="references">References</h2><ul><li><a href="https://forum.gettingthingsdone.com/">Official GTD Forum</a></li></ul><h3 id="overview%2Fintroduction">Overview/Introduction</h3><ul><li><a href="https://hamberg.no/gtd">GTD in 15 minutes</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done</a></li><li><a href="https://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done">Merlin Mann's Intro with further links</a></li></ul><h3 id="references-2">References</h3><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190602235428/http://wiki.43folders.com:80/index.php/GTD">Merlin Mann's wiki via Wayback Machine</a></li></ul><h3 id="scientific-evaluation">Scientific Evaluation</h3><ul><li><a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GTD-cognition.pdf">"Getting Things Done: The Science behind Stress-Free Productivity"</a></li></ul></article></div>]]>

  <blockquote>
<p>Mr. Bezos. I’m all in favor of a clean fulfillment center, but tell me: Why do you sweep? Why do you not instead eliminate the source of dirt? - Unknown “insultant”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does DevOps pass the “so what?” test? When you start to follow the history of DevOps from Agile, Lean, TOS, TQM, TPS, and beyond; doesn’t it lead to plain old critical thinking? Is it anything special? If it’s so simple, if anyone can do it, then why on earth would the worlds richest person <a href="https://youtu.be/O4MtQGRIIuA?t=1250">pay an “insultant” to teach him</a>? Jeff seems to understand that eliminating waste is important, that you should never pass a defect down the line, but he seems to discard the sweeping question as too abstract, and not useful.</p>
<p>Las Cruces Public Schools (LCPS) may be a perfect example of an organization that’s proud of their ability to <a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/education/lcps/2020/11/14/las-cruces-public-schools-what-ransomware-attack-taught-us/6296955002/">scale up sweeping operations in response to a ransomware incident</a>. Why are they so proud of their investment of resources, to deal with ransomware? <a href="http://www.lcps.net/district-overview/">How does that support their mission</a>? Who’s their customer? Ransomware? If DevOps is just critical thinking and LCPS’ value statement is “<a href="http://www.lcps.net/district-overview/">our expectation is that our schools are diverse, equitable, and provide opportunities for the development of critical thinking and democratic ideals</a>”, then shouldn’t we hold them accountable for critical thinking?</p>
<p>Nobody gravitates towards DevOps when everything is working. DevOps isn’t valuable in environments where waste is cheap, it’s valuable where waste isn’t cheap. I’d have to think it’s valuable in any public school system that’s struggling to meet demand within their budget. Maybe it’s too late to help LCPS avoid ransomware, but maybe we can help another school system through a little critical thinking exercise.</p>
<p>Most of what people assume is “DevOps” is just repackaged teaching from an Isreali physicist who wrote a book for the business world in 1984. That book, The Goal, <a href="https://slate.com/business/2012/06/the-goal-eli-goldratts-gripping-thriller-about-operations-theory.html">is still popular in business schools</a>. If there’s one thing Eliyahu Goldratt, the author of The Goal, consistently talks about in all of his teaching, it’s understanding cause and effect. Goldratt advocates for the use of what he calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_reality_tree_(theory_of_constraints)">Current Reality Tree</a> (CRT) to map out the cause and effect of a problem, the conflict, and where to focus resources on resolution.</p>
<p>Let’s try it out with Ransomware, it may look something like this if we simply map out the cause and effect relationships of what we know about a <a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/">ransomware incident</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-1.png" alt="simple cause and effect"></p>
<p>Make sense? Now let’s look at a full current reality tree, where we go beyond the ransomware incident, and start to look at how a ransomware opportunity was created.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-2.png" alt="full crt">
<a href="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-2.png">Full Image</a></p>
<p>It balloons out when we start to understand all the vectors of how they get on our network, and what they do, once they get there.</p>
<p>Vectors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/">Phishing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/business-security-world/2018/08/protect-rdp-access-ransomware-attacks/">Perimeter System: Compromised Credentials</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/black-kingdom-ransomware-hacks-networks-with-pulse-vpn-flaws/">Perimeter System: Missing Patch</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once they get on the network they’ll deploy a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/09/24/cobalt_strike_cisco_talos/">command and control</a> (C&amp;C) tool that enables them to drop additional tools and start hunting domain admins. They’ll search for servers or computers <a href="https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound">where they can login, and where the domain admin is logged in</a>. Once they find that system they grab either the domain admin’s password, or their session information (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash">just as good as a password</a>), then it’s game over. They now have keys to the kingdom and can delete backups and encrypt systems.</p>
<p>Now that you know how it works, and the cause and effect: Did LCPS eliminate the source of dirt?</p>
<p>This is the only statement that covers what they learned, and how they changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since then, we have installed firewalls, updated our systems, invested in our teachers and improved our infrastructure so we can protect ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we go back to our current reality tree we can ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does a firewall address the conflict points? It’s not clear if they’re talking about a new fancy next-gen perimeter firewall, improved network segregation, or host firewalls. Segregation and host firewalls could help if they prevent the bad actor from logging into a shared system where domain admin is logged in.</li>
<li>Was the problem updated systems? Possible vector if they’re not patching, but it doesn’t address the core conflict.</li>
<li>Invested in our teachers and improved our infrastructure. Great. Keep it up, but it still doesn’t address the core conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the core conflict:</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-3.png" alt="core conflict"></p>
<p>The number of domain admins is the core conflict. It’s rarely necessary to have any domain admins, but most organizations have much more than zero when it’s easier to give somebody domain admin access, than it is to take the time to give them only the access they need to do their job. Plain old Least Privilege. Plain old <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/controlled-use-of-administrative-privileges/">#4 on the CIS Top 20 security controls</a>.</p>
<p>Did LCPS go back and fix the core conflict, or are they still passing a defect downline? What should they have done prior to the Ransomware breach? What can you do now? Evaluate your blast radius. Your InfoSec and/or IT teams should be following the advice of <a href="https://adsecurity.org/">adsecurity.org</a>. They should be running tools like <a href="https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound">Plumhound</a> or <a href="https://www.guardicore.com/infectionmonkey/">Infection Monkey</a> to understand and reduce blast radius.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be an IT or InfoSec expert to get a glimpse into your ransomware risk. You’re at less risk, possibly near zero, if your organization isn’t using Active Directory; but if they are, you can run the powershell below from your computer to evaluate blast radius.</p>
<pre><code># This will install AD tools on Windows 10
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
# This will list all domain admins
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recursive | %{Get-ADUser -Identity $_.distinguishedName -properties *} | Select Name, Enabled, LastLogonDate, logonCount, PasswordLastSet
# This will list all enterprise admins
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Enterprise Admins" -Recursive | %{Get-ADUser -Identity $_.distinguishedName -properties *} | Select Name, Enabled, LastLogonDate, logonCount, PasswordLastSet
</code></pre>
<p>That powershell will list user accounts ransomware teams are interested in, the ones they’ll go after once they land on your network. Ideally that list is zero. It’s not zero? Shocker! How about passwords? Are they being rotated quickly? Ideally every 7 days or less. What’s the logon count look like? Is it in the hundreds? Ouch, somebody is running around with scissors.</p>
<p>Concerned? Send that output to your IT or InfoSec teams. Ask them if they understand the advice of adsecurity.org or Plumhound. Maybe they have it under control, but maybe they need a little poking to remind them it’s important.</p>
<p>Interested in learning more about the so what of DevOps, and how it applies to Information Security? I’m writing a book.

The most important update is obviously the announcement from Pfizer that they had developed a vaccine offering ‘90% protection’ against COVID-19. The stock market reacted accordingly, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average opening up 1,500 points on Monday morning, and the Russell 2000 Small Cap Value Index rocketing 7% higher for the&nbsp;<em>day.&nbsp;</em>Now, the ironic part of all this is that the positive vaccine news is coming at a time when we are seeing exponential growth in cases around the country. On Friday the United States hit another daily record for COVID cases at 184,514 reported cases.</p>
<p>However, knowing that there is now a light at the end of the tunnel I want to use today’s post to focus on some of the silver linings and unintended&nbsp;<em>positive</em> consequences of past crises, crashes, and darkest hours in history. While there is much to be negative about in a time of pandemics and politics, there will be certainly be knock-on effects that have a positive effect on society, markets, and business.</p>
<p>For instance, a recent example that was pointed out to me was the return on investment for London’s considerable investment in the city’s infamous 19th century sewage system, as described below:</p>
<p>London was a rapidly growing city with a population that had reached two million by 1840, having doubled since the beginning of the century and it had a big sewage problem. Before the construction of proper sewers, most of London’s sewage was recycled as fertilizer. Individual houses had cesspools (though often these were just the cellars). The solid waste or ‘night-soil’ was collected from these by well-paid ‘nightmen’ (they were only allowed to work at night) who transported it to the market gardens surrounding the city. The wastewater either seeped into the ground or flowed through the streets into the old natural rivers, which had become public sewers. These all eventually flowed out into the River Thames.</p>
<h4>London’s Water Supply Problem</h4>
<p>Supplying clean drinking water was another serious problem. Some of London’s water came from shallow wells within the city and was delivered by the bucketful. More prosperous areas had piped water provided by private water companies from springs in the hills around London or, most dangerously, from the Thames itself.</p>
<p>The invention of the flush toilet or water closet at the end of the eighteenth century made things worse. Well-off households that could afford a proper water supply could now dispense with a smelly cesspool and simply flush all their waste away – and out into the Thames.</p>
<h4><strong>Cholera Arrives</strong></h4>
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/sites/www.open.edu.openlearn/files/ole_images/the_silent_highwayman_800.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="460"></p><p>Death rows on the polluted River Thames in a cartoon from Punch Magazine (1858)</p></div>
<p><strong>Cholera is a deadly disease. The primary symptom is acute diarrhea, which drains the body of nutrients and fluids. In 1831, there was a global outbreak. It had originated in India but had spread across Europe and arrived in Britain. This outbreak killed over 6,000 people in London. At the time, the cause of the disease was a mystery. The link between the disease and the contamination of drinking water by human sewage was suspected by some. It was obvious that Thames water, when seen through a microscope, was far from clean and it was a subject of wonderful campaigning cartoons in the London newspapers and the satirical magazine Punch.</strong></p>
<p>However, at this time the dominant opinion was the ‘miasmatic theory’, that the disease was spread by ‘fould air’. It wasn’t the polluted water that was deadly, but the very smell of it…</p>
<p>In 1848 the government had established a Metropolitan Commission of Sewers. After issuing a general invitation to engineers to submit proposals for dealing with London’s sewage, an engineer with a background in land drainage methods, Joseph Bazalgette, was hired. In 1855, the Metropolitan Local Management Bill was put through Parliament. This attempted to centralise some aspects of the administration of London. It created the <strong>Metropolitan Board of Works</strong>, one of whose duties was to ‘make such sewers and works as they may think necessary for preventing all and any part of the sewage of the Metropolis from flowing into the River Thames in or near the Metropolis’.</p>
<p>Joseph Bazalgette was appointed chief engineer for the Board of Works. He took his duties very seriously, reviewing 137 different proposals and producing a detailed plan for a scheme of intercepting sewers collecting London’s sewage and discharging it into the Thames 10 miles further downstream (which could be interpreted as being ‘near the Metropolis’)…</p>
<p>Bazalgette’s scheme was an extraordinary feat of engineering. It involved the construction of major new ‘intercepting sewers’ that would collect sewage from the existing piecemeal array of sewers and move it down river. On the north bank, sewage would be carried eastwards as far as Beckton, eight miles east of St Paul’s Cathedral, to be stored and then discharged on the outgoing tide. On the south bank, the sewage would flow as far as Crossness, two miles further downstream, where the same would happen.</p>
<div>
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/sites/www.open.edu.openlearn/files/ole_images/bazalgettes_system_of_intercepting_sewers_-_800_1.jpg" alt="Bazalgette’s system of intercepting sewers " width="767" height="441"></p><p>A map of Bazalgette’s 1858 scheme</p></div>
</div>
<p>Most of the scheme was very carefully designed to flow by gravity, but at critical points, all of the sewage would have to be pumped to a higher level using huge steam pumps. Those installed at Deptford in 1864 were at the time the largest ever built. One of these pumping stations was at Abbey Mills, where much of the sewage from London’s East End had to be pumped up into the enormous Northern Outfall Sewer which flowed across the marshland towards the discharge point at Beckton. This was a prestige project and the buildings above ground, such as the pumping stations, were lavishly decorated.</p>
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/sites/www.open.edu.openlearn/files/ole_images/crossness_pumping_station_-_800_2.jpg" alt="" width="657" height="378"></p><p>The restored interior of the pumping station at Crossness</p></div>
<p>Bazalgette replaced 165 miles of old sewers as well as constructing 1100 miles of new ones. It required the excavation of 3.5 million cubic yards of earth by hand – there were no mechanical diggers at the time. The construction consumed 318 million bricks and demand was such that it forced up the price of them in London by about 50%. The need for more bricklayers meant that wages had to be increased from 5 shillings (25 pence) per day to 6 shillings (30 pence) or more. It consumed nearly a million cubic yards of concrete. A special mill was built at Crossness to produce this, together with a railway to distribute it</p>
<p>The project made pioneering use of Portland cement, which was water resistant, rather than conventional lime mortar. Because its manufacturing process was so new, Bazalgette insisted on a draconian regime of quality control, with every batch being tested before it was used. The southern drainage scheme was completed in 1865 and the northern one in 1868. Most of the pumping stations were opened by Royalty, and some of the enormous sewage pumps were even named after members of the royal family.</p>

<p>While the project was an incredibly costly one, we can only imagine the impact that this improved sewage system had on the city in terms of preventing widespread and frequent cholera outbreaks going forward. Like the theme of today’s post, this positive outcome stemmed from a dark period in London that was filled with disease and death. This impressive engineering feat offered a real silver lining.</p>
<p>Now let’s dive in!</p>

<p>I’ll just give you a little teaser as you should really read the article, but did you know Bank of America was actually founded as the Bank of Italy?

<p>For those that survived, the Black Death was a godsend for serfs in Europe as the decimated labor supply suddenly gave them some leverage at the bargaining table with Lords of vast manors that suddenly had little to no laborers to till their land. Despite the atrocity that was the bubonic plague, the dissolution of serfdom across large swathes of Europe offers a silver lining.</p>
<p><em>‘After the Black Death, serfdom disappeared in Western Europe while making a resurgence in Eastern Europe. What explains this difference? I argue that serfdom was against the interests of the sovereign and was only imposed when the nobility, most of whom needed serfdom to maintain their economic and social standing, had leverage to impose their will. One way the nobility gained this power was through financing the military. Using data from the fourteenth to through the eighteenth centuries, I show that serfdom was imposed in areas where sovereigns had few other resources to pay for war or defense. This paper addresses the causes of a historical institution that scholars from Moore (1966) to Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) have argued played an important role in the development, or lack thereof, of democracy and long-term economic growth.’</em></p>

<p>July 12<sup>th</sup>, 2020</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Twitter can be a very useful source of information and news. Or, it can waste your time and make you sad. It’s all in how you use it. Here I’ll show you how to make Twitter work for you, instead of against you.</p>
<p>There are many things you can do to turn Twitter into a useful tool, but there is one central concept that is more important than everything else combined. If you absorb and apply this idea, you will transform Twitter from a source of pointless irritation into a veritable lifehack.</p>
<p>The secret is to completely separate the concepts of <em>following</em> and <em>reading</em>.</p>
<p>Let me explain: the person finally giving in and signing up for Twitter looks for instruction and advice on how to get started and how to use it. This advice, either from helpful writers on the internet or from Twitter itself, goes something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Look for people who are interesting to you;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow them;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Observe your timeline, where their tweets will appear.</strong></p>
<p>If you follow this advice, you will be doing it wrong. This is the exact opposite of how you should use Twitter. The problems with this approach are:</p>
<p>You may see the tweets not always in the order in which they were tweeted, but in some other order that Twitter creates for you;</p>
<p>You will see “promoted tweets” interpolated between the tweets you signed up to see. This is paid advertising;</p>
<p>You will see random other things you didn’t ask for;</p>
<p>You will be inundated with “suggestions” from Twitter about people to follow, trending topics to keep on top of, and other irrelevant nonsense;</p>
<p>You will never see some of the tweets tweeted by the people you are following. They simply will not appear in your timeline;</p>
<p>Everyone can see the list of people you follow. You may or may not want this;</p>
<p>You will discover that the people you followed because you admire them have nothing interesting to say, only tweeting cat pictures and worn-out memes.</p>
<p>In short, you will be fed tons of stuff you never signed up for, and not get what you wanted.</p>
<p>You can’t turn <em>any</em> of this off. Twitter lets you tell it that you want to see <em>less</em> of some kinds of things, but there are no actual settings to turn off advertising or suggestions about fascinating hashtags.</p>
<p>The first step in fixing Twitter for yourself is to understand what following is really for. You don’t follow an account because you want to read their tweets. Twitter is “social media”, and following is a social signal. When you follow someone you are declaring that you approve of that person. Whether or not this is what you intended, this is how your decision to follow someone will be interpreted. If you are, for example, a journalist researching neo-Nazis, and part of your research involves tracking what they are saying on Twitter, you may not want to be seen as endorsing these people.</p>
<p>Obviously, you may want to read certain people’s tweets without following them. And you can! Twitter allows you to create private <em>lists</em> of accounts that you can track without following. You can see all their tweets scroll by without appearing to have endorsed them. The composition of your private lists, and even their existence, will remain secret. The people you add won’t know you’re adding them, nor that you’re seeing their tweets, unless you choose to interact with them. In addition, the tweets will appear in chronological order, with no interpolated advertising nor any other junk, unlike in your timeline. But you must not forget to mark the lists as private. In the picture below, one arrow points to the widget for creating a new list, and another points to the all-important checkbox for making the list private. You should only make private lists; there is no reason to make public lists, and, in fact, some people object to being placed in them (for some reason that escapes me, but behavior on Twitter is weird in many ways).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/newlist.png" alt="Making a list"></p>
<p>Make as many lists as you want, as fine-grained or as general as you think will be useful to you. You can have an astronomy list, or a list just with people who talk about astrophotography with iPhones. You can make a list for local news, and one for international news. You can put accounts in more than one list, so the exact composition of a list is not a crucial decision. This is how you separate the concepts of reading and following. You follow when you want to let people know you are following (hi, Mom), and you want everyone else to know, too. When you become famous and have a million followers, you can follow others to amplify their signals. Until then, follow to encourage, to lend support, and to let others know where you stand. If you also want to read the tweets of someone you follow (and you might not), put that person in one of your lists in addition. Your followee’s tweets will also appear in your timeline, but you won’t see them there, because <em>you will never look at your timeline</em>. Of course, you literally don’t have to follow a single person. Following is public. Aggregating accounts into lists is your private business.</p>
<p>Lists become most useful when there is an interface for conveniently seeing what’s on them. The regular Twitter clients are not very good for this, but Twitter has an alternative client that is made for it. Use <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-use-tweetdeck">TweetDeck</a>. It divides your twitterverse into columns. Each column can contain the tweets from one of your lists; in addition, you can create columns that track search terms, individual accounts, hashtags, your notifications, your direct messages, and more. By default, it will have a column with your timeline, but you can delete that, because, as I hope is clear by now, your timeline is a waste of time.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/tweetdeck.jpg" alt="Tweetdeck. Picture by Ruben Schade">
</figure>
<p>This interface, although not perfect, helps a great deal in making Twitter more useful. If you keep it open, it can be a low-distraction way of monitoring recent tweets from low-traffic lists. You can delete columns you don’t care about today, and add them back in tomorrow.</p>
<p>Lists and search terms, combined with the avoidance of the timeline and the use of TweetDeck, already turns Twitter from a cesspool with advertising into a useful news feed. But by combining this with a few other practices, you can make Twitter even better.</p>
<p>First, control yourself. Use the platform as a source of timely information, and as a way to be helpful with others by offering information or advice. Do not, ever, no matter how strongly you feel that someone is <em><a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">wrong</a></em>, get into an argument on Twitter. I have often failed to heed this advice myself; do what I say, not what I do. Twitter can be a fantastic source of news from all over the world; it is often the first place you will hear about something, and sometimes the only place. It can be a very useful platform for receiving and offering technical information, such as links to papers. I recently contributed a scrap of code, in a tweet, for a maintainer of the venerable linux utility <code>curl</code>; the result is in <a href="https://github.com/curl/stats/commit/ac6ae20082fd5e61aa7122b1d4c6030e48ba52a9">this commit</a>. This kind of interaction is satisfying, but trying to have an actual discussion or argument never is, because it is impossible to do with this platform. At best, you will score points against someone not as clever as you; and that and $2.50 will get you a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Next, use the muting function. Even members of your carefully curated lists will sometimes decide to spend a week talking incessantly about their new sneakers. Mute them until they get over it. <a href="https://lee-phillips.org/makeTwitterBetter/">Mute words and phrases</a>, too, for those times when a bunch of people are talking about something that you don’t care to see in your feeds (NBA playoffs, political debates, you name it).</p>
<p>When you discover someone interesting on Twitter, check their profile for a link to a website. <img src="https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/redfern.png"> Click on it. If the person is worth following on Twitter, his or her website is likely to be of even more interest. Check the site for an Atom or RSS feed (look over to the right to see where I’ve used a version of the Atom/RSS feed icon). If there is one, subscribe in your feedreader. If you don’t have a feedreader, you should set one up. I use <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/">Newsblur</a>.</p>
<p>I hope I’ve shown you some ways to make Twitter work for you. If you have any additional suggestions, please leave me a comment so I can incorporate them.</p>

                The Guinness Book of World Records says that Deinococcus radiodurans is the worldâ€™s most extremophile bacterium. As its name suggests, this bacterium can deal with radiation. It has even been found on the inside walls of nuclear reactors.

                The Guinness Book of World Records says that Deinococcus radiodurans is the worldâ€™s most extremophile bacterium. As its name suggests, this bacterium can deal with radiation. It has even been found on the inside walls of nuclear reactors.
            </p>

            <div><h3>Fascination with these survivors</h3>

<p>Scientists have been fascinated by these tough bacteria for years. The <a href="https://www.micropia.nl/en/discover/microbiology/microbes/">microbes</a> can deal with extreme cold, lack of water, vacuums and high acidity. And how is it that it can also withstand extreme radiation despite the fact that radiation does not occur in the natural world?</p>

<h3>Back-up against mutations</h3>

<p>Since they started researching its genome, scientists have discovered various mechanisms in the bacterium which protect it against mutation. <em>D. radiodurans</em> has within it, for example, multiple copies of its genome. If just one of these remains unchanged, it can survive. <em>D. radiodurans</em> also has an extremely efficient <a href="https://www.micropia.nl/en/discover/microbiology/dna/">DNA</a> repair mechanism.</p>

<h3>Learning from bacteria</h3>

<p>Genetic mutations have major consequences for mankind. Human cells only have one copy of the genome and do not have <em>D. radioduransâ€™</em> quick and efficient DNA repair mechanism. It is possible that we could learn a lot from this bacterium. For example, research into the micro-organism could lead to medical applications to protect people better against the terrible results of radiation poisoning.</p>

November 15, 2020 | https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-v0.3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-v0.3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a while since we released v0.2 of <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a> and that I have posted about it <a href="https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-v0.2-and-future">here</a>.</p>
<p>In that post I gave a view about the potential future of <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a>. We finally released v0.3 and the future is now the default.</p>
<p>Just listing all the changes we made would probably be quite boring and therefore I want to create a neat animation along the way and explain some parts of the awesome Fourier series.</p>
<p>I think quite a lot of people have heard about the Fourier series but didn't fully understand it. I'm quite sure I'm still part of that crew. Others might not know what I'm talking about and I don't know whether it's a good idea to read this post as your introduction but I'll give my best.</p>
<p>Additionally, I envy the latter group because Fourier series is something extremely fascinating.</p>
<p>This blog is mostly for readers who are interested in <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a> and JuliaLang so I'll start with the changes we did for v0.3.</p>

<h2 id="changes_in_v03_on_a_higher_level"><a href="#changes_in_v03_on_a_higher_level">Changes in v0.3 on a higher level</a></h2>
<p>We finally have a version for transposing a matrix or I prefer to say general morphing capabilities as transposing only works sometimes 😄 Nevertheless, I'll make a post about that shortly after this one. (Okay let's say in November... hopefully)</p>
<p>Something that unfortunately didn't make it into v0.3 though is the ability to have layers but we are getting there. We conceptually have a plan for it but haven't found the time to code it yet. There might be also some tweaks to the concept.</p>
<p>The next point from the list of <a href="https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-v0.2-and-future">the previous post</a> is "Renaming stuff".</p>
<p>We did rename quite a few things and I hope a bit that you either haven't used v0.2 of Javis 😂 OR that you are adaptable and are happy with the changes we made.</p>
<p>Let's just list a few of them:</p>
<p><code>Action</code> and <code>SubAction</code> are now called <code>Object</code> and <code>Action</code> respectively. This is due to the fact that the <code>Action</code> before describes more the object itself and doesn't have the capability to actually move the object now. It had the option before but we decided to remove it. We did this to simplify the codebase and make the distinction much clearer.</p>
<p>Next up we simplified <code>BackgroundAction</code> to <code>Background</code>. No more comments on that 😄</p>
<p>Finally we removed <code>Translation</code>, <code>Rotation</code> and <code>Scaling</code> and introduced <code>anim_translate</code>, <code>anim_rotate</code>/<code>anim_rotate_around</code> as well as <code>anim_scale</code> because working with functions instead of structs seems to be more natural and the naming specifies that we do some animation here and not a static translation.</p>
<p>Our last mayor change was to get rid of the <code>javis</code> function and the weird design I started with. It was a huge mess with these weird arrays.</p>
<p>One now defines the video, objects and actions just line by line and renders the video in the end.</p>
<p>Just to give you an example</p>
<pre><code>using Javis
function ground(args...)
    background("black")
    sethue("white")
end

video = Video(800, 400)
Background(1:100, ground)
ball = Object((args...)-&gt;circle(O, 100, :fill), Point(-500, 0))
rolling = Action(anim_translate(Point(1000, 0)))
act!(ball, rolling)

render(video; pathname="rolling_ball.gif")</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/rolling_ball.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/rolling_ball.gif" alt="Rolling ball 1"></a></p><p>I think one can clearly see what is defined where besides maybe a few quirks... 😄</p>
<p>The <code>circle</code> function takes the center point and the radius as well as the action (here <code>:fill</code>). Why do I define it at the center center? I could have defined it at <code>Point(-500, 0)</code> but I like to think of objects being centered and then move them around. Maybe it's just me but it has the advantage that it's easy to scale objects correctly and makes rotations easier.</p>
<p>It's not really possible to see a rotation of a circle (currently we don't rotate it). How about adding something to the circle such that we can differentiate between a rotating circle and a moving one.</p>
<pre><code>using Javis
function ground(args...)
    background("black")
    sethue("white")
end

function my_circle(args...)
    circle(O, 100, :fill)
    sethue("black")
    line(O, Point(100, 0), :stroke)
end

video = Video(800, 400)
Background(1:100, ground)
ball = Object(my_circle, Point(-500, 0))
translating = Action(anim_translate(Point(1000, 0)))
rotating = Action(anim_rotate(0.0, 2*2π))
act!(ball, [translating, rotating])

render(video; pathname="rolling_ball_2.gif")</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/rolling_ball_2.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/rolling_ball_2.gif" alt="Rolling ball 2"></a></p><p>That one is clearly rolling. Okay I might have gotten a bit distracted with that one 😄 but we can reuse that for later.</p>
<p>Now in v0.2 it would be quite hard to make the line inside the circle grow longer with time I think. Actually this was possible with v0.2.2 but I haven't written about it yet so this is the time of <strong>change</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>using Javis
function ground(args...)
    background("black")
    sethue("white")
end

function my_circle(args...; line_length=0)
    circle(O, 100, :fill)
    sethue("black")
    setline(2)
    line(O, Point(line_length, 0), :stroke)
end

video = Video(800, 400)
Background(1:100, ground)
ball = Object(my_circle, Point(-500, 0))
translating = Action(anim_translate(Point(1000, 0)))
rotating = Action(anim_rotate(0.0, 2*2π))
changing_len = Action(change(:line_length, 0 =&gt; 100))
act!(ball, [translating, rotating, changing_len])

render(video; pathname="rolling_ball_3.gif")</code></pre>

<p>We kind of have the building blocks for fourier now 😉</p>

<p>We basically try to combine simple waves (sine waves) and add them up to create a square wave.</p>
<p>Importantly there is nothing special about the square function. This works with every function. One just needs to add quite a lot of the functions together. For the actual result we need infinitely many. </p>
<h3 id="lets_quickly_change_to_2d"><a href="#lets_quickly_change_to_2d">Let's quickly change to 2D</a></h3>
<p>I actually want to draw something in 2D though instead of this 1D function. 2D is much more interesting when you ask me.</p>
<p>BTW this entire idea of using <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a> to visualize the Fourier series came from <a href="https://github.com/ric-cioffi">Riccardo Cioffi</a>, who I like to call the first user of <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a>. He also coded it himself without us knowing about this until we saw <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/t/fourier-draws-the-julia-logo/47309">his post</a> about it on the JuliaLang discourse. Please check it out!</p>
<p>It was done using a previous version of Javis so the code doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>I'll wait here for a couple of minutes while you enjoy his stunning visualization.</p>
<p>Let's start with some building blocks that make sense to understand the Fourier series in 2D. I'll start with circles and complex numbers.</p>
<p>In general I'll basically go through the stuff that Grant Sanderson explained beautifully on his YouTube Channel 3blue1brown <a href="https://youtu.be/r6sGWTCMz2k">But what is a Fourier series?</a>. There are some more references at the end of this post 😉</p>
<p>You've seen some circles before but let's have a look at how to work with them using complex numbers.</p>
<p>I here refer to the usage of the formula</p><p>
\[
e^{2\pi i t}
\]
</p><p>where t is our variable ranging from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code> and <code>i</code> is the imaginary unit.</p>
<p>This therefore computes a complex number when we give it some \(t\). We plot that by simply using the real component of our complex number on the x-axis and the complex component on the y-axis.</p>
<p>In this visualization the circle is drawn up to a certain point at each frame and completes the circle with <code>t=1.00</code></p>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/circle.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/circle.gif" alt="Circle path"></a></p><p>This is just something to keep in mind for the rest of the post. </p>
<p>Next up we start with a shape let's say a star that we want to draw using circles rotating around circles as circles are the sine waves of 2D space.</p>
<p>I think this is best explained visually so I'll show you what we are trying to achieve first and then show you how to get there. </p>
<h3 id="what_we_want_to_create"><a href="#what_we_want_to_create">What we want to create</a></h3>
<p>This is kind of what we want to achieve but we will have a look at more complicated shapes later. For that we will use more circles though and then it's hard to grasp what's going on.</p>

</a></p><p>By John Lekberg on November 15, 2020.
</p><hr>
<p>This week's post is about solving the "String Search" problem.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-searching_algorithm">String-searching algorithms</a> have applications in a wide range of fields, including digital forensics and spam detection.</p>
<p>You will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solution</a>.</li>
<li>How to improve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solution</a> by
using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm">Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm</a>.</li>
<li>How to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern">proxy object</a> that allows you to use <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/oneBasedIndexing.html">1-based indexing</a>
(used by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm">Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of the "String Search" problem is to find the first index (using
<a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/zeroBasedIndexing.html">0-based indexing</a>) of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substring">substring</a>, <strong>pattern</strong>, in a larger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">string</a>,
<strong>text.</strong> E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Find the first index of "o" in "hello world".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As input, you are given two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)">strings</a>, <strong>text</strong> and <strong>pattern.</strong></p>
<p>As output, you must return the first index of <strong>pattern</strong> inside <strong>text</strong>. If
<strong>pattern</strong> is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substring">substring</a> of <strong>text</strong>, then return nothing.</p>
<p>E.g., here's a scenario with a match:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text</strong> is "hello world".</li>
<li><strong>Pattern</strong> is "o".</li>
<li>The first index of <strong>pattern</strong> inside <strong>text</strong> is 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g., here's a scenario without a match:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text</strong> is "hello world".</li>
<li><strong>Pattern</strong> is "z".</li>
<li><strong>Pattern</strong> does not occur inside <strong>text.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In production code,</strong> please use the built-in method <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.index">str.index</a> instead of
creating your own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-searching_algorithm">string-searching algorithm</a>. However, there are only
built-in methods for <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str">str objects</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#binary-sequence-types-bytes-bytearray-memoryview">bytes objects</a>: if you want to, e.g., find the first index of <code>[2, 3]</code> within <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>, then you'll need to use other code (write your own or use a library).</p>

<p>For the input, I represent <strong>text</strong> and <strong>pattern</strong> as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy">Sequence
objects</a>. In Python, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy">Sequence object</a> can be a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#text-sequence-type-str">str
object</a>, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">list object</a>, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#binary-sequence-types-bytes-bytearray-memoryview">bytes object</a>, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range">tuple object</a>, etc.
It represents a general "sequence" type. E.g. here are some <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy">Sequence
objects</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"hello world"</code></li>
<li><code>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)</code></li>
<li><code>["Aâ™­majâ�·", "gm", "fâ™¯o", "fmâ�·", "Eâ�·", "Eâ™­", "Dâ�·", "Gâ�·sus4", "Gâ�·"]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For the output, I represent the index as an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex">int object</a> (e.g. <code>7</code>). If there is no
match, then I use the special constant <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html?highlight=none#None">None</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force solution</a> to the "String Search" problem can iterate over
every index in <strong>text</strong> and see if <strong>pattern</strong> matches at that index. If the
match fails at a particular index, then I move onto the next index.</p>
<p>Here's Python code that does this:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def string_search_bf(*, text, pattern):
    """Find the first index of `pattern` in `text`
    using brute force. If nothing is found, then
    return None.
    
    text -- Sequence. E.g. "hello" or [1, 2, 3, 4].
    pattern -- Sequence. E.g. "ll" or [2, 3].
    """
    n, m = len(text), len(pattern)
    for i in range(1 + (n - m)):
        match = True
        for j in range(m):
            if text[i + j] != pattern[j]:
                match = False
                break
        if match:
            return i


string_search_bf(text="hello world", pattern="o")
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>4
</code></pre>
<p>What's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this code? For <var>n</var>-element
<strong>text</strong> and <var>m</var>-element <strong>pattern:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I iterate over <code>i</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">O</a>(<var>n</var>-<var>m</var>) times.
<ul>
<li>Within each iteration, I iterate over <code>j</code> O(<var>m</var>) times.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, the overall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of this algorithm is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O((<var>n</var>-<var>m</var>)<var>m</var>) time</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For <var>n</var>-element <strong>text</strong> and <var>m</var>-element <strong>pattern</strong>, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm">Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm</a> solves the "String Search" problem in</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O(<var>n</var>+m) time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is more efficient than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time complexity</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force
algorithm</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O((<var>n</var>-<var>m</var>)<var>m</var>) time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm">Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm</a> is to <strong>make use of
previous partial matches.</strong> In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search">brute force algorithm</a>, when a match fails, the algorithm backtracks <strong>text</strong> to the next
index. But in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm">Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm</a>, when a match fails, the
algorithm doesn't backtrack <strong>text</strong>. Instead, the algorithm determines how to
backtrack <strong>pattern</strong> to find the current partial match.</p>
<p>For more information on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm">Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm</a>, see</p>

<a href="https://doi.org/10.1137/0206024">https://doi.org/10.1137/0206024</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The algorithm outlined in this paper uses <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/oneBasedIndexing.html">1-based indexing</a>.
Instead of modifying the algorithm to use <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/zeroBasedIndexing.html">0-based indexing</a>, I created a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern">proxy object</a>, <code>OneBased</code>, that allows me to use <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/oneBasedIndexing.html">1-based indexing</a> on
sequences:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>class OneBased:
    """A proxy object that allows sequences to use
    1-based indexing."""

    def __init__(self, seq):
        self.seq = seq

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        assert key &gt;= 1
        return self.seq[key - 1]

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.seq)


x = OneBased("hello")
x[1]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>'h'
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>x[5]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>'o'
</code></pre>
<p>The class <code>OneBased</code> implements the special methods <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__getitem__">__getitem__</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__len__">__len__</a>.</p>
<p>I chose to use <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/oneBasedIndexing.html">1-based indexing</a> because it makes it easier to directly copy
the algorithm from the paper, which reduces the chances of me making a mistake.
Converting from <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/oneBasedIndexing.html">1-based indexing</a> to <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/zeroBasedIndexing.html">0-based indexing</a> is
straightforward, but tedious. E.g. here is some pseudocode from the paper:</p>
<pre><code>jâ‰”1; tâ‰”0; next[1]â‰”0
while j&lt;m do
    begin
        while t&gt;0 and pattern[j]â‰&nbsp;pattern[t]
	    do tâ‰”next[t];
	tâ‰”t+1; jâ‰”j+1
	if pattern[j]=pattern[t]
	then next[j]â‰”next[t]
	else next[j]â‰”t;
    end;

...

jâ‰”kâ‰”1;
while jâ‰¦m and kâ‰¦n do
    begin
        while j&gt;0 and text[k]â‰&nbsp;pattern[j]
	    do jâ‰”next[j];
	kâ‰”k+1; jâ‰”j+1
    end;
</code></pre>
<p>If I use <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/oneBasedIndexing.html">1-based indexing</a> here's the corresponding Python code:</p>
<pre><code>j = 1; t = 0; next = {1:0}
while j &lt; m:
    while t &gt; 0 and pattern[j] != pattern[t]:
        t = next[t]
    t = t + 1; j = j + 1
    if pattern[j] == pattern[t]:
        next[j] = next[t]
    else:
        next[j] = t

...

j = k = 1
while j &lt;= m and k &lt;= n:
    while j &gt; 0 and text[k] != pattern[j]:
        j = next[j]
    k = k + 1; j = j + 1
</code></pre>
<p>But, if I use <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/zeroBasedIndexing.html">0-based indexing</a> here's the corresponding Python code:</p>
<pre><code>j = 0; t = -1; next = {0: -1}
while j &lt; m - 1:
    while t &gt; -1 and pattern[j] != pattern[t]:
        t = next[t]
    t = t + 1; j = j + 1
    if pattern[j] == pattern[t]:
        next[j] = next[t]
    else:
        next[j] = t

...

j = k = 0
while j &lt;= m - 1 and k &lt;= n - 1:
    while j &gt; -1 and text[k] != pattern[j]:
        j = next[j]
    k = k + 1; j = j + 1
</code></pre>
<p>The high-level structure is the same, but I made plenty of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error">off-by-one
errors</a> while I was creating the <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/zeroBasedIndexing.html">0-based indexing</a>
example.</p>
<p>Here's my Python implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm">Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm</a>:</p>
<pre><code>def knuth_morris_pratt(*, text, pattern):
    """Run the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm on
    sequences `text` and `pattern`. The
    sequences must use 1-based indexing, not
    0-based indexing. Returns the 1-based index
    of the first match, or returns None if no
    match is found.
    
    text -- OneBased. E.g. OneBased("hello") or
        OneBased([1, 2, 3, 4]).
    pattern - OneBased. E.g. OneBased("ll") or
        OneBased([2, 3]).

    """
    n, m = len(text), len(pattern)
    
    # Compute the "next" table.
    
    j = 1; t = 0; next = {1:0}
    while j &lt; m:
        while t &gt; 0 and pattern[j] != pattern[t]:
            t = next[t]
        t = t + 1; j = j + 1
        if pattern[j] == pattern[t]:
            next[j] = next[t]
        else:
            next[j] = t

        k = k + 1; j = j + 1
    
    if j &gt; m:
        return k - m
</code></pre>
<p>To use this to solve the "String Search" problem, all I need to do is account
for the <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/oneBasedIndexing.html">1-based indexing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>def string_search_fast(*, text, pattern):
    """Find the first index of `pattern` in `text`

    pattern -- Sequence. E.g. "ll" or [2, 3].
    """
    index = knuth_morris_pratt(
        text=OneBased(text), pattern=OneBased(pattern)
    )
    if index is not None:
        return index - 1


string_search_fast(text="hello world", pattern="o")

<p>In this week's post, you learned how to create a brute force solution for the
"String Search" problem. You also learned how to implement the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm">Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm</a> to create a more efficient solution. One of
the key ideas behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm">Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm</a> is to precompute a
data structure (e.g. the <code>next</code> table) to improve the overall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time
complexity</a> of the algorithm. You also learned how to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern">proxy
object</a>, <code>OneBased</code>, that allowed you to use <a href="https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/oneBasedIndexing.html">1-based indexing</a> with
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy">Sequence objects</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-searching_algorithm">String-searching algorithms</a> have applications in a
wide variety of fields, such as digital forensics and spam detection. In a
digital forensics project, you may want to search a computer's memory for the
URLs, so you search for the substrings "http:" and "https:". In a spam
detection project, you may want to search emails for key phrases that indicate
spam, such as "Be your own boss", "Extra income", "No purchase necessary", or
"Meet singles".</p>
<p>My challenge to you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modify the Python functions <code>knuth_morris_pratt</code> and <code>string_search_fast</code> to
return a list of all matching indices. E.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>string_search_fast_all(text="hello world", pattern="o")
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>[4, 7]
</code></pre>
<p>It's your decision to count overlapping matches or not.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Over the years I have observed that many engineers tend to attribute much of the success or failure of a company to the technical choices made. I know I’m often guilty of this too. And while it is often justified, I would argue that for the vast majority of startups out there, the choice of programming language, framework, or even database doesn’t matter that much. This seems especially true during the early stages.</p><h2>Through the engineering lens</h2><p>This perception is understandable, we as engineers tend to look at the world from a specific lens, and are often biased by what we know best. Our daily activities may include things such as debugging CI pipelines, implementing new features, pairing with colleagues, or migrating the always present legacy codebase. The environment that surrounds us makes it easy to believe that it all boils down to those things that we see and understand. It’s an illusion that makes us feel like we’re fully in control of what makes or breaks the product.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, it can be a huge advantage for many companies to make their product 3x more efficient than competitors, or to have elegant, composable code. But you might be focusing on the wrong problems if nobody cares about the product you’re actually building, and sooner or later your business will hit this wall.</p><p>I’m not saying that software doesn’t matter. A solid foundation for your startup goes a long way. If investing in this allows you to build better features faster than your competitors, more power to you. But finding the right balance is highly dependent on what you’re trying to solve and the resources you have at hand. There’s no right or wrong way to do it, and as usual, it mainly comes down to tradeoffs.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/lenses.png" alt="Different lenses"></p><h2>Boring makes me happy</h2><p>I believe aiming for a healthy balance of risk vs reward when it comes to your technical choices is something to strive for. In particular, if it decreases the chances you get stuck on the wrong problems down the road.</p><p>This is why I have come to appreciate ideas such as <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">Choose Boring Technology</a>. This is often interpreted as “picking old technologies over newer ones”, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that. For me, this comes down to using proven technologies in which the ways it can fail are mostly known, but occasionally experimenting with different, possibly newer tools that might suit me better.</p><p>Maybe you want to gain more experience by using the latest framework or programming language, or you just want to have some fun. You do what makes you happy. But if you’re trying to make a decision to increase the odds that your product or business will succeed, it’s worth stepping back and considering your options.</p><p>For me, mainly choosing software that has been around for longer is not about it being boring or older, it’s about the fact that the ways in which it fails are better known. There are fewer unknowns for you to deal with and this maximizes your chances of actually shipping the project.</p><p>For example the other day I had an issue with my Django app, and a quick search led me to tens of answers to this problem in various forums and websites. It took me at most 10 minutes to get back on track and that was the end of this issue.</p><p>I experienced the exact opposite a few years ago with a popular, but not so battle-tested Scala library my team had been using for a while. We were probably among the first to encounter the issues we were facing, and it seemed nobody had walked down this path before. Maybe it sounds like a fun challenge or a great chance to contribute back to OSS (which I’m happy to), but once you solve it, do your customers really care about it? How many days, weeks, or even months are you willing to invest in such issues? In my case, I’d rather use that time to ship new features or improve the existing ones.</p><h2>Proven tech vs new tools</h2><p>I try to follow an 80/20 distribution when it comes to my choice of tools. This means my stack consists of about 80% software I already know well, but I do allow myself 20% of the stack to explore tech I have less experience with. The exact ratio is not what’s important here, it’s more the fact that you should lean towards using proven technologies.</p><p>This also resonates with how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">Multi-armed bandits</a> work. You try to maximize your expected gain by taking advantage of what worked well in the past, while sometimes exploring new things to avoid missing out on a possible goldmine.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/bandits.png" alt="Balance new vs proven"></p><p>A more recent example of mine is <a href="https://panelbear.com/">Panelbear</a>, it started as an embarrassingly simple Django app with no charts, all metrics were rendered on a plain HTML table, and all data was stored on a SQLite database. Took literally a weekend to get it up and running including manually deploying to a $5/mo VM. Low risk and high reward for my needs at the time.</p><p>Fast forward and as I added more features and began handling more page views for various websites, I started to notice that the codebase could use some refactoring. It also became increasingly repetitive to do things like deploying to new instances, issuing SSL certs, and keeping the DNS records up to date in case the IP address of my instances changed.</p><p>As a second iteration, I upgraded to a docker-compose setup plus lots of glue code. But soon enough I found myself reinventing what other tools already do well. There are multiple ways to solve each of these pain points, but in my case, it came down to using a tool I am very familiar with from my full-time job: Kubernetes.</p><p>Yes, I am well aware Kubernetes is an absolute overkill for a lot of projects out there, and I could have gotten away with a more traditional solution. But it allowed me to simplify the operational aspects tremendously, and I feel comfortable working with it after having the pleasure of putting down multiple production fires for my employer over the years. That’s why I wouldn’t bindly recommend it to everyone. Do what you know best.
As an added benefit, it also made it trivial when I migrated from DigitalOcean to Linode, and most recently to AWS (each migration took mostly an evening of changing my Terraform files and deploying them - I’m being serious). But that’s for another post.</p><p>Another case in which it paid off once again, was when I wanted to experiment with using Clickhouse for data ingestion and the aggregation queries. It took me less than 10 minutes to write a basic deployment manifest and have it up and running. This included automated SSL certs, in-cluster service discovery, and unified logging/monitoring out of the box. It was a huge win since it allowed me to try things out faster than before.</p><p>Even better, I can deploy any container and operate it the exact same way as I deploy anything else on my cluster. Need more volume storage with zero downtime? It’s a simple manifest change, commit and deploy. Same thing when I needed Redis for caching, I was up and running in minutes, without increasing my costs or adding operational complexity.</p><h2>Focus on shipping</h2><p>My point is, I moved into these technologies as the pain with the previous solution was higher than dealing with the new tech. But more importantly, it helped me ship features even faster to my customers while reducing the operational overhead for me.</p><p>If I had started with the more advanced setup from day one, I might have lost all motivation before I would have had the first version of Panelbear. The key is to solve the problems that are getting between you and your goals, not potential issues you believe one day will be yours.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed this blog post. I plan on writing more about Panelbear’s tech stack, and lessons learned along the way. So stay tuned!</p></div></div></div>]]>

                <p>The software development world is crowded with different practices, metrics, methodologies, tools and techniques.  But what unites them all?</p>

<p>The Risk-First perspective is that all of these practices and methodologies have at their heart the job of managing different <em>software development risks</em>.  Risk isn’t something that just appears in a report, it actually drives everything we do.</p>

<p>Risk-First is split into three main parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://riskfirst.org/thinking/Start">Part 1: Thinking Risk-First</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://riskfirst.org/risks/Start">Part 2: The Risk Landscape</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://riskfirst.org/practices/Start">Part 3: Practices</a>  <em>(Under Construction)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>However, if you want a brief overview of what this is all about, the articles in this section give you a short taster.</p>

<p>In particular, if you’re after a very high-level summary, please check out the <a href="https://riskfirst.org/overview/Quick-Summary">Quick Summary</a> article below.</p>

<p>The ongoing debate over copyright in the digital age is clouded by so many layers of new-age malarkey and overblown, political banner-waving that it’s easy to lose sight of the behavioral realities behind all the self-serving theories of bloggers, legal scholars, corporate interests, and futurists. Take a very common activity like watching movies online via torrents or other sites that enable free viewing (aka piracy).&nbsp; My kids’ generation, growing up around this behavior as a norm, will hear words to describe this kind of movie viewing as contrarily <i>theft</i> or <i>sharing</i>.&nbsp; What are they to make of it?&nbsp; Certainly, I’ve taught them to share and not to steal.&nbsp; For the sake of their cultural and psychological growth, however, I’d suggest for the purposes of discussion, that this kind of media overconsumption is, if nothing else, dumb.</p>
<p>For context, we need to admit that the majority of unlicensed, online movie viewing is done by young, middle-class, generally privileged Americans, who are watching mainstream, Hollywood-produced fare. Search for top movies viewed through torrent sites, for example, and you’ll find that the lists will comprise tentpole films produced by the big studios who represent the part of the industry most vilified for efforts to mitigate piracy. If that hypocrisy is not enough to raise your brows, though, the very nature of these films is then used as a justification for the pirate-enabled viewing in itself. We typically hear some combination of the following:&nbsp; “So much of the mainstream stuff is junk that it doesn’t deserve to be paid for.&nbsp; These films already make millions. I would never pay to see it anyway, so it’s not like they’re losing a sale.”&nbsp; If my own kids presented me with these rationales, we’d have a serious talk because this is corrupt thinking no matter what the law, the technologists, or the economic theories say.</p>
<p>Consolidate these oft-repeated positions into the declarative, first person, and the stupid shines through a little clearer:&nbsp; “I’m going to spend hours of my life watching movies I probably won’t like, but because I expect not to like them, I’m not going to pay for them.”&nbsp; And as a kicker, “I am going to help put money in the pockets of the people who stole the movies in the first place.”&nbsp; Bloggers like Mike Masnick will try to argue the new and bizarre economics of free media; and scholars like Mr. Lessig will argue that there is something intellectually or culturally constraining about “permission culture.” Then, these purely academic theories trickle down to the ears of my kids and their contemporaries, who translate it all into the aforementioned rationale. But as a parent living in the real world, what I’ve just heard my kids say is that they’re shoplifting cartons of potato chips at the corner store, which doesn’t matter because chips aren’t real food anyway.&nbsp; Hence, my kids now have both a moral <i>and</i> a health problem.</p>
<p>With regard to movies (or any creative media) the first thing I’d tell my own children is that their lives are not at all enriched by watching scores of films they probably won’t like. To the contrary, when they make time for media consumption, they should develop a critical sense for what kind films might be worth the investment of their time and attention. What matters is not the fifty films they’ll forget within hours of viewing, but the five this year that will change their lives in some way. It doesn’t matter that the sale for the producers of the tentpole is zero whether my kid watches it through a torrent or doesn’t see it at all; what matters is making the decision that if it isn’t worth paying for, it probably isn’t worth the equally valuable resources of time and attention. In short, it’s not only okay to let some things go, you don’t really have a choice.</p>
<p>It is a valuable component of cultural experience for the individual to pay attention to what kind of art or media affects him and to seek out that which fulfills these emotional connections.&nbsp; Nobody can watch, read, listen to, or experience everything; so there is not only nothing wrong with scarcity, it is an absolute necessity for an individual’s cultural development. Those who promote the idea of abundance as some sort of digital-age renaissance are not really contributing to a more enlightened, more cultured generation so much as they’re breeding a new crop of agitated media junkies. Remove for a moment the questions of legality or creators’ rights, and we’re still living in an era of media obesity and don’t yet know what this means for the future of culture in general.</p>
<p>Many of the filmmakers whose works have touched my life and the lives of my contemporaries were dead before the Internet was even built.&nbsp; We somehow managed to experience their films without this technology and without in any way contributing to IP theft. Through pre-Internet experiences, I have seen motion pictures that I doubt my own children will ever know existed; and still, in over thirty years of loving this medium, I know that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of films that I will not see in my lifetime. This is true for my children as well, despite the overblown promise of technology to put “the world at their fingertips.” So, what I’ll tell my kids is simply this:&nbsp; “You can’t consume it all, you shouldn’t try, and whatever is worth your time is also worth your money.”</p>

This utility is not meant for normal users or even sysadmins. It provides
  unabstracted access to capabilities which are normally handled for the user
  automatically when changing the security policy through GUIs such as Startup
  Disk in macOS Recovery. It is possible to make your system security much
  weaker and therefore easier to compromise using this tool. This tool is not to
  be used in production environments. It is possible to render your system
  unbootable with this tool. It should only be used to understand how the
  security of Apple Silicon Macs works. Use at your own risk!
<p><code>bputil</code> performs actions by calling the
    BootPolicy library. This modifies the security configuration of the system,
    which is stored in a file called the LocalPolicy. This file is digitally
    signed by the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP). The private key which is used
    to sign the LocalPolicy is protected by a separate key which is only
    accessible when a user has put in their password as part of a successful
    authentication. This is why this tool must either have a username and
    password specified on the command line, or via the interactive prompt.</p>
<p>By design, the SEP application which is responsible for making
    changes to the LocalPolicy will inspect the boot state of the main
    Application Processor (AP). It will only allow the below
    security-downgrading operations if it detects that the AP is in the intended
    boot state. When System Integrity Protection (SIP) was first introduced to
    Macs, it was decided that requiring a reboot to macOS Recovery would provide
    intentional friction which would make it harder for malicious software to
    downgrade the system. That precedent is extended here to detect the special
    boot to macOS Recovery via holding the power key at boot time. We refer to
    this as One True Recovery (1TR), and most of the below downgrade options
    will only work when booted into 1TR, not when called from normal macOS. This
    helps ensure that only a physically-present user, not malicious software
    running in macOS, can permanently downgrade the security settings. The below
    CLI options specify what boot environments a downgrade can be performed
    from.</p>
<p>The SEP-signed LocalPolicy is evaluated at boot time by iBoot.
    Configurations within the LocalPolicy change iBoot's behavior, such as
    whether it will require that all boot objects must be signed with metadata
    specific to the particular machine (a "personalized" signature,
    which is the default, and the always-required policy on iOS), or whether it
    will accept "global" signatures which are valid for all units of a
    specific hardware model. The LocalPolicy can also influence other boot or OS
    security behavior as described in the below options.</p>
<dl>

    <p>If this is specified the above username option is required

    <p>If this is not specified, an interactive prompt will request

  <dd>
    <p>Specify the APFS Volume Group UUID of the OS intended to have
        its policy changed. If no option is specified, the default value will be
        set to the APFS Volume Group UUID of the running OS. The Volume Group
        UUID for a given OS can be found with 'diskutil apfs
      listVolumeGroups'.</p>

  <dt><a href="#d,"><code id="d,">-d,</code></a>
    <code>--display-policy</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Display the detailed contents of the LocalPolicy. This will
        show specific 4-character "tags" in the Apple Image4 data
        structure which is used to capture the customer-specified security
        policy. More details about the displayed entries are available in the
        "Apple Platform Security" website documentation. If the system
        has multiple bootable volumes, an interactive prompt will ask to select
        a volume to display the policy for.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#f,"><code id="f,">-f,</code></a>
    <code>--full-security</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Changes security mode to Full Security. This option is
        mutually exclusive with all options below which cause security
        downgrades. Full Security is effectively a LocalPolicy which is in its
        default state, lacking all available security downgrades. Full Security
        also performs an online check at software install and upgrade time to
        ensure that only the latest version of software can be installed. This
        prevents accidentally installing old software which has known
        vulnerabilities in it. If the security is downgraded away from Full
        Security, and then re-upgraded to Full Security, the online check will
        be performed, and if the software is no longer the latest available, it
        will not be possible to set it to Full Security again. Because online
        checks are only performed at software installation, upgrade, and Full
        Security policy setting time, it is possible for an OS to report that it
        is Full Security despite not being the latest software version. Full
        Security only indicates the state as of the latest install or
      upgrade.</p>
    <p>Boot environment requirements: None.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#g,"><code id="g,">-g,</code></a>
    <code>--reduced-security</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Selecting this option will make your system easier to
        compromise!</p>
    <p>This changes the security mode to Reduced Security. Reduced
        Security will use the "global" digital signature for macOS, in
        order to allow running software which is not the latest version. Thus
        anything other than the latest software therefore may have security
        vulnerabilities. At a high level, Reduced Security does not necessarily
        require the latest software, but it does still require all software be
        digitally signed by Apple or 3rd party software developers. Passing this
        option will explicitly recreate the LocalPolicy from scratch, (i.e. it
        does not preserve any existing security policy options) and only the
        options specified via this tool will exist in the output local
      policy.</p>
    <p>Boot environment requirements: software-launched macOS
        Recovery or 1TR.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#n,"><code id="n,">-n,</code></a>
    <code>--permissive-security</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Selecting this option will make your system easier to
        compromise!</p>
    <p>This changes the security mode to Permissive Security.
        Permissive Security uses the same "global" digital signature
        for macOS as the above Reduced Security option, in order to allow
        running software which is not the latest version. Thus anything other
        than the latest software therefore may have security vulnerabilities. At
        a high level, Permissive Security allows configuration options to be set
        to not require all software to be digitally signed. This can allow users
        who are not part of the Apple Developer program to still be able to
        introduce their own software into their system. Additionally, especially
        dangerous security downgrades may be restricted to Permissive Security,
        and only available via CLI tools for power users rather than GUIs.
        Passing this option will explicitly recreate the LocalPolicy from
        scratch, (i.e. it does not preserve any existing security policy
        options) and only the options specified via this tool will exist in the
        output local policy.</p>
    <p>Boot environment requirements: 1TR.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#k,"><code id="k,">-k,</code></a>
    <code>--enable-kexts.</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Because this option automatically downgrades to Reduced
        Security mode if not already true, selecting this option will make your
        system easier to compromise!</p>
    <p>The AuxilaryKernelCache is a SEP-signed boot object which can
        be verified and loaded into kernel memory before that memory is
        restricted to being non-writable by a "Configurable Text Read-only
        Region" (CTRR) hardware register. Introducing 3rd party kernel
        extensions can introduce architectural or implementation flaws into the
        kernel, which can lead to system compromise. In order to achieve
        iOS-like security properties, 3rd party kexts must be denied by default,
        and only loadable if the customer consciously opts in to lowering their
        security from 1TR.</p>
    <p>Boot environment requirements: 1TR.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#c,"><code id="c,">-c,</code></a>
    <code>--disable-kernel-ctrr</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Because this option automatically downgrades to Reduced
        Security mode if not already true, selecting this option will make your
        system easier to compromise!</p>
    <p>This disables the enforcement of the "Configurable Text
        Read-only Region" (CTRR) hardware register that marks kernel memory
        as non-writable. This is sometimes required for performing actions such
        as using dynamic DTrace code hooks to profile kernel behavior or perform
        3rd party kernel extension debugging. However, the lack of CTRR
        enforcement makes it much easier for an attacker to modify the kernel
        with exploits.</p>
    <p>Boot environment requirements: 1TR.</p>

        Security mode if not already true, selecting this option will make your

<p>The basic installation format for users who install packages via <code>pip</code> is
the wheel format. Wheel names are composed of four parts: a
package-name-and-version tag (which can be further broken down), a Python tag,
an ABI tag, and a platform tag. More information on the tags can be found in
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425">PEP 425</a>.  So a package like NumPy
will be available on PyPI as <code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl</code> for 64-bit
windows and <code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl</code> for macOS. Note
that only the plaform tag <code>win_amd64</code> or <code>macosx_10_9_x86_64</code> differs. </p>
<p>But what about Linux? There is no single, vendor controlled, "Linux platform"
e.g., Ubuntu, RedHat, Fedora, Debian, FreeBSD all package software at slightly
different versions. What most Linux distributions do have in common is the
glibc runtime library, and a smattering of various additional system libraries.
So it is possible to define a least common denominator (LCD) of software
expected to be on a Linux platform (exceptions apply, e.g. non-glibc
distributions).</p>
<p>The decision to converge on a LCD common platform gave birth to the
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/">manylinux1</a> standard. Going back
to our example, numpy is available as
<code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl</code>.</p>
<p>The first manylinux standard, manylinux1, was based on CentOS5 which has <a href="https://endoflife.software/operating-systems/linux/centos">been
obsolete</a> since
March 2017. The subsequent manylinux2010 standard is based on CentOS6, which
will hit end-of-life in December 2020. The manylinux2014 standard still has some
breathing room. Based on CentOS7, it will reach end-of-life in July 2024.</p>
<p>So what is next for <code>manylinux</code>, and what <code>manylinux</code> should users and package
maintainers use?</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h3>If <code>manylinux1</code> is obsolete, why are there still manylinux1 wheels?</h3>
<p>Wheels are typically consumed by Pip via <code>pip install</code>. Manylinux wheels are
used for projects that require compilation, otherwise they would ship
pure Python wheels with the "none" platform tag, meaning they are compatible with
any platform. So say you are a library author and want to make it convenient
for users to install your package. If you ship a manylinux2014 wheel, but the
version of Pip your users have is too old to support manylinux2014 wheels, Pip
will happily download the source package and compile it for them. Havoc ensues:
Windows users typically cannot compile, prerequisites will be missing. Pip has
a <code>--only-binary</code> option to prevent it from downloading source code and
compiling, and a <code>--prefer-binary</code> option to prefer older binary packages over
compiling from source, but neither is on by default.</p>
<p>Pip began supporting manylinux2010 wheels with <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/master/NEWS.rst#190-2019-01-22">version
19.0</a>,
released in Jan 2019. The version of Pip that is officially shipped with Python 3.6, via
the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/ensurepip.html">ensurepip</a> module, is
version 18. Python 3.7 ships pip 20. It is easy enough to upgrade, but to be on
the safe side, and prevent havoc, library authors will ship a manylinux1 wheel
for Python 3.6 support.</p>
<h3>What happens now that Python 3.6 is falling out of favor?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494">Python 3.6 is no longer in active
development</a>. In fact, the scientific
Python community has decided to stop actively supporting Python 3.6 <a href="https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html#support-table">from
July 2020</a>.
So I would expect to see projects begin to drop the older manylinux1 format,
and drop support for Python 3.6 sooner rather than later, meaning that
<strong><code>manylinux2014</code> may soon become the only option</strong> for new versions.</p>
<h3>What about Conda packages?</h3>
<p>Conda does not use the same kind of wheel format provided by PyPI and Pip. Conda's
build system is internally consistent, and Conda packagers build a binary
package for each supported OS, thus they are not bound to the manylinux
designation. Conda does not have a declared policy around deprecating Python
3.6 yet. Conda does support <code>pip</code> (but try not to mix <code>conda</code> and <code>pip</code>
usage!), and the Pip provided should be version 20 or later. If needed,
<code>conda upgrade pip</code> should get you a modern version, so here too
<code>manylinux2014</code> will soon become the only option.</p>
<h3>What comes after manylinux2014?</h3>
<p>The glibc used in manylinux2014 is defined as the one used by CentOS7. This OS
was released in June 2014. This manylinux standard, for the first time,
declared support for non-x86 hardware systems like ARM64 (aarch64), Power
(ppc64) and S390X.  However the ARM platform has grown greatly since 2014, and
glibc has moved from version 2.17 to 2.31, fixing many bugs. Since the real
driver for platform compatibility is glibc, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0600/">PEP
600</a> defined a "perennial manylinux
spec" that is based on the glibc version number. A lot of work has <a href="https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/542">already
taken place</a> to support the next
version. Now we need to take the dive: decide what the base OS for the next
manylinux tag will be, roll out a Docker image and tooling around it, and
convince library packaging teams to adopt it. This is needed to allow libraries
like NumPy to confidently use the glibc routines fixed after 2014. For
instance, <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15763">this issue</a> is
preventing NumPy from properly supporting <code>np.float128</code> on Power and S390X.</p>
<h3>What about non-x86 machines and Linux?</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, starting with manylinux2014 <code>pip</code> and <code>wheel</code> supports
non-x86 architectures like ARM64. Many packages are just now starting to roll
out support for these architectures, as the CI systems that support open source
projects (like TravisCI) have only recently made those platforms available.
It might be easier for users to adopt Conda and the <code>conda-forge</code> channel
since conda-forge has support for non-x86 architectures today.</p>
<h3>OK, so what is the bottom line?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use pip v20 or later to make it easier on libarary packagers: modern pip
  versions will take the latest manylinux package they can support and will be
  forward-compatible with the PEP 600 perennial manylinux standard.</li>
<li>Manylinux1 and Python 3.6 are going away. Update your systems.</li>
<li>For people looking to move PEP 600 forward, the next step is to dive into the
  <a href="https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel">auditwheel</a> repo to define and support
  the next manylinux version. </li>

<h3>raidz vs draid<a href="#raidz-vs-draid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ZFS users are most likely very familiar with raidz already, so a
comparison with draid would help. The illustrations below are
simplified, but sufficient for the purpose of a comparison. For example,
31 drives can be configured as a zpool of 6 raidz1 vdevs and a hot
spare: <img alt="raidz1" src="https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/_images/draid_raidz.png"></p>
<p>As shown above, if drive 0 fails and is replaced by the hot spare, only
5 out of the 30 surviving drives will work to resilver: drives 1-4 read,
and drive 30 writes.</p>
<p>The same 30 drives can be configured as 1 draid1 vdev of the same level
of redundancy (i.e. single parity, 1/4 parity ratio) and single spare
capacity: <img alt="draid1" src="https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/_images/draid_draid.png"></p>
<p>The drives are shuffled in a way that, after drive 0 fails, all 30
surviving drives will work together to restore the lost data/parity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All 30 drives read, because unlike the raidz1 configuration shown
above, in the draid1 configuration the neighbor drives of the failed
drive 0 (i.e. drives in a same data+parity group) are not fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>All 30 drives write, because now there is no dedicated spare drive.
Instead, spare blocks come from all drives.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Normal application IO: draid and raidz are very similar. There’s a
slight advantage in draid, since there’s no dedicated spare drive
which is idle when not in use.</p></li>
<li><p>Restore lost data/parity: for raidz, not all surviving drives will
work to rebuild, and in addition it’s bounded by the write throughput
of a single replacement drive. For draid, the rebuild speed will
scale with the total number of drives because all surviving drives
will work to rebuild.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The dRAID vdev must shuffle its child drives in a way that regardless of
which drive has failed, the rebuild IO (both read and write) will
distribute evenly among all surviving drives, so the rebuild speed will
scale. The exact mechanism used by the dRAID vdev driver is beyond the
scope of this simple introduction here. If interested, please refer to
the recommended readings in the next section.</p>

<h3>Recommended Reading<a href="#recommended-reading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Parity declustering (the fancy term for shuffling drives) has been an
active research topic, and many papers have been published in this area.
The <a href="http://www.cse.scu.edu/~tschwarz/TechReports/hpca.pdf">Permutation Development Data
Layout</a> is a
good paper to begin. The dRAID vdev driver uses a shuffling algorithm
loosely based on the mechanism described in this paper.</p>

<h2>Using dRAID<a href="#using-draid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First get the code <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/10102">here</a>,
build zfs with <em>configure –enable-debug</em>, and install. Then load the
zfs kernel module with the following options which help dRAID rebuild
performance.</p>

<h3>Create a dRAID vdev<a href="#create-a-draid-vdev" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Similar to raidz vdev a dRAID vdev can be created using the
<code><span>zpool</span> <span>create</span></code> command:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span># zpool create &lt;pool&gt; draid[1,2,3][ &lt;vdevs...&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Unlike raidz, additional options may be provided as part of the
<code><span>draid</span></code> vdev type to specify an exact dRAID layout. When unspecific
reasonable defaults will be chosen.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span># zpool create &lt;pool&gt; draid[1,2,3][:&lt;groups&gt;g][:&lt;spares&gt;s][:&lt;data&gt;d][:&lt;iterations&gt;] &lt;vdevs...&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>groups - Number of redundancy groups (default: 1 group per 12 vdevs)</p></li>
<li><p>spares - Number of distributed hot spares (default: 1)</p></li>
<li><p>data - Number of data devices per group (default: determined by
number of groups)</p></li>
<li><p>iterations - Number of iterations to perform generating a valid dRAID
mapping (default 3).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The default values are not set in stone and may change.</p></li>
<li><p>For the majority of common configurations we intend to provide
pre-computed balanced dRAID mappings.</p></li>
<li><p>When <em>data</em> is specified then: (draid_children - spares) % (parity +
data) == 0, otherwise the pool creation will fail.</p></li>

<p>There are two logical hot spare vdevs shown above at the bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The names begin with a <code><span>s&lt;id&gt;-</span></code> followed by the name of the parent
dRAID vdev.</p></li>
<li><p>These hot spares are logical, made from reserved blocks on all the 53
child drives of the dRAID vdev.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike traditional hot spares, the distributed spare can only replace
a drive in its parent dRAID vdev.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The dRAID vdev behaves just like a raidz vdev of the same parity level.
You can do IO to/from it, scrub it, fail a child drive and it’d operate
in degraded mode.</p>

<h3>Rebuild to distributed spare<a href="#rebuild-to-distributed-spare" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When there’s a failed/offline child drive, the dRAID vdev supports a
completely new mechanism to reconstruct lost data/parity, in addition to
the resilver. First of all, resilver is still supported - if a failed
drive is replaced by another physical drive, the resilver process is
used to reconstruct lost data/parity to the new replacement drive, which
is the same as a resilver in a raidz vdev.</p>
<p>But if a child drive is replaced with a distributed spare, a new process
called rebuild is used instead of resilver:</p>

<p>The scan status line of the <em>zpool status</em> output now says <em>“rebuilt”</em>
instead of <em>“resilvered”</em>, because the lost data/parity was rebuilt to
the distributed spare by a brand new process called <em>“rebuild”</em>. The
main differences from <em>resilver</em> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The rebuild process does not scan the whole block pointer tree.
Instead, it only scans the spacemap objects.</p></li>
<li><p>The IO from rebuild is sequential, because it rebuilds metaslabs one
by one in sequential order.</p></li>
<li><p>The rebuild process is not limited to block boundaries. For example,
if 10 64K blocks are allocated contiguously, then rebuild will fix
640K at one time. So rebuild process will generate larger IOs than
resilver.</p></li>
<li><p>For all the benefits above, there is one price to pay. The rebuild
process cannot verify block checksums, since it doesn’t have block
pointers.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, the rebuild process requires support from on-disk format,
and <strong>only</strong> works on draid and mirror vdevs. Resilver, on the other
hand, works with any vdev (including draid).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although rebuild process creates larger IOs, the drives will not
necessarily see large IO requests. The block device queue parameter
<em>/sys/block/</em>/queue/max_sectors_kb* must be tuned accordingly. However,
since the rebuild IO is already sequential, the benefits of enabling
larger IO requests might be marginal.</p>
<p>At this point, redundancy has been fully restored without adding any new
drive to the pool. If another drive is offlined, the pool is still able
to do IO:</p>

				<p><h2>Small, portable laser pointers could be used to guide lightning strikes, with a study suggesting the technology may prevent bolts from sparking wildfires, a researcher told AFP Thursday.</h2></p>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div>
				
				
				<div><p>A team of international scientists have shown storm clouds could be “short-circuited” by using a hollow laser — like a pipe of light — to deliver particles into the clouds and draw lightning strikes, research co-author Professor Andrey Miroshnichenko from the University of New South Wales in Canberra told AFP.</p>
<p>In lab tests, the team — which also included scientists from the Australian National University (ANU) — successfully used a laser tractor beam to direct the path of an electrical discharge to specific targets, Miroshnichenko said.</p>
<p>In the past, high-powered lasers were needed to achieve similar results, making the technique dangerous, costly and inaccurate.<span>&nbsp;</span></p></div>

				<p><iframe title="Bushfires in Australia: What ignited the deadly crisis" width="1080" height="608" src="about:blank" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-l28KQ8dJDM?feature=oembed" data-no-lazy="1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
				
			</div><div>
				
				
				<div><p>But the new research suggested that small, hand-held lasers could be used in the field within the next decade, he said.</p>
<p>“It turns out that to deliver particles, you do not need high-intensity lasers, even low intensity like your laser pointer will be already enough,” Miroshnichenko said.</p>
<p>Using a tractor beam with a hollow centre, micro-particles in the air could be heated up and delivered to a specific point and trigger an electrical discharge.</p></div>

				<p>The electrical discharge induced by a heated microparticle.</p>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div>
				
				
				<div><p>Although it is yet to be tested outside a lab, the technique could potentially be used to control dry lightning strikes, infamous for sparking large blazes including several major <a href="https://www.breakingasia.com/trending/social-media-fakes-australia-bushfire-disinformation/">bushfires in Australia</a> and the western US in the past year, Miroshnichenko added.</p>
<p>“We can imagine a future where this technology may induce electrical discharge from passing lightning, helping to guide it to safe targets and reduce the risk of <a href="https://www.breakingasia.com/trending/makeshift-hospital-saving-dozens-of-koalas-injured-in-bushfires/">catastrophic fires</a>,” co-researcher Vladlen Shvedov, from the ANU Research School of Physics, said.</p>
<p>The research, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19183-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature Communications last month</a>, also involved Texas A&amp;M University in Qatar and the University of California in Los Angeles.<span>&nbsp;</span></p></div>

Let's take a walk through the core of it all: data structures. What are they and why are they so important? A 'hello' to a reader that might have missed our talk on <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/memory-management-deep-and-shallow-copying">Memory management</a>, where we delved into what happens to our code in variable assignment. Do take a look, even if it's a refresher you're looking for.</p>
<p>Alright then. What is a data structure?</p>
<p>It's a way of organizing data. Say we have a couple of friends coming over for our fortnightly game night( ah...the things on our to-do list). We need snacks, a number of people expected to be there, a list of activities to partake. I can go on and on. So how do we organize this in say a program we want to implement to fix the hustle of planning? How do we store the things to be done or the items to be purchased? It's all data in the end. We need structure. We need data structures. The how of getting our data and manipulating it from these structures are our algorithms.</p>
<p>Right back to our game, who will do what? </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604914703881/MPT41cxif.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="adeolu-eletu-DqWEAOHsAvc-unsplash.jpg"></p>
<p>How do we decide what comes before what in terms of structuring this data? Does our simple program make it easy to retrieve this information? Is it fast enough? What about efficiency?</p>
<p>Whatever kind of application we are talking about, we need a data structure(s) that will allow traversing, insertion, searching, deletion( in case the last casserole was outright nasty), sorting, or merging of bits of data. Call it CRUD with extra steps.</p>
<p>As from the Memory management article, we got data, then collections of data. It's all data. While memory allocation might not be something we think of with javascript of even Python, it holds water when doing <strong>C</strong> or <strong>C++</strong>. So keep this in mind. </p>
<p>Broadly speaking, we group data structures, much like data types in itself, as:</p>
<p>a) Primitive</p>
<p>b) Non-primitive</p>
<p>Primitive structures would hold primitive data types; that is the <em>chars</em>, the <em>int</em> the <em>float</em>. Basically, data types that hold a single value.</p>
<p>Non-primitive structures, on the other hand, break down to <strong>linear</strong> (which holds data in a sequence) and of course <strong>non-linear</strong>. Hold your breath in case you lost it a moment there. We'll go into the details soon enough.</p>
<p>As of now, you have a general idea, a scope if you may, of what structures involve.
They are quite a number.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next couple of weeks, we'll be covering some of these structures. Unraveling them to bits and pieces. Finding what makes them tick as so and getting why many a time, developers new and old alike, have challenges addressing them. Stick a while, I cannot wait for our next piece in this!</p>

  <p><time>10 Nov 2020</time>
  </p>
  <p>Haskell’s type classes and deriving facilities are a killer feature for type safety and extensibility.
Over nearly 30 years they’ve acquired quite a bit of cruft and language extensions.
With <code>DerivingVia</code>, we now have the ability to dramatically simplify the deriving story.</p>

<p>This post outlines a change to the <em>language</em> that would hopefully be adopted with the next version of the language standard.
They get less reasonable and more dramatic as the post goes on.</p>



<p>GHC has a ton of extensions that only serve to unlock additional type classes to the “stock” deriving strategy.
<code>Derive{Functor,Foldable,Traversable,Generic,Lift,etc}</code>.
We can remove all of these extensions by folding them into the <code>stock</code> deriving strategy.</p>



<p><code>DeriveAnyClass</code> is a footgun.
It allows you to write any type class in a <code>deriving</code> clause.
It pastes in an “empty” instance, relying on <code>DefaultSignatures</code> to fill in the values.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- With DeriveAnyClass:</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span>

<span>-- Without:</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>X</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p><code>DefaultSignatures</code> is used to give a single default implementation of a type class if the underlying type matches a more restrictive constraint.
This is primarily used to provide <code>Generic</code>-based implementations with very little syntax.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span> <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>

<span>-- with DefaultSignatures:</span>

<span>class</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>a</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Value</span>
    <span>default</span> <span>toJSON</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Generic</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>GToJSON</span> <span>(</span><span>Rep</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Value</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>=</span> <span>gtoJSON</span> 

<span>instance</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>X</span>

<span>-- without DefaultSignatures:</span>

<span>class</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>a</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Value</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>X</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>=</span> <span>gtoJSON</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By privileging a single default, it makes any other possible defaults less useful and less discoverable.</p>

<p>The <code>DeriveAnyClass</code> utility is subsumed by <code>DerivingVia</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>newtype</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>a</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>(</span><span>Generic</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>GToJSON</span> <span>(</span><span>Rep</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>(</span><span>Generically</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>(</span><span>Generically</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>gtoJSON</span> <span>a</span>

<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span> 
    <span>deriving</span> <span>stock</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>X</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>This extension is subsumed by <code>DerivingVia</code>, also.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- with GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>Text</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>newtype</span> <span>(</span><span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>)</span>

<span>-- with DerivingVia</span>
<span>newtype</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>Text</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>)</span> <span>via</span> <span>Text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Now that there’s only two strategies, we can get rid of <code>DerivingStrategies</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- Before</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>stock</span> <span>(</span><span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span><span>)</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span><span>)</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>X</span>

<span>-- After</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>

<p>Currently, you must write the complete type in a <code>DerivingVia</code> clause.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span> 
    <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>X</span>

<span>newtype</span> <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>Y</span> <span>Text</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can be cumbersome for a very large type.</p>

<pre><code>newtype App a = App (ExceptT () (StateT () (ReaderT () IO)) a)
    deriving
        ( Functor
        , Applicative
        , Monad
        , MonadReader ()
        , MonadError ()
        , MonadState ()
        )
      via
        ExceptT () (StateT () (ReaderT () IO))
</code></pre>

<p>It’s also annoyingly repetitive, and can lead to errors.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span> 
    <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>Foo</span>

    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>Foo</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A wildcard can be used to indicate either:</p>

<p>a. The underlying type of a <code>newtype</code>, or 
b. The type of the <code>data</code> declaration.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span>

<p>There are two ways to derive things: <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> and attached deriving.
Attached deriving is redundant, but convenient.
<code>StandaloneDeriving</code> is more powerful, but less convenient.
Attached deriving clauses don’t work with <code>GADTs</code>.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>



<p>The problem with the above proposal is that it carries a significant syntax cost.
The keyword <code>deriving</code> is repeated for each instance, the keyword <code>instance</code> is repeated, the <code>via _</code> clause is repeated, and the type name is repeated.
Multiple instances should be derivable with the same context.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>Foo</span> 
    <span>(</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>via</span> 
        <span>(</span><span>Generically</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>ToJSON</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this block, we define the <code>ToJSON</code> and <code>FromJSON</code> instances using the same <code>Generically</code> viatype.
We can still use <code>_</code> to refer to the type, since we know the type we’re deriving for: <code>Foo</code>.
This recovers the syntax convenience of “attached deriving.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>newtype</span> <span>App</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>App</span> <span>...</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>App</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>instance</span> 
            <span>(</span> <span>Functor</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>Applicative</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>Monad</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadReader</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadError</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadState</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This also recovers the convenience of attached deriving.
Let’s look at the main <em>point</em> - GADTs.
Otherwise we could just remove <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> (with the nice benefit/tragedy of banning orphan derived instance).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>Some</span> <span>::</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span>

<span>-- old</span>
<span>deriving</span> 
    <span>instance</span> <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>Some</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>

<span>-- new</span>
<span>deriving</span> <span>Some</span>
    <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>

<span>-- generally,</span>
<span>deriving</span> <span>SomeGadtType</span>
    <span>(</span><span>SomeContextOn</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Eq</span><span>,</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span>
        <span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>_</code> refers to the type name, without any variables applied.
So you need to apply the type variables in the instance head.
That’s a bit annoying, but maybe it’s fine</p>



<p>GHC provides a <code>newtype Stock a = Stock a</code> that hooks in to <code>DerivingVia</code> somehow.
Now we’re down to one deriving strategy.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>X</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>Stock</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>Eq</span><span>,</span> <span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span> <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This “deprivileges” the <code>Stock</code> deriving classes.</p>



<p>OK, so maybe you don’t like getting rid of attached deriving.
Let’s get rid of standalone deriving instead.
We need <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Orphan derived instances (shame on you)</li>
  <li>Specifying a context for GADTs and allow application of type variables</li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>Some</span> <span>::</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span>
    <span>deriving</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span>
            <span>=&gt;</span>
            <span>Show</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>-- generally,</span>
            <span>(</span><span>SomeContext</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>
            <span>=&gt;</span>
            <span>SomeClass</span>
        <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The type variable <code>f</code> is in scope from the <code>data</code> declaration.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/quickdudley/status/1328068260659482624">@quickdudley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nnotm/status/1327998875563683845">@nnotm</a> have correctly pointed out that you also want to be able to define instances of a class at the definition module of a class.
These are perfectly valid instances, and so we must keep <code>StandaloneDeriving</code>.</p>



<p>Alright, post is done.
These ideas are certainly controversial and Bad, but <em>man</em> wouldn’t it be nice to have a simpler story around deriving and type class instances?
The current story is so complex, and I think we can genuinely simplify Haskell-the-language by trimming some fat here.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/am_i_tom/status/1327992136151789568">@i_am_tom</a> posted a reference to the <a href="https://github.com/tysonzero/ghc-proposals/blob/concrete-class-dictionaries/proposals/0000-concrete-class-dictionaries.md">Concrete Class Dictionaries</a> GHC proposal, which subsumes a lot of this.</p>

    <p>It's November 2020. There is no cure for coronavirus. What can we do to prevent the disaster?</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at several simulations of the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>I recommend to visit website from desktop for better experience. Phone may has performance issues.</p>
    <h3>Simulation rules</h3>
    <h4>Assumptions</h4>
    <p>Desease lasts a long time: <strong>2 to 5 weeks.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>30%</strong> of people develop severe symptoms. They are especially vulnerable in a case of a lack of medical care due to overwhelmed medical facilities or weak healthcare systems.</p>
    <p><strong>3%</strong> of people are destined to die. <a href="https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/3000168/pdf/3000168/COVID-19.pdf" target="_blank"> [Source]</a>. It is due to genetic and age reasons. We are assuming we can save the people through vaccination or isolation. Unfortunately as of November 2020 there are no vaccines approved for public use.</p>
    <h4>Possible states of a person</h4>
    <p><span id="guide-healty"></span> - a healthy person.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-ill"></span> - a sick person. They infect other individuals in a small area around them.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-serious"></span> - a seriously sick person with severe symptoms. They die if the medical system is overloaded. We assume the healthcare system  can handle a maximum of 200 patients at a time. Also, severely ill patients move much slower than other people.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-dead"></span> - a dead person.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-immunity"></span> - a recovered perso. We assume they have developed an immunity and can not get reinfected.</p>
    <h4>Modificators</h4>
    <div>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-mask"></span> - a person with mask. <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/10/22/national/science-health/japan-masks-block-coronavirus/" target="_blank">Mask retains up to 50% of exhaled viruses</a>. Also it retains up to 40% of inhaled viruses. If both persons
            wear masks a synergy effect appears.</p>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-screen"></span> - a person with screen. Screen additionally protects against infection.</p>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-both"></span> - a person with screen and mask.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Let's get started</h2>
    <h3>Virus in a small virtual city</h3>
    <p>There is a virtual city with population of 2 000 people. People contact each other as usual. No measures are taken. What could go wrong? Check it.</p>

          <div id="game-simulation-small-city">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-small-city" onclick="startButton('small-city', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-small-city">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-small-city" onclick="resetButton('small-city')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>    
    <p>At the end of simulation you will see that everyone get desease. Results may vary, but I had a disaster my first simulation. I have got up to 1500 sick people at same time and
        600 dead people at the end. These are 75% and 30%, respectively. Each person with severe symptoms died.</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people</h3>
    <p>We have not taken any measures to protect people. Obviously, we can isolate patients in hospitals. Let's be honest, complete isolation is not possible. Patients will still
        be in contact with service personnel, such as doctors, janitors, couriers. So the virus can be passed on, but it happens less likely.</p>
    <p>Let's see how this affects the spread of the virus. <strong>It is a perfect scenario!</strong> Be prepared it takes long time. I recommend to move ahead after 90th day,
        there is nothing interesting in the following days.</p>

          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-small">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-small" onclick="startButton('isolate-small', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-small">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-small" onclick="resetButton('isolate-small')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>    
    <p>Wow! In my simulation there were so few infections that medical care was enough for everyone. Over time, the number of people with immunity increased. At some point, the
        patients were in contact only with people with immunity and could not spread the virus further.</p>
    <p>My result is 70 people who died over 498 days of pandemy. Exactly 3% that are in the genetics of people. So, what is your result?</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people in real life</h3>
    <p>Sadly, not all people observe isolation. And alas, not all sick people know that they are ill. There is no scientific work reporting how many people are asymptomatic. In my
        city one clinic said 25% of its positive tests were from people with no signs of illness. Let's take this number as a basis. <strong>25% of those infected will not show
            symptoms and will move freely around the city.</strong></p>
          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-part-small">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-part-small" onclick="startButton('isolate-part-small', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-part-small">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-part-small" onclick="resetButton('isolate-part-small')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>        <p>Well, the burden on the healthcare system is still less than in the very first scenario. But a cemeteries are overcrowded again.</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people in real life. But with masks and screens</h3>
    <p>May be masks and screens will help? Of course not all people wear them. Let's say <strong>10% of people wear screens and 50% of people wear masks</strong>.</p>
          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-part-small-masks">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-part-small-masks" onclick="startButton('isolate-part-small-masks', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-part-small-masks">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-part-small-masks" onclick="resetButton('isolate-part-small-masks')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>        <p>Hmm. Although the effect is small, it is there. Why masks have not worked? Actually they worked. But if you have chance of infection as 5%, 20 contacts turns it to 74%,
        that's it! How many contacts do you have in pub or in club? Do you consider you are breathing the same air with all the pub visitors?</p>
    <h3>Isolation + masks + screens + self-isolation</h3>
    <p>So, our goal is to reduce the number of contacts. It's time for self-isonation. Don't forget to build houses for everyone in our virtual city in advance.</p>
    <p>In this case we have a chance to isolate people who do not know they are ill. One more modification in this simulation is prevention of infection through the walls.</p>
    <p>I live in Russia. So I will draw on the experience of my country. The Moscow mayor's office has obliged business to send <strong>30% of employee to work from home</strong>.
        Let's check what happens when this order is respected.</p>
          <div id="game-simulation-selfisolate-part-small-masks">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-selfisolate-part-small-masks" onclick="startButton('selfisolate-part-small-masks', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-selfisolate-part-small-masks">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-selfisolate-part-small-masks" onclick="resetButton('selfisolate-part-small-masks')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>        <p>This set of measures has shown maximum efficiency. About 70% of people did not even get infected by the end of the simulation.</p>
    <p>This is most effective step in fight with epidemy. </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>

<p><strong>It’s time for the holidays and what better way to share love and memories with your family than to create an old-school, vintage movie? You don’t need a time-machine to go back to the 50s or 60s to rmake your homevideo look like a vintage movie. All you need is FFmpeg, some imagination, and perhaps the rest of this guide 🙂 </strong></p>



<p>Let’s take a look at how you can use FFmpeg to make your videos look like old-school/vintage/retro-styled movies, shall we?</p>



<hr>



<h2>What’s Do I Mean By A Vintage Movie?</h2>



<p>Well, good question! </p>



<p><strong>My definition of an old-school movie is a movie with a low frame-rate (like 15 fps), lots of scratches and film-grain to give an aged look, and a sepia tint to it!</strong></p>



<p>Let’s see how we can achieve all of this using FFmpeg.</p>



<p>For this tutorial, I shall be using the “Touchdown Pass” sequence from <a href="https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xiph</a> to illustrate the steps. It’s a 20 second video, but for the sake of this tutorial, I’ll be cutting it to 10 seconds using FFmpeg (<a href="https://ottverse.com/trim-cut-video-using-start-endtime-reencoding-ffmpeg/">here’s how to do that</a>).</p>



<p>Let’s get started! </p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 1: Changing the Frame Rate using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>The first step is to “speed” up the video. Let’s take the video back to pre-30fps or pre-60fps days and take it all the way down to 10 fps. This gives the video an old-school look right off the bat! </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i td-10sec.mp4 \
-filter:v fps=fps=10 \
td-fast.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here is the sped-up video. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479524704" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 2: Give The Video a Vintage Look using FFmpeg’s filters</h2>



<p>Next, let’s change the rich, wonderful colors and bring a sepia-link tint to the entire video. This can be done using FFmpeg’s in-built <code>curves</code> filter. You can use the <code>curves</code> filter to change the amount of R, G, B in a frame and specify the “curves” that govern the change or shift in colors. </p>



<p>Luckily for us, FFmpeg has a pre-defined <code>vintage</code> filter that works pretty well, I must say! Here is the commandline to convert our sped-up video into a “vintage” looking video. Simple, right?</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i td-fast.mp4 \
-vf curves=vintage \
td-vintage-fast.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here’s the result of the <code>curves=vintage</code> filter on our footall video.</p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479525304" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 3: Getting a Film Grain Overlay and Resizing It</h2>



<p>As the final step, let’s add a lot of film-grain and “scratches” to make our video look like something that was shot on film, stored in a dusty old cupboard, and discovered 40 years later! </p>



<p>I found a fantastic “old school” film overlay on YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_MZb7qTenE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source link</a>) with a download link. </p>



<figure><div>
<p><span><iframe width="1200" height="675" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_MZb7qTenE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></span></p>
</div></figure>



<p>The video’s size is <code>1440x1080</code> pixels and so I had to resize it to <code>1920x1080</code> to match the size of my input video. </p>



<p>Here is the command to resize a video using FFmpeg using the the <code>scale</code> filter. I’ve stored the output video as <code>oldFilm1080.mp4</code>.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i old-film-grain.wmv \
-vf scale=1920:1080,setsar=1:1 \
oldFilm1080.mp4</code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>Step 4: Add the Overlay To Your Video</h2>



<p>Now we have two videos with us – </p>



<ol><li>our old-school film-grain-scratchy video</li><li>our vintage-looking, sped-up football video. </li></ol>



<p>Now all that’s left to do is to overlay them on each other and enjoy the fruits of <s>our</s> FFmpeg’s labor! </p>



<p>Here’s the commandline to achieve that. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe \
-i oldFilm1080.mp4 \
-i td-vintage-fast.mp4 \
-filter_complex "[0]format=rgba,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.25[fg];\
[1][fg]overlay[out]" \
-map [out] \
-pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -crf 18 \
touchdown-vintage.mp4</code></pre>



<p>So, what’s going on here? </p>



<ul><li>we provide two input videos to FFmpeg </li><li>using <code>filter_complex</code>, we use <code>colorchannelmixer</code> to overlay by modifying the alpha channel of the film-grain video that is referred to as <code>[0]</code> and and let’s call the output <code>[fg]</code>. It’s black and white, so modifying only the alpha is good enough for our use case. The syntax is as follows <code>colorchannelmixer=rr:rg:rb:ra:gr:gg:gb:ga:br:bg:bb:ba:ar:ag:ab:aa</code>. </li><li>we are modifying only the alpha, and so, we modify only the <code>aa</code> (output’s alpha) to <code>0.25</code>.</li><li>then, we use the vintage-looking football video (referred to as <code>[1]</code>) and overlay them both using the <code>overlay</code> filter to create an interim output stored in a variable called <code>[out]</code>. This is shown in the commands –&gt; <code>[1][fg]overlay[out]</code></li><li>then, we encode the interim output to give us the final video using H.264 with <code>crf=18</code> which should give us a good quality video.</li></ul>







<p><strong>Here is what the final output looks like! Cool, isn’t it? </strong></p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479529512" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>







<p>And, here’s how it looks side-by-side the original video. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479529447" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>







<p>Now you can change the opacity of the alpha channels, use a different film grain video, or use a different <code>curves</code> function, but, the process won’t change much. </p>



<p>Hope you all have a lot of fun making “<strong>vintage</strong>” videos this holiday season and please let me know in the comments how it went! Please create some fun videos, share them with your loved ones, and have a few laughs 🙂 </p>

                </div>
                <p>Properties are a really nice feature of modern languages, and I've recently
                    gotten attached to them in Kotlin. For a while
                    I wasn't comfortable with the idea of 'fields' performing arbitrary computation,
                    but having used them for a few months now I'm really enjoying the simplicity -
                    <em>especially</em> when moving back to Java!</p>
                <p>Having given it some thought, I wanted to lay out a case in support of
                    properties which highlights their benefits over directly accessing fields (which
                    is mostly about getters/setters, but nonetheless), and how we can establish some
                    guidelines on when properties should not be used to avoid the issue of
                    arbitrary computation causing side effects or other unexpected behavior.</p>
                
                <p>In short, a property is <abbr title="Features which aid readability or ease of use but do not impact semantics.">syntax sugar</abbr> for getter/setter methods that look
                    like fields. Instead of having to use the methods <code>item.getQuantity()</code> and
                    <code>item.setQuantity()</code>, we can access the property <code>item.quantity</code> and set it
                    using <code>item.quantity = 1</code>, exactly like a field. The compiler transforms property
                    access and assignment to use the appropriate getters/setters (hence, syntax sugar).
                </p>
                <p>The most noteworthy consequence of this is, in my opinion, allowing <em>validation
                    on assigment</em>. For example, <code>item.quantity</code> may be defined as follows (in Kotlin):</p>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>Item</span> {
    <span>var</span> <span>quantity</span>: <span>Int</span> = <span>0</span>
        <span>set</span>(value) {
            require(value &gt;= <span>0</span>) <span>//throws if negative</span>
            <span>field</span> = value
        }
}
</pre>
<pre><span>
  <i onclick="openDemo('item-property', this)"></i>
</span>item.<span>quantity</span> = <span>-10</span>;
</pre>
                
                <p>The largest benefit of properties is replacing field use, which has a massive
                    amount of drawbacks, with methods instead. In languages like C++ and Java that
                    don't have properties, the best practice is to keep all fields private and
                    manually create getters and setters. More modern languages, like C# and Kotlin,
                    use properties for this instead which can do that automatically.</p>
                <p>Most of the following points are also benefits of using getters/setters over
                    fields, and then properties step in to provide the extra bit of syntax sugar icing on
                    the cake.</p>
                <div>
                    <div>

                <ol>
                    <li>Property getters/setters can have different <abbr title="public/private and friends">access modifiers</abbr>, allowing for
                        fields which are read-only for external use but still mutable within the class.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: In Kotlin, <code>val&nbsp;counter&nbsp;=&nbsp;0&nbsp;private&nbsp;set</code>
                                defines a <code>counter</code> field that can be publicly accessed but not modified (unless within the class).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Getters/setters can be used to maintain <abbr title="A (mathematical) property which is expected to hold true in all cases

For example, a unit vector (3D) has the invariant x² + y² + z² == 1.">invariants</abbr> and perform other
                        validation work, such as <code>quantity&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0</code> in the opening example.
                    </li>
                    <li>Since getters/setters are methods, the implementation can be changed without
                        breaking either <abbr title="Application Programming Interface

The interface of the *source* code">API</abbr> or <abbr title="Application Binary Interface

The interface of the *compiled* code">ABI</abbr> compatibility.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: A <code>Vector</code> class could have <code>x/y/z</code> properties, but
                                change the implementation to use a component array <code>[x, y, z]</code> instead without issue.
                            </li>
                            <li>Additionally, getters/setters can be inlined during optimization to speed up performance at the cost of ABI compatibility.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Properties can be used in interfaces since they're backed by methods, while fields require getters/setters to be defined for them. Notably, these getters/setters would still need to have fields defined in the implementing class to handle their values, while a property can handle that automatically.
                    </li>
                    <li>Properties can be used for methods which often behave like fields, but
                        cannot be implemented with one due to subtypes requiring computation or
                        other restrictions.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: <code>List#size()</code> generally doesn't need computation and returns the
                                value of a field, but some implementations (such as a <abbr title="A form of linked list which doesn't track its size, comes from Lisp

Honestly google it, this text box can't do it justice">cons list</abbr>) might.
                            </li>
                            <li>Whether <code>List#size()</code> should be a property is certainly debatable, but with how frequently collections are used I think it's almost a necessity.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Properties are a <em>single unit</em>. Getters/setters are located in the same
                        location in the source code as the property declaration, making it easier to
                        fully understand a field as opposed to having them defined in separate locations.
                    </li>
                    <li>Properties almost always have syntax sugar for providing default
                        implementations of <code>get/set</code> (if it's not already done automatically). In Kotlin, <code>val property</code> provides a default
                        getter while <code>var property</code> provides both a getter and setter.
                    </li>
                    <li>Debugging properties is possible without a dedicated debugger by using
                        getters/setters. This may be minor for large languages, but if your language
                        doesn't have an IDE or still in development this is <em>extremely</em> useful.
                    </li>
                    <li>Readability is often increased, albeit debatable. I personally find <code>item.quantity&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</code> to
                        be more readable than <code>item.setQuantity(1)</code>, especially in large chains.
                    </li>
                    <li>Generally, properties imply 'simple' behavior, like fields, as opposed to complex
                        computation that some methods may perform. We'll talk about this in detail soon.
                    </li>

                                </a>

                            <span>So what are the downsides?</span>
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>I think there are two notable downsides to having properties. First, the
                    performance difference between field access and method calls can be significant,
                    especially in low level languages. Second, field access has clear, well-defined
                    behavior while a method call could effectively do anything, thus making it
                    harder to reason about code. Let's dig in to both of these.</p>
                
                <p>Field access is almost always language primitive, and is therefore faster than
                    doing the work of a method call (which then has to access <em>something</em> anyways).</p>
                <p>That said, compiler optimizations like <abbr title="Replacing a method call with it's implementation">inlining</abbr> can easily resolve this for
                    simple properties. In more complex cases, this is actually where properties are
                    most useful - a field itself wasn't sufficient, so the alternative would have
                    been a method call or sacrificing validation anyways.</p>
                <p>In low level languages where memory layout is often important, knowing a field
                    access corresponds to a memory lookup (and not arbitrary computation) can be
                    important. In higher level languages, particularly Object Oriented ones that
                    often encapsulate fields behind methods anyways, I don't believe this
                    distinction is as necessary.</p>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <h3 id="problem-2-arbitrary-computation">
                            <span>
                                <a href="#problem-2-arbitrary-computation">
                                    <i></i>
                                </a>
                            </span>
                            <span>Problem 2: Arbitrary Computation</span>
                        </h3>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Finally, we've made our way to what I believe is the core issue: since
                    properties can perform arbitrary computation, it is unclear what potential
                    behavior getting/setting a property may have. The extreme example here, of
                    course, is deleting the entire file system. Fields on the other hand have
                    clearly defined behavior - get or set the value, nothing more.</p>
                <p>However, these type of assumptions are not unique to properties. We apply the
                    same assumptions to methods (and honestly everything) as well. I often presume
                    that <code>getX()</code> and <code>setX(x)</code> have 'simple' behavior, but they could use lazy
                    initialization, have unexpected validation checks, or cause side-effects and
                    other unexpected behavior
                    like a database <code>getConnection()</code>. Naming is one of the two hard problems in computer science,
                    likely because we carry assumptions with us that may not always fit.</p>
                <p>That said, these assumptions …</p></article></div>

<p>Most programmers I know started programming out of sheer curiosity and joy. Joy is what keeps one motivated to keep up with the changing landscape of technology. It’s what keeps one happy. That is why I am recommending these 10 best books for programmers, books I really enjoyed reading. These are the books that I keep picking up and coming back to or have fond memories of. These are also the books that I hardly see recommended elsewhere, except for a few classics that are certainly worth repeating. And now I would like to share these books with you.</p>



<p><em>This post contains affiliate links where applicable. If you’re planning to buy any of these books yourself you can support this blog by buying it with the links</em> provided in the titles.</p>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/36ALozx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Pragmatic Programmer<br></a><sub>Your Journey to Mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="230" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-pragmatic-programmer-230x300.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>I would recommend any programmer to read this book. It contains a lot of wisdom, tips, and advice. Most of it is pretty basic but therein lies the beauty. The first edition released in 1999 and was getting pretty dated. Despite it being old it was still highly recommended. To my surprise they released a new edition 20 years later, all up-to-date! Now you’ve got no excuses left to not read this book. A wonderful book that you surely will be referring back to over and over again, I know I do.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.learninpublic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Coding Career Handbook<br></a><sub>Guides, Principles, Strategies, and Tactics – from Code Newbie to Senior Dev</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-coding-career-handbook-196x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-coding-career-handbook-196x300.jpg 196w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-coding-career-handbook.jpg 311w" sizes="(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px"></figure></div>



<p>Similar to the The Pragmatic Programmer , I consider this book a must-read. It focuses on the bigger picture and your career, not just about writing code. This book is the reason I started this blog in the first place! A great book for any ambitious programmer and want to take your career to the next level.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/36ulPQI">Apprenticeship Patterns<br></a><sub>Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="229" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apprenticeship-patterns-229x300.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apprenticeship-patterns-229x300.jpeg 229w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apprenticeship-patterns.jpeg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px"></figure></div>



<p>If you’re new to programming, making the same mistakes as the programmers that have gone before you can be costly and detrimental for your career. Let this book guide you on avoiding these same mistakes. This book is similar to the ones mentioned above and makes for a nice addition. It’s split up into smaller sections that can be read in any order you’d like, this makes it a fun and easy read.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/3prQVAU">Beginning C++ Through Game Programming</a></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="243" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/beginning-c-through-game-programming-243x300.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/beginning-c-through-game-programming-243x300.jpg 243w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/beginning-c-through-game-programming.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px"></figure></div>



<p>This is the book that taught me how code and was the first book I read on the subject of programming. It made learning new programming languages that much easier. Ever since I read this book it seems I’ve always been one step ahead of the herd. This book is about learning the fundamentals of programming and C++ and less about games. It merely uses games as an example to reinforce programming concepts. This book was a lot of fun to read and because it uses games as a theme it keeps one motivated.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/35sQDSE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Programming Game AI by Example</a></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="201" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/programming-game-ai-by-example-201x300.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/programming-game-ai-by-example-201x300.jpg 201w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/programming-game-ai-by-example.jpg 335w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px"></figure></div>



<p>To be honest I have not read this book in it’s entirety yet as I currently lack the time to do so. But I am really excited about this one and can’t wait to read it in combination with learning a new programming language: Rust. This book makes use of C++ but I’d figure these languages are similar enough as to implement the same ideas in Rust. I’ve put this book on this list because of the pure excitement it makes me feel. I would recommend to at least peruse this book to see if it resonates with you.</p>

<p>This is a book I got recommended, I read it, I loved it. I recommended it to a friend, and he loved it. And now I recommend it to you! It’s a really fun read and I could hardly put it down. This book really is written like a novel and packed with great lessons. Go read it! There is also a part two of sorts: The Unicorn Project. I hear it contains much of the same lessons, only told with a different story. I have yet to read it but will certainly do so in the near future.</p>

<p>I adore this book. It’s a book I keep coming back to over and over. It’s about programming patterns with a game theme once again. Note that the patterns here are not only for games! Some of them are game specific but most of them aren’t. It’s a fun read with beautiful hand drawn diagrams. Bob Nystrom clearly has put a lot of love in his book.

<![CDATA[Learning all VSCode shortcuts evolved my developing habits in unexpected ways]]>
            </title>
            <description>
<![CDATA[
Score 3 | Comments 2 (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25101574">thread link</a>) | @tkainrad
<br/>
November 15, 2020 | https://tkainrad.dev/posts/learning-all-vscode-shortcuts-evolved-my-developing-habits/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tkainrad.dev/posts/learning-all-vscode-shortcuts-evolved-my-developing-habits/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentdiv">

<p>I spent a few hours spread over the last couple of weeks to learn every single one of VSCode’s keyboard shortcuts, specifically the 149 shortcuts from the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf">official keyboard shortcuts reference</a>. These are also present in <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">KeyCombiner’s searchable table of VSCode shortcuts</a>.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I started this challenge to write a blog post about it afterward and as a way to promote <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">KeyCombiner</a> via content marketing. The blog post I had in mind would be similar to my previous one, <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/">documenting my process of learning 50 new web application shortcuts in 42 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>But, as it usually happens only in romantic comedies, my intentions changed over time. This article turned out much different. It is not about the learning process but about how this challenge changed some of the developing habits I had for many years. Workflows that I grew used to during many projects, different IDEs, and even varying programming languages suddenly evolved.</p>

<p>As software engineers, we like to think that we are continually learning and improving our skills. This is certainly true when it comes to the technologies we are using. However, our development habits, such as which features of our IDEs we use, are much more rigid. I believe most of our core workflows are formed early on and very hard to change.
I don’t have data to back this up, but when I look at myself, my co-workers, and other developers I know, this certainly seems true. If you think about it, it is not surprising, the same thing happens in other areas of life. For this very reason, you will find that developers who have studied or worked together will often use similar shortcuts, similar IDE features, and have similar limitations in their workflows.</p>
<p>The usual way to combat this is reading books, blog posts, attending conferences, well, everything that is used in our industry to extend our knowledge. However, with fundamental developing habits, I have found that this works poorly. You might read about a neat feature of your IDE, or see someone demo their workflow, but when you are eventually sitting in front of your screen and writing code, it is easy to fall back to what we already know, what is already set up, and proven to work.</p>
<p>After this experiment, I am convinced that keyboard shortcuts are the main factor in how we form our developing habits, and they can also stop us from evolving our habits.
Even before this challenge, I felt that I was good with shortcuts. I knew quite a few refactoring shortcuts, knew how to pause and stop program executing during debugging, was decent at jumping around between files, searching through my project, and all the other usual stuff. When I saw a co-worker using a shortcut that I didn’t know, I was quick to incorporate it into my workflow, too. After all, I was enough into shortcuts that I built a whole side-project around learning them.
<strong>The thing is, all new shortcuts that I learned were the ones that would augment my existing habits.</strong></p>
<p>This is a hen and egg problem; if you don’t know the shortcuts, you will not start to change your habits and use new IDE features because without shortcuts, they are too tedious to use or not at all usable. But if you don’t form new habits, you will not learn the shortcuts.</p>
<p><strong>Without intending it, I think I found a way to break out of this cycle:
Learning all IDE shortcuts very well <em>before</em> getting back to work. By learning <em>all</em> shortcuts, you are not limited to what somebody shows you and might not be compatible with your situation. You can naturally include what makes sense, in addition to your existing skills.</strong></p>
<p>The next section shows how this worked for me.</p>

<p>I started the learning process as it is usually done with KeyCombiner: By importing some shortcuts from the <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">public collection of VSCode shortcuts</a> into a personal collection. Intuitively, I started with the ones I already knew and some additional that seemed most useful to me. Back then I was still trying to show that I could learn all shortcuts very quickly with KeyCombiner. I didn’t expect that shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing workflows will be the real deal.</p>
<p>Some of the first combinations that I picked and that I did not know previously were <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>/<kbd>r</kbd>/<kbd>c</kbd> for toggling find options (match whole word, regex, case sensitivity) because I was already using those features. This went on for a few days. I did a couple practice runs every day and added new shortcuts whenever KeyCombiner was saying that I mastered all of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Eventually, I knew all shortcuts that seemed useful for how I was using VSCode back then. So I had to start adding shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing habits. This brought up an interesting misconception. Often keyboard shortcuts are seen as a way to do things faster, compared to using the mouse. While that is true, I think there is an even more aspect to shortcut usage in IDEs: Many features are not used at all, if you don’t know the shortcut!</p>
<p>As I was learning new VSCode shortcuts every day, I started to use features that I previously didn’t even know of. One of the first things that suddenly made a lot of sense was <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> as default binding, especially when combined with regex search. I was so excited about it, that I even <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasKainrad/status/1305608337799761920">tweeted a Gif</a> showing how I use it to modify the CSV files that are the source for KeyCombiner’s public collection tables.</p>
<p>The process worked both ways: Sometimes, while I was practicing a shortcut on KeyCombiner, it seemed apparent that this was useful and that I should include it into my workflow. Sometimes it hit me while coding that I had just learned a shortcut that can make the current task more efficient.</p>
<p>In the following, I describe the most significant changes in my daily development habits. The list is far from complete though; there are many more small things that I picked up and frequently use now.</p>
<p><strong>Editor and Panel Management</strong><br>
Since knowing all the shortcuts to switch focus between panels and move editors around, I am using VSCode’s powerful layouting capabilities much more. I have 3-5 editor panels open at pretty much all times, seeing many related pieces of code at once. Working this way by using the mouse is very impractical.
I switch between editor panels with keyboard shortcuts and move editors from one group to the other.</p>
<p>There is one negative side-effect, though: I am starting to get annoyed when I use other IDEs (PyCharm, Eclipse), because they lack far behind VSCode when it comes to using multiple editors.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-cursor Editing</strong><br>
If you don’t know the shortcut to add additional cursors, I doubt you will ever use this incredibly powerful feature of VSCode. It is a typical feature that only blends into your habits once you know the shortcuts.
The basic commands are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Down</kbd>/<kbd>Up</kbd> for adding cursors above/below. However, I found the commands to <em>Insert cursor at end of each line selected</em> (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>), and the above-mentioned <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>) even more powerful. These commands are why I frequently paste text snippets into VSCode, apply a few operations, and then copy-paste it back into whatever application I was using.</p>
<p><strong>Opening views by shortcut</strong><br>
I sometimes tried to do this before, but it never stuck. Now I finally switch to all views (Explorer, Debug, Search, Problems, etc.) with dedicated keyboard shortcuts. These shortcuts translate very nicely to other IDEs. After learning the VSCode default bindings, which are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;char&gt;</kbd>, I set the same bindings also for Eclipse and PyCharm. Especially <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>e</kbd> for switching to the explorer view and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> for switching to the debug view are among my most used shortcuts now.</p>
<p><strong>Making Selections</strong><br>
I hate to admit it, but I did not use shortcuts to expand and shrink AST selections before. AST stands for <em>abstract syntax tree</em>, which means that the IDE will take the current language’s syntax into account for modifying the selection. Finally, I picked up <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>left</kbd>/<kbd>right</kbd> to shrink and expand selections. Not all IDEs handle this in the same way, which can be a bit annoying, but it works well for the most frequent tasks, such as expanding the selection to enclose the current string, method, class, or HTML tag.</p>
<p><strong>Folding</strong><br>
I have started to use folding much more. For years, I have rarely used this feature that all IDEs support to a great extent. Now, I do it frequently. Folding is one of these things that are just not feasible with the mouse. Of course, if you need to fold code, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-problem-with-code-folding/">chances are that you need to structure your code better</a>. Many organizations even apply automatic code linters that will complain when methods or classes are too long. However, I have never seen someone recommend splitting up blog posts into multiple files. The same goes for other non-code file types, such as JSON. All we have there is folding.</p>
<p>I am not saying these are the things you should start to learn now, far from it. These are the things I personally integrated deep into my workflows after doing this challenge, without choosing them deliberately, but naturally. Who knows what you will pick up.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the shortcuts I learned still seem a bit, let’s say nonessential, but a little useless knowledge never killed nobody.</p>

<p>In addition to finally breaking out of old habits and experience a real evolution of my IDE usage, there were some additional, less significant, but still delightful second-order effects.</p>
<p>As a shortcut enthusiast, I often had the problem that I needed to decide which binding to use for a particular operation and application pair. KeyCombiner’s public shortcut search helps to find out which binding is the convention for a particular operation, but it can still be tricky. For example, take the frequently used <em>Step Over</em> operation used for debugging. <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/search/?description=step+over&amp;keys=&amp;mac_keys=&amp;submit=Search">KeyCombiner shows that VSCode, Eclipse, and JetBrains IDEs all use a different default binding</a>(<kbd>F6</kbd>,<kbd>F8</kbd>,<kbd>F10</kbd>). Learning every single VSCode shortcut has freed me from this mental load of deciding what the best …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Python is one of the languages that is witnessing incredible growth and popularity year by year. In 2017, Stack overflow calculated that python would beat all other programming languages by 2020 as it has become the fastest-growing programming language in the world.</p>
<p>Python is one of the most popular general-purpose, high-level programming languages in modern times. It is an elementary and widely used programming language because of its code readability. </p>
<p>The term <strong>general-purpose</strong> means that Python can be used for a variety of applications. And the term <strong>high-level language</strong> means it's close to human language. The main advantage of high-level languages is that they are easier to read, write, and maintain. Programs written in a high-level language must be translated into machine language by a compiler or interpreter. Python is an interpreted language because, during execution, each line is interpreted to the machine language on-the-go.</p>
<h2 id="history">History 📜</h2>
<p>Python was created in the late 1980s as a successor to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)" target="_blank">ABC language</a>. It was developed by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a> and was first released in 1991. While Guido van Rossum was implementing Python, he read the published scripts from Monty Python’s Flying Circus. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063929/">Monty Python’s Flying Circus</a> is a BBC Comedy TV series from 1969+. It is a highly viewed TV series and is rated 8.8 on IMDB.
Python programming language is highly rated too. According to a recent <a target="_blank" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies">Stack Overflow survey</a>, Python has overtaken Java in popularity.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/egu2Nzo.png" alt="python overtaken"></p>
<p>Fig: Python has overtaken Java in popularity</p>


<p>Python is named after the comedy television show Monty Python’s Flying Circus. It is not named after the Python snake.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy 🧠</h2>
<p>The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python">The Zen of Python</a>, which includes aphorisms such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
<li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
<li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
<li>Readability counts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features 💼</h2>
<p>As a programming language, the features of Python brought to the table are many. Some of the most significant features of Python are:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/u4OfzKl.jpg" alt="https://i.imgur.com/u4OfzKl.jpg"></p>
<p>Fig: Features of Python</p>


<h3 id="easy-to-learn">🎯 Easy to Learn</h3>
<p>Python is a very developer-friendly language, which means that anyone can learn to code it in a couple of hours or days.</p>
<h3 id="readability">🎯 Readability</h3>
<p>One of the biggest reasons for Python’s rapid growth is the simplicity of its syntax. The language reads almost like plain English, making it easy to write complex programs. Here is an example</p>
<pre><code>a = <span>1</span>
b = <span>1</span>
<span>if</span> a <span>is</span> b:
    print(<span>"Hi"</span>)
a = <span>2000</span>
print(<span>"Yeah!"</span>) <span>if</span> a % <span>2</span> == <span>0</span> <span>else</span> print(<span>"No!"</span>)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="object-oriented-language">🎯 Object-Oriented Language</h3>
<p>Python is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object-Oriented languages</a>. The term object-oriented means it supports the concept of classes, method, object encapsulation, and many more. Here is an example code of OOP</p>
<pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>Car</span>:</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span>(<span>self, color, model, year</span>):</span>
        self.color = color
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
</code></pre>
<h3 id="free-open-source-and-cross-platform">🎯 Free, Open Source and Cross-Platform</h3>
<p>Python is an open-source programming language, which means that anyone can create and contribute to its development. Python has an online forum where thousands of coders gather daily to improve this language further. Along with this, Python is free to download and use in any operating system, be it Windows, Mac, or Linux.</p>
<h3 id="graphical-user-interfaces">🎯 Graphical User Interfaces</h3>
<p>Python supports a wide array of GUIs which can easily be imported and make the results more visual. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/">PyQt5</a> is the most popular option for creating graphical apps with Python.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-memory-management">🎯 Dynamic Memory Management</h3>
<p>Python supports automatic memory management, which means the memory is cleared and freed automatically. You do not have to bother clearing the memory.</p>
<h3 id="exception-handling">🎯 Exception Handling</h3>
<p>Python supports exception handling, which means we can write fewer errors in code and test various scenarios that can cause an exception. Here is an example code</p>
<pre><code><span>try</span>:
    a=<span>5</span>
    b=<span>0</span>
    <span>print</span> (a/b)
<span>except</span> TypeError:
    print(<span>'Unsupported operation'</span>)
<span>except</span> ZeroDivisionError:
    <span>print</span> (<span>'Division by zero not allowed'</span>)

-------------output ----------------------
&gt; Division by zero <span>not</span> allowed
</code></pre>
<h3 id="highly-dynamic">🎯 Highly Dynamic</h3>
<p>Python is one of the most dynamic languages available in the industry today. It means that the type of a variable is decided at the run time and not in advance. Due to this feature's presence, we do not need to specify the variable's type during coding, thus saving time and increasing efficiency. Here is an example code in the C language</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> </span>{
    <span>int</span> a = <span>1</span>;
    <span>printf</span>(<span>"%d"</span>, a);
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's see the same code in Python.</p>
<pre><code>a = <span>1</span>
print(a)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="large-standard-library">🎯 Large Standard Library</h3>
<p>Python has a large standard library which provides a rich set of module and functions, so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing. There are many libraries present in python for such as regular expressions, unit-testing, web browsers, etc.</p>
<h3 id="portable">🎯 Portable</h3>
<p>If you are running Python on Windows and you need to shift the same to either a Mac or a Linux system, you can easily achieve the same in Python without worrying about changing the code.</p>


<p>Apart from learning, Python is a very efficient language used in almost every sphere of modern computing. This makes a strong case for learning Python, even for non-programmers. Some of Python’s main applications are highlighted below:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qg46Qqy.jpg" alt="https://imgur.com/qg46Qqy.jpg"></p>
<p>Fig: Applications of Python</p>

<h3 id="web-development">📌 Web Development</h3>
<p>Python can be used to make a web application at a rapid rate. That because the frameworks like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> are uses to create these applications. Python frameworks are known for their security, scalability, and flexibility.</p>
<h3 id="game-development">📌 Game Development</h3>
<p>Python is also used in the development of interactive games. There are libraries such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/informatique/soya3d/index_en.html">PySoy</a>, a 3D game engine supporting Python 3, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted">PyGame</a>, which provides functionality, and a library for game development. Games such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2">Battlefield 2</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://civilization.com/civilization-4/">Civilization IV</a>, Disney's Toontown Online, and many more have been build using Python.</p>
<h3 id="artificial-intelligence">📌 Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>A major advantage of using Python for AI is that it comes with inbuilt libraries. Python has libraries for almost all kinds of AI projects. For example, <a target="_blank" href="http://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nltk.org/">nltk</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://simpleai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SimpleAI</a> are important inbuilt libraries of Python.</p>
<h3 id="machine-learning">📌 Machine Learning</h3>
<p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are the most promising careers for the future. We make the computer learn based on past experiences through the data stored or, better yet, create algorithms that make the computer learn. Python has libraries for almost all kinds of ML projects. Libraries like <a target="_blank" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-learn</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>, and many more.</p>
<h3 id="data-science-and-data-visualization">📌 Data Science and Data Visualization</h3>
<p>Creating visualizations really helps make things clearer and easier to understand, especially with larger, high dimensional datasets. Libraries such as <a target="_blank" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> help you in extracting information. You can even visualize the data libraries, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib and</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn</a>, which help plot graphs and much more.</p>
<h3 id="desktop-gui">📌 Desktop GUI</h3>
<p>Python an excellent choice for developing desktop-based GUI applications. Python offers many GUI toolkits and frameworks that make desktop application development a breeze. <a target="_blank" href="https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro">PyQt</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyGtk</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://kivy.org/">Kivy</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://wxpython.org/">WxPython</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python_gui/">PyGUI</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://pyside.github.io/docs/pyside/">PySide</a> are some of the best Python-based GUI frameworks that allow developers to create highly functional Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).</p>
<h3 id="business-application">📌 Business Application</h3>
<p>Enterprise-level software or business applications are strikingly different from standard applications, as the former demands feature like readability, extensibility, and scalability. This is where Python can make a significant difference. Python high performance, scalability, flexibility, and readability are just the features required for developing fully-functional and efficient business applications.</p>
<h3 id="web-scrapping">📌 Web Scrapping</h3>
<p>A python is a nifty tool for pulling a large amount of data from websites, which can help in various real-world processes, including job listings, price comparison, and so on. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html">Urllib</a> are some of the best Python-based web scraping tools.</p>
<h3 id="image-and-video-processing">📌 Image and Video Processing</h3>
<p>Image Processing is thus the process of analyzing and manipulating a digital image primarily aimed at improving its quality or for extracting some information from it, which could then be put to some use. Python offers many libraries, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_table_of_contents_imgproc/py_table_of_contents_imgproc.html">OpenCV</a>.</p>
<h3 id="embedded-application">📌 Embedded Application</h3>
<p>Python can be used to create <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_C">Embedded C</a> software for embedded applications. The most well-known embedded application could be the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, which uses Python for its computing. We can also use it as a computer or like a simple embedded board to perform high-level computations.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion 👌</h2>
<p>In conclusion, Python is capable of handling almost any development requirement. No matter what field you take up, Python is rewarding. In the last few years, Python applications have gained newfound traction in Data Science, particularly in Machine Learning. Python is a great way to start a developer's journey. </p>

                <a href="https://serverless.pub/author/slobodan">Slobodan Stojanović</a> in <a href="https://serverless.pub/category/Serverless">Serverless</a> <i></i> <i></i> 

  20 minutes

            </p>

            <p>Every story needs a hero. But, not all heroes are the same. Some of them have superpowers, and some are ordinary people. This story’s hero is just a regular software developer who works in a small team on a medium-size application. Our hero loves his job most of the time, except when he sends a test push notification to thousands of their customers in production, like a few minutes ago.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/01-push-notifications.png" alt=""></p>

<p>One day, his boss came with a new project. “We need to build a new complex application for our new important customer.” Nice, our hero loves challenges! “But we need to do it fast, as we have a short deadline because they have an important marketing event!” Ok, how fast do we need to build an app? “It needs to be ready for yesterday. And it needs to be real-time and scalable!”</p>

<p>The new project is a big challenge for our hero, as he never did that kind of project. Can he even do it?</p>

<p>“You can do it,” his boss says. “I also hired a famous consultant to help you.” That’s awesome! Challenge accepted.</p>

<p>After a full-day meeting with the consultant, and a whiteboard full of weird diagrams, the plan was simple: “Just use Kubernetes!”</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/02-consultant.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But our hero doesn’t know Kubernetes. And there’s no time to learn it now. What should he do?</p>

<p>He started wondering if he is the only one who doesn’t know Kubernetes. Is he good enough for this job?</p>

<p>Our hero spent a sleepless night in front of his computer with his faithful sidekick, a rubber duck. He tried to learn as much as he can about this new technology. But he ended up more confused and tired.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/03-sidekick.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="you-should-try-serverless-graphql">You should try Serverless GraphQL</h2>

<p>In the middle of the night, our hero’s faithful sidekick said, “you should try serverless GraphQL.”</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/04-try-serverless-graphql.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Was he dreaming? And what the heck is serverless GraphQL? He knows what serverless is, but what’s GraphQL?</p>

<h3 id="whats-graphql">What’s GraphQL</h3>

<p>Do you remember when Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/">said</a>, “our biggest mistake was betting too much on HTML5?” It was a long time ago, back in 2012, when HTML5 was in its early days.</p>

<p>At that moment, the Facebook mobile app was an HTML5 web app embedded in the native mobile shell. They served all the news feed updates as HTML data from the server. However, HTML5 was in its early days, and the mobile web views were not performant enough, so the app wasn’t stable and scalable enough.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/05-fb-mobile-app.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In 2012, Facebook’s engineering team started rebuilding their mobile and switching to the native iOS and Android apps. They evaluated different options for delivering the news feed data, including RESTful services  and Facebook Query Language (FQL).</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/09/14/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/">“GraphQL: A data query language”</a> article in 2015, Lee Byron wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were frustrated with the differences between the data we wanted to use in our apps and the server queries they required. We don’t think of data in terms of resource URLs, secondary keys, or join tables; we think about it in terms of a graph of objects and the models we ultimately use in our apps like NSObjects or JSON.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This frustration led the Facebook engineering team to rethink the way they serve data to their mobile application. Instead of returning a full model with a lot of unnecessary data, they tried to develop a new system to return only the data the application needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/06-data.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In 2015, they <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/09/14/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/">announced</a> GraphQL, an open-source data query language. The idea behind GraphQL was simple, the client defines the data structure, and the server provides a JSON response with precisely the same format.</p>

<p>For example, the client wants to get the user with a specified ID. However, the application needs only the user’s name, a profile photo with a specific size, and the first five friend connections. Instead of sending two or three different requests to the RESTful API, with GraphQL, you can send a request similar to the one in the image below. And the response will be the JSON with the same structure, as you can see on the right side of the same image.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/07-an-example.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>That sounds nice and smart. But why should our hero care about GraphQL? He doesn’t have the same problem Facebook had.</p>

<p>The problem Facebook’s engineering team had was the leading cause for inventing GraphQL. However, that’s not the only problem GraphQL solves. If you have one of the following symptoms, GraphQL might be the cure for the problems your application faces, too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distinct front end clients for multiple platforms, such as web and mobile, have different data requirements.</li>
  <li>Your back end serves data to your client apps from different sources. For example, your app has SQL and NoSQL databases, and it connects to some external systems.</li>
  <li>Your app has a complex state and caching managements for both front end and back end.</li>
  <li>Slow pages, especially on mobile, caused by multiple dependant HTTP requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not complete, and GraphQL can bring even more benefits to your application. Some of the main characteristics of GraphQL are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It defines a data shape. The request always specifies the response’s form, which makes requests more predictable and easier to use.</li>
  <li>It’s hierarchical. Its strict relation between objects with graph-structured data simplifies getting data from multiple sources.</li>
  <li>It’s strongly typed. It can give you descriptive error messages before you run a query.</li>
  <li>It’s a protocol, not storage. Each GraphQL field is backed by a function on the back end, which allows you to connect it to any storage you want in the background.</li>
  <li>It’s introspective. You can query the GraphQL server for the types it supports. This gives you built-in documentation and also a base for a powerful toolset.</li>
  <li>It’s version free. The shape of the data is always defined by the client’s request, which means adding additional fields to your model will not affect your client application until you change the query itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>To combine data from multiple sources using RESTful API, you often send multiple HTTP requests and then connect data on the client-side. This works fine in perfect conditions. However, users don’t always use your app in ideal conditions. They are often on mobile with a limited or unstable network. Or they live in Australia, and each request is a few hundred milliseconds slower.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/08-multiple-data-sources.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>With GraphQL, you can archive the same with a single request. This will push a bit more load to the server-side, but that works just fine in most cases. It’s even better when you don’t own the server.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/09-graphql-request.gif" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="where-to-start-with-graphql">Where to start with GraphQL</h3>

<p>With GraphQL, you start by shaping your data using types. For example, if you are building a blog, you will have an author and a post, similar to the following code snippet. Each post will have its id, a name, a title, and an author. Authors have their ids, names, and a list of their posts.</p>

<p>As you can see, types also define a relation between an author and posts.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>
  </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>posts</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>Post</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Post</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>
  </span><span>title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>text</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>author</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you have types, you can build your GraphQL schema. In the code snippet below, we define two queries: get author by ID and get posts by title. Each of these queries defines input parameters with their types and a return type.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>getAuthor</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>):</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span>
  </span><span>getPostsByTitle</span><span>(</span><span>titleContains</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>):</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>Post</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>schema</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>query</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Query</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As GraphQL is not storage but a protocol, we need to tell GraphQL where and how it can read the data by creating resolvers. In the following code snippet, we define two resolvers: one for the author that connects to the SQL database and one for a list of posts sends an HTTP request to the blog platform API.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>getAuthor(_, args){
  return sql.raw('SELECT * FROM authors WHERE id = %s', args.id);
}

posts(author){
  return request(`https://api.blog.io/by_author/${author.id}`);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, we can run the query. As we defined queries, we can ask for an author by their ID. Relations allow us to get a list of all author’s posts in the same request. And if we ask for the author’s name for each blog post, that name will be the same as the author’s name above because it points to the same author.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>getAuthor</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>){</span><span>
    </span><span>name</span><span>
    </span><span>posts</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>title</span><span>
      </span><span>author</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span># this will be the same as the name above</span><span>
        </span><span>name</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once we run the query, GraphQL will parse the request, then validate the types and data shape, and finally, if the first two steps are correct, it will run the query and our resolvers. Once we receive the data, it’ll look similar to the following JSON data:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Slobodan"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"posts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[{</span><span>
    </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"The power of serverless GraphQL with AppSync"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"author"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Slobodan"</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>},</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Handling webhooks with EventBridge, SAM and SAR"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"author"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Slobodan"</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>By GraphQL specification, queries read the data. GraphQL specification also defines mutations and subscriptions. Mutations modify the existing data (i.e., add a new author or edit post), and subscriptions can notify you whenever the data is changed (i.e., it’ll run whenever the post is published).</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-need-serverless-graphql">Why do we need serverless GraphQL?</h3>

<p>“You can always deploy your GraphQL using Kubernetes and write your resolvers by hand,” the rubber duck said, “but there’s an easier way.”</p>

<p>GraphQL makes retrieving your data from the client-side effortless, but you still need to manage and scale your infrastructure. And now, you have one central place that controls all of your requests. Unless you do the same you do with the other web applications – make your application serverless. Serverless GraphQL brings the best of both worlds: GraphQL makes you client-to-server connection effortless, and serverless simplifies maintenance of your infrastructure.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/10-scaling.png" alt=""></p>

<p>“Interesting, but how do I make GraphQL application serverless?”</p>

<p>“There are many ways to do that,” the rubber duck said. “You can do that manually using the familiar serverless services. For example, on AWS, you can use Amazon API …</p></div></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[Why the Release of Ruby 3 Will Be Monumental]]>

<br/>
November 15, 2020 | https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve been living in the shadow of Ruby 2 for seven years now. Seven! <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/">Ruby 2 was released in 2013</a> (which incidentally is the same year as the initial public release of React 0.3.0!).</p>

<p>In that span of time, Ruby performance has improved <em>significantly</em> and many, many enhancements to the language have benefited a great many people and projects. We’ve seen companies using Ruby and in many cases Rails become bedrocks of developer and consumer internet infrastructure. GitHub. Shopify. Stripe. Square. AirBnB.</p>

<p>But there has also been some consternation along the way. Is Ruby really a top-tier programming language able to compete with the likes of Javascript, Python, PHP, Go, and beyond? Or was it just a DHH-fueled hype-cycle doomed to inevitable relative obscurity as other technologies and frameworks ascended in its wake? (I don’t actually believe anyone seriously thinks this any more, but you still see the stray head-scratcher whiz by on Hacker News.)</p>

<p>Now we are mere weeks away from a major new Ruby release: version 3. While Ruby 3 is an exciting update with lots of features that make it interesting both now and in the future with various point updates promising even more goodies, I think it’s the <strong>psychology</strong> of turning over from major version 2 to 3 that is most vital to the future health of the community.</p>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just a new version. <strong>It’s a new era.</strong></p>

<p>What does this era represent? Let’s list a few talking points I hope we’ll start to push <em>hard</em> and <em>often</em> as Rubyists:</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-fast">Ruby 3 is Fast</h3>

<p>No, I don’t mean Ruby 3 suddenly got a whole lot faster than Ruby 2.7. I mean that Ruby 3 is <em>fast compared to Ruby 2</em>. It’s unfortunate that much of the “Ruby is slow” meme has been a laggard perspective stemming from people’s experiences <em>years ago</em> with the language, or an old version of Rails, or Jekyll, or…the fact is it just wasn’t the zippy experience we’re pleased to enjoy today.</p>

<p>Do we still want even better performance? Of course! But at this point, Ruby is plenty fast as compared to many other “scripting” languages. Most of the time it’s on par with Python. It’s even on par with Javascript. (What? Don’t believe me? <a href="https://css-tricks.com/comparing-static-site-generator-build-times/">Check out how similar Jekyll and Eleventy perform as static site generators.</a>) And as Nate Berskopec often reminds us, your Rails app can perform quite well with just a bit of fine-tuning, and often the typical bottlenecks lie elsewhere in the stack (database, web server, etc.)</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-easy">Ruby 3 is Easy</h3>

<p>These days, you don’t need to wrestle with gem dependency hell or pray to the gods to get Ruby or a Ruby extension to compile. That was “old Ruby”. New Ruby is using a fancy-pants version manager like <code>rbenv</code> combined with Bundler 2.</p>

<p><strong>It just works.</strong></p>

<p>Truly, Ruby is the first thing I install on any new Mac or Linux machine I operate and getting things set up is a piece of cake. Installing Rails. Installing Bridgetown. Installing…whatever. It. Just. Works.</p>

<p>We also have things like Docker and WSL to make things <em>much</em> easier to accomplish on Windows machines if you get stuck wrestling with Win-native Ruby. Heck, you can upload your entire dev environment into the cloud now and use VSCode with remote extensions.</p>

<p>Are there ways Bundler and the ecosystem around Ruby versions/dependencies could be improved? No doubt. But it’s in no way any more complicated or fiddly than the world of npm/yarn, and you don’t see the angry hordes trying to burn down the barn doors over there (except maybe the Deno folks 😉).</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-sleek">Ruby 3 is Sleek</h3>

<p>Ruby isn’t the best choice for all problem domains. It just isn’t. But when it comes to “standard” web development, it often <em>is</em> the best choice. It really is! Spend a few days writing NestJS + TypeORM Typescript code and then come back to Rails. It’s like a breath of fresh, sweet air. And that’s not just when you’re writing controllers or models…it goes all the way up and down the stack.</p>

<p>Ruby just makes everything <em>better</em>. Less code. Less boilerplate. Less ceremony. More streamlined. More properly object-oriented. More polished and pleasurable to read and write. Certainly one could posit there are other web frameworks/languages which have much going for them as well. Laravel is popular with PHP devs, and for good reason. Django is popular with Pythonistas. But can anyone say with a straight face that, all things being equal, PHP is a “superior” programming language to Ruby? Can anyone say that Python—taken as a whole—is more suited to building a website than Ruby is?</p>

<p>I think not. While Ruby wasn’t originally invented as a way to supercharge web development, it found its niche in the rise of such amazing projects as Rails, Rack, Jekyll, plus great APIs by Stripe and many others. It rode much of the early wave of Web 2.0 hits, and that heritage continues to benefit us today.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-here-to-stay">Ruby 3 is Here to Stay</h3>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just another notch on the belt of recent Ruby releases. It’s <strong>Ruby 3.0</strong>. That means we can look forward to 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and beyond. This is the beginning of a whole new era. New innovations. New patterns. Exciting ideas fusing concepts from other technologies with The Ruby Way. Fresh blood coming into the ecosystem. (Anecdotally, I’m seeing newbies plus returning old-timers jumping into Ruby-based forums and chat rooms <em>all the time</em>, and the pace of interesting new Ruby gems bursting onto the scene finally seems to be increasing after a few years of ho-hum incremental progress.)</p>

<p>The takeaway is this: Ruby 3 represents a moment when we should stand proud as Rubyists and unabashedly proclaim to the bootcamps and engineering departments of the world that we’re open and ready to do business large and small. Sure you could pick something other than Ruby with which to build the next great internet success story. But you’ll definitely be in good company if you do pick Ruby. After all, it’s more likely than not your code will be living in a repository overseen by Ruby (GitHub), you’ll be communicating with your fellow colleagues via Ruby (Basecamp &amp; HEY), you’ll be asking for support via Ruby (Discourse forums), you’ll be researching the latest developer news and techniques via Ruby (Dev.to), and you’ll be spinning up your dev machine while wearing that l33t geek t-shirt you got from an indie vendor via Ruby (Shopify)—that is, after you paid for it via Ruby (Stripe). And when you’re exhausted from all that coding and need to unwind at a private cottage by the beach, Ruby will help you out there too (AirBnB).</p>

<p><em>Excelsior!</em></p>

<p>
or <b>Better Digital Living By Making Things Harder For Yourself</b><br>
or <b>I spent a Year Without Facebook and Google - Here's What Happened Next</b><br>
</p>

<p><em>Autumn 2020</em></p>


<p>
It's easy to grow disillusioned with tech, even to the point that it 
appals you. I've been using computers since 1988 and the net since 1995
and over time, something's happened. During the last decade or so, my 
mind has increasingly been preoccupied with the following thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm no longer in control of my computer and my OS.</li>
<li>The modern web is a cesspool of tracking scripts, ads, 
malware and clickbait designed to suck you in and make you stupid.</li>
<li>Even the most premium commercial software and hardware more often
than not comes with contraptions to spy on you.</li>
<li>"Cloud apps" are replacing programs I'd much rather run natively.</li>
<li>Thus, we sacrifice our privacy and intellects for faux conveniences.</li>
<li>The Idealist Net we fondly remember is long dead and unlikely to come
back.</li>
<li>...but there are still pockets of sanity left.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a child of the home computer boom, I'm used to general purpose 
machines that do my bidding without interference from neither the 
manufacturer nor some unknown other wanting to sell me Depends and 
Bitcoins. That's what I want my computing to <i>still</i> be like.
</p>

<p>
The Man wants something different, though. The Man wants you to log in, 
click accept, sell your soul and Buy More Stuff. Hence, working to avoid 
that must be some level of subversive computing: Sticking it to The Man, 
one bit at a time.
</p>

<p>
In this text, I'll try to outline how I do my best to achieve that. Fair 
warning: it doesn't come without what some would call sacrifice, because 
you can't have the cake and eat it. This "sacrifice", however, might 
ultimately turn out to be beneficial.
</p>

<h2>What I absolutely do not use</h2>

<h3>Facebook</h3>

<p>
This is a dead giveaway, of course. No facebook and no facebook services 
(E.G. instagram, whatsapp, messenger, etc).
</p>

<p>
Quitting was, considering the circumstances, very easy. I'd had a 
facebook account since 2007 and I used to live there, sometimes posting 
several times a day and checking in much more often. In the summer of 
2019, I wrote a goodbye post and the day after, I closed my account. 
This is more than a year ago now and I don't miss it.
</p>

<p>
I had an Instagram account for a while, but only used it for maybe a 
month or two. It's the second stupidest "service" available on the net 
right now, and that's saying a lot: It is, quite literally, a site 
where millions of people post daily photos of their dinners. To put it 
as nicely as I can: Instagram has absolutely zero content of any kind of 
real importance to anyone.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None, really. It turns out that people who are 
interested in meeting with or talking to you will send an email or text 
or perhaps even call you. I'm also particularly thankful I didn't have to
witness the COVID-19 debacle unfold on social media.
</p>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p>
Beating Instagram, Twitter is currently the stupidest site on the net. 
Best described as a slowly decomposing swamp of infighting and political 
bickering, it's full of people who will not yield a millimeter in any 
direction and will never, ever change their opinions about anything.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None. Ditching twitter is something I advice 
everyone to do, even those who will gladly sell their DNA for a bit of 
"free" online convenience. You'll feel much more at peace with the world 
without it.
</p>

<h3>Google</h3>

<p>
If facebook is a dead giveaway, this is the truly crucial part of the 
concept. Facebook deals with distractions - Google deals with 
infrastructure. No longer one of many actors on the net, their monopoly 
quite simply dictates what goes and what doesn't. A recent reminder was 
when their domain blacklisting suddenly identified 
pouet.net, an innocent site for discussing the demo scene, as a spreader 
of malware. Things were, as usual, only resolved because someone knew 
someone who worked at Google. To discourage their thuggish, predatory 
behavior, we should avoid them in any way possible.
</p>

<p>
I closed down my Google account together with my Facebook account. I 
haven't missed that one, either. I also switched to searching with 
DuckDuckGo. The major point here is to <i>not</i> find a "replacement 
Google", such as Office 365 and Onedrive. That's not taking back control 
over your data, that's just handing it to the next buffoon for continued 
mining.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I now pay for my email. A mom-and-pop hosts it 
all for a very reasonable yearly fee and they throw in some pretty 
decent web hosting, too. Complete self-hosting would of course be ideal 
from a privacy standpoint, but I'm happy with this solution. I can also 
mount the home directory through sshfs, which makes it an excellent 
"cloud drive". When I've been in contact with their customer support,
they've been timely, friendly, efficient and professional.
</p>

<p>
All things considered, it's probably nowhere near as safe 
from third-party intrusion and reliable against service outage as 
the Google equivalent, but then again I didn't use Google Drive for
anything important, either. That's what my hard drives and USB sticks are for. 
Don't hand over the stuff that matters to third parties if you can avoid 
it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caveat:</b> Some people might actually need Google Docs for work, because 
employers like to force their employees into certain ecosystems. I'm 
forced into other ecosystems by mine, see
<a href="#tacs">Tradeoffs and Concessions</a>
below. The best option in these cases is of course to use it exclusively for 
work, exclusively on your work computer and in a separate web browser if
possible.
</p>

<h3>Many more sites</h3>

<p>
There are tons of sites, services and apps I don't use, for example 
Paypal and Dropbox. In fact, I avoid most sites where I have to register 
an account.
</p>

<h3>Phone Apps</h3>

<p>
My employer supplies me with a smartphone. On it I keep only the apps I 
need for work and banking. When commuting was still a thing, I also 
listened to Spotify. Other than that, I try to use it as little as 
possible these days. I do carry it with me, though: it mostly works fine 
as a phone and mobile phones are pretty damn convenient.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I've never been fond of having a lot of apps.
Most of them are pointless and solve completely invented problems.
</p>

<h3>My local newspaper</h3>

<p>
I used to pay for an online subscription, until I just decided to stop 
one day. Apart from the poor quality of journalism, the biased reporting and 
the insipid editorial texts, I was basically paying money to keep feeding 
the online ad machine. That's a no-go.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> It's probably a reasonable idea to keep somewhat 
informed about current events. <a href="#news">See "News" below.</a>
</p>

<h2>Things I do use</h2>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>
In terms of user empowerment, even Canonical's Ubuntu with its telemetry 
and mysterious snap packages is so far a much better choice than any 
proprietary home computer OS on the market. From a privacy standpoint, 
other distributions, such as Debian and Slackware, are of course even 
better.
</p>

<h3>Native software</h3>

<p>
Turns out there are plenty of good programs that can be used completely 
offline and will let you store your files locally. They're not even hard 
to find. A few tips: Abiword, GNumeric, The Gimp, WordGrinder, 
Audacious.
</p>


<h3>The Web</h3>

<h4>The web, method one: Links2</h4>

<p>
The web still has good parts and I want to get at those good parts. 
Turns out the really good parts are usually remnants of The Old Web, 
consisting of HTML and great content.
</p>

<p>
I try to do as much web browsing as possible in Links2. It's a fast, 
lean browser with zero support for JavaScript and CSS. The latter means 
some sites look a bit funky. The former means some sites won't work at 
all. My usual strategy for sites that won't render without JavaScript is 
to simply ignore them. If they can't produce something worthwhile 
without scripting, it's probably not worthwhile at all.
</p>

<p>
On the plus side, no JavaScript means that most trackers and other spy- 
and malware just won't run at all. Since Links doesn't save <i>any</i> 
cookies between sessions, other means of tracking will at least be kept 
somewhat confused. The flip side is that it's probably an extremely 
unique browser fingerprint.
</p>

<h4>The web, method two: RSS and native applications</h4>

<p>
You can subscribe to Youtube channels, subreddits and pretty much every 
blog out there using RSS. There are also plenty of specialized TUI:s and 
CLI:s for interfacing with various popular websites such as Youtube and 
Reddit.
</p>

<h4>The web, method three: Firefox with UBlock Origin</h4>

<p>
For some things, like banking and filing taxes, the Internet really has 
made things so much more convenient I don't want to live without them. 
Although my bank could easily provide the services I use completely 
without a single line of JavaScript, they have decided not to. This also 
goes for most online shopping. For these types of sites, I use Firefox.
</p>

<h3>Youtube</h3>

<p>
There's still plenty of worthwhile content published on Youtube, not 
least recordings of demo scene productions for obscure hardware.
</p>

<p>
I watch Youtube using my own <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/yt">tube script</a> in 
combination with a media player. It's not ideal, since Google will be 
able to infer a bit about my habits through my IP (although that could 
of course be mitigated using a VPN) and some videos don't work due to 
various restrictions imposed by their creators (or copyright laws). 
Somewhere around 90% of them do though, especially the interesting 
ones such as Computerphile and Numberphile. The upside is freedom from 
ads and algorithmic "recommendations": I watch only the videos I really 
want to watch.
</p>

<h3>Wikipedia</h3>

<p>
Still a useful and usable site.
</p>

<h3 id="news">News</h3>

<p>
Most of the content produced by news media is either clickbait or some 
kind of "commentary" by "experts" on actual headline news, which can 
then be milked for another couple of days. More often than not, the 
reporting is either misinformed, or biased, or both. Still, keeping 
somewhat updated can be beneficial for private decision making and 
overall …</p></div></div>

<p>While contributing to a big OSS project it’s quite useful to know how to do a Git rebase. And more importantly: don’t be afraid of the Git force push. In this post I will write a little about the why and the how.</p>



<h2>The Backstory</h2>



<p>Finally, your change is ready for the world to see. You have gathered the courage to open that PR and hope it will get merged soon. Unfortunately reality is that your PR might be sitting there for a while. Meanwhile, development goes on and the branch you are targeting with your PR gets updated. </p>



<p>While this happens, conflicts may arise. These are conflicts between your code changes in the PR and other changes that got merged into the target branch. What you could do is merge the changes from the target branch into your PR branch. That will however give a lot of merge commits and isn’t very clean. Another way is to do a rebase.</p>



<p>To make the example more specific. On the Xamarin.Forms repository we might ask you to do a rebase whenever there are conflicts. Another reason might be that you have just opened the PR at a time where the tests or build were in a bad state. Or your code hooks into new code that is now added in the target branch. As you can see, there are a lot of reasons for a rebase.</p>



<h2>What is a Git Rebase exactly?</h2>



<p>This is where things start to get a bit scary, because it involves rewriting history due to force pushing. Let me expand on that. What will happen during a Git rebase is that the commits you want to add to the codebase are replayed on top of the target branch.</p>



<p>Imagine you want to add commits to the master branch. Since you opened the PR, new commits were added to the master branch. When you do a Git rebase you take that latest state of the master branch. Then commit by commit your changes are re-added on top of the latest state on master. After each commit is replayed there is a check if there are conflicts which you should then fix, but more on that later.</p>



<p>Have a look at the graphic below which will hopefully make it a bit more clear. On the left you see a merge, in the middle is your typically branching and on the right you can see a rebase. Imagine that the yellow dots are master and the purple ones are your branch/PR.</p>







<h2>Doing a Git Rebase</h2>



<p>Now on to the actual doing. While there are some tools that will do it with a great GUI, I will show you how to do it with the command-line. That will show what is actually going on under the hood. To make things a bit more visual I will use a GUI tool. I actually really like the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="GitHub Desktop client (opens in a new tab)" href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop client</a>, simple yet effective.</p>



<h3>RadioButton PR</h3>



<p>I have a PR that I am still working on to add a RadioButton to the Xamarin.Forms toolkit. I want to ultimately merge it into master. It has been sitting there for a while now while master has had several changes added. In the screenshot from GitHub Desktop below you can see the current state.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-852x1024.png" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-852x1024.png" alt="Screenshot of the commit history for the RadioButton branch" width="426" height="512" data-srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-852x1024.png 852w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-250x300.png 250w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-768x923.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled.png 998w" data-sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-852x1024.png 852w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-250x300.png 250w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-768x923.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled.png 998w"><figcaption>Commit history for the RadioButton branch</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The commits marked in red at the bottom of the list are the latest changes on master at that time. Everything above that are the commits that hold the changes we want merged into master. You will see that Andrei made a great start with this PR and now I am taking over. If we take a quick look at the current state of the master branch, we will see the history as shown in the screenshot underneath.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141.png" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141.png" alt="Current state of the master branch" width="494" height="442" data-srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141.png 988w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141-300x268.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141-768x687.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141.png 988w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141-300x268.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141-768x687.png 768w"><figcaption>Current state of the master branch</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I’m just showing you this so you will have a reference point and you know what to look for during the rebasing process. Note the top commit here, we expect that to show up directly under our own commits in the new history.</p>



<h3>Git Rebase onto Master</h3>



<p>The first thing we will do is open a command-line window. I will be showing you this on Windows, but everything works just the same on Mac or Linux if you will. Open the command-line and point it to the folder of your local Git repository. Then you type:</p>



<p><code>git rebase -i origin/master</code></p>



<p>The <code>git rebase</code> part is probably clear, that is the actual command. Then, we have the <code>-i</code> option. Which means you want to do an interactive rebase. The only thing this does is show you which commits are going to be rebased. You even have the option to remove commits, squash them, etc. although that is not something we will be doing now. Lastly, you see the <code>origin/master</code> part. That is the target branch. What we are doing here is basically saying: give me the latest situation on <code>origin/master</code> and replay the commits interactively from the branch I’m currently on. Does that make sense?</p>



<p>When confirming this command, you will see output like in the screenshot below.</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="568" src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1024x568.png" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1024x568.png" alt="Vim editor showing the commits we want to git rebase" data-srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1024x568.png 1024w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-300x166.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-768x426.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1536x852.png 1536w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase.png 1838w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1024x568.png 1024w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-300x166.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-768x426.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1536x852.png 1536w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase.png 1838w"><figcaption>Vim editor showing the commits we want to git rebase</figcaption></figure>



<p>You will notice that these are the same commits as we saw in the earlier screenshot. The commits in this list which are prefixed with <code>pick</code> will be the commits that are replayed on top of the target branch. You can see all other commands below. </p>



<p>If, for some reason, there are commits in this list that you would like to exclude, just delete the lines by tapping d on your keyboard. You could also put a # in front of the line to comment it out. Or you could put the letter d or word drop in front of the line to exclude it from the rebase.</p>



<h3>Escaping Vim</h3>



<p>Don’t be alarmed, I will tell you how to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="get out of here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/" target="_blank">get out of here</a>. But the interactive part has just opened Vim for you. After you have made all the changes, simply tap <strong>esc</strong> followed by typing <code>:qw!</code>. This will exit Vim (q), save the changes (w) and not ask for confirmation (!). </p>



<p>After you did, in the best case, your rebase is done! Hooray, congrats, high fives for everyone!</p>



<h3>Dealing with Conflicts</h3>



<p>In a less ideal case, like mine, you will encounter a conflict. The changes that came in from your target branch edits were made in the same places as you made changes. The output from our rebase shows us what happened. You can see it in the screenshot underneath.</p>



<div><figure><img width="1024" height="568" src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1024x568.png" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1024x568.png" alt="Console windows showing conflicts after rebase" data-srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1024x568.png 1024w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-300x166.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-768x426.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1536x852.png 1536w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict.png 1838w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1024x568.png 1024w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-300x166.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-768x426.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1536x852.png 1536w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict.png 1838w"><figcaption>Conflicts after rebase</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>No worries, we got this! You can either fall back to your GUI tool and solve it there, or simply open the conflicted files with your favorite editor. Actual Visual Studio Code is very good with these conflicts.</p>



<p>In my case, I have a conflict in the <code>ButtonRenderer.cs</code> file, I will open it up in Visual Studio Code. With VS Code you can easily identify the conflict and it also provides you with some quick actions to resolve it easily, although you are free to blend the changes together and solve it that way. You can see my conflict opened in VS Code underneath.</p>

<h3>Continuing the Git Rebase</h3>



<p>After you have resolved the conflict you mark the conflict as resolved by running <code>git add {path to file}</code> or if you want to remove the file altogether, replace “add” with “rm” for remove.</p>



<p>Now note that this happened after a certain commit. So, not all commits in the list we’ve seen before, but this conflict happened after one certain commit out of that list. That means, that after we resolved the conflict, we continue the rebase by typing <code>git rebase --continue</code>. This will take the next commit from the list and apply that.</p>



<p>From that commit another conflict might emerge and you rinse and repeat until you are done. If you’ve lost faith, you can do <code>git rebase --abort</code> to undo the whole thing and go back to things as before we started this.</p>



<h3>Rewriting History</h3>



<p>Now our Git rebase is done. What I like to do is to inspect if everything went the way I expected. To do this, I look at the new commit history. You can see the history in my GUI tool in the screenshot below.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-962x1024.png" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-962x1024.png" alt="Rewritten history of commits after our Git rebase" width="481" height="512" data-srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-962x1024.png 962w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-282x300.png 282w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-768x817.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory.png 998w" data-sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-962x1024.png 962w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-282x300.png 282w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-768x817.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory.png 998w"><figcaption>Rewritten history of commits after our Git rebase</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Notice how the commits at the bottom, in red, are the ones that were the most recent on the current master branch. Everything above the red box, are the commits that I wanted to rebase. Effectively, we have rewritten history! </p>



<p>However, this means there is one last scary part to overcome… The Git force push.</p>



<h2>Git Force Push</h2>



<p>Because we did rewrite history our branch is in a weird state. Remotely things look differently than we have locally. Locally we suddenly have all kinds of new commits from master that are not on our remote PR branch. Because of the rebase, our local branch is the leading one. This has all the latest bits from our target branch <em>and</em> includes all of our changes.</p>



<p>To get it all back into sync, we need to do a force push. With a force push we simply push all our local changes and overwrite whatever is on the remote branch. It sounds scary and it is! Because we simply rewrite everything on the remote branch this is a destructive operation so you should handle with care. If there are commits on the remote branch that you do not have locally, they will be gone after a force push.</p>



<p>After this post was published, Steve Gordon tweeted with a thing he’d like to add to this. Since I think it was a good addition, I’ve added the tweet for you below.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great post on Git rebasing! One thing I'd add is that this is fairly safe on a personal GitHub fork and/or where you're reasonably confident no one else has pulled the remote branch you plan to force push. In other cases, rewrite remote history with caution. <a href="https://t.co/eNLEuGPPFz">https://t.co/eNLEuGPPFz</a></p>— Steve Gordon (@stevejgordon) <a href="https://twitter.com/stevejgordon/status/1214847644033523718?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>On the other hand, it is not as scary if you’ve done it a couple of times. Especially when you get the hang of doing rebases, and do force pushes more often. You do need to pay attention though and make sure that you got all the changes and commits you want. That is why I like to keep my rebase operation interactive and then inspect the outcome in a GUI tool, looking at the history.</p>



<p>OK, enough with the warnings. When you are ready, simply run this command:</p>



<p><code>git push --force</code></p>



<p>That will push everything from local to remote and everything is back in sync. It’s done! Now you know how to rebase. You can do this immediately after the rebase, or first add some more changes to your branch and push them along with everything else.</p>

    <p>Consider a team of engineers building a feature API for Snapchat. Let’s call them Ovah’s team. They’re facing two big problems: how to build it, and how long would it take.</p>

<p>If they can’t figure out how to build it, the feature is dead already. If they take too long to build it, the feature is as good as dead: Instagram would copy it before they’ve built it.</p>

<p>This post contains 4 different perspectives to look at the two problems. As you read through the perspectives, notice the tension in the examples. Both problems are vastly different, and some perspectives are better for one problem, and worse for another problem.</p>





<h2 id="the-outside-view">The Outside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_outside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the outside view, Ovah’s team compares this feature to other similar features they’ve built in the past. They built earlier features using Flask, and it took them 1 month to do it.</p>

<p>The outside view says that a good estimate for how long it would take is 1 month as well.</p>

<p>Further, the outside view says that a good estimate for how to build it is how you built it in the past: using Flask.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The outside view looks for similar problems in different contexts. It’s a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/gears-vs-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behaviour level model</a>: you look at things only from the outside. How things change from the outside are hints to what’s important on the inside.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that figuring out how long it takes might do well with the outside view, but the API design decisions - not so much. What’s different between the two problems?</p>

<p>Taking the outside view on API design decisions is like building a truck using a car model. Just because it has 4 wheels and behaves the same as a car doesn’t mean it’s used for the same purposes.</p>

<p>On the flip side, not taking the outside view for figuring out how long it would take is a fallacy. Daniel Kahneman writes about the outside view in <a href="https://amzn.to/3eVmTkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“People who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs”</p>

<h2 id="the-inside-view">The Inside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_inside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the inside view, Ovah’s team looks at the components of the problem. They look at the requirements for the feature, and come up with a good design tailored exactly for this use case. It’s unique. They decide to go with Django instead of Flask, since it gets them authentication and other nice things out of the box.</p>

<p>The team figures that with Django, most things are done for them already, so it should take about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>The inside view looks at specifics of the problem. It’s a gears level model: you understand how things tick. You figure out how each component would work.</p>

<p>Taking both, the inside and outside view is better than just taking one. It’s like going to the eye doctor, where they show you unreadable letters on a lit-up screen. They add one lens on your eyes, and you begin to distinguish <code>o</code> and <code>e</code>. Then they add a second lens, and now you can even tell the difference between <code>h</code> and <code>n</code>! They add a third spherical lens, and the dots become sharper - you can now even see the dots over the i’s as circles, not blobs. Each lens is a perspective that sharpens your view. It helps you realise that you’re looking at <strong>e</strong>va<strong>n</strong>’s team, not <strong>o</strong>va<strong>h</strong>’s team: and then everything clicks.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>In this case, using Django was a good decision. However, it took much longer than 2 weeks: unexpected things went wrong, and the team’s imagination was limited by how things can go right.</p>

<p>I think engineers are better at designing APIs than they are at figuring out how long it would take, which hints at them being better at taking the Inside View. This makes taking the Outside View even more important: if no one else is thinking like you, you have a sharp lens no one else has, which makes all the difference.</p>

<p>At the same time, you need to beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maslow’s Hammer</a>: If you only take the Outside View on every problem, you’ll end up with a bad API design.</p>

<h2 id="the-birds-eye-view">The Bird’s eye View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_bird.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the bird’s eye view, Evan’s team looks at how this API should connect to other teams and clients. What are the other components involved? How can we best design things to work seamlessly with existing workflows?</p>

<p>The bird’s eye view looks at the problem as a part of a system, a part of other problems. This is different from the outside view, since it’s still the same problem in the same setting, but being looked at as an interface: how it connects to other things and other problems.</p>

<!-- Sometimes, tweaking the bigger picture can improve the interface, and subsequently the problem in the specific box you were working. -->

<p>Amazon is a company that internalises the bird’s eye view: Every team talks via interfaces! Every other team is their customer. You can’t go to your friend and ask them to open a backdoor for internal calls: it needs to be part of an interface anyone in the company can call. This means, not just clients, but also their colleagues and friends face the pain when the interfaces are hard to use.</p>

<p>What would it mean to take the bird’s eye view for the second problem? Evan’s team looks at how long their dependent teams would take, and when customers would be most likely to upgrade. So, they decide to launch with the next filters release, using that as a guiding factor: if the feature won’t get done by this time, build a smaller feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-worms-eye-view---genchi-genbutsu">The worm’s eye View - Genchi Genbutsu</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_worm.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genchi_Genbutsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genchi Genbutsu</a> means to “go and see”. Go to the problem, and see why it’s a problem.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup></p>

<p>For Evan’s team, this means looking at the team dynamics, and figuring out if Evan or others are somehow holding the team back. It also means figuring out if they have the required expertise in the team, and if not, how can they build it.</p>

<p>Like how the bird’s eye view zooms out to the interface between other teams, the worm’s eye view zooms in to the interface between people in the team. It’s one layer deeper than the problem of designing the API: it’s about how the team will go about it. You’re looking at the problem as a single engineer among other engineers working on the same problem.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>I’ve noticed that the Inside View, and the Bird’s eye view comes more naturally to people, while Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View are rarer. The more uncertainty and unknown unknowns involved in a problem, the more important Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View become.</p>

<p>The importance of taking these different perspectives shows up when you’re facing hard problems without an obvious solution: with the right combination of lenses, a blur turns into a sharp dot.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<p>(Photo by <strong><a href="https://www.pexels.com/@sulimansallehi?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Suliman Sallehi</a></strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/grey-concrete-structure-1481829/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Pexels</a>)</strong></p><p>(<strong>Warning</strong>: This is not a climate denial post, it's my reflection on the state of current affairs)</p><p>The idea of Climate Change doesn't seem to have product-market fit. They've marketed it hard and for decades but it's not really taking off. They've held multiple conferences with a range of &nbsp;popular or obscure characters as keynote speakers, tried bundling it with other products, and made some pretty good cartoons and movies about. And yet society as a whole's doesn't seem to be buying it.</p><p>No one cares about the fact that Climate Change is happening and accelerating. Not really.</p><p>Don't get me wrong - there's lot's of talk <em>about</em> caring about Climate Change, but the real issue is not being seriously address by anyone. Let me explain.</p><h2 id="in-politics-climate-change-is-just-gang-sign-or-pom-poms-">In politics, Climate Change is just gang-sign. Or pom-poms.</h2><p>Climate change is often mentioned in political discussions and, for some reason, seems to be a largely partisan issue, specifically in the Western world. </p><p>It's an excellent tool to signal your affiliation. You see, if you paint it one colour, you can use it as a patch on your conservative jacket. Go Reds! When you paint it another, it's great insignia for your liberal banners. Go Blues! What colour words you use tells other people which gang you belong to.</p><p>For politicians Climate Change is mostly taken seriously as a tool too rile their base. It's very useful to shake around and manipulate your team's spirit. Rah-rah-rah!</p><p>For the conservatives, you're expected to doubt it's veracity, or at the very least, play down its seriousness. Conservative-lites, for instance, will very vaguely argue that technology and human ingenuity will eventually help us all coast this annoying artifact of progress. Full-fat conservatives will go whole-hog and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-skeptics-want-more-co2/">argue it'll be of net benefit to society</a>.</p><p>On the liberal side they have their own range of cheers. Liberal-lites are very keen on raising taxes on production, which they argue would somehow help cool down the world. Full-fat liberals try to use Climate Change as an argument for going communist, because we all know communist societies won't engage in any industrialised production.</p><p>But both sides merely skirt around the issue when it comes down to it. It's merely one string connected to the levers which make their supporters dance. And it's often used as a more palatable brand to be wrapped like a mask over schemes that try and force action of other, unrelated kinds, that they know would not have broader public appear.</p><h2 id="for-large-orgs-it-s-press-release-porn">For large Orgs, it's press release porn</h2><p>Then there's the giant multinationals and intergovernmental organisations. They love to throw around the words "Climate" or "Environmentally friendly" too. It's excellent press-release porn.</p><p>There's a regular, periodic drip of kumbaya-like statements from these hydras, with vague expressions of their "great concerns" and "action needing to be taken". The young folks loves that shit, right? </p><p>You see, a well-crafted press release is amazing for creating the illusion of action. It's excellent moral insurance cover. "We often spoke about our concerns, with quite a lot of words and various agreeable degrees of sternness."</p><p>Then there's the epic events. Climate Change is a pretty rad reason to organise those. They have them often. Fly a whole bunch of delegates to this expensive venue in that remote country. There's lots of food and freebies, well-lit stages, fancy hotels and banquets. The pamphlets and banners with their tastefully designed artwork make for excellent photo-op backdrops. The world needs to see how much these very important organisations and their people care. </p><p>For-profit organisations also know how to use Climate Change effectively. It's marketing gold - so hot right now! It's a very effective tool to justify asking for more money while giving less in return. Tell your customers it's for the good of the colony! That charger that you now need to buy separately will surely save us all.</p><p>My point is of course that when it comes to Climate Change<em>,</em> the leaders of our societies, even the ones that don't outright deny that it's happening, all shout out slogans, make speeches, and then recede into the shadows of bureaucracy.</p><p>"Showing support" is easy, cheap and keeps the masses content. No serious thought or action is being mustered into how we're <em>actually</em> going to deal with the arrival of this c<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-climate-change-report-human-civilization-at-risk-extinction-by-2050-new-australian-climate/">ivilisation-ending threat</a>. </p><p>Some parts of some governments <em>are</em> actually thinking about it, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/2/24/21145687/climate-change-usa-military-book-interview">like the militaries,</a> but for the rest it's just lip service.</p><p>"COVID!", you might retort, "showed us that governments <em>can</em> take swift and decisive action! So there's hope! We just need to vote more and start grass-roots movements!"</p><p>Well, sure, governments did take action with COVID. But most of them took too little action too late. And let's not even go into the mad-surge of power grabbing that happened - the rights being sacrificed on the altar of Security. Or my own government taking the opportunity to elevate corruption and state-looting to new, ever-refined heights.</p><p>But sure, let's simplify it and just consider the fact that action was taken. The problem is that action was only taken when the sparks began to fly. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/revealed-the-inside-story-of-europes-divided-coronavirus-response">Action was taken when the viruses were at the gate</a>. Rome had to fall before anyone felt bothered enough to get up.</p><p>Another example of when people collectively decided to take mass action was with the BLM protests. Or the recent electoral battle between the two old men in the US. Magnificent events, for sure. The people made their voices heard. </p><p>But on closer consideration, doesn't it simply add more evidence to my assertion that nobody really believes in Climate Change? It's clearly not deemed important enough to warrant similar such action.</p><p>Well, that's not really true, I guess. </p><p>There was the Climate Change protests in 2019, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2019_climate_strikes#:~:text=The%20September%202019%20climate%20strikes,place%20from%2020%E2%80%9327%20September.&amp;text=The%2020%20September%20protests%20were,climate%20strikes%20in%20world%20history.">Global Week for Future</a>. Let's be honest though, nothing really came of that. Lot's of noise was made, lots of fun chanting. School was skipped, selfies were taken. Camaraderie was felt, but <em>actual</em> change was as good as being on holiday. And ever so swiftly, with the emergence of the virus shenanigans, Greta &amp; co also faded into the background.</p><p>Then there's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_Rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a>. They're hard core. Excellent name too, really catchy. Too extreme for mainstream narratives though, too aggressive and offensive. You can't run feel-good stories after covering that lot. The responsible media can't support such hooliganism.</p><p>So I admit, there <em>were</em> social movements trying to rouse society into action, but they lost steam and fizzled out. Not enough traction. Not compelling enough. Just a fad. No product-market fit.</p><p>I've been thinking about this for quite a while. It's a recurring theme when reading some of the comments on Reddit and HackerNews when the weekly Climate horror threads bubble up. Is it hopelessness, disbelief, distant consequences or laziness? </p><p>Because i<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3041/beating-back-the-tides/">t's</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201109152241.htm">not</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/nov/13/rising-levels-of-carbon-dioxide-increasing-extreme-weather-events-in-australia-report-finds">due</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/hurricane-eta-storm-2020-climate-change-b892557.html">to</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/arctic-sea-ice-level-climate-change-global-warming-siberia-b1345792.html">a</a> <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/08/russian-scientists-find-powerful-ever-methane-seep-arctic-ocean/">lack</a> <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3008/stunning-forecast-a-century-of-ice-loss-for-nearly-100000-glaciers/">of</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75481-z">evidence</a>. There's <strong>tons</strong> of evidence that things will unhinge pretty soon, and there has been for years. Never mind the fact that even the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/climate-change-oil-industry-environment-warning-1968">oil companies knew what they were doing</a> in the 60s, or that even further <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/how-19th-century-scientists-predicted-global-warming/">back in the 19 century, some had started to suspect that things could get bad</a>. </p><p>Then there was also that fun little controversial book, written ages ago in 1972, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth#Conclusions">The Limits to Growth</a>.

Thrilling stuff. </p><p>Here's a trailer.</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCxPOqwCr1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>The Limits to Growth caused quite the stir.

That has been done millions of times before and is just a Google search away. </p><p>Neither is the aim to go through the all the specific claims of books and studies like the Limits of Growth with a fine-toothed comb to judge exactly how accurate they are. This is not necessary, because there've been enough different studies focussing on different aspects of our effect on the environment, and they all seem to come together as pixels of same picture.</p><p>Make no mistake, it sure looks like the apocalypse is coming.

<p>
If you have participated in a discussion about Elixir, you may have heard “you may not need Redis with Elixir”. Given that Redis has many use cases, this sentence may confuse developers as they try to match Elixir’s different features against Redis’ capabilities. This article aims to explore different scenarios where the above is true, when they are not, and which trade-offs you may want to consider. We will discuss four cases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<a href="#post-pubsub">Distributed PubSub</a>  </li>
  <li>
<a href="#post-presence">Presence</a>  </li>
  <li>
<a href="#post-caching">Caching</a>  </li>
  <li>
<a href="#post-async">Asynchronous processing</a>  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Before we start, I want to emphasize we find Redis a fantastic piece of technology. This is not a critique of Redis but rather a discussion of the different options Elixir developers may have available.</p>
<h2 id="post-pubsub">
  Case #1: Distributed PubSub</h2>
<p>
The first scenario where you may not need Redis with Elixir is Distributed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">PubSub</a>. Throughout this section, we will consider PubSub systems to provide <strong>at-most-once delivery</strong>: they broadcast events to the currently available subscribers. If a subscriber is not around, they won’t receive the message later.</p>
<p>
For this reason, PubSub systems are often paired with databases to offer persistence. For example, every time someone sends a message in a chat application, the system can save the contents to the database and then broadcast it to all users. This means everyone connected at a given moment sees the update immediately, but disconnected users can catch up later.</p>
<p>
Imagine that you have multiple nodes, and you want to exchange messages between said nodes. In Elixir, thanks to the Erlang VM, which ships with distribution support, this can be as simple as:</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span><span> </span><span>node</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-</span><span> </span><span>Node</span><span>.</span><span>list</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-1">(</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8737372369-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>send</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-3">(</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-4">{</span><span>:known_name</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>node</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-4">}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:hello_world</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-3">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
In <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_pubsub/blob/master/lib/phoenix/pubsub.ex">200LOC or less</a>, you can implement a PubSub system that broadcasts to all subscribers within the same node or anywhere else in a cluster, without bringing any third-party tools. At best, you will need <a href="https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster">libcluster</a> - an Elixir library - to establish the connection between the nodes based on some strategy (K8s, AWS, DNS, etc.).</p>
<p>
In other words, PubSub pretty much ships out of the box with Elixir. Technologies without distribution would need to rely on Redis PubSub, PostgreSQL Notifications, or similar to achieve the same.</p>
<p>
Of course, the above assumes your infrastructure allows you to directly establish connections between nodes, which may not be possible in some PaaS, such as Heroku. In those cases, you can use any of the technologies above (Phoenix <a href="https://dashbit.co/blog/github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_pubsub_redis/">has a Redis adapter</a> for its PubSub), or alternatively use platforms, such as <a href="https://www.gigalixir.com/">Gigalixir</a>, that make it trivial to setup a cluster.</p>
<h2 id="post-presence">
  Case #2: Presence</h2>
<p>
Presence is the ability to track who is connected in a cluster right now — the “who” may be users, phones, IoT devices, etc. For example, if Alice is connected to node A, she wants to see that Bob is also available, even if he has joined node B.</p>
<p>
Presence is one of the problems that are more complicated to implement than it sounds. For example, let’s consider implementing Presence by storing the connected entities in a database. However, what happens if a node crashes or leaves the cluster? Because the node crashed, all the users connected to it must be removed, but the node itself cannot do so. Therefore the other nodes need to detect those failure scenarios and act accordingly. But observing failures in a distributed system is also complicated: how do you differentiate between a temporarily unresponsive node from one that permanently failed?</p>
<p>
Another common approach to solve this problem is to frequently write to a database while users are connected. If you have seen no writes within a timeframe, you consider those users to be disconnected. However, such solutions have to choose between being write-intensive or inaccurate. For instance, let’s say that users become disconnected after 1 minute. This means that you need to write to the database every 1 minute for every user. If you have 10k users, that’s 167 writes per second, only to track that the users are connected. Meanwhile, the gap between a user leaving and having their status reflected in the UI is, in the worst-case scenario, also 1 minute. Any attempt at reducing the number of writes implies an increased gap.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir’s clustering support, we can once more implement <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Presence</a> without a need for third-party dependencies! We use a PubSub system to implement Presence, as we need to notify as users join and leave. Instead of relying on centralized storage, the nodes directly communicate and exchange information about who is around. This removes the need for frequent writes. When a user leaves, this is also reflected immediately.</p>
<p>
So while you can use Redis or another storage to provide Presence, Elixir can deliver a solution that is efficient and doesn’t require third-party tools.</p>
<h2 id="post-caching">
  Case #3: Caching</h2>
<p>
The solutions to previous cases were built on top of Erlang’s unique distribution capabilities. In the following sections, the distinguishing factor between needing Redis or not will be <strong>multi-core concurrency</strong>, so this discussion is more generally applicable. Therefore, when we say Elixir in this section, it will also apply to JVM, Go, and other environments. They will contrast to Ruby, Python, and Node.js, in which their primary runtimes do not provide adequate multi-core concurrency within a single Operating System process.</p>
<p>
Let’s start with the non-concurrent scenario. Consider you are building a web application in Ruby, Python, etc. To deploy it, you get two eight-core machines. In languages that do not provide satisfactory multi-core concurrency, a common option for deployment is to start 8 instances of your web application, one per core, on each node. Overall, you will have CxN instances, where C is the number of cores, and N is the number of nodes.</p>
<p>
Now consider a particular operation in this application that is expensive, and you want to cache its results. The easiest solution, regardless of your programming environment, is to cache it in memory. However, given we have 16 instances of this application, caching it in memory is suboptimal: we will have to perform this expensive operation at least 16 times, one for each instance. For this reason, it is widespread to use Redis, Memcached, or similar for caching in environments like Ruby, Python, etc. With Redis, you would cache it only once, and it will be shared across all instances. The trade-off is that we are replacing memory access by a network round-trip, and the latter is orders of magnitude more expensive.</p>
<p>
Now let’s consider environments with multi-core concurrency. In languages like Elixir, you start one instance per node, regardless of the number of cores, since the runtime will share memory and efficiently spread the work across all cores. When it comes to caching, keeping the cache in-memory is a much more affordable scenario, as you will only have to compute once per node. Therefore, you have the <em>option</em> to skip Redis or Memcached altogether and avoid network round-trip.</p>
<p>
Of course, this depends on how many nodes you are effectively running in production. Luckily, many companies report being able to <a href="https://dev.to/erlangsolutions/why-elixir-is-the-programming-language-you-should-learn-in-2020-5g00">run Elixir with an order of magnitude less nodes</a> than technologies they have migrated from.</p>
<p>
You can also choose a mixed approach and store the cache both in-memory and in Redis. First, you look up in memory and, if missing, you fallback to Redis. If unavailable in both, then you execute the operation and cache it in each. The critical part to highlight here is that multi-core environments give you more flexibility to tackle these problems while reducing resource utilization. In Elixir/Erlang, you can also keep the cache in memory and use PubSub to distribute it across nodes. You can see this last approach in action <a href="https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags">in the excellent FunWithFlags library</a>.</p>
<p>
Another trade-off to consider is that all in-memory cache will be gone once you deploy new nodes. Therefore, if you need data to persist across deployments, you will want to use Redis as a cache layer, as detailed above, or dump the cache in a storage, such as database, S3, or Redis, before each deployment.</p>
<h2 id="post-async">
  Case #4: Asynchronous processing</h2>
<p>
Another scenario you may not need Redis in Elixir is to perform asynchronous processing. Let’s continue the discussion from the previous case.</p>
<p>
In environments without or with limited multi-core concurrency, given each instance is assigned to one core, they are limited in their ability to handle requests concurrently. This has led to a common saying that “you should avoid blocking the main thread”. For example, imagine that your application has to deliver emails on sign up or generate some computationally expensive reports. While one of your 16 web instances is doing this, it cannot handle other incoming requests efficiently. For this reason, a common choice here is to move the work elsewhere, typically a background-job processing queue. First, you store the work to be done on Redis or similar. Then one of the 16 web instances (or more commonly a completely different set of workers) grabs it from the queue.</p>
<p>
In multi-core concurrent environments, requests can be handled concurrently regardless if they are doing CPU or IO work. Sending the email from the request itself won’t block other requests. Generating the report is not a problem, as requests can be served by other CPUs. These platforms typically get assigned as many requests as they can handle and they distribute the work over the machine resources. Even if you prefer to deliver emails outside of the request, in order to send an earlier response to users, you can spawn an asynchronous worker without a need to move the delivery to an external queue or to another machine. Once again, concurrency gives us a more straightforward option to tackle these scenarios.</p>
<p>
Note the Erlang VM takes care of multiplexing CPU and IO work without a need for developers to tag functions as async or similar. Workers in Erlang/Elixir are …</p></article></div></div>

November 15, 2020 | https://www.ungated.media/article/substack | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ungated.media/article/substack">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>’ll admit, I have a major soft spot for <a href="https://substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a>. It’s home to some of the most electrifying writing online, and I happily pay for a few newsletters myself. However, as someone who’s looking to <a href="https://www.ungated.media/article/introduction" target="_blank">build a long-term business around my own writing</a>, you couldn’t pay me to use the platform. The cost is too high, in more ways than one.</p><p>The critique that’s coming is going to be brutal. But first, a few acknowledgments, because Substack’s founders have indeed done something extraordinary. They’ve properly aligned the incentives between creators and consumers, unshackled some of the world’s best writing talent, and singlehandedly made the idea of paid newsletters cool again.</p><p>In a media ecosystem increasingly dominated by the loudest, most outrage-driven voices, Substack’s carved out a space where thoughtfulness reigns, and individual creators are rewarded for the depth of their contribution. It’s refreshing, and it gives me a glimmer of hope for the future of indie media.</p><p>Substack also deserves credit for how simple and frictionless their platform is. It’s the only tool I know where you can set up a paid newsletter in the next 20 minutes, even if you’re technologically illiterate. I doubt we’d have seen the explosion in quality writing this year had it not been dead simple to get started.</p><p>However, most of that praise comes from a consumer perspective. As a creator and entrepreneur, I’m perplexed and concerned by Substack’s seemingly endless list of shortcomings. Though it’s incredibly popular right now, I believe it’s important for ambitious creators to understand the downside before staking their claim on Substack.</p><h2>Who do I recommend Substack for?</h2><p>Before we get into the critique, I have to stress that Substack is not a bad piece of software. Though it’s a poor fit for serious creators, there are people who will get amazing value from Substack.</p><p><strong>For starters, it’s the obvious choice for hobbyists.</strong> If you’re looking for a place to write, unencumbered by expensive marketing and website tools with features you’ll never need, go for Substack. It’s free, simple, and so, so easy to maintain. Plus, you can always turn on subscriptions if you want to generate a bit of side income. Just beware, if your intentions shift towards building a business, you’re going have to deal with all of the limitations below.</p><p><strong>I’d also recommend it for creators who value simplicity and ease above all else.</strong> Personally, I enjoy <a href="https://www.ungated.media/article/membership-tools" target="_blank">getting into the weeds and finding the perfect tech</a> for the job. I don’t mind a bit of extra complexity if it results in a better business for me, or a richer experience for my fans. But if all you want is to write and get paid, and you don’t have the time or temperament to piece together various tools, go with Substack. I still hope you’ll read the rest of this article, though, because there are very real tradeoffs you’re making with this approach.</p><p><strong>Lastly, I’d recommend it for serious entrepreneurs who are looking to rapidly deploy an MVP for a paid newsletter</strong>. Maybe you’ve got a hypothesis for a newsletter you think would kick ass, but you’re not sure it’d work. Instead of investing the time to build your custom infrastructure up front, you can jump on Substack, publish a bit, do some marketing, and see if your hypothesis holds water or not.</p><p>I’m pretty sure that’s what <a href="https://rosieland.substack.com/" target="_blank">Rosie Sherry</a> is doing with her Substack. She used it to build a writing habit, validate that people will pay for great community-building content, and is now moving to a better set of tools.</p><figure id="w-node-22162e753f7d-377c2913"></figure><p>Just beware, the longer you stick with Substack, the harder it’s going to be to switch. So I’d recommend using it for a few months at most, then migrating to a set of tools more suited to building a business.</p><p>With all of that said, let’s now get into Substack’s shortcomings for serious creators.</p><h2>A pricing model that penalizes success</h2><p>How much would you reasonably pay for the service that Substack provides? I’m going to keep coming back to this simple question throughout the article. So keep it top of mind.</p><p>Substack, of course, is free to start. Only once you monetize do they take a flat 10% out of your earnings. (And hey, if you never charge, you’ve essentially got a forever-free newsletter/blog hybrid.)</p><p>Assuming you’re just getting started with subscription media, this is an <em>amazing</em> deal. You get full access to a platform that would likely cost $30-100/month were it priced as a traditional SaaS tool. And you never pay anything close to that in fees until you’re bringing in real money. </p><p>This is part of what makes Substack so seductive. It’s not only easy to get started, but it comes with the veneer of being a great bargain.</p><p>However, as you start growing a genuine business around your content, and that 10% creeps ever higher, it becomes less obvious what value you’re getting in return for Substack’s fee.</p><p>Here are a few examples that demonstrate this well.</p><p>When I first started planning Ungated, I briefly considered building on Substack. After all, that’s where all the cool kids were writing. Then I started doing the math.</p><p>The plan was (and still is) to build a $10/month publication, and within a year, have 1000 happy customers. Yep, a year from now, I plan to be living the Kevin Kelly dream.</p><p>That’s $120,000/year in top line revenue. Of that, Substack’s take would be $12,000 annually, or $1,000 a month. (Keep in mind, this is simplified math that doesn’t take into account the additional 2.9% + 30¢ from Stripe.)</p><p>That hypothetical $12K annual fee—how does it strike you? Does it feel like a fair exchange of value with Substack? Are you getting your money’s worth?</p><p>For me, the answer was a clear and unambiguous <em>hell no</em>. And you’ll see why as you move through the rest of this post.</p><p>Let’s step it up a notch, and use another real life example to drive home the point.</p><p>As of this writing, <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/" target="_blank">Matt Taibbi</a> has the third most popular paid newsletter on Substack’s leaderboard, with “tens of thousands” of subscribers. Now, by all accounts, Matt’s super happy with Substack, so this’ll be hypothetical. But it’s instructive nonetheless.</p><p>For the sake of easy math, let’s say he’s got 15,000 paid subscribers at $50/year. That translates to roughly $750,000 per year, without yet accounting for fees or churn or new subscribers.</p><p>That means, unless Substack cut him some kind of deal (which they’ve been known to do with high-profile journalists), Matt Taibbi’s singlehandedly paying $75,000 a year in fees.</p><p>Can we let that sink in for a moment? </p><p>That’s a year of tuition, room, and board at Yale University. That’s a middle manager’s yearly salary. That’s a brand new Tesla Model S. That’s an entry-level house in Detroit. Hell, that’s a full time employee—or several contractors—Matt could hire to help grow his media business (which he recently <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/note-to-readers-6ea" target="_blank">expressed interest</a> in doing.)</p><p>Broken down, that’s $6,250 per month in fees. If Matt posts twice per week, he’s essentially paying Substack $781.25 every single time he publishes.</p><p>For what?</p><blockquote>Is Substack, as a platform, delivering a fraction of that much value on an ongoing basis? Sure, it’s easy and low-maintenance, but how much are those things truly worth? At what point are you flushing money—that you’ve rightfully earned by delivering value to your fans—down the toilet?</blockquote><p>Again, I would like you to consider the question: what would you reasonably pay for the service that Substack provides? $50 a month? $100 a month?</p><p>In 2020 as I write this, the market for “passion economy” software is exploding. Anyone can now piece together an email, membership, and website tech stack that is <em>far more capable</em> than Substack, and only pay $15-200/month. </p><p>For the creators who succeed on its platform, Substack really has to deliver something above and beyond to justify taking 10% in perpetuity. And I don’t see much evidence of that.</p><p>In fact, as we’re about to see, the sky-high fee is just the tip of a very depressing iceberg.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>After chatting with someone at Substack, it seems they do offer ongoing benefits to their higher-earning creators. It just isn’t advertised anywhere. Those benefits include things like health care, legal defense if you get sued, and design/marketing help, which are indeed hugely valuable. I’d hope for more transparency from Substack as to how creators can qualify for any of this, because right now, it’s very unclear.</em></p><h2>In a world that rewards uniqueness and personality, Substack forces sameness</h2><p>I’m subscribed to roughly eleventy thousand Substack newsletters. That number has actually grown since I started writing this article. I’ve clearly got an addiction, and someone should stage an intervention ASAP.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f5306248ae8615a2f258509/5f90860691026f7b7be523dd_HugeThoughtfulKagu-size_restricted.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Jokes aside, the moment you subscribe to more than a handful of Substack newsletters, you’ll notice something rather alarming—they all start to blend together. </p><p>They all look and feel the same. The user experience is the same (and not very good, as I’ll detail later). And hell, the content itself is even starting to blur together, given that it’s mostly tech/media/politics folks on the platform.</p><p>Even the strongest, most thoughtful writers start blending in with one another, as they have almost no discernible brand. And in a landscape with more people becoming indie creators each day, that is a seismic fucking problem.</p><p>Let’s back up a moment.</p><blockquote>One of the core principles of succeeding in the modern creator economy is that your work needs to be <em>genuinely worthy of people’s attention</em>. We live in a world of media abundance, and if you want to be seen as signal in the noise, you need to be different or better in some way.</blockquote><p>A big part of that is honing in on a specific niche, or finding your “personal monopoly” as <a href="https://www.perell.com/" target="_blank">David Perell</a> would say. </p><figure id="w-node-0922ad6c2b70-377c2913"></figure><p>But another, equally important part is finding ways to inject your personality, values, and aesthetic sensibilities into everything you do. In other words, it’s about having a unique, discernible brand.</p><p>On Substack, you can kiss that possibility goodbye from day one.</p><p>In fact, Substack gives you so little control over your design and brand that it’s actually a bit comical. You get the …</p></div></div>

<![CDATA[Moving my serverless project to Ruby on Rails]]>

November 15, 2020 | https://frantic.im/back-to-rails | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://frantic.im/back-to-rails">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <header>
    
    
  </header>
  <p>I have a small side project: <a href="https://hacker.gifts/">digital gift cards for hackers</a>. It uses Shopify for all the store-related stuff: frontend, payments, refunds, reports, etc.</p>

<p>But unlike regular digital products (ebooks, videos) I wanted each card that the user purchases from the store to be unique. So I made a  script that generates personalized images and ran it manually for every order.</p>

<p>The next logical step was automating this process. I started with serverless AWS Lambda. At the time it was the hot new tech and I wanted to learn more. It seemed very fitting for my use-case: single-responsibility functions that can run at any time and don’t require server maintenance.</p>

<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/back-to-rails/simple-lambda.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It was super easy to get started. I built a JavaScript function and deployed it to AWS Lambda, added Shopify web hook and it all worked!</p>

<p>Early benefits of serverless (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to get started</li>
  <li>Don’t have to configure or maintain servers</li>
  <li>Free for small loads</li>
</ul>

<p>In reality, writing the simple Lambda functions turned out to be only 10% of the work.</p>

<p>Time passed and my backend started getting more complex: I needed to store some state for each <a href="https://hacker.gifts/products/space-invaders">puzzle</a>, send confirmation emails, show an order details page. What started as a simple function, grew into a bunch of serverless functions, SNS topics, S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables. All bound together with plenty of YAML glue, schema-less JSON objects passed around and random hardcoded configs in AWS console.</p>

<p>I think it’s just a typical software development lifecycle: things grow organically, become a mess, and require some refactoring. Make it run first (discover market fit), then make it right (refactor to integrate the new discoveries).</p>

<p>But this time it was different. I couldn’t refactor things as easily as I used to in traditional monolithic apps. Here’s why:</p>

<p>When the building blocks are too simple, the complexity moves into the interaction between the blocks.</p>

<p>And the interactions between the serverless blocks happen <em>outside</em> my application. A lambda publishes a message to SNS, another one picks it up and writes something to DynamoDB, the third one takes that new record and sends an email…</p>

<p>I could test every single block in that flow, but I didn’t have confidence in the overall process. What if publishing fails, how would I know that? How would system recover? Can I rollback and try again? Where do the logs go?</p>

<p>Another swarm of problems was hiding in my configuration: bad Route 53 record, typos in SNS topics, wrong S3 bucket region. Tracing errors was a challenge, there’s no single log output I can look into.</p>

<p>With serverless, I was no longer dealing with my project's domain, I was dealing with the distributed system's domain.</p>

<p>At this point I felt fooled.</p>

<p>I came for the easy way to deploy code and not think about servers, but in the end had to design my system around the platform’s limitations.</p>

<p>Drawbacks of serverless (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hard to follow information flow</li>
  <li>Impossible to replicate production environment locally</li>
  <li>Slow iteration speed</li>
  <li>Lack of end-to-end testing</li>
  <li>Immature documentation (dominated by often outdated Medium posts)</li>
  <li>No conventions (have to make hundreds of unessential decisions)</li>
</ul>

<p>—</p>

<p>I was clearly not enjoying the serverless. So I decided to rewrite it. After all, it is a side project I’m doing for fun. The tech stack of choice — Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>I haven’t used Rails since 2013, and for the last 8 years at Facebook I’ve been mostly doing JavaScript.</p>

<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/back-to-rails/logo.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The experience of picking Rails back up was really nice but… uneventful. Not much had really changed. A few things got added, a few small things moved around.</p>

<p>Of course I did <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/38060">hit some magical Ruby issues</a>. But unlike my typical experience with JavaScript, I was quickly able to find the solution.</p>

<p>Rails comes with so many things built-in and configured. Over the years, without Rails, I used to gluing random JavaScript libraries together to roll my own routing, file storage wrappers, email preview pipeline, managing secrets, test setup with fixtures, database migrations, logging, performance reporting, deployment scripts. With Rails I didn’t have to think about all these details and could simply focus on making product-visible changes.</p>

<p>It was like driving a Tesla after years of making my own scrappy cars. Similar components, but all configured and aligned to work well together.</p>

<p>Benefits of Rails (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conventions</li>
  <li>Tooling, libraries</li>
  <li>Documentation</li>
  <li>Monolith is easy to understand and test</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawbacks of Rails (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Feels heavyweight in the beginning</li>
  <li>Hurts if your opinions differ from Rails conventions</li>
  <li>Have to host on a server</li>
  <li>Doesn’t sound cool in 2020 (anymore and maybe yet)</li>
</ul>

<p>—</p>

<p>Serverless is like a black hole. It promised exciting adventures, but gravity sucked me in and I spent most of my efforts dealing with its complexity, instead of focusing on my product.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Concords is an MVP framework for building offline &amp; decentralised web apps, with a file-based approach to storing data. It has no servers or databases and is a static app built with Javascript and HTML, all code is written to run in a browser and nothing is stored outside of the browser or downloaded files.</p> <p>The full MVP is available to try at <a href="https://alpha.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">alpha.concords.app</a></p> <h2 id="why">Why?</h2> <p>SAAS applications run on servers with databases. Each interaction with the UI sends information from the browser to a server, which then likely writes something or fetches something from a centralized database.</p> <p>Maintaining servers and databases is expensive, complex and time-consuming and I'm not really interested in that side of software. I don't want the responsibility to look after data that is depended upon, that's neither my skill-set nor passion. I like to focus my attention on the front-end experience.</p> <p>I set out to build a framework for file-based SAAS apps. Multi-user collaborative apps, with data-driven user flows and advanced UI. But apps that run offline and save state to the filesystem, not send it off to a cloud-based database. Giving users full ownership and visibility of their data, with no dependency on an internet connection. Taking a progressive approach to connectivity, using it to enrich the experience, but not depend on it.</p> <h2 id="technical-steps">Technical Steps</h2> <ul> <li><p>Functional blockchain library in Typescript.</p> </li> <li><p><a href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Svelte</a> &amp; <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sapper</a> for all things UI.</p> </li> <li><p>Blockchain sync with IndexedDB and reactivity hook.</p> </li> <li><p>Created <a href="https://1.0.0.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some mini-apps</a> to refine and test the core functionality.</p> </li> <li><p>User Authentication flow.</p> </li> <li><p><a href="https://alpha.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MVP: Kanban app</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="concords-mvp-board-app">Concords MVP: Board App</h2> <p>This MVP serves to demonstrate a basic solution to a truly offline and decentralized experience in a collaborative web app. It's a static app, so just Javascript and HTML, with no servers or databases running in the background. It's a progressive web app with a service worker, that runs entirely in the browser. So once the initial load has been performed, the rest of the experience can work completely offline, where data is stored in files, downloaded and uploaded through the UI.</p> <p>A boards app covers a lot of functionality commonly found in SAAS applications, I figured it's a great benchmark to prove out the technology.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/add-task.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3> <p>With Concords, authentication is all done in the browser, without any communication to a server or external resource.</p> <p>In the Concords authentication system, we issue a downloadable public profile which includes your public key and some basic user info. I keep mine for the MVP on my personal domain. <a href="https://ternent.dev/concords/sam-ternent.profile.concords.json" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ternent.dev/concords/sam-ternent.profile.concords.json</a></p> <p>Anyone with access to my public key is able to encrypt data for me, that only I can read with my private key. I just have that stored on my personal machine. It’s never been online and no-one else knows it.</p> <p>This key is used to log the user into the app and only a valid key combination can login and access the software.</p> <p>For my MVP, this is more than sufficient to complete and decent authentication flow. We can have a recognisable UX of profile/password combination to build a login system, whilst setting us up for an encrypted, multi-user, data flow.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/signup.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <p>I know it's a pain to ask users to store both parts of their encryption keys themselves. If the private key is lost, it's unrecoverable and so is any encrypted data to that key. But I couldn't compromise here, it has to be this way to keep things decentralized. But it's a problem that can be fixed through software, it doesn't have to be my software - we're decentralizing things here, but key management software will fix this problem.</p> <h3 id="the-app">The App</h3> <p>Knowing roughly what I needed to build to prove out the concept, and having already implemented User Profile and the authentication flow, the key features I chose to implement were:</p> <ul> <li>Create new and multiple boards</li> <li>Downloadable app files</li> <li>Load any board, from any user</li> <li>Assign tasks to users</li> <li>Editable tasks</li> <li>Timestamped actions</li> <li>Drag to sort columns</li> <li>Draggable tasks across columns</li> <li>Soft delete tasks to the trash, with restore and remove</li> <li>Activity log with an immutable history of the board</li> </ul> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/create-board.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h4 id="multiple-users">Multiple Users</h4> <p>By default, a new user doesn't have edit access to a document. For the purpose of the MVP, we've got a "Join" button in the left-hand sidebar. Clicking this will add the user as an entry to the data store and unlock editing. This covers the concept enough for now, but we are able to achieve direct encryption with the public/private key authentication, so that's going to be an interesting avenue to explore further outside of the MVP context.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/third-user.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h3 id="core-library">Core Library</h3> <p>The core of the framework is written in Typescript. It's a collection of functional utilities which cover the data side of the application. It runs an internal blockchain for writing data, mapped with an IndexDB instance for reading.</p> <h4 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h4> <p>At the heart of the library is the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/merkle-tree-what-is-it-and-why-use-it-8m2a63xjd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Merkel Tree</a> solution. Our Merkle Tree (as used in Blockchain and git), is a functional library to act as a blockchain node, from a JSON object structure, in the browser.</p> <p>Built on top of that is a CRUD API which the application will interface with. When an action is performed in the app, a timestamped transaction is created for the blockchain. Once commit, all pending transactions are then added to a block on the chain. Once a block has been added to the blockchain, the hash-based data structure ensures the integrity of the app state.</p> <pre><code>{
 "type": "tasks",
 "action": "create",
 "data": {
   "title": "Task Name",
   "description": "Task Description",
   "completed": false,
   "due_date": "2020-11-02",

 },
 "signature": "NOT RELEASED"
}</code></pre><hr> <h4 id="database">Database</h4> <p>Sitting on the other side of the blockchain is the DB layer. When a transaction it accepted onto the blockchain, we parse the event and perform an operation on an IndexedDB instance in the browser. Transactions are recorded as they go in, so we don’t duplicate transactions and minimise the number of write operations to the database.</p> <p>As long as we have the blockchain data object, we have a full picture of our app and data state. We can drop and recreate a database with complete accuracy, based on secured transactional history. This is a <strong>read only</strong> layer.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/recreate-db.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h4 id="architecture-overview">Architecture Overview</h4> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/images/architecture.svg"></p> <hr> <h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2> <h3 id="desktop-app">Desktop App</h3> <p>A quick leap here is to build this out into a desktop app using electron. Little things like saving the hash to a keychain, directly reading and writing to the filesystem. I'm excited to try running the <a href="https://dat.foundation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DAT</a> project to enable P2P connectivity to give a realtime collaborative experience.</p> <h3 id="intergrations">Intergrations</h3> <p>My primary goal is decentralization. I'm not against storing data on the cloud, I just want to be able to make my own choice as to where. The initial standout integration I want to try is with Dropbox, syncing a folder in your filesystem to dropbox will give us the ability to introduce the "push/pull" aspect found in git.</p> <h3 id="conflict-resolution">Conflict resolution</h3> <p>I need to do further research around conflict resolution. I have the basics for a complete blockchain, which includes proof of work and consensus to ensure the validity of the underlying data structure, but it doesn't secure or handle in-app data conflicts. Visual diffs and conflicts are problems solved in various other applications, with plenty of research available. I'm not sure how it will look yet, but it should be a fun one to solve.</p> <h3 id="user-roles--permissions">User roles &amp; permissions</h3> <p>Using our data structure user roles and permissions are achievable. With the use of application-level permission keys, we can encrypt the access key for a specific user. They will then have access to any data under that permission level.</p> </section></div></div>]]>

<p><b>...or anyone else, for that matter.</b></p>

<p><i>Autumn 2020</i></p>

<p>Ask anyone who's really into cooking and they'll tell you how important it is to have a kitchen that's arranged just right. To someone who rarely cooks, a kitchen is probably just a place to store a few pots and a toaster, and the placement of such stuff doesn't matter much: canned soup and microwave dinners are designed for ease of preparation.</p>


<p>For the enthusiastic home cook, however, a lot of things can go wrong. Often there's only a second's notice to fix something that might ruin a perfect meal or set you back hours of hard toil. Hollandaise starting to split? Better bring out that ice cold water post haste! Garlic burning? Better chop some more right this instant, or the pasta will be overcooked and there goes the Aglio e Oglio.</p>


<p>To achieve speed, you have to know where your knives, pots, pans, spoons, whisks and other utensils are and you want to be able to arrange them so that they're easy to reach. Seasonings, spices, herbs and condiments should be within reach from the stove. Then there's the mise en place before the actual cooking begins: chopping all the vegetables, cubing the meat, slicing the bacon and so on.</p>


<p>All of this is, thankfully, easy to achieve. Even the most cramped kitchen will, after having been battle tested through a few meals, be as optimal as possible according to the cook's personal preference. The same goes for painters, carpenters, car mechanics and even office dwellers. Hammer missing from the hammer hook? For shame! Stapler not to the immediate right of the stack of post-its? Well it should be!</p>


<h3>The regulated kitchen</h3>


<p>Now imagine if you couldn't organize your kitchen to your heart's content. Not because you're lacking the funds or skills, but because some federally appointed clerk is constantly coming to inspect it.</p>


<p>"Nah," he says, adjusting his clip-on tie, "you can't put your spices there. Against regulations. All spices must be kept more than two yards from the stove at all times." He then goes on to explain that you'll have to call him every time you want to use the stove, just to make sure the pots you're using are compliance tested. Plus, they have to be stored in the government approved pot storage cabinet below the sink, otherwise they're not fit for kitchen use.</p>


<p>Want to change the color of the counter top? Sorry, no can do. Want to switch from glass bowls to stainless? Alas, you used to be able a few years ago, but nobody wants stainless anymore anyway, right? The salt <i>can</i> be put next to the stove, but it's not recommended and might change in the near future. Knives are now to be honed every Tuesday afternoon by a designated craftsman. Sure, you can postpone a few times, but eventually, you just have to live with that. Plus, there's going to be some dudes coming to inventory your pantry on a regular basis, most likely when you're in the middle of cooking something really complicated. There's no use in protesting - this is all for your own good.</p>

<p>And yes.


</p><p>Of course this is a metaphor for computers.</p>


<h3>The curious disappearance of configuration</h3>


<p>For the casual user, some of this can <i>maybe</i> be convenient - or at least not annoying. If someone who rarely uses the kitchen has decided to whip up a home cooked feast, it doesn't matter that the spices are kept strangely far from the stove: they're just happy they found them. And <i>maybe</i> there is, for the casual user, some "security" in lock-in efforts such as MacOS calling home<sup><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></sup> to check if a program is allowed to run and that web browsers automatically block certain URLs.</p>


<p>Likewise, maybe a handful of confused beginners are helped by the fact that certain system settings are extremely hard to find, or that you're supposed to put all your photos in a specific directory, or that you can't decide what partition you want to install a program on, or that some indexing service starts running when you least expect it, or that not a single application gives a crap about the few color settings you're allowed to make.</p>


<p>For the power user, such things range from nuisances to something that seriously hampers productivity and creativity.</p>


<p>It used to be that whenever I got a new computer, I spent a day or two setting it up. I selected the fonts I wanted to use, I picked the colors I liked for window decorations and GUI elements, I installed my preferred tools and utilities and I organized the desktop icons and program launchers to my liking. It took a bit of time, but it was a labor of love. In times of trouble I was, if nothing else, at least the boss of my own desktop environment.</p>


<p>I don't know of any proprietary OS where I can do that anymore. Linux is, considering what's going on with the major distributions, desktop environments and UI toolkits, seemingly heading the same way. Sure, pick your own window manager, see if we care - we've got client side decorations! Want to theme your GUI? Yeah, but not in our Snap packages you won't! Want to turn off cursor blinking? Mmmmyyeeaahhh, not too sure about that. Oh, you started a GUI file manager? Hey, enjoy the ten new folders we've littered your home directory with! They all start with capital letters: designed for typing convenience in a case sensitive file system.</p>


<p>Of course I still spend a fair amount of time setting up a Windows machine, but these days it's not the joyful experience of configuring the best fonts and nicest colors and arranging the icons on the start menu in the correct order for my muscle memory. Instead it's usually a week of swearing over removed settings and working hard to find the ones that actually remain, or trying various registry hacks to circumvent seemingly unchangeable defaults. I'm working against the system instead of with it, and someone else is trying to boss me around.</p>


<h3>A better example</h3>


<p>All of this could be different. It used to be. On my Amiga, I could configure <i>everything</i>. Apart from things like fonts and colors I could draw my own mouse pointer, tiling desktop backgrounds and icons. (Yes, the system really shipped with separate little paint programs just for pointers, desktop tiles and icons.) I could customize double click speed and key repeat rates on millisecond levels. I could even control the exact position of individual icons and the size and position of every individual directory window opened.</p>


<p>Most casual users didn't care about all that, but they didn't have to. The system came with a reasonable set of defaults and when or if they grew more proficient and wanted to change something about their daily working environment, they had the option to do so.</p>


<p>This was a great approach to users. Instead of being treated like an incompetent moron and placed in a walled garden, you were entrusted and empowered. Something as simple as drawing my own mouse pointer on the Amiga was a profound and formative experience for me. As corny as it sounds, it was as if the guys who built this amazing machine put it in my hands and said, "Hey kid, you're in charge. This computer is yours. Learn how to use it and you can make it do anything." It was a call for exploration and creativity.</p>


<p>Today, I can't even change the system font in Windows. I can select an "accent color", but most applications completely ignore it. Every program defaults to downloading into a Downloads folder and I've lost count of how many times I've changed its folder view from grouped to not grouped, only to discover it's been magically changed back the next time I browse it. Lots of settings have been removed completely while others are buried deep in strange places where a user clearly isn't really supposed to venture.</p>


<p>The problem is that there's no toggle for enabling "advanced mode". I'm just supposed to accept that I can no longer change simple things I've been able to configure for the past thirty years. Someone, somewhere just decided that all users have the same basic skill level and that the defaults are always acceptable.</p>


<h3>General purpose Instagram cameras</h3>


<p>I suppose the lack of configurability is a metaphor for personal computing in general: we're not buying our machines, we're renting them by way of bizarrely complex EULA:s for everything from the firmware to the OS and we're not supposed to be curious or creative, we're supposed to sit back and passively consume advertisements. The base level of creative computer use is no longer exploring programming or graphics or music, but photographing a meal someone else has prepared and then applying a predefined sepia filter to said photo. The base level of configuring a system is no longer picking some personal favorites among fonts and colors, but - maybe - selecting between dark and light mode.</p>


<p>
On the flip side, more and more people also need to use computers 
for actually producing stuff - not least programming all those ad 
delivery platforms and the curiously unconfigurable operating systems 
they run on. But there are also armies of innocents; office workers,
administrators, hotel clerks, librarians, teachers - those people now often 
have no choice but to strain their eyes staring at black text on bright 
white backgrounds, unable to select a font they find easier to read.
</p>

<p>Too bad they can no longer store their spices close to the stove, but hey, who cares? Let them take one for the team. We're all swimming in ad revenue and if people learn to configure things, maybe they'll suddenly realize that the presence of those ads should be configurable as well.</p>

        <div>
  
  <p><span>07 Nov 2020</span></p><p>The purpose of this serie is to review some parts of the <em>CPython</em>’s code.</p>

<p>Why ?</p>

<p>Well there are multiple reasons :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Because we can. The project is opensource and the source code is freely available here : <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">https://github.com/python/cpython</a></li>
  <li>I strongly believe that we, as developpers, can learn a lot by studying good and clean code. And I think we can safely assume that CPython’s code, which is used practicaly everywhere, meet this crietria.</li>
  <li>I also think that studying python internals can make us better python programmers, for example ever wondered why changing <em>sys.stdout</em> seems to have no effect on subprocesses ? Well at the end of this article You will know why.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will try to regulary realease articles  on random functions/modules/data strucutres/algorithms.</p>

<p>Starting today I don’t really have a plan or a timeline for future articles, I’ll just start with <em>subprocess.Popen</em> and go from there.</p>

<p>I’ll try to link PEPs, articles and disscussions whenever I can.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER : I am not a Python Core Developper, therefore a lot of claims that I’ll make here may be wrong, especially if they’re not backed by any evidence.</p>

<p>With that being said, let’s read some code !</p>

<h2 id="wait--what-the-heck-is-cpython-">Wait … What the heck is CPython ?</h2>

<p><em>CPython</em> is the official python implementation. You need to understand that there is a difference between python specification and a python implementation.</p>

<p>A simple example can be the sorting function :</p>

<p>The python specification specify that a valid implementation should offer a <code>sorted</code> function which can take a list and sort it.</p>

<p>But as you may recall from your painfull algorithms course, there are multiple sorting algorithms, so which one are being used ? Well, as a lot of things, it depends on the implementation.</p>

<p>In fact you can create your own implementation and use bubble sort if you want, not a very practical choice but you can !</p>

<p><em>CPython</em> is widely used nowadays, and a lot of its code is wrote using C, again this is an implementation detail not a specification one.</p>

<p>There are other python implementations like <em>PyPy</em> (which use JIT compilation), or <em>Jython</em> which is ran on a JVM machine.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-code">Getting the code</h2>

<p>the first step is to get the cpython code. For that we gonna just clone the official repo on github :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>git clone https://github.com/python/cpython.git</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="subprocesspopen--the-class">Subprocess.Popen : The class</h2>

<p>Please note that we won’t really analyze ALL the code of <em>Popen</em>, there are way too many options and use cases to fit in this article.</p>

<p>Instead we juste gonna try to understand what happens when you execute this line of code :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>subprocess</span><span>.</span><span>Popen</span><span>([</span><span>'ls'</span><span>,</span> <span>'-l'</span><span>])</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>We need to find a starting point, we can simply do :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>find <span>-name</span> subprocess.py 

./Lib/asyncio/subprocess.py
./Lib/subprocess.py</code></pre></figure>

<p>we can safely assume that the module we’re searching for is <code>Lib/subprocess</code>.</p>

<p>By searching for <code>Popen</code> in the file we find a class :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Popen</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>):</span>
    <span>""" Execute a child program in a new process.

    For a complete description of the arguments see the Python documentation.

    Arguments:
      args: A string, or a sequence of program arguments.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The first instruction is :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>_child_created</span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span>  <span># Set here since __del__ checks it</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>the <code>__del__</code> is basicaly a destructor method in python, this method is automatically called when the garbage collector try to free the object.</p>

<p>in CPython the garbage collector use what we call <em>reference counting</em>, this means that if you write something like this :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span> 

<span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span> <span># we affect a new list to a</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the second line we no longer have a reference to the list <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, which means that the garbage collector may delete it (or not) any time.</p>

<p>my guess, is that if you run a command like this :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>subprocess</span><span>.</span><span>Popen</span><span>([</span><span>'my command'</span><span>])</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>since you’re not referencing the Popen object, it is a <em>garbage candidate</em>, and the gc may try to delete it before it run. Which is not the excepected behaviour since you except the command to run even if you don’t care about what it’ll return.</p>

<p>What surprises me tough is the fact that it’s a class attribute, there is surely a reason behind it, but i’m not sure what.</p>

<p>After doing a <code>git blame</code>, we can see that it was actually an instance attribute before this commit <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/72e7761301febe026536e7a2a444269698dcf156">72e7761301febe026536e7a2a444269698dcf156</a>. Which refers to this issue : <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue12085">issue12085</a>.</p>

<p>And the explanation is as follow :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If subprocess.Popen is called with a keyword argument whose name is undefined or simply too many arguments, an instance of the Popen class is created but its __init__ method call fails due to the invalid argument list. (Immediately) afterwards, the new instance is destroyed and its __del__ method is called, which checks the _child_created field that is defined by __init__; but __init__ never got the chance to execute, so the field is not defined, and __del__ raises an AttributeError, which is written out to stderr.</p>

  <p>- Oleg Oshmyan (chortos) [2011]</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-__init__-method">The <code>__init__</code> method</h2>

<p>the first instruction in the init method is :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>_cleanup</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>from the comment it looks like the purpose of the function is to avoid zombie processes. one thing that i like about this function is how the autor of the except explictly explain why he passes when he catches a ValueError and why it’s okay. I see a lot of developpers using the pattern <code>try: except (some exception or just Exception) pass</code> instead of treating the error proply. This can be very risky as it may hide a real error that you wish you saw before wasting 2 days trying to debug a random issue.</p>

<p>After that we can see some basic parameters validation : like <em>is bufsize an integer</em> ?</p>

<p>This is also a very good habit to have, especialy in a dynamicaly typed language like Python.</p>

<p>your code may still work with the wrong types and give you a wrong result, as an example :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>to_upper</span><span>(</span><span>list_str</span><span>):</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>upper</span><span>()</span> <span>for</span> <span>s</span> <span>in</span> <span>list_str</span><span>]</span>

<span>to_upper</span><span>([</span><span>'aaa'</span><span>,</span> <span>'bbb'</span><span>])</span> <span># ['AAA', 'BBB']
</span><span>to_upper</span><span>(</span><span>'ab'</span><span>)</span> <span># ['A', 'B']</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As you can see altough it works, example 2 is clearly not what the user would expect.</p>

<p>You can also start to see that some code parts depends on the target plateforme (windows / POSIX), for the rest of this article, I’ll focus on the POSIX part.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>(</span><span>p2cread</span><span>,</span> <span>p2cwrite</span><span>,</span>
<span>c2pread</span><span>,</span> <span>c2pwrite</span><span>,</span>
<span>errread</span><span>,</span> <span>errwrite</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_get_handles</span><span>(</span><span>stdin</span><span>,</span> <span>stdout</span><span>,</span> <span>stderr</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>next we get the <em>file decriptors</em> related to the optional arguments stdin/stdout/stderr.</p>

<p>A file descriptor is an abstraction managed by the process, each file descriptor points to an entry in a system wide table called <em>Open file table</em>.</p>

<p>In python you can do :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"my file"</span><span>).</span><span>fileno</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This will return the file descriptor.</p>

<p>Based on the comments and common sense it looks like, we will not always need 6 file descriptors, but only if we choose to communicate with the child process (which is not our case for our example).</p>

<p>In our example it looks like : <code>c2pwrite</code> will be the fd of the output of our script (1 if stdout) and <code>p2cread</code> the fd of the input of our script (0 if stdin).</p>

<p>In the <code>_get_handles</code> function :</p>

<p>looks like the default values (if no alternative stdout/in/err) is provided) : -1.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>p2cread</span><span>,</span> <span>p2cwrite</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
<span>c2pread</span><span>,</span> <span>c2pwrite</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
<span>errread</span><span>,</span> <span>errwrite</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>

 
<span>if</span> <span>stdin</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
	<span>pass</span>

<span>if</span> <span>stdout</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
	<span>pass</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>the function seems to confirm our hypothesis :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>else</span><span>:</span>
	<span># Assuming file-like object
</span>	<span>p2cread</span> <span>=</span> <span>stdin</span><span>.</span><span>fileno</span><span>()</span>
<span>else</span><span>:</span>
	<span># Assuming file-like object
</span>	<span>c2pwrite</span> <span>=</span> <span>stdout</span><span>.</span><span>fileno</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>it does bug me how similar the stdin / stdout / stderr code is. I know if I had to write this code I will desperatly try to somehow refactore it in one block, I’m not sure tough if it will be a good idea, refactoring is not always a good thing.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"> <span># How long to resume waiting on a child after the first ^C.
</span> <span># There is no right value for this.  The purpose is to be polite
</span> <span># yet remain good for interactive users trying to exit a tool.
</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_sigint_wait_secs</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.25</span>  <span># 1/xkcd221.getRandomNumber()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I found the comment funny, for refecence this the xkcd comic that it refers to :</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/random_number.png" alt="xkcd comic"></p>

<p>next we call the function : <code>_execute_child</code> (POSIX version in our case) :</p>

<h2 id="_execute_child-function"><code>_execute_child</code> function</h2>

<p>Again some basic parameter validation.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>audit</span><span>(</span><span>"subprocess.Popen"</span><span>,</span> <span>executable</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>cwd</span><span>,</span> <span>env</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>this will send a <em>signal</em> and subsribed functions may do things accordenly (no idea what tough).</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>_USE_POSIX_SPAWN</span>

		<span>return</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>if the <code>_USE_POSIX_SPAWN</code> is true, python will try to use it to create the child process.</p>

<p>according to : <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922113430/https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris10/subprocess-136439.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20190922113430/https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris10/subprocess-136439.html </a></p>

<p><code>posix_spawn</code> will not copy the data of the parent process, which can make the script start faster for larger processes.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python">

<p>that if you are on a linux plateform and the version of <em>glibc</em> is greater than <em>2.24</em> you ll use <code>posix_spanw()</code>.</p>

<p>the 2.24 version of glibc has been released around 2016 so it’s fair to assume that if you have a recent linux distribution you ll also use <code>posix_spawn()</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to check</p>

      We need to talk.
    </p><div>

<p>Here’s a paraphrased conversation I’m having way to often, costing me way too much time, keeping me from doing things that are way more important:</p>

<pre>User: Hi, I'd like to report a bug in your application.
Me:   Great! Please open a support ticket, then.
User: But, it looks like I need to pay for that?
Me:   So?
User: I just want to tell you that your app is broken, so you can fix it.
Me:   Yes, that's a support request, please open a ticket.
User: ...
</pre>

<figure>

  </a>
  
</figure><p>
                             
                             
From there it typically derails into a whiny tirade about me being a crappy two bit developer who doesn’t give a shit about his code (which is ridiculous, since, professional pride aside, I have every incentive to fix bugs, to prevent my inbox from getting flooded) and just wants to rip off his users.</p>

<p>In the past, I sometimes gave in (when it sounded like something might be wrong). I looked at the issue and almost always found that nothing was broken, just didn’t work as expected (which is actually to be expected for every reasonably complex piece of software). The user just didn’t bother reading the docs and tried to bypass the fee by masquerading the support request as a bug report. So, nowadays my policy simply is: no support ticket, no service. Any such request goes straight to the trash folder without even being looked at.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-such-an-asshole">Why am I such an asshole?</h2>

<p>Here’s the thing: I write open source software to solve <strong>my problem</strong>. I let you use my solutions because that comes at zero cost for me (well, almost, I still have to pay for the website, you are downloading from. You are welcome, by the way). I also provide the source code, so you can fix things yourself, should my solution turn out to be unsuitable. However, once you come to me with a “bugreport” that doesn’t also include a patch (or at least very precisely pinpoints the problem), then you are basically asking me to <strong>look at your problem</strong>. At this point, it is no longer zero cost for me and that’s the reason for why I am charging you money: you are asking me to spent time on your behalf. That is commonly called <strong>work</strong>. And surprisingly enough, work is what people expect to be paid for.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m happy to help. Selling support is what keeps the lights on here (did I mention the cost of running a webserver?). But coming to me under false pretense and/or expecting that I <strong>must</strong> provide free service on top of a software I gave away without charge is not going to win you any favours.</p>

<p>It stops being free, when it starts costing me! My time is valuable. If you want a piece of it, I want money in return. Period.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Seems like this post has struck a nerve and caused a few misunderstandings. <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/reactions-bugreport-free-support/">Clarification on my position here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>Lazy loading is a very cool design pattern that is not often talked about. Many frameworks implement it without even telling us about it ðŸ˜Š. For example, .NET Entity Framework (all versions) support the pattern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what is lazy loading? The idea behind the pattern is simple. By using lazy loading, we defer the initialization of objects (heavy ones) until we need them. Thatâ€™s it.</p>



<p>Letâ€™s provide an example. We have a simple HR application. The application supports the tracking of employee records. Each record has standard fields like name, email, date of birth, and image (like a profile picture), etc.</p>



<p>The application has operations like adding employees, updating employees, searching for an employee, generating reports, etc. Do all functions need the image of the employee? Should we load images in some aggregated reports? Of course not. A picture can take a lot of resources, so it is not reasonable to load it everywhere. And here, lazy loading comes to help us.</p>



<h2>Lazy loading implementation</h2>



<p>There are several ways to implement the lazy loading pattern, but we are going to inspect the most used one (when it comes to manual implementation).</p>



<p>In the source code, the employee domain model is represented like this:</p>



<pre><div><div><p><span>public</span> <span>class</span> Employee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Name <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> Image <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> Employee<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>void</span> Load<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING ALL THE DATA.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p></div></div>

</pre>



<p>Nothing special. Just a class with three fields and a method which would load all the data. But as we said, most of the time, we do not want the Image data because it could take a lot of resources.</p>



<p>So, how do we <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/02/15/what-is-code-refactoring/">refactor</a> the class? We do It like this:</p>



<pre><div><div><p><span>public</span> <span>class</span> Employee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> image<span>;</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Name <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> Image <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>get</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>if</span> <span>(</span>image <span>==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>return</span> image<span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>else</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>return</span> image<span>;</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING ONLY NAME AND EMAIL PROPERTIES.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p></div></div>

</pre>



<p>We followed only four steps:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Extract the logic for image data load from the Load method to a new Method â€“ LoadImage;</li><li>Introduce a new private field for the image data;</li><li>Refactor the Image property to check if image data is null. If it is, the new method loads the image data, assigns it to the image field, and then return it to the consumer.</li></ol>



<p>Next time we load the object (or objects if we load a collection of them), we wonâ€™t have the overhead of loading unnecessary image data. We are going to extract the image data only when we need it (by accessing Image property).</p>



<h2><strong>ORMs</strong></h2>



<p>ORMs like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entity Framework Core</a> support lazy loading. When a query is executed, not all the properties are loaded (unless you have disabled lazy loading). Only by accessing them, another query runs to fetch the data.</p>



<p>For example, imagine we have two entities in relation: a Company entity and an Employee entity. A company has many employees. If we query for a specific company by id and we get a result, the list of its employees wonâ€™t be loaded. Only when we access them a new query will fetch the collection.</p>



<p>In some cases, this is cool in others, not ðŸ˜Š.</p>



<p>Can we implement our own lazy loading if we are using some ORM? Sure. The thing you should do is not to map properties/entities that donâ€™t need to be loaded with every query. Of course, you should provide proper methods to handle the data that is not loaded.</p>



<p>In Entity Framework, you use the [NotMapped] attribute to annotate desired properties.</p>



<p>You can read in many places that lazy loading is used when accessing network resources. That is true but not complete. You can use lazy loading also for any demanding operation, like complex computations, reading big chunks of local data, etc.</p>

  <p>Back in 2012 my wife and I started a house renovation project in Edinburgh (Scotland) having moved to that great city the previous year. In our previous London abode we’d installed a wireless lighting system from a company called Rako and it worked well enough to convince us that wireless was the way to go. Now, having installed and maintained a system with over 150 wireless lighting control circuits over the past 7 years I’ve finally had to admit that my technology choice was wrong. The Z-Wave wireless lighting system I installed just doesn’t work for a home like mine. I have now ripped out almost all of the Z-Wave units I installed – which had cost me more than £6k to buy and install. Read on to see the 10 reasons I finally kicked it out and what I have now replaced it with.</p>
<h2>My career in Wireless</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Actixlogohires-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="205" height="153" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Actixlogohires-300x224.jpg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Actixlogohires-100x75.jpg 100w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Actixlogohires.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px">Firstly let me explain that I spent most of my career in the wireless (mobile phone) industry and consider myself to have a reasonable degree of expertise in the field. The company I founded (<a href="http://www.actix.com/">http://www.actix.com</a>) has been a leading specialist in planning and optimising new wireless technologies for the past 25 years and has developed solutions for measurement and optimisation of everything from Analog to 5G.</p>
<p>Wireless technology is behind some of the most amazing developments of the last 50 years – things like the iPhone and satellite TV. So you may find it strange that I would be doubting the ability of a leading home-automation wireless technology to do something as straightforward as turning a light on and off. But unfortunately my experience has been exactly that.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Z-Wave – The system I chose in 2012</h2>
<p>Back in 2012 I asked for recommendations from the people I knew who were Home Automation pioneers – not least <a href="https://www.devicepilot.com/about">Pilgrim Beart</a> (the founder of the Hive product <a href="https://www.hivehome.com/">https://www.hivehome.com</a> now owned by BG) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Stafford-Fraser">Quentin Stafford-Fraser</a> (co-inventor of the webcam). The consensus around the time was that one of the wireless technologies already on the market would become the de-facto standard for domestic lighting control. That seemed pretty compelling as companies like <a href="https://aeotec.com/">AeoTech,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fibaro.com/en/">Fibaro</a>, Philips and LightwaveRF were already producing wireless lighting systems including (in the first two instances) control modules that could be retro-fitted into the pattress (wall-box) behind a light switch.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-14-190552.png" alt="" width="172" height="145" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-14-190552.png 172w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-14-190552-100x84.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px"><img loading="lazy" src="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-14-190703-300x210.png" alt="" width="231" height="162" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-14-190703-300x210.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-14-190703-100x70.png 100w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-14-190703.png 753w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px"></p>
<p>At that time there were essentially three main choices of wireless technology: <a href="https://www.z-wave.com/">Z-Wave</a>, <a href="https://lightwaverf.com/">LightwaveRF</a> and <a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/">ZigBee</a>. I discounted LightwaveRF as it was (still is?) very range limited and my house is an old one built almost entirely from large stone blocks (even internally) that are very good at blocking RF signals. Between Z-Wave and ZigBee there wasn’t much to choose from a wireless perspective but the decision was made for me when I looked at the manufacturer support for each technology. As mentioned above companies like AeoTech and Fibaro already had modules (devices that turn on/off or dim a circuit) on the market that I thought would be ideal for my lighting control system whereas such support for ZigBee was pretty much completely absent save a few hobbyist-level companies.</p>
<p>So I found a supplier (<a href="https://www.vesternet.com/">Vesternet</a> – who have been great by the way) and started ordering Z-Wave modules to try out. Fast-forward 18 months or so and I’d installed (with the help of a great electrician called Lorenzo) over 150 circuits with Z-Wave control. Many of the modules I installed in that period were Fibaro generation 1 dimmer and switch (relay) units. They had a few quirks but I found that if I bought the right LED lamps (mainly Philips ones) and used the balun that you can buy to compliment a Fibaro dimmer then I could get (relatively) flicker-free dimming wirelessly.</p>

Picture by Rab (Ian or Yanny) Gamble.</p></div>
<p>Since Lorenzo was replacing most of the wiring in the house I managed to get him to bring a lot of the control cables together in around five separate locations. This simplified the task of adding devices and also helped me to keep track of the actual units. To this day I have a spreadsheet with around 500 lines (around 3 lines per circuit) which details all of the lighting circuits in the house, the circuit breaker they are connected to, the type of device that controls the circuit and its location. Unfortunately I wasn’t 100% successful in getting the control point of all the lighting circuits in one of these five locations and there are actually at least three units lost in the walls somewhere which respond to Z-Wave commands but don’t seem to control anything I can find!</p>
<h2>Z-Wave Hubs</h2>
<p>Having chosen a technology and the modules to turn things on and off (or dim them) the next step is to decide on a central hub or controller as all Z-Wave networks need one of those. At the time a popular one was called <a href="https://www.vesternet.com/pages/vera-controller-comparison">Vera</a> and I initially opted for that. It had a reasonably good way of overcoming one of the problems of Z-Wave (adding a new module requires the hub and the module to be close together) which came in the form of a battery box that could power the hub while you moved it around to add modules (the AeoTech Z-Stick has a similar feature). Unfortunately Vera also had a number of downsides – a limited API to allow it to be controlled by other systems, a non-working backup system that forgot what modules had been added and a slow processor which meant adding multiple modules took a stupidly long time.</p>

<p>So began a waltz through a significant part of the available hub-landscape, taking in <a href="https://www.vesternet.com/products/z-wave-fibaro-home-center-2-system">Fibaro’s HC2 hub</a>, a Mac-based home automation app called <a href="https://www.indigodomo.com/">Indigo</a>, an open-source system called <a href="https://www.domoticz.com/">Domoticz</a> and finally <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> (recommended by Quentin who I mentioned previously – did I tell you he co-invented the web-cam – I did – but I guess that’s cool enough to be mentioned twice – right?). Each has their own strengths and weaknesses but ultimately a lot of the problems I found with any of these systems came down to issues with Z-Wave itself and while my sashays from one to another sometimes gave me the impression of progress they generally just shifted the shadows around and left the underlying issues unresolved.</p>
<p>What did prove to be significant though was the hardware on which these systems are based. The Vera and Fibaro HC2 have their own hardware platforms which are not open and this gave me quite a bit of trouble as I tried to work though the failure concentration problem that I will attempt to explicate later. The Mac-based system was good in the sense that it was based on Mac hardware which I have found to be relatively reliable. However, it was, ironically, the failure of a Mac Mini which ultimately precipitated another switch that I had been mulling due to a lack of Z-Wave diagnostics.</p>
<p>The systems I moved to (Domoticz and then Home Assistant) were based on Raspberry Pi hardware and that has resulted in quite a few more problems – SD card corruption due to brown-outs, reboots at unfortunate times due to me attempting to automate system updates and hardware failure initiated by some circuit breaker issues I experienced.</p>
<h2>Reason 1: Z-Wave Pairing</h2>
<p>The process of adding a module to a Z-Wave network is to put the hub into “include” mode and then press a button on the module while it is close to the hub. That sounds simple enough but now imagine doing this for 150 modules scattered around a house, some behind wall-plates, others in waterproof boxes, concealed in ceilings, etc.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/z-wave-protocol-hacking-300x157.png" alt="" width="300" height="157" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/z-wave-protocol-hacking-300x157.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/z-wave-protocol-hacking-100x52.png 100w, https://secureservercdn.net/160.153.137.170/onv.491.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/z-wave-protocol-hacking.png 728w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>It was quite onerous to do it once but I think I’ve probably done it on average three times for every module in the house plus quite a few more times for modules that I’ve moved around, or have failed and had to be replaced. That’s getting on for 500 include processes. And that’s just to get the module visible to the system. Once it is included you generally have to locate the specific function(s) of the module you want to use (e.g. a motion sensor might have a temperature reading, a light-level and an alarm setting in addition to the motion detection function), then you give each function a name, then you need to indicate what room it is in, then you might want to group it with other module functions (so, for instance, a mood setting in the dining room sets the light levels on five different modules via a scene or group). All of that needs to be typed in and you will generally be doing this while wandering around, so you will do it on a laptop or tablet and sometimes up a ladder or in a cupboard.</p>
<p>I have now gotten to the stage where I dread some modules failing. The one that controls a water-feature in the garden is in a sealed box, the one that controls an out-door heater is in a small loft area that can only be accessed by a rickety ladder, the one for the guest-room extractor fan is in a crawl space, etc. This can’t be the right way to do things can it?</p>
<p>When I compare this to the way IT operations used to be compared to the way dev-ops is now I think it is fair to say that we are just at the start and that things must change. It used to be normal that an IT person would have to physically sit at a computer for hour on end to install OSes, applications and security. Now it is done remotely and automatically on predominantly virtualized hardware. Furthermore, most apps are now in the cloud and the management of the servers that run them are automated to the Nth degree. Home automation and IoT have a long way to go!</p>
<h2>Reason 2: Z-Wave Healing After Adding a Module</h2>
<p>As mentioned a common challenge with Z-Wave is that introducing a new module to the network requires the module and hub to be close together. This actually creates a lot of work. There are two main ways to handle this:</p>
<ol>
<li>bring the hub to the module once it is in-situ and operating</li>
<li>power the module up when it is close to the hub and then move it later</li>
</ol>
<p>Both options are problematic if you are relying on the mesh network capabilities to extend the range of the network because the mesh works by finding routes from one module to another so that it can communicate at distance.</p>

<p>This is a tiny lesson in design I learned at Freshworks. The lesson seems obvious in hindsight, but it wasn’t so obvious when we were making the mistake.</p>



<p>So, <a href="http://www.freshdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Freshdesk</a> is used by customer support teams day in and day out. When these teams log in to Freshdesk, we show them conversations their users had sent in over email, Twitter, Facebook, etc – in one place. &nbsp;</p>



<p>These customer support teams can pick between two different views to see these conversations when reading them on Freshdesk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One view was called the <strong>card view</strong>. The card view is quite similar to how emails appear today in mobile Gmail. It was the default, and it looked like this:</p>

<p>When we got on calls with teams that used Freshdesk, we were surprised that they hadn’t discovered table view until we told them about it.</p>



<p>A person actually told us that the icon we had used to represent the table view was too small, and it appeared like a calculator and not actually a table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first time I heard it – I’ll be honest, I chuckled. Then, I went back and thought about it and felt he was totally right. We had all sorts of icons (with <strong>no</strong> supplemental text) that made no sense to our customers. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>That’s</strong>&nbsp;<strong>when I learned a design lesson that I carry in my heart till day.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone’s muscle memory recognises the icons for ‘Save’, ‘Delete’ and ‘New’ as ‘something that looks like a floppy’, ‘a bin’ or ‘a plus’, respectively. And they know what these icons convey in the apps they’re seeing them on.</p>



<p>But the products we’re building these days have more than just these universally recognized actions. Brand new icons you may be using to represent these actions aren’t part of anyone’s muscle memory (like the floppy or bin icons).&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your product has a button to let sales people change the deal stage, it cannot be just an icon. It’s got to be supplemented with text. </p>



<p>If you’re building a feature where you’re taking people to a ‘focus mode’ to do some intense work using a button, you can’t have just an icon to represent it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sure, your designers and product team might love having just icons to represent these actions to save space but your users will:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. end up rarely noticing the icon if it’s not a frequent action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. when it’s a frequent action, they’ll click on the icon,&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. realise they clicked on the wrong one,</p>



<p>4. then go on a trip to find what they actually want to click on,</p>



<p>5. then click on the right one after some retries.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>It just doesn’t work when someone says “we can just use an icon and get rid of the text to save some space in the screen.”</strong> By doing that, you’re not saving space – you’re actually causing a usability problem that your customer base will run into hundreds or thousands of times a day.</p>



<p><strong>So, here’s the bottomline:</strong></p>



<p>More often than not, content eats icons for breakfast. Any action that’s <strong>not universal</strong> like ‘save’, ‘new’ or ‘delete’ <strong>must include text.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>By doing this, you actually eliminate the thinking required by your users every time they’re trying to click on that button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have 1000 users, and on average, if one user does an action that’s represented by only an icon 10 times a day, that’s 10,000 confused and unsure clicks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ten thousand literal moments everyday when people are spending a few seconds to figure out if they’re clicking on the right button or not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eliminate those 10k*2 seconds = 5 hours by just adding relevant text to those icons 🙂</p>



<p><strong>You’re not just saving those 10 seconds, you’re saving customers from feeling stupid, which they should never feel when using your products anyway 🙂</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>I don't expect to have an ARM-based PC any time soon</h2>

	<p><small>November 15, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>The ARM-related news of the time interval is of course that Apple
has announced several ARM-based Mac laptops and that early (and
preliminary) leaks are that they perform very well and are definitely
competitive. This raises the great hope in many technical people's
minds of ARM based laptops and desktops from more than Apple, ARM
PCs that would run more than Apple's OS X. This is especially a
dream for many Unix people, who already run little or no commercial
binary software and so in theory ARM support is only a recompile
away; moving away from the x86 hegemony would please a lot of people.</p>

<p>(The practice of moving to ARM is somewhat different, especially
for performance sensitive code. Focused use of x86 assembly is
surprisingly common in various places.)</p>

<p>My own view is that while I wouldn't mind using a competitive ARM
based PC (either laptop or desktop), I don't expect to actually
have one any time soon. The rub is that 'competitive'. Right now,
the only ARM chip maker that can compete with the performance of
the x86 hegemony in the desktop/laptop space is Apple, and Apple's
machines only run OS X. While there are promising developments in
the server space, many of them are also bespoke to the large cloud
vendors, and also may not be particularly suitable for scaling down
to desktops and laptops (in all sorts of dimensions, including how
much money can be made on them).</p>

<p>Apple has demonstrated that it's possible to make ARM be competitive
(on laptops, at least, although likely on desktops too), but <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1326317293849153540">they
stand alone</a>
and I don't think it's likely for anyone else to join them. Apple has
the benefit of a gigantic market for their own ARM designs that
feeds a firehose of money into their R&amp;D budget and also good
assurance of large production runs even for laptop CPUs (never mind
phone ones). Anyone else would be in the position of trying to take
laptop and desktop CPU market share from Intel and AMD (who are
already fighting each other), without the kind of money firehose
and good market that Apple has.</p>

<p>(Apple also has the benefit of capturing all of the profit from its
laptops. An ARM CPU maker would capture much less of the profit of
machines with its CPUs in them; much of the overall profit would go
to the system vendors or at least to the makers of other parts, like
motherboards.)</p>

<p>The other problem is that merely being competitive isn't good enough,
because there are real costs to switching to ARM (even for Unix
people). It's likely that an ARM PC would need to be clearly better
than the x86 equivalent before very many people became interested,
and might face an extended period of doubt and proving itself. To
be honest, that would be my attitude toward the first generation
of ARM PCs; I would not buy immediately and let other people get
those experiences.</p>

<p>(I think this will be easier on laptops than on desktops, because
on laptops power efficiency can count for a lot. The longer battery
lifetime is already one of Apple's selling points for their new ARM
laptops)</p>

<p>PS: I would love to be wrong on this, as I'm not particularly fond
of the x86 hegemony. But I'm also a pragmatist.</p>

    <p>You’re happily working your way through a codebase when you happen upon some code that makes you stop and think: What the…!? Maybe it’s a method that’s doing something surprising. Or perhaps it’s doing something completely unsurprising, it’s just doing it in a surprising way.</p>

<p><img src="https://tekin.co.uk/images/20201113/math-lady.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="git-blame-to-the-rescue">Git blame to the rescue?</h2>

<p>When this happens you might instinctively reach for <code>git blame</code> to help you figure out what’s going on. After all, <code>git blame</code> gives you the commit that most recently touched the line, and often that’s enough to point you in the right direction. But often it isn’t and you’re none the wiser. That’s because:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>git blame is too coarse</strong>: it reports against the whole line. If the most recent change isn’t related to the part of the line you’re interested, you’re out of luck.</li>
  <li><strong>git blame is too shallow</strong>: it only reports a single change; the most recent one. The story of the particular piece of code you’re interested in may have evolved over several commits.</li>
  <li><strong>git blame is too narrow</strong>: it only considers the file you are running blame against. The code you are interested in may also appear in other files, but to get the relevant commits on those you’ll need to run blame several times.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you only use <code>git blame</code> you’re limiting yourself to a one-dimensional perspective of the code you’re trying to understand. Wouldn’t it be better to view things in 3D!?</p>

<p>Thankfully Git has some pretty powerful search tools built right in. Let’s take a closer look at some of the tools at our disposal.</p>

<h2 id="find-all-commits-containing-a-particular-piece-code">Find all commits containing a particular piece code</h2>

<p>If <code>git blame</code> is entry-level history search, <code>git log -S</code> (also known as “the pickaxe”) is how you take things to the next level. It lets you search for all commits that contain a given string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git log <span>-S</span> <span>"method_name"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will return all the commits that contain <code>method_name</code> across the entire repository, giving you a bespoke history of a piece of code across both multiple commits and files. You can use the pickaxe to examine the entire history of a particular snippet: all the places it’s been used; how it’s usage has changed; if it’s moved file; when it was first introduced, and more.</p>

<h2 id="see-the-diffs-alongside-the-commit-messages">See the diffs alongside the commit messages</h2>

<p>If you include the <code>-p</code> option (short for <code>--patch</code>) you get the full diff alongside the commit messages, giving you even more context and making it easier to spot the relevant changes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "method_name" -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="find-the-commit-that-first-added-some-code">Find the commit that first added some code</h2>

<p>Say you want to find the first commit that introduced a particular class, method or snippet of code. You can use the pickaxe combined with the <code>--reverse</code> option to get the commits in reverse-chronological order so the commit where the code first appears is listed at the top:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "method_name" -p --reverse
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="find-when-a-piece-of-code-was-deleted">Find when a piece of code was deleted</h2>

<p>Because the pickaxe search finds both additions and deletions, you can even use it to find code that has since been deleted:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "deleted code" -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Assuming the snippet no longer exists in the codebase the first commit returned will be the one where it was removed.</p>

<h2 id="limit-the-scope-of-the-search">Limit the scope of the search</h2>

<p>Because we’re using <code>git log</code> you can also provide a path to focus the search to a given file or folder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "some code" -p app/models/user.rb
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="search-deeper-with-a-regular-expression">Search deeper with a regular expression</h2>

<p>I mostly stick to the pickaxe because I find working with regular expressions cumbersome, but if you want to perform a more advanced search using a regular expression you can do so with <code>-G</code> instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -G "REGEX HERE"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s also worth noting that searching with <code>-S</code> has a subtle limitation that <code>-G</code> does not: <code>-S</code> only shows commits that either added or removed the search string. If the string you are searching for moved within the same file but was otherwise unchanged, <code>-S</code> won’t include that commit, whereas <code>-G</code> will.</p>

<h2 id="search-the-commit-messages-themselves">Search the commit messages themselves</h2>

<p>Sometimes searching for literal code is too narrow, or the information you’re after isn’t actually in the code but in the commit messages themselves. In which case you can use <code>--grep</code> to search commit messages instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log --grep "commit message search"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2>

<p>Next time some code has you puzzled and you want to understand more about it, look beyond <code>git blame</code> and dig deeper into the history using the pickaxe and friends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find the entire history of a snippet of code with <code>git log -S</code></li>
  <li>Include <code>-p</code> to see the diff as well as the commit messages</li>
  <li>Include <code>--reverse</code> to see the commit that introduced the code listed first</li>
  <li>Scope search to specific folders or files by including a path</li>
  <li>Search with a regular expression using <code>git log -G</code></li>
  <li>Search commit messages using <code>git log --grep</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

<p>Of course searching a codebase’s history will only be fruitful if the history itself is helpful. If the history hasn’t been constructed with atomic commits that have useful commit messages, searching it will likely be a frustrating and unhelpful experience.</p>

										                <p><em>A superresolution image of a group of killer T-cells (green and red) surrounding a cancer cell (blue, centre). Image: US NIH.</em></p>
<p>On World Cancer Day this year, Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, known in India for its cancer care facilities, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/exploring-new-options-in-cancer-care/article30729911.ece">announced</a> that it would study the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02161900">effects of yoga</a> on breast cancer patients. While the association between <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/features/regular-exercise-helps-patients-combat-cancer-67317">exercise and recovery</a> in cancer patients has been known since the 1990s, we know little about how this works on a molecular level.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59996">new study</a> shows that the key might lie in activating certain immune cells. The study, conducted by Randall Johnson and his team from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, and the University of Cambridge, was the culmination of three years of research on what makes exercise good for cancer patients.</p>


<p>They first established that exercise could indeed decrease the growth of tumours. They induced tumours in mice, mimicking breast cancer in humans, and separated them into two groups: one exercised on running wheels and one did not. After a few days, the tumours had shrunk in the group that exercised but not in the sedentary group.</p>
<p>When the researchers examined blood samples from the mice, two things had dramatically increased after exercise: immune cells known as CD8+ T-cells and a compound called lactic acid.</p>
<p>The team first looked into CD8+ T-cells, which <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-analysis/the-ever-expanding-t-cell-world-a-primer-31123">defend against</a> tumours and infections. Did increased levels after exercise mean that the cells were involved in reducing tumour growth? To test this, the team removed CD8+ T-cells from tumour-bearing mice and then made them exercise. This time, exercising could not shrink the tumours: removing the T-cells also removed the positive effects of exercise.</p>
<p>“Then we did what, to my mind, is the coolest experiment in the paper,” said Johnson. They made mice exercise, carefully took CD8+ T-cells from them, and transplanted the cells into another set of mice that had tumours but didn’t exercise. To the scientists’ delight, simply transplanting CD8+ T-cells from mice that had exercised could shrink tumours in sedentary mice.</p>
<p>“The T-cells themselves are coming in ‘trained,’ making them better anti-tumour T-cells,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>What was ‘training’ the T-cells, though? That’s when the team turned their attention to lactic acid. After an intense bout of exercise, lactic acid is what makes your muscles feel like they’re burning. In the bloodstream, it circulates as lactate, its ionic form.</p>
<p>To mimic this form and the levels attained after exercise, the researchers injected sodium lactate into sedentary mice that had tumours. As with the T-cells, they found that daily injections of sodium lactate could shrink tumours and improve survival in these mice.</p>
<p>The team now knew that, through exercise, both lactate and CD8+ T-cells could reduce tumour growth. But this still didn’t explain how the two effects were linked.</p>
<p>To answer this, the scientists first checked whether lactate could independently activate CD8+ T-cells – and found that it could. Next, they again injected mice with lactate, only this time they removed the CD8+ T-cells from the mice. Without the T-cells, lactate injections could no longer lessen tumour growth.</p>
<p>“This shows that it’s really the lactate affecting the T-cells and helping them achieve a better anti-tumour effect,” Johnson said.</p>
<p><ins>Also read: <a href="https://science.thewire.in/health/why-everyone-around-you-seems-to-be-getting-cancer/">Why Everyone Around You Seems to Be Getting Cancer</a></ins></p>
<p>The study fills an important gap in our understanding of how exercise and the related metabolite changes boost anti-tumour the activities of our immune cells.</p>
<p>This said, “My main concern is that people should not think that only exercise can cure cancer,” S.V. Chiplunkar, a former director of the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Mumbai, and current head of its Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy division, cautioned.</p>
<p>“A combination of immunotherapy with supervised exercise or yoga regimens may yield significant benefits, but this needs to be tested in a randomised clinical trial.” Chiplunkar wasn’t involved in the study.</p>
<p>And as with any good study, this one spawned more questions than it answered. “Future studies should address how lactate levels are modulated in cancer patients/mice models in response [to] exercise,” Rajender Motiani, an assistant professor and DBT/Wellcome Trust India fellow at the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad, said.</p>
<p>“A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0485-4">recent study</a> in elite athletes showed that lactate is utilised by a unique class of gut microbiome, enhancing endurance and performance. It would be worth examining gut microbiota changes in cancer patients in response to exercise.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s team is now working out how much exercise is needed to boost T-cell activity. For example, one question they’re asking is if one hour of intense exercise could be better than two hours of light exercise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Helene Rundqvist, the study’s lead author, has been involved in a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02522260?term=exercise&amp;cond=Breast+Cancer&amp;cntry=SE&amp;city=Stockholm&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1">clinical trial</a> assessing the effects of exercise on breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The trial is still active and expected to be completed in 2022.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Django framework for building python server applications has been around since forever and I believe that the reason for this is the speed at which you can develop apps without compromising on robustness.<br></p><p>To gauge the usefulness of any backend framework, a great litmus test is to see how easy it is to plug in a database to your application and expose the database models to the client via 4 operations - Create, Read, Update and Delete.<br></p><p>This functionality solves a big chunk of your problems, especially if you are building a product that is more front-end heavy and you want to spend as little bandwidth as possible on building your APIs.<br></p><h3><strong>What is CRUD?</strong><br></h3><p>An application server is nothing but a layer on top of a database which provides the ability for a client application to perform the following underlying operations.<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Create a new entry into a table in the database.</li><li>Read the database table entries either by fetching a list of all entries or retrieving the details of a single entry.</li><li>Update an existing entry in the database either by changing certain details or by replacing it entirely with a new one.</li><li>Delete a database table entry either by removing it from the database or by simply marking it as deleted and deactivating it.<br></li></ol><p>Django has ways of doing all of this right out of the box, but I prefer to use a framework written on top of Django called the <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/" target="_blank">Django Rest Framework</a> which makes things even simpler by providing an intuitive interface to the developers. <br></p><h3><strong>A sample CRUD application</strong><br></h3><div><p>I write all my blog posts on the apple notes app before I edit and publish them and it occurred to me that a note taking app is a great way to <a href="https://github.com/sankalpjonn/django-crud-example" target="_blank">demonstrate a CRUD application</a>. </p></div><figure id="w-node-bc04fc2d279c-87eecd11"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e0b01877436086c8beecd1a/5faf5796ca5e3a5dd77c5b41_XEHsDH39C2XuP7jH2D_R7hv6wYs8ZGIBkCij0NWiAXStAOuzeIqG61JLp52DNELlsmxqfuMj33tIE-0YsgTIIIDeskVcpRMarPKJKsNA4O2rBoMIFmgahW8Vo2J0YCLZqBsym1Mb.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>A note taking app that we will build using Django and Django Rest Framework</figcaption></figure><p>To build an application like this, we need a database table that stores a list of notes consisting of a Title, Content and the last updated timestamp. The notes are sorted according to the last updated timestamp.</p><p>To build this application we need the following functions:&nbsp;</p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>Creating a new note with an empty title and content.</li><li>Updating the newly created note with a title and content.</li><li>Reading the fields of a note.</li><li>Partially updating the note by modifying either tile or content.</li><li>Listing all the notes in the database sorted by last updated timestamp.</li><li>Deleting a note by marking it as deactivated.</li></ol><p>I&nbsp;will be going through all the steps involved in creating this application, but first let's start with the basics.</p><h3>Setting up a Django project</h3><p>There is some basic boilerplate code involved in building any Django application. Here is a summary of all the steps needed to set up the boilerplate<br>‍</p><p><em>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/07b99adf85538b5a90a0dcaa34de328c.js&lt;/p&gt;</em></p><h5><strong>Need for a virtual environment</strong></h5><p>While building any python applications, it is recommended to create a virtual environment and install all the packages you need within this environment to keep them isolated from the rest of your machine. This not only ensures prevention of conflicts but also makes it easy to deploy this application anywhere you want.</p><p>Once this virtual environment is activated, your development environment is setup.</p><h5><strong>Creating a Django project</strong></h5><p>Once the virtual environment is created and the necessary python packages are installed, the boilerplate code you need can be created by using a nifty tool called django-admin. We will use this to create a project called <em>notesapp</em>. This not only creates the project structure but also configures a default SQLite database that you can use for the application. </p><p>This database is nothing but a single file created locally with the name <em>db.sqlite3</em> and is very handy to quickly prototype your application. You can change the database settings inside <em>settings.py</em> to point it to any database. This can be done later too once the basic functionality of your application is ready and works with SQLIte.</p><p>After your Django project is created, you also have to create a new Django app which we will use to define our models and APIs. Let's call this <em>notes. </em>Make sure to add this to the INSTALLED_APPS section of your settings.py</p><h3>Creating database models</h3><p>Before writing the CRUD&nbsp;APIs, we must first create a database model on which we wish to perform the CRUD&nbsp;operations. Let us create a model called <em>Note </em>in notes/models.py.</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/d5e29080d973326be371f0d03a5d23ef.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>Before we proceed we must update the schema because a new database table needs to be created in the underlying database. This can be done by creating and running migrations</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE: https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/8234bd9ad41637718be8dca4dba04235.js&lt;/p&gt;<br>‍</p><h3>Creating the CRUD&nbsp;APIs</h3><p>Now that the model has been created, we need a way to perform CRUD operations on this model by writing as little code as possible. This is where Django Rest Framework comes in. Not only can you expose CRUD&nbsp;APIs on this model within minutes, but you also get a pretty nifty user interface to view those APIs in action. </p><p>To do this, you must first define a serializer for the database model you created in the above step. <strong>‍</strong></p><h5><strong>Defining a serializer</strong></h5><p>A serializer is responsible for two things<br></p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>To validate an incoming create/update request and reject it if the fields are not in the format that is required to create/update an entry in the database table.</li><li>To convert a database table entry into a format like JSON&nbsp;that can be transferred over the internet to the client.</li></ol><p>Let us create a serializer in notes/serializers.py as follows.</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/4d69bb0c0de94789842fe9eb23e8e882.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>Inside the Meta class, we define which database model is being serialized and what all fields within that model should be serialized. We could choose to include only certain fields from the model that we would like to expose over the API.</p><p>We can also define certain fields as <em>read_only</em> which indicates that these fields will be ignored if present in a create/update request but they will be present in the response a read request. </p><p>In this above case, is_active is responsible for indicating if a note has been deleted or not. Therefore we must not allow it to be modified via a create/update request and it should be set to false only when a delete operation is performed. This will become more clear in the upcoming steps. </p><p>We can also define fields as <em>write_only </em>which will indicate that these fields will not be present in a read response but we will allow the field to be modified in a create/update request. We can now proceed to writing the CRUD&nbsp;APIs</p><h5><strong>Defining an API&nbsp;View set</strong></h5><p>In Django, the APIs are written in views.py and each API&nbsp;that does some operation on a certain database resource is a view. In our case we will be performing multiple operations on the database model and hence what we need is a viewset. Here is how you define one in notes/views.py</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/b313384c0774ec4f1dee342ced8ccc20.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍<br>‍<br>This viewset is now capable of performing all the CRUD&nbsp;operations and it will use the NoteSerializer to determine how the data will be received and how it will be sent back to the requesting client. <br></p><p>Since a read operation could be retrieving a single note or listing all the existing notes, we need a way to handle both cases. </p><p>The <em>get_object </em>is responsible to determine how an object is retrieved. In this case we look for an <em>id </em>field in the query parameters of a a request and use that to retrieve a note. </p><p>This method is also used while making an update operation because to update a particular note we would have to first retrieve that note.</p><p>The <em>get_queryset</em> method is responsible for determining how a list operation will work. In this case we will be listing all the notes which are still active and sort them in the decreasing order of the <em>last_udpated_on</em> timestamp.</p><p>The <em>perform_delete</em> method will determine what to do when a delete operation is requested. In this case we do not want to delete the row from the database and we simply want to deactivate it. Therefore we will be setting the <em>is_active</em> field to False and saving the note.</p><h5>‍<strong>Defining the URL&nbsp;path</strong>‍</h5><p>We just have one more step to complete before we can see our APIs in action and that is to determine what URL&nbsp;path will invoke the above viewset. This can be done in notesapp/urls.py as follows.<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/902b7c23e95e3cb4ddf99f1b52bbbe52.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><div><p>‍</p><p>To explain what is going on here, we are basically saying that if the url <em>/note</em> is called, no matter what the HTTP&nbsp;method is, we will be invoking the NoteViewSet and based on what the HTTP method is we will call a particular method within this viewset.<strong>‍</strong></p></div><ol start="1" role="list"><li>A POST&nbsp;call will result in a create operation of the Note model.</li><li>A GET&nbsp;call will result in retrieving a single Note model object using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A&nbsp;PUT&nbsp;call will result in replacing an existing Note model with a new Note and the existing Note model will be fetched using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A PATCH&nbsp;call will result in modifying only a certain field inside an existing Note model instead of entirely replacing it and the existing Note model will be fetched using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A DELETE&nbsp;call will result in calling a destroy function which internally calls the <em>perform_destroy</em> method defined above in views.py.</li></ol><p>In case you haven't noticed, there is one thing missing in this url PATH and that is the ability to list all the existing Note model objects. </p><p>To solve this I&nbsp;created another URL&nbsp;path <em>/note/all </em>where I am invoking the same viewset as the above one with the difference being the GET&nbsp;call will now invoke a list method on the viewset instead of a retrieve method which means that the <em>get_queryset </em>method defined earlier will be invoked.<br></p><h3>See your APIs in action<br></h3><p>Okay enough talk, let us now run the server and view the APIs in action. You can run the Django development server using the below command and it will expose your server on the 8000 port on localhost.</p><div><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/473d335affb3426f7d5cbc1a747e4fe4.js&lt;/p&gt;</p></div><blockquote>Please do not forget to include <em>r…</em></blockquote></div></div>

<p>I am what I would call a non-famous public person. What do I mean by that? I mean that I have jobs where people publicly review my work. As a college instructor, I receive student reviews. Some of them get read internally at our school, and some of them get posted publicy. And they’re attached to my name. They’re not some product where people might just know my company or my brand. They know <em>me</em>, and they’re reviewing <em>me</em>. As an author, my books get reviewed. Some of those reviews are by editors and official reviewers internal to the publisher. Some of those reviews are by email. But most of those reviews are posted online. As a software developer and hobbyist podcaster I also get public reviews.</p>

<p>To anyone in a personalized creative field who cares deeply about their work, bad reviews hurt. It’s not just about being sensitive (although I am sensitive and that doesn’t help). It’s that when you really pour your heart into something, as I do my teaching for example, then the product is an extension of you. Nobody would deny that the way a class or a book turns out is an extension of the personality, knowledge, and ability of the teacher/author. And when the product is criticized, it’s like you are being criticized. </p>

<p>My dad, who was also a college instructor, and the producer of nine books and nine instructional videos among many other public creative ventures, had a very thin skin. He couldn’t stand me reading him a bad review. That stuck with me. This very accomplished man, couldn’t stand even a little criticism. When I get too sensitive, I try to remember how his inability to accept criticism hurt some of his products. He was much more about getting things done than doing them perfectly. If he had a little bit more of a perfectionist streak in him, he would have done even better. But maybe he would have done less…</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if I receive eighteen great reviews for a class. It’s the words of the two bad reviews that stick with me. And do you know why? <em>Because almost always there’s a kernel of truth to those reviews.</em> Does that mean we should listen to them? Well if I only listened to the bad reviews, I would never produce anything. I would just stay in bed. The fact is the people who are getting no bad reviews, are the people who are not taking the risk of putting themselves out there. So, we have to not let ourselves get so discouraged that we stop producing. And we have to remember that while we may not have served those two students well, we may have served those other eighteen students better than they would have been served in a world without us teaching them. </p>

<p>We can’t please every student or every customer. Nothing that gets watched/read by more than a few people is going to be liked by all of them. Even Mother Theresa would get a downvote on YouTube. So, if we’re serving the majority, we don’t want to let the critiques of a few steer us in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, being like my dad is dangerous too. <strong>No, the customer is not always right. But usually the customer has a point. We have to always be working to get better.</strong> Because we’re not perfect, and there’s always room for improvement. <strong>And we need to read those bad reviews to find those spaces for improvement.</strong> It doesn’t mean they’re right, but it does mean we need to think about them.</p>

<p>My dad accomplished an amazing amount. If he let those bad reviews slow him down too much, it’s very possible he would have not accomplished as much. But if he could have found a few tweaks, a few changes, to serve a few customers better, well then he could have grown through them. I want to grow, but I also don’t want to stop. So, I can’t let the reviews get me too down, but I have to read them.</p>

<p><strong>In this article, let’s learn to compute VMAF, PSNR, and SSIM using FFmpeg. While working on videos (compression or post-processing), it is common to compute objective metrics in addition to doing subjective Visual Quality testing. If you are using FFmpeg in your workflow, it is very easy to compute these metrics instead of purchasing expensive tools. </strong></p>



<p>Let’s go ahead and take a look at these metrics and how they are computed, shall we?</p>



<hr>



<h2>What is VMAF?</h2>



<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VMAF from Netflix</a></strong>&nbsp;stands for Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion, and it is a video quality metric that combines human vision modeling with machine learning. It’s become very popular as it succeeds (not fully) at automating subjective quality testing that usually requires humans to watch and score videos.</p>



<p>FFmpeg and Netflix’s VMAF are now part of every video processing and compression engineer’s toolbox. To understand how to install VMAF, please read our “<a href="https://ottverse.com/vmaf-ffmpeg-ubuntu-compilation-installation-usage-guide/">VMAF Installation</a>” article.</p>



<hr>



<h2>How to Compute VMAF using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>Let’s look at a couple of ways of computing VMAF. </p>



<p><strong>If your source and destination videos are of the same dimensions (height and width)</strong>, then you can directly compute the VMAF value using the command line below. </p>



<p>All you need to do is point FFmpeg to the location of the VMAF model file and it will do the rest. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi libvmaf="model_path=vmaf_v0.6.1.pkl":log_path=vmaf_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p><strong>However, in case the source and destination videos are not of the same resolution, then you have to ensure that the destination is brought to the same resolution as the source video before computing VMAF</strong>.</p>



<p>Here is a simple one-liner that uses the <code>filter_complex</code> to do the resolution change and then computes the VMAF value. I have used the <code>bicubic</code> filter to do the up/down scaling. </p>



<pre><code><code>bin/ffmpeg -i test_720p30.mp4 -i test_1080p30.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic[main]; [1:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,fps=fps=30/1[ref]; \</code>
<code>[main][ref]libvmaf=psnr=true:log_path=vmaflog.json:log_fmt=json" \</code>
<code>-f null -</code></code></pre>



<p>The log file that is produced by the VMAF computation is very comprehensive. It provides a frame-wise score of VMAF and its constituent metrics, along with the aggregate score (if that’s all you are looking for). </p>



<p>Here is an example of the VMAF file. </p>

<h2>What is PSNR and How Is It Calculated?</h2>



<p>From Wikipedia, </p>



<p><em><strong>Peak signal-to-noise ratio, often abbreviated&nbsp;PSNR, is an engineering term for the ratio between the maximum possible power of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(information_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signal</a>&nbsp;and the power of corrupting&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noise</a>&nbsp;that affects the fidelity of its representation.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>So, for a video, you are essentially trying to compute how much noise or pixel corruption has been introduced due to the video compression process which is essentially lossy (mainly due to Quantization). </p>



<p>The first step is to compute the Mean Squared Error or MSE. The formula is shown below where I and K represent the original and destination images respectively and <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are the height and width of the images respectively. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a34719b4f391dba26b3e8e4460b7595d62eece4" alt="{\mathit  {MSE}}={\frac  {1}{m\,n}}\sum _{{i=0}}^{{m-1}}\sum _{{j=0}}^{{n-1}}[I(i,j)-K(i,j)]^{2}" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>



<p>Once you have the MSE, you can compute the PSNR using the formula shown below. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc22801ed1232ff1231c4156b589de5c32063a8a" alt="{\begin{aligned}{\mathit  {PSNR}}&amp;=10\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({\frac  {{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}^{2}}{{\mathit  {MSE}}}}\right)\\&amp;=20\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({\frac  {{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}}{{\sqrt  {{\mathit  {MSE}}}}}}\right)\\&amp;=20\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}}\right)-10\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({{{\mathit  {MSE}}}}\right)\end{aligned}}" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>



<p>Here,&nbsp;<em>MAX<sub>I</sub></em>&nbsp;is the maximum possible pixel value of the image. When the pixels are represented using 8 bits per sample, this is 255. </p>



<h2>How to Calculate PSNR using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>You don’t have to go through all those calculations while using FFmpeg. All you need to do use the filter module <code>lavfi</code> and tell it to compute the PSNR. That’s it. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi psnr=stats_file=psnr_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p>FFmpeg will print the average PSNR on the console while the log file will contain a frame-wise list of the MSE and the PSNR for the Luma and Chroma planes (y, u, and v). An example is shown below – </p>



<pre><code>n:1 mse_avg:54.96 mse_y:72.51 mse_u:27.98 mse_v:11.74 psnr_avg:30.73 psnr_y:29.53 psnr_u:33.66 psnr_v:37.43 
 n:2 mse_avg:69.70 mse_y:93.80 mse_u:31.01 mse_v:12.02 psnr_avg:29.70 psnr_y:28.41 psnr_u:33.22 psnr_v:37.33 
 n:3 mse_avg:72.74 mse_y:98.37 mse_u:31.02 mse_v:11.96 psnr_avg:29.51 psnr_y:28.20 psnr_u:33.21 psnr_v:37.35 
 n:4 mse_avg:73.11 mse_y:98.94 mse_u:31.14 mse_v:11.76 psnr_avg:29.49 psnr_y:28.18 psnr_u:33.20 psnr_v:37.43 </code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>How to Calculate SSIM using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>Finally, let’s take a look at computing SSIM using FFmpeg. Again looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definition of SSIM</a>, </p>



<p><em><strong>The&nbsp;structural similarity&nbsp;index measure&nbsp;(SSIM) is a method for predicting the perceived quality of digital television and cinematic pictures, as well as other kinds of digital images and videos. SSIM is used for measuring the similarity between two images. The SSIM index is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_quality#Classification_of_objective_video_quality_metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full reference metric</a>; in other words, the measurement or prediction of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image quality</a>&nbsp;is based on an initial uncompressed or distortion-free image as reference.</strong></em></p>



<p>Calculating SSIM using FFmpeg is very similar to calcuating PSNR. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi ssim=stats_file=ssim_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p>The output of this command is going to look like this – </p>



<pre><code>[Parsed_ssim_0 @ 0000029c82894300] SSIM Y:0.926845 (11.357537) U:0.876798 (9.093807) V:0.860658 (8.559193) All:0.907472 (10.337287)</code></pre>



<p>And the log file will give you information on the SSIM values for each of the planes (Y, U, and V) along with the aggregate for each of the frames of the video. </p>



<pre><code> n:1 Y:0.930033 U:0.926453 V:0.913508 All:0.926682 (11.347897)
 n:2 Y:0.919140 U:0.915343 V:0.910900 All:0.917134 (10.816226)
 n:3 Y:0.922417 U:0.915795 V:0.910959 All:0.919404 (10.936853)
 n:4 Y:0.920077 U:0.916443 V:0.912994 All:0.918291 (10.877300)
 n:5 Y:0.926438 U:0.927597 V:0.917905 All:0.925209 (11.261518)
 n:6 Y:0.920619 U:0.919988 V:0.918780 All:0.920207 (10.980375)</code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>That’s it folks – now you know how to calculate three very important objective metrics for video quality evaluation — PSNR, VMAF, and SSIM. By computing all three and using them for analysis, it’s hard to be thrown off by artifacts that one metric can catch and the other can’t. </p>



<p>And like always, do spend a few minutes doing some visual testing (subjective) after you’re done with the objective scores! </p>

<p>Do you hate writing? Me too.</p>



<div><p>I am not talking about tweets or IG posts. I’m talking about 500 word long articles and essays. Most of us don’t like writing them. They take too much time and effort. </p><p>But is time really the problem? I don’t think so. We spend a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/average-daily-time-on-social-media" target="_blank">lot of time</a> on social media everyday right? Yeah time is not the problem.</p></div>



<p>So is effort the problem? Hmm let’s see. What happens when you open a blank page to write? Does anxiety kicks in? For me it does. </p>







<p>See, when I plan to write an article, usually I have a general idea about the topic I plan to write about. Though as soon as I open a blank page, my ideas start ruffling among each other making a mess. I don’t have clarity anymore. Everything starts falling apart, anxiety kicks in and …. I close the tab. Phew too much trouble for a few likes. </p>







<p>But after a few days / weeks those ideas start dying. The worst part is I see them dying without seeing the light of the day. That sucks. </p>



<p>And that’s why I try to write, and you should too.</p>



<p>Writing about a topic gives me a platform to just lay my ideas wide in the open. It’s like clearing my mental hard drive. It feels relaxing. </p>



<p>But If I just pour my random thoughts on a piece of paper that’s just writing, not <em>good</em> writing. I don’t want people to see a mishmash of ill shaped ideas, I want them to see a well ordered architecture where every part fits in. It’s not just for the sake of readers though, It’s for the ideas themselves. </p>



<p>Often about a topic, I have a range of musings. They’re like vectors, each with their own direction and magnitude. They make sense individually but to understand about the topic as a whole, all of them need to come in sync. Their rhythm has to match. That’s what good writing does. </p>



<blockquote><p>Good writing is just clear thinking expressed on paper.</p></blockquote>



<p>Writing about a topic makes me think about it from all the directions and perspectives. </p>



<p><em>What do I know about this topic?</em></p>



<p><em>Do I know enough?</em></p>



<p><em>If everything I know, correct?</em></p>



<p><em>How can I fill my gaps?</em></p>







<p>Jotting down everything I know helps me answer many of these questions. The ones still unanswered force me to research more. It’s a cycle.</p>



<p>Each draft of writing takes me one step closer to the complete and clear picture. The ultimate truth starts showing itself in the end. It’s a bliss moment.</p>



<p>The learning readers get is always a pleasant <em>byproduct</em>. </p>







<p>As one of my favorite writer <a href="https://twitter.com/Julian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Julian</a> says, </p>



<blockquote><p>The best writing is therapy that you publish for the world to learn from.</p></blockquote>







<p>After self-learning and expression, what is the next best thing writing offers?</p>



<p><strong>Relationships</strong>.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Writing online is a superpower.</p><p>Here’s a list of people who should start writing online.</p><p>1. The Niche Hobbyist</p><p>The Internet rewards people with obscure interests. Writing online will help you find other like-minded hobbyists who you wouldn’t be able to find in real-life.</p></div>— David Perell (@david_perell) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1227612675334660099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<div><p>Writing online helps you create meaningful relationships, sometimes even indirectly. When people read well written articles, they can’t stop but appreciate the coherent thinking of the writer. These artifacts demonstrate author’s expertise in the given topic and hence increase their visibility.</p><p>Internet is a great place, good content can reach thousands of people with zero marketing. </p></div>



<blockquote><p>“By making it easy for people to find you online, you’ll create a vehicle for serendipity.” – <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell">@david_perell</a></p></blockquote>



<p>This visibility can get you job offers, network of influential people, money and many other things. </p>



<div><p>I can go on and on about the benefits of putting yourself out there but it’s a moo point. You have to experience the magic yourself. When a stranger thanks you for a piece of advice or a someone asks if they can use your work, it feels great. </p><p>Not trying to brag here but even as a crappy writer myself, I have experienced the joy of someone reaching out to me to thank me for my work.

        <article>
          <section><p>Earlier this year I bought a Raspberry Pi 3 to have as an AArch64
development machine. The fastest way to get familiar with an
instruction set is to write a disassembler for it and I’ve made one
for 64-bit <span>ARM</span> in R6RS Scheme as part of
the <a href="https://github.com/weinholt/machine-code">machine-code</a> project.
The instruction set is called <span>ARM</span> A64, instructions are always 32 bits
wide and they have a neat structure which is pretty fast to decode in&nbsp;software.</p>

<p>The architecture has 31 integer registers (x0-x30). There is also a
stack pointer register and a zero register that always contains
zeroes. Both these registers are encoded as register number 31, and
it’s up to each instruction if an operand can use the stack pointer or
the zero register. The x30 register is used to store the return
address. These registers are all 64-bit registers and the lower 32
bits can be accessed using the names w0-w31. Operations that write to
the lower 32 bits also clear the upper 32 bits, just like on&nbsp;<span>AMD64</span>.</p>
<p>There are also 32 registers usable as either floating point registers
or 128-bit vector registers. As vectors they support different
arrangements that are either 64 or 128 bits in total, containing
8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit quantities. There are many
instructions that operate on multiple quantities at the same time,
which is an interesting way to speed up code. Multiple loop iterations
can be run&nbsp;simultaneously.</p>
<p>The instructions are documented in the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0487/a/arm-architecture-reference-manual-armv8-for-armv8-a-architecture-profile"><span>ARM</span> ARM for ARMv8-A</a>. I’ve
counted, not including instruction aliases, 442 instruction mnemonics
(things like <span>ADD</span>, EOR, B.EQ, etc). They are organized in what is
basically a four-level table: main encoding, instruction group, decode
group and instruction. Chapter C4 of the manual follows the same
structure. This structure is nice for fast decoding, but it’s not
strictly necessary since all encodings at the instruction level still
need to have a unique&nbsp;meaning.</p>
<p>For each instruction mnemonic there can be multiple variants that
enable the instruction to handle different types of operands. An
example of this is the <span>FMUL</span> instruction that multiples two floating
point values. In a C program it would look like <code>a = b * c</code>. In A64
assembler it might look like one of these, depending on what the
surrounding code&nbsp;does:</p>
<pre><code><span>fmul</span> <span>s0</span>, <span>s1</span>, <span>s2</span>            
<span>fmul</span> <span>d0</span>, <span>d1</span>, <span>d2</span>            
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>s, <span>v2</span>.<span>2</span>s   
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>4</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>4</span>s, <span>v2</span>.<span>4</span>s   
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>d, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>d, <span>v2</span>.<span>2</span>d   
<span>fmul</span> <span>s0</span>, <span>s1</span>, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>]       
<span>fmul</span> <span>d0</span>, <span>d1</span>, <span>v2</span>.d[<span>0</span>]
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>s, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>] 
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>4</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>4</span>s, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>]
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>d, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>d, <span>v2</span>.d[<span>0</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>That’s quite a few variants for a single mnemonic. Not all mnemonics
have this many variants, but depending on how one counts I estimate
that there are in total around 1000-2000 variants. The instruction set
designers had to fit all these variants into 32 bits, while at the
same time making space for instructions that encode relatively large
immediate operands, and not forgetting about leaving space for future
extensions. As if that wasn’t difficult enough, the instructions
should also be easy to decode with&nbsp;hardware.</p>

<p>I’ve extracted the tables from my disassembler, rendered them with
the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bit-field">bit-field package</a>, and
made them slightly interactive. If you’re reading this in a browser
you can see the encodings below. The thing to notice is that each
layer adds extra fixed bits: fields that must be a fixed 0 or 1 value.
(The last level, the instruction level, is not shown in this table).
Two encodings under the same parent always have some differences in
these fields, so that they can be separated by an instruction decoder.
Click an encoding to expand the next level of&nbsp;encodings.</p>




<p>There are many conventions in the field names. Instructions that take
register operands encode them in fields named <em>Rd</em>, <em>Rn</em> and <em>Rm</em>.
Immediate values (integers, <span>PC</span>-relative offsets, etc) are named <em>imm</em>.
Fields that change the type of operation tend to be called <em>op</em>N or
<em>opcode</em>. In general a few of the fields encode the operation (or the
size of the operation) and the rest encode the&nbsp;operands.</p>

<p>The image below shows the encoding space of the instruction set. The
<em>x</em> axis goes from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup>-1 and encodes the lower 16 bits
of the instruction space, and the <em>y</em> axis contains the upper 16 bits.
The different colors denote different decode groups, i.e. all the
encodings at the third level of the table above. (There is probably a
better&nbsp;representation).</p>
<p><img src="https://weinholt.se/articles/arm-a64-instruction-set/a64-2048-crushed.png" title="Encoding space used by ARM A64" alt="An image showing the 32-bit
  encoding space. Mostly there are horizontal thick lines of different
  colors. This shows that the higher 16 bits tend to keep similar
  instructions together, although there is some mirroring around the
  middle of the image."></p>
<p>All the dark spots are places where ARMv8 does not have any allocated
instructions, or the encoding is reserved. For many instructions there
are some fields that have reserved encodings and these are also&nbsp;dark.</p>
<p>Even if instructions are kept to the fixed 32 bit encoding there is
still plenty of room for the instruction set to&nbsp;grow.</p>

<p><span>ARM</span> A64 is a quite clean instruction set with only a few quirks here
and there in its encoding. Compared to AMD64 it has twice the amount
of registers, a clean separation of load/store instructions, clean
RISCy operands (mostly one destination register and two source
registers) and of course the register names and most mnemonics are
totally different. Both have 128-bit vector registers and 64-bit
integer registers and a 64-bit address space. They look quite similar,
except everything’s&nbsp;different.</p>

<p>The why of why people use vim has been <a href="https://dev.to/iggredible/why-i-use-vim-2f40">covered fairly extensively</a>, so I thought I would spend a little time explaining why I <em>teach</em> vim to my high school students, even in 2020.</p>



<p>It all began when I was assigned a mixed class of ninth through twelfth grade students in computer science just after the financial collapse on 2008. Well, the financial collapse first brought me to teach Intro to Programming using VB 6.0 and Windows thin clients, which was an experience unto itself (thanks in part to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker">Conficker virus</a>). That experience is worth a separate blog post and is a good part of why one of my specialties is teaching computer security.</p>



<p>So here I am with all levels of student, including AP CS A (read: AP CS Java), and obsolete Windows PCs (at least the thin clients were gone). I couldn’t install any software, wanted to teach C, had to teach Java, and had very few options (these were the days before online web based IDEs).</p>



<p>I had experience with the UNIX command line, primarily Sun Workstations, thanks to my wonderful education at <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering">UCSC</a>, so that wasn’t an issue. I had played with Linux in the 1990s to a bit of success, but hadn’t touched it for almost a decade. So I found an old Pentium 2 carcass in the the garbage outside my condo complex, installed a hard drive, and tried this new (to me) flavor of Linux called, strangely, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.</p>



<p>I quickly realized this machine could have all the students coding at one, discovered the wonder that is <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">putty.exe</a> (it doesn’t require any installation to run!) to connect the obsolete PCs to the server and soon my students were off and coding.</p>



<p>Why did I teach them vim? I wish I could say I agonized over all the options at the time and decided vim was the best pedagogical solution, but the reality of the situation was that vi was what I used in college because my father taught me vi. You see, I am lucky to have a father who worked in the industry and is even somewhat of a <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qed.html">footnote in text editor history</a>. So I taught vi (later vim) because it is what I knew. A running theme in many computer science teacher’s trials by fire… teaching something because it is what they know. I will go as far as to argue that it is more important that the teacher knows the editor, and especially the programming language, rather than assigning any importance to one correct editor or one correct language that all teachers should teach.</p>



<p>Years later, though, I still teach vim and the command line. So here is how I justify my decision, even if only to myself.</p>



<p>It just works. Every time I go to a new school, it takes time to get the software installed necessary to run IDEs. I remember walking into one school in which the AP CS A class was flailing away with Eclipse on Mac OS X because the students needed, and didn’t have, administrator access. I have an amazing tech department at my current job, but even here it took us weeks to figure out how to deploy Visual Studio Code on the student’s MacBook Airs and then we had to figure out how to deploy Python3 and Java. So there’s no confusion, I teach vim along with many IDEs and I fully believe it is my responsibility to teach multiple platforms and multiple IDEs, but the CLI and vim are always my safety net.</p>



<p>My students can program in any number of of languages on a now cloud based CLI Linux machine (thank you <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> – both of whom offer a $5/month plan – just. happy customer!). By using the CLI, I can support literally any type of computer connecting (including iPads, although the lack of a virtual esc key drives me batty as a vim user, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell-app/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en">ChromeBooks</a>). Students can connect from anywhere in the world and things just work. All of this became infinitely important in the remote and hybrid learning experience of the pandemic. And this is all possible because the students use vim.</p>



<p>I keep track of as many of my students that major in CS and a running theme is they all profusely thank me for teaching them vim and the CLI. Too many colleges start CS1 with an IDE and then throw the CS2 students into the deep end with the CLI. Not everyone is as lucky as I was in regards to having a father well versed in the CLI.</p>



<p>And yes, there are online IDEs these days, but I’ve found those to be full of their own pitfalls, privacy issues, and costs and find doing any advanced work using them to be very difficult if not impossible.</p>



<p>Also, to be clear, both nano and Emacs work quite well in the context of CLI Linux and I don’t make any claim that teachers should use vim over those equally acceptable command line text editors except for one small argument. Most people agree, computer security pretty much requires knowledge of the command line and a text editor. I always tell my students that the one editor they are likely to find already installed on a machine is vim and it is a bad day when you have to install another editor. Maybe just an issue for students interested in ethical penetration testing…</p>

<p>In 2007, just after his cancer diagnosis, Carnegie Mellon professor Randy Pausch gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTugjssqOT0">a well received lecture on Time Management</a>. These are my notes (<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Randy/RandyPauschTimeManagement2007.pdf">slides here</a>, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/time-management-by-randy-pausch">transcript here</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Side note - he is better known for his Last Lecture on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">Achieving Your Childhood Dreams</a> - ironically given <em>before</em> this Time Management talk.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We are very good at dealing with money, but very bad at dealing with time. Having an idea of how much your time costs helps you start making tradeoffs better.</li>
    <li>We have to manage our time better than we manage our money. We have money budgets, what about time budgets?</li>
    <li>We are in a "Time Famine" - nobody says they have "too much time". Yet The typical office worker wastes almost 2 hrs a day at work, and 28 hours a week on TV. This isn't just a one-off problem - you can't solve it one week and then go back to normal - it's systemic and requries change in fundamental processes to address this once and for all.</li>
    <li>The goal is to have fun, be happier, lead a more meaningful life. If you're not going to have fun, why do it?</li>
    <li>Being successful doesn't make you manage your time well. Managing your time well does make you successful.</li>
    <li>Turn money into time - Hire someone to do chores. Esp if you have kids.</li>

      <p>He often uses humor - noting the optimistic side of his very grim situation, giving some relief to his audience while also reminding them of the importance of his message.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>He is also extremely respectful - being humble to specific members of the audience ("Gabe is REALLY in good shape", "I am NOT smarter than Jim Calhoun", "Am I giving a talk with Alf Weaver in the audience?"), as well as the venue/general audience itself ("there aren't many better PhD programs in history than this one").</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>He brings in personal stories and examples, often involving his wife, and they are usually relatable and funny. His slides use photos from his own life living the things he talks about.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The anecdotes also inject some variety - 40 minutes in he breaks for a tangent about his dog and a tiny debate he had with his wife.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Vocal variation - 53 minutes in he screams "PUT THE CIGARETTE OUT MOM" and that is a nice spike in decibels.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Ending is really good: He ends with actionable things to do, and a nice reminder of why this is important:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"If I haven't changed anything, then we still had a pleasant hour together. If you have changed things, then you'll probably have a lot more time to spend with the ones you love. And that's important, time is all we have. And you may find one day, you have less than you think."</p>

November 14, 2020 | https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-i-read | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-i-read">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I try to read a lot, though I'm not nearly as voracious a reader as people who have a reputation for it. I have no idea how Marc Andreessen or Patrick Collison read as much as they do, especially given the enormous demands on their time. The most plausible explanation is that they're aliens with ungodly information processing abilities. I'm human, so I shoot for 40 pages every day, and fail maybe a third of the time. That works out to about 10,000 pages or ~20 books every year. </p><p>Reading twenty books a year gets you a lot. Consider: one book gives you more knowledge about a subject than almost every other person on the planet, because people don't read. Two books on the same subject give you more knowledge than almost any reader, because people don't read two books about the same thing. How many people who read The Power Broker went on to read a second book about Robert Moses? I'd wager not many.</p><p>Beyond two books on a subject, there is a long utility dip. People who bothered to read more than two books about Robert Moses, are either obsessed with him or study him for a living, which means they've read much, much more about him. So two books on a subject, at least with respect to competitive edge, is an inflection point. After you read two, you get diminishing returns.</p><p>There is a way to get around this limitation. A single book is a pinhole view of the world set up by the author. You have no input into its contents, and therefore cannot change the orientation of this view. But you do choose the books you select. That means you can stitch together multiple pinhole views into a unique lens to examine the world— one that no one else will have unless they use the same list of books to stitch together the same lens. </p><p>For example, you can look at the world through history of technology that became ubiquitous. Here is one possible list of books to stitch together this lens: <a href="https://amzn.to/36fB6Vb">The Victorian Internet</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2GHE8Jh">Empires of Light</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ua2P49">The Wright Brothers</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/38pdoIY">The Network</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3n3SeEf">Hackers</a>. Very few people in the world read all five of these books. Even within Silicon Valley, where everyone's living depends on creating new ubiquitous technology, your understanding of how technology becomes ubiquitous will be in the 95th percentile (and likely higher) if you read these five. You will now be armed with a unique instrument that few others possess, and assuming twenty books per year, it only took you three months to acquire.</p><p>Another example is to look at American history and the dynamics of failure by studying biographies of U.S. presidents who sought reelection and lost. There were ten: John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren, Benjamin Harrison, William H. Taft, Herbert Hoover, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and now Donald J. Trump. It may be difficult to stomach ten presidential biographies in a row, but it's doable to read five. That's enough to pick up a new lens. Another three months; another sophisticated instrument to examine the world at your disposal.</p><p>I settled on clusters of five and almost never read a single book in isolation. Less than five feel lacking; more than five gets repetitive. Every cluster has a goal of the form "study <code>X</code> through <code>Y</code>". Study American history through technological expansion, or study failure through one term presidents are just a few examples. I try to be creative and make <code>Y</code> unusual. For instance, everyone likes to read about presidents who are believed to be successful. A simple trick is to inverse it and read about unsuccessful ones instead. Or skip the presidents altogether, and read about vice presidents. It doesn't matter what <code>Y</code> is because you're trying to study <code>X</code>, and it's more fun to make <code>Y</code> unusual.</p><p>I don't bother diversifying books within a cluster by time period, cultural or linguistic background of the author, or anything like that. I simply try and find the best books on the subject. Sometimes they turn out to be diverse along some axes; other times they're homogenous. I never read forewords or prefaces and always finish every book in a cluster. I prefer paper to digital, and used books to new ones. I never take notes or, god forbid, create flashcards. My goal is to suck the juice out of a book, not to hold on to pieces of the carcass. If I ever need to remember a specific detail, it's always waiting for me on the shelf.</p><p>This system gives me four new instruments per year, each capable of inspecting the world in a different way. Rather than pick the instruments at random I try to be strategic and collect them into a mental lab. I visualize the lab as a room with multiple stations. Each station has a collection of related instruments on it. When I'm faced with a problem I can go to the right station and examine the problem through the instruments available on that station. All this is physically materialized on my bookshelf. Some day when I become less mobile, I plan to dedicate a literal room to it.</p><p>I don't maintain lists of books I want to read, and don't plan a sequence of instruments to acquire in advance. Once I'm done reading a cluster of books, I ask myself: <em>what instrument can I add to double the utility of my lab</em>? Another way to phrase this question is "what is the most important subject that I know the least about?" It's easy to think of many possible answers to this question; I then pick the answer that seems the most interesting, construct a new cluster of five books, and recurse.</p><p>Four instruments per year may not seem like much, but consider: in five years you will have about twenty mental instruments, all of which interrelate and reinforce each other. In ten years you will have an impressive lab of forty instruments. And it will be unique— no other mental lab on the planet will be able to inspect the world in the way that yours can.</p><p>Because the instruments are constructed from books, they are endlessly upgradeable. Sometimes you might choose to upgrade an existing instrument to increase its power and get higher resolution, rather than acquire a new one. You can do that one book at a time. To use the examples above, you can read another book about ubiquitous technology, or another book about a one term president.</p><p>If you organize your reading this way, your bookshelf won't be arranged by genre like a typical bookstore. Rather than having sections for e.g. biographies, essays, novels, military history, all sorted by author, you will instead have sections for addressing different problems, likely sorted by clusters of books in order that you encountered them. The arrangement won't make sense to anyone except you. But you'll be able to find what you need instantaneously, and your capacity to examine the world from different perspectives will dramatically increase.</p><p>Waiting five, ten, fifteen years to build a mental lab may seem like an impossibly long time. But you don’t have to wait. It’s a pleasure to read about the Wright brothers, or proliferation of the telegraph, or early computer culture! And in a measly three months you’ll have acquired a fresh way of looking at the world. Already you will be a different person. Then you keep going, and keep looking for new instruments to double the utility of existing ones. And in one year? You will look back at today’s version of yourself and find it unrecognizable.</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Read ~40 pages/day, assume 30% failure rate. That's 10k pages and ~20 books annually. Pick a problem, and read clusters of five books to study that problem from a unique perspective. Visualize each cluster as an instrument to inspect the world. Collect instruments into a mental lab, with various stations for related instruments. You can upgrade the instruments one book at a time. Have your bookshelf reflect this mental image. Win the decade, not the day. Start now and never stop.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Governments are back on their anti-encryption bullshit again.</p>



<p>Between the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/">U.S. Senate’s “EARN IT” Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">E.U.’s slew of anti-encryption proposals</a>, and <a href="https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/">Australia’s new anti-encryption law</a>, it’s become clear that the authoritarians in office view online privacy as a threat to their existence.</p>



<p>Normally, when the governments increase their anti-privacy sabre-rattling, technologists start talking more loudly about Tor, Signal, and other privacy technologies (usually only to be drowned out by paranoid people who think Tor and Signal are government backdoors or something stupid; conspiracy theories ruin everything!).</p>



<p><strong>I’m not going to do that.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, I’m going to show you how to add end-to-end encryption to any communication software you’re developing. (Hopefully, I’ll avoid making <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/">any bizarre design decisions</a> along the way.)</p>



<p>But first, some important disclaimers:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Yes, you should absolutely do this.</strong> I don’t care how banal your thing is; if you expect people to use it to communicate with each other, you should make it so that you can never decrypt their communications.</li><li>You should absolutely NOT bill the thing you’re developing as an <em>alternative</em> to Signal or WhatsApp.</li><li>The goal of doing this is to increase the amount of end-to-end encryption deployed on the Internet that the service operator cannot decrypt (even if compelled by court order) and make E2EE normalized. The goal is NOT to compete with highly specialized and peer-reviewed privacy technology.</li><li>I am not a lawyer, I’m some furry who works in cryptography. The contents of this blog post is not legal advice, nor is it endorsed by any company or organization. Ask the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> for legal questions.</li></ol>



<p>The organization of this blog post is as follows: First, I’ll explain <a href="#symmetric-key-encryption">how to encrypt and decrypt data between users</a>, assuming you have a key. Next, I’ll explain <a href="#key-agreement">how to build an authenticated key exchange</a> and <a href="#session-key-management">a ratcheting protocol to determine the keys used in the first step</a>. Afterwards, I’ll explore <a href="#identity-key-management">techniques for binding authentication keys to identities and managing trust</a>. Finally, I’ll discuss <a href="#backdoor-resistance">strategies for making it impractical to ever backdoor your software (and impossible to silently backdoor it)</a>, just to piss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the creeps and tyrants of the world</a> off even more.</p>



<p>You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing.</p>







<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>



<h3 id="choosing-a-cryptography-library">Choosing a Cryptography Library</h3>



<p>In the examples contained on this page, I will be using the <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">Sodium cryptography library</a>. Specifically, my example code will be written with the <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus">Sodium-Plus</a> library for JavaScript, since it strikes a good balance between performance and being cross-platform.</p>


<pre title="">const { SodiumPlus } = require('sodium-plus');

(async function() {
     // Select a backend automatically
     const sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();
     
     // Do other stuff here

<p>Libsodium is <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html">generally the correct choice for developing cryptography features in software</a>, and is available in most programming languages,</p>



<p>If you’re prone to choose a different library, you should consult your cryptographer (and yes, you should have one on your payroll if you’re doing things different) about your design choices.</p>



<h3>Threat Modelling</h3>



<p>Remember above when I said, “You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing”?</p>



<p>How far you go in implementing the steps outlined on this blog post should be informed by <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">a threat model</a>, not an ad hoc judgment.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re encrypting user data and storing it in the cloud, you probably want to pass <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/">the Mud Puddle Test</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.<br>2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but<em>&nbsp;won’t for the life of you&nbsp;</em>be able to&nbsp;recall your device passwords or keys.<br>3. Now try to get your cloud data back.</p><p>Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way around your provider’s internal policy checks.</p></div><cite>Matthew Green describes the Mud Puddle Test, which Apple products <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">definitely don’t pass</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you must fail the Mud Puddle Test for your users, make sure you’re clear and transparent about this in the documentation for your product or service.</p>







<h2 id="symmetric-key-encryption">I. Symmetric-Key Encryption</h2>



<p>The easiest piece of this puzzle is to encrypt data in transit between both ends (thus, satisfying the loosest definition of end-to-end encryption).</p>



<p>At this layer, you already have some kind of symmetric key to use for encrypting data before you send it, and for decrypting it as you receive it.</p>



<p>For example, the following code will encrypt/decrypt strings and return hexadecimal strings with a version prefix.</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v1";

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Under-the-hood, this is using <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-xchacha20poly1305">XChaCha20-Poly1305</a>, which is less sensitive to timing leaks than AES-GCM. However, like AES-GCM, this encryption mode doesn’t provide <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">message- or key-commitment</a>.</p>



<p>If you want key commitment, you should derive two keys from <code>$key</code> using a KDF based on hash functions: One for actual encryption, and the other <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153">as a key commitment value</a>.</p>



<p>If you want message commitment, you can use AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 or XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b-MAC.</p>



<p>If you want both, ask <a href="https://mumble.net/~campbell/">Taylor Campbell</a> about his BLAKE3-based design.</p>



<p>A modified version of the above code with key-commitment might look like this:</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v2";

/**
 * Derive an encryption key and a commitment hash.
 * @param {CryptographyKey} key
 * @param {Uint8Array} nonce
 * @returns {{encKey: CryptographyKey, commitment: Uint8Array}}
 */
async function deriveKeys(key, nonce) {
    const encKey = new CryptographyKey(await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x01].append(nonce)),
        key
    ));
    const commitment = await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x02].append(nonce)),
        key
    );
    return {encKey, commitment};
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(commitment) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(114));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const storedCommitment = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50, 114));
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);
    if (!(await sodium.sodium_memcmp(storedCommitment, commitment))) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect commitment value");
    }
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Another design choice you might make is to encode ciphertext with base64 instead of hexadecimal. That doesn’t significantly alter the design here, but it does mean your decoding logic has to accommodate this.</p>



<p>You SHOULD version your ciphertexts, and include this in the AAD provided to your AEAD encryption mode. I used “v1” and “v2” as a version string above, but you can use your software name for that too.</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistance could <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/12/oneill-rpt-amr/">cost the world $100 trillion by 2050</a>, and approximately kills 700,000 per year. Some in the scientific community say it could be as bad as cancer. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as one of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768623/">principal public health problems</a> of the 21st century. The World Health Organisation published <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-02-2017-who-publishes-list-of-bacteria-for-which-new-antibiotics-are-urgently-needed">a list of bacteria of which new antibiotics are urgently needed</a>, and superbug “Staph” was Priority high. It’s a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25498-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-now-a-global-epidemic/">global epidemic</a>.</p>



<p>We should be rational optimists, as Matt Ridley explains with evidence in his book. Through science and technology the world gets better via our collective brain.</p>



<p><a href="https://botanixpharma.com/">Botanix Pharmaceuticals</a> (Botanix) has made a scientific breakthrough. In September 2020, Botanix proved its product&nbsp; BTX 1801 kills superbug Staph (aka MRSA or golden Staph) without allowing resistance to develop. <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20200908/pdf/44mf662gw8dbkd.pdf">It was done in human skin</a>. This product is designed for Surgical Site Infections (SSI) which costs hospitals US$10 billion per year. The Phase 2a study is due in Q4 2020. They did this a year after they <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20190801/pdf/4473szphv8b084.pdf">raised US$40 million at a valuation of US$198 million</a>.</p>



<p>There was already evidence Cannabidiol (CBD) was antibacterial, which is used in the product. This new data supports bigger studies for a potential new antibiotic. There is a big need for new antibiotics due to antibiotic resistance. The problem is that it is very hard to make these scientific breakthroughs. Botanix has made a breakthrough for the world, and the data will be used by other scientists to save lives. Botanix also has a cash runway to take its clinical pipeline to December 2021 (excluding FDA approved Phase 3 Acne).</p>



<p>There are <a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/hospital-infection-control/surgical-site-infections/">approximately 27 million</a> surgical procedures in the U.S per year. Approximately 5% get infected, which leads to 1.35 million SSI’s per year in the U.S. Occurrence of SSI is estimated to increase hospital stay by 7 to 10 days and add over <a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/hospital-infection-control/surgical-site-infections/">$3,000 in costs of care</a>. Globally, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5435b2b9e4b0e1fd29fa9d26/t/5aa2b3374192023932fb6690/1520612157567/Surgical%26AnaesthesiaDataReport.pdf">there are approximately 313 million</a> surgical procedures per year. If 5% of surgical procedures lead to infections, that’s 15.6 million SSI’s globally.</p>



<p>In the U.S there are 1.35 million SSI’s per year, multiply that by $3,000 costs, and it equals $4 billion. SSI’s cost U.S hospitals $4 billion per year. If BTX 1801 is priced at $100, that equals $135 million yearly revenue in the U.S – a huge drop in hospital costs. Presume the product will last 10 years, and that equals $1.3 billion in revenue. Globally, potential annual revenue could be $1.5 billion (SSI’s multiplied by the $100 price).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep in mind that this is 1 of 3 products in the Botanix clinical pipeline. Pending studies are FDA approved <a href="http://marksita.com/botanix-pharmaceuticals">Phase 3 Acne</a> and Phase 2 Rosacea.</p>



<p>A recent study found it costs on average <a href="https://amr.solutions/2020/03/06/what-does-an-antibiotic-cost-to-develop-what-is-it-worth-how-to-afford-it/">$1.3 billion to get a new drug approved</a>. By using synthetic Cannabidiol, Botanix is able to make significantly better drugs. Botanix has a competitive advantage, and the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/fast-track">FDA Fast Track Status</a> application (due to the <a href="https://smallcaps.com.au/botanix-pharmaceuticals-receives-fda-grant-antibacterial-product-btx-1801/">FDA Qualified Infectious Disease Product</a> status) will make it stronger.</p>



<p>Antibiotics is the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rearvision/antibiotics-dilemma-running-out-of-drugs-to-treat-superbugs/7281438">$40 billion drug market</a> that no company wants a part of. <strong>Until now.</strong></p>

Essentially this was the CRISPR Nobel Prize. If enough of CRISPR has already come so that it is worthy of a Nobel Prize I can’t imagine there is much place to go from here.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span id="docs-internal-guid-4bf038d4-7fff-ec28-e41c-6ded5276f0c8"><p dir="ltr"><span>Modifying the genome of organisms has always been of great interest to scientists. Adding or removing genes allows us to understand how things work and allows us to create microorganisms, plants or animals(humans are animals right?) that have traits never seen before. Knowingly modifying the genome of organisms has been done since people understood breeding. Inserting specific DNA elements began in the 1970s but it wasn’t very targeted and was mostly just inserting genes into random places in genomes. It wasn’t until the 1990s that people started to be able to do targeted genome modifications.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Targeted genome modifications allow highly specific and accurate changes to an organism’s DNA. The co-opting of the cellular mechanism of homologous recombination is the backbone of all modern genome editing technologies including Zinc Finger Nucleases(ZFNs), Transcription activator-like effector nuclease(TALENs) and Clustered regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats(CRISPR). Both ZFNs and TALENs are mostly synthetic, i.e. they contain a portion that can be engineered to target DNA and a synthetically attached nuclease that will cleave DNA to initiate recombination and gene editing. CRISPR is almost completely natural which makes one wonder how there are so many patents on it’s use, yikes. </span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>CRISPR can modify most any living cell but so can ZFNs, TALENs and other technologies. So why then was CRISPR </span><span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2014/12/04/170211/who-owns-the-biggest-biotech-discovery-of-the-century/">heralded as the discovery of the century</a></span><span> by the MIT Tech Review? Simply, CRISPR is just easier to use because it uses nucleic acid targeting. That makes it cost less and take less time to produce genetic modifications.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>So what has CRISPR made possible? Not much really. Most everything done with CRISPR can be done with one of these other technologies albeit these others are slower and more expensive. CRISPR allows the scaling of genetic engineering so that time and money are much less of a factor. It is the cloud computing of biology at least in my mind.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Despite claims by scientists and pharma companies there is little chance CRISPR will ever be widely used in the clinic to directly treat disease. That is because it suffers from all the same faults as its predecessors and maybe even more so. Gene editing has low efficiency in adult animals(yes humans are animals) no matter the technique used. For instance, if you have a disease that affects the brain you can probably only modify &lt;1% of cells even using the best delivery techniques available.&nbsp;Really, the only way to get rid of genetically inherited diseases using gene editing is by modifying embryos.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Misleading as it has been CRISPR can’t actually make specific changes to a gene easily in an adult animal. That is because it requires what is called a donor template, basically just a DNA template that cells can use to create the genome modifications. There is no efficient way to use donor templates in an adult animal so all genome edits would need to be gene knock-outs only i.e. you can only use CRISPR to destroy bad genes not modify them to make them good genes. As you can imagine this is very limited in scope when it comes to diseases that can and should be reasonably targeted using genome editing.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>To date all human clinical trials involve gene editing technology whether CRISPR or otherwise have failed to show any change in the disease condition. I don’t see this as likely to change. While there might be a disease that can be helped despite the low efficiency of CRISPR chances are that normal gene therapy, that doesn’t edit the genome, will be easier and more successful. There are very few diseases that would require genome editing as opposed to just adding an extra copy of the gene to cells like gene therapy does. It’s not all just conjecture either, just recently in August 2020 the pharma giant Abbvie ended a partnership it had with Editas, one of the major CRISPR players. Apparently, I’m not the only one who sees CRISPR's future in the clinic as limited.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>So what applications are left for CRISPR besides contributing to research? Some people are betting on diagnostics, using CRISPR’s ability to target specific sequences of DNA. While this seems reasonable it is unlikely that tried and true methods for DNA detection that use PCR will ever be significantly deplatformed. After that we are scraping the bottom of the bowl of guac.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>I have been around CRISPR since near the beginning. The only thing that has remained constant is the hype. Even that has been fading. While it is hard to measure hype Google Trends indicates that for 2020 the topic and search term CRISPR is on track to be the lowest searched since 2016. We now know that CRISPR gene drives don’t really work. No success for CRISPR in the clinic. CRISPR has already been used to edit human embryos. Really, the only thing keeping CRISPR hype alive is probably the MIT Tech Review. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>In 2006, RNAi gene silencing was given the Nobel Prize. MIT called it the </span><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2003/rnai-0108"><span>breakthrough of the decade</span></a><span>. I remember everyone being so excited about it! It was the hot topic at conferences and even my graduate school interviews. While RNAi was and always has been a great benefit to researchers its actual application has been extremely limited. It’s taken 13 years from the RNAi Nobel Prize to bring something to the clinic and even then the two drugs have been a bit underwhelming. According to Google Scholar, papers even mentioning RNAi have been on the decline for the past 6 years. The drug approved in the past few years haven't even slowed the decline.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>I am sure people will continue to use CRISPR for years to come but I hate to break it to you CRISPR is dead.</span></p><br></span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="divbodyholder">  <div id="divbody"> <div> <h3> Why Twitter can't agree on a simple math equation </h3> <p> November 14, 2020 — Chris Foster </p> <p>I cam across this tweet this morning, followed by the replies of approximately 9.7 thousand people arguing over what the correct answer actually is.</p> <!-- Content Breaker --> <blockquote width="400"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">how smart are my oomfs <a href="https://t.co/YVxtzhNx4c">pic.twitter.com/YVxtzhNx4c</a></p>— dev ᴺᴹ ᴬᴳ (@iambuterastann) <a href="https://twitter.com/iambuterastann/status/1327101241390886915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  <p>The complete and total conviction in the replies is notable. I’ve seen the same thing on Facebook and I often get caught up with the verocity that people argue with each other. The trick is usually the same, but in this specific case users come mostly to two answers: \(1\) and \(9\). Which is right? The answer is that they <strong>both are</strong>! Read on for why.</p>  <p>As mentioned, there are roughly two categories of answers: \(1\) and \(9\). There’s also some weird ones, like \(0\) being another common one, but these are primarily arithmetic mistakes. First, let’s focus on how someone would arrive at \(9\).</p> <p>Remember PEMDAS? You may have also learned it as BEDMAS. This is a rule taught that helps you remember the order of operations for algebraic notation. We follow this order: <strong>P</strong>arentheses, <strong>e</strong>xponents, <strong>m</strong>ultiplication / <strong>d</strong>ivision, and then <strong>a</strong>ddition / <strong>s</strong>ubtraction. You do each of these steps from left to right. Note that multiplication / division as well as addition / subtraction happen at the same time, rather than multiplication <em>followed by</em> division for example (ironically that leads to a valid answer for invalid reasons and further fuels argument).</p> <p>If you strictly follow PEMDAS you get this result:</p><p> \[6 \div 2(1 + 2) \\ 6 \div 2(3) \\ 6 \div 2 \times 3 \\ 9\] </p><p>Did you see what happened in that second step? Let’s re-look:</p><p> \[6 \div 2(3) \\ 6 \div 2 \times 3\] </p><p>Keep that in mind as we look at what the second category of users, those who concluded the answer is \(1\), are doing:</p><p> \[6 \div 2(1 + 2)\\ 6 \div 2(3)\\ 6 \div 6\\ 1\] </p><p>Did you see the difference? Users who conclude \(1\) multiplied \(2\) and \(3\) together <strong>before</strong> evaluating the multiplication and division left-to-right. You might think “that’s not following PEMDAS!” and you would be right. So why are they doing this?</p> <p>The notation \(2(3)\) can be called an <em><a href="https://www.themathdoctors.org/order-of-operations-implicit-multiplication/">implicit multiplication by juxtaposition</a></em>. It’s <em>implicit</em> because there is no actual multiplication symbol, and it’s understood to be multiplication with the brackets because it’s <em>juxtaposed</em> (“close to”) with them.</p> <p>In some notations it is a common convention to treat these implied multiplications as <em>higher priority</em> than other multiplications. For example you might see authors write things like \(\frac{x}{2(3x + y)}\) as \(x \div 2(3x + y)\), which is different than \(x \div 2 \times (3x + y)\).</p>  <p>So who is correct? A math expression must have only one real answer right? The point of math is it is supposed to be true and inarguable, right?</p> <p>That’s all fair, but “math” is different than “math notation”. Mathematics models real relationships in our physical world, but the things we write down are just an agreed upon language for communicating it.</p> <p>For example, if there is a four legged creature with a cute nose right in front of me:</p> <p><img src="https://fosterelli.co/image/why-twitter-cant-agree-on-a-simple-math-equation/dog.jpg" alt="A cute dog doing some math"></p> <p>and I tell you that I see <em>a dog</em>, you know what I mean. But if I only spoke Spanish and I called it <em>un perro</em>, you may not know what I meant. That doesn’t change the inarguable fact that there is a furry four legged creature in front of me, but you might only understand what I’m trying to communicate if we’re speaking the same notation.</p> <p>There’s lots of examples of this in math. Take something as simple as \(\times\). It should always mean multiplication right? Well, in vector algebra, everyone agreed that \(\times\) actually means something called the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product#Definition">cross product</a></em> of two vectors, denoted by the formula \(a \times b = \left\| a \right\| \left\| b \right\| \sin(\theta) n\) or to demonstrate visually:</p> <p><img src="https://fosterelli.co/image/why-twitter-cant-agree-on-a-simple-math-equation/vector.png" alt="A visual example of the cross product"></p> <p>There is some overlapping intuition, but this obviously looks and feels nothing like arithmetic multiplication, which is a series of repeated additions. However that’s what we decided to use \(\times\) for when talking about vectors. There are many examples of overlapping notation in math. As long as we agree and can communicate mathematical ideas, the notation isn’t really important.</p> <p>So what users really disagree about is <em>how to read this equation</em>. Does the author who wrote this equation mean \(6 \div 2 \times (1 + 2)\) or do they mean \(6 \div (2 \times (1 + 2))\)? If this was in a textbook, or part of a larger series of equations, it would be clear from the context. With only this single equation to go on, it’s actually unclear what the author intended. Both interpretations are valid.</p>  <p>Of course the vagueness is deliberate in this case. It gets everyone on social media riled up as they think <em>obviously</em> their understanding is correct and <em>obviously</em> the other person is wrong. <em>Didn’t they take 5th grade math?!</em> But really – both groups are making reasonable interpretations and the equation itself is poorly written. If you were to give someone an equation with no other context at all, you should <em>always</em> use appropriate brackets to make it clear what you are communicating.</p> <p>For more fun, you can see that even calculators themselves will differ on how to interpret this question. Some calculators process input left-to-right, some follow PEMDAS, and others will follow PEMDAS while giving implicit multiplication by juxtaposition a higher priority.</p> <blockquote data-conversation="none" width="400"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Different calculators give different answers - it depends on the choices made by the people making them. In the last pic it automatically added parentheses when giving the answer, it’s just down to convention chosen: <a href="https://t.co/DB9J9j2zTx">pic.twitter.com/DB9J9j2zTx</a></p>— Dave (@DavePunFun) <a href="https://twitter.com/DavePunFun/status/1327327770750271488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  <p>The real solution is to make this a more official rule that standard education teaches. Right now this is something that students in later education mostly learn by convention – which leads to a lot of confusion when people clearly interpret it differently but have a hard time explaining <em>why</em>. Textbooks can also be awful as they might explain PEMDAS and then give the implicit multiplication priority with no explicit mention of how that works.</p> <p>Anyway, I see something similar on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter every few months and I thought it was worth writing up a beginner-friendly explanation that I can reference later. Hopefully it was helpful to you too!</p>  </div>  </div> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Most programming languages barely differ from each other apart from superficial syntax differences, but not Idris. Idris, having a type system supporting dependent types and other innovative ideas, opens up a host of possibilities few other language provides.</p>

<p>When we want to ensure that a piece of code works as intended the usual tool we use is testing. Testing provides plenty of benefits, but wouldn’t you prefer to encode your tests right in the type signature and let the compiler decide if your code is correct given those constraints? With Idris you can do exactly that.</p>

<p>Let’s investigate how by comparing a very simple list operation, append, also called (++) in Haskell and Idris. Append in Haskell has the following type signature:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>Prelude</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span>
<span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>::</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Sharing most of the syntax and lot of the type system with Haskell, the append for lists looks very similar in Idris:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>Idris</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>t</span> <span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span>
<span>Prelude</span><span>.</span><span>List</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span> <span>a</span>
<span>Prelude</span><span>.</span><span>Strings</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
<span>Prelude</span><span>.</span><span>Vect</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>+</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When we have a look at the Prelude.List.(++), we can see that it matches the Haskell version - it tells us that it takes two lists and returns a third one - it doesn’t say a single word about the lengths of those lists. But if we look at append for the Prelude.Vect type (vectors are a kind of lists with a size), we see the signature describing the size of the vector:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>Prelude</span><span>.</span><span>Vect</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>+</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In dependent type terminology a vector is a list indexed over its length, or in laymen’s terms the type of a vector is a list with a size. This is remotely similar to the concept of fixed sized arrays, (for example, in Go) a [4]int is not the same type as a [5]int. However in Idris, we can not only describe that those lists have different type, but as we can see above we can also express how a given property - in this case the length of a list - changes as a result of a function. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">Wikipedia succintly states</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A promising type-based verification approach is dependently typed programming, in which the types of functions include (at least part of) those functions’ specifications, and type-checking the code establishes its correctness against those specifications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To understand the importance of this it is not enough to inspect the the above functions’ type signature. What meets the eye there could be considered documentation. But the real epiphany comes when we start to implement a function after specifying its signature. Let’s examine the source code of <a href="https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/blob/43127b17a765dbab2e7bcb6be2f6f2efc7a42386/libs/base/Data/VectType.idr#L181">append</a>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>|||</span> <span>Append</span> <span>two</span> <span>vectors</span>
<span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>m</span> <span>+</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span>
<span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span>      <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>ys</span>
<span>(</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span><span>::</span><span>xs</span><span>)</span> <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span> <span>++</span> <span>ys</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But what happens if we intentionally brake the implementation, for example by appending the first argument to itself and ignoring the second argument entirely? The resulting Vector will have a length of <b>m + m</b>, which is clearly different than the <b>m + n</b> stated in the signature.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>import</span> <span>Data.Vect</span>

<span>vapp</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>m</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span>
<span>vapp</span> <span>Nil</span>       <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>ys</span>
<span>vapp</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span> <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>vapp</span> <span>xs</span> <span>xs</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris-dev/blob/43127b17a765dbab2e7bcb6be2f6f2efc7a42386/test/tutorial006/tutorial006a.idr">link</a>)</p>

<p>The compiler tells exactly what we suspected:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>Type</span> <span>checking</span> <span>./</span><span>vapp</span><span>.</span><span>idr</span>
<span>vapp</span><span>.</span><span>idr</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>:</span><span>23</span><span>:</span><span>When</span> <span>elaborating</span> <span>right</span> <span>hand</span> <span>side</span> <span>of</span> <span>vapp</span><span>:</span>
<span>When</span> <span>elaborating</span> <span>argument</span> <span>xs</span> <span>to</span> <span>constructor</span> <span>Prelude</span><span>.</span><span>Vect</span><span>.:::</span>
        <span>Can't</span> <span>unify</span>
                <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span>
        <span>with</span>
                <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>plus</span> <span>n</span> <span>m</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span>
        
        <span>Specifically</span><span>:</span>
                <span>Can't</span> <span>unify</span>
                        <span>plus</span> <span>n</span> <span>n</span>
                <span>with</span>
                        <span>plus</span> <span>n</span> <span>m</span>
<span>Metavariables</span><span>:</span> <span>Main</span><span>.</span><span>vapp</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The above example shows an interesting quality of Idris’ type system: the correctness of the code is checked against any specification in the functions’ type. If the implementation does not meet the specification a compile error is triggered. Naturally, any property not described by those specifications will not interest the compiler. Let’s say we implement our ‘vapp’ function the following way:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>vapp1</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>n</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>m</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>+</span> <span>m</span><span>)</span> <span>a</span>
<span>vapp1</span> <span>Nil</span>               <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>ys</span>
<span>vapp1</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>x'</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span>   <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>vapp</span> <span>xs</span> <span>ys</span>
<span>vapp1</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>xs</span><span>)</span>         <span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>::</span> <span>vapp</span> <span>xs</span> <span>ys</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This compiling program almost works perfectly but it does have a quirk; the first element from the first argument is present twice, once on the 1st position correctly, and on the second position incorrectly, deleting the second element:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>*</span><span>vapp</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>vapp1</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span>5</span><span>,</span><span>6</span><span>]</span>
<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span> <span>:</span> <span>Vect</span> <span>6</span> <span>Integer</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So we have proved that whatever is stated in the type signature is guaranteed to be correct - but nothing else may be. In our append example we state that ‘given vector a and vector b, calling append with those vectors as arguments will yield a vector with a length of length a + length b’. It does not state that the resulting vector will contain any element from the argument vectors, or if the order is preserved or anything else! But this is pretty obvious since how could the compiler decide wether a code is correct or not if we do not tell it the criteria to judge a piece of code by. Mind reading based programming is not invented yet, unfortunately.</p>

<p>To say the least, dependent types have the potential to become a new useful tool in a programmer’s toolbox - and there is a certain idealistic beauty in building on top of formally verified, guaranteed to be correct code.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Having been a reviewer for numerous machine learning conferences now,
there are some repeated issues I want to point out, concerning the way
authors describe mathematical concepts in their papers. I hope that my
suggestions will serve in particular those that are new to machine
learning and for whom the task of reading a paper with a ‘bad’
mathematical style might seem a daunting prospect. Without further ado,
here are some suggestions for improving your research article.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Your primary objective when writing mathematics should be to build
intuition for readers. This does <em>not</em> mean that you should sacrifice
any rigour or precision—I am just advocating for considering that
a reader of your paper is not an expert in the subject matter yet. If
you want readers to take away some wisdom from the paper, you have to
address their intuition first. No one except an expert in your field
will be swayed by long-winded proofs.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>I am <em>not</em> advocating for sloppy thinking, sloppy writing, or
‘hand-waving’ in your proofs.  I am just saying that the way you lay out
your overall argument should be based on intuition, such that even
reviewers that are not experts in your domain can follow along. If you
only write a paper geared towards a very small audience, you are
reducing its impact and make your life harder because it will almost be
impossible to find good reviewers for it in the conference cycle.</p>

<p>Whenever you introduce notation, try to remain <em>consistent</em>. For
example, if you want to name three objects, prefer calling them $a$, $b$, and
$c$, instead of $\alpha$, $\mathbf{B}$, and $\mathfrak{c}^\prime$.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, follow established terminology—such as calling loss
terms $\mathcal{L}$—but do not assume that the reader is aware of
these conventions. <em>Always</em> take the time to at least briefly introduce
your notation.</p>
<p>This point is in fact closely related to the second issue, namely…</p>

<p>Some people aim to be extremely precise and <em>always</em> employ index-based
notations. For example, instead of referring to objects $a$ and $b$, it
is always $a_1$ and $a_2$ or something. There is nothing wrong with this
in principle, but I would suggest to always strive for as little index
notations as possible and, if only two objects of the same type are needed,
why not use a $\prime$ symbol (<code>\prime</code> in LaTeX) instead of indices?
This can often increase readability and makes you less error-prone
because you do not have to keep track of the indices any more. For
example, in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03854">survey on graph kernels</a>,
we try to always speak of $G$ and $G^\prime$ when we need to refer to
two graphs. This leaves the indices free for when you actually <em>have</em> to
index something, for example because you are aggregating over objects
arising from a certain set.</p>
<p>In addition, try to adhere to ‘less can be more’ in other places as
well, by removing unnecessary variables, unnecessary concepts, and
unnecessary definitions. It does you credit if you want to explain
<em>everything</em> about a certain field in your paper, but if you introduce
a concept X as a special case of a concept Y, there is no need to go to
great lengths to describe any super-concept Z, unless you actually
<em>need</em> to refer to its properties. This does not mean that you should
leave out salient information—I am suggesting to <em>focus</em> on pertinent
information only. For example, there is no need to expand on properties
of metric spaces, topologies, and so on, if all you need is Lipschitz
continuity. Aim to get to the point quickly and without too many
redirections&nbsp;(unless you are writing a book, but I am assuming that
the reader of this post is interested in writing research papers).</p>
<p>Try also not to fall prey to the tendency to make your formulas more
complex than they have to be. For example, peppering your formulas with
logical quantifiers such as $\forall$ or $\exists$ is more appropriate
when you are publishing in logic. Many people, however, treat these
symbols as shortcuts. Please <em>do</em> resist that temptation. As Knuth
remarks in <a href="https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf">Mathematical Writing</a>,
the overuse of such symbols just decreases readability.</p>
<p>As a corollary to the preceding rule, do <em>not</em> include ‘cosmetic
mathematics’ in your paper.  Every equation, lemma, proposition, or
theorem should be there because it needs to be there. I know that there
is a tendency for reviewers to look favourably on a paper whose
mathematics seem ‘sufficiently complex’, but this is not the right way.
If you want to publish good papers, your first duty is to ensure that
readers of that paper can glean some insights from it. Showing off will
not help in the long run.</p>

<p>Similar to my previous post <a href="http://bastian.rieck.me/blog/posts/2019/on_writing/">on writing in general</a>,
the main thing to remember is to know your audience. In machine
learning, this audience can come from highly different backgrounds. Make
them appreciate the ideas in your paper by guiding them gently into the
mathematics. Reserve the ‘heavy stuff’ for an expert audience that can
give you some actual feedback for it instead of just skimming over it.</p>
<p>Write well, until next time!</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I am assuming throughout this article that your research article
is written for a machine learning conference. You might have to adjust
your writing considerably if you are a mathematician publishing for
other mathematicians—but in machine learning, many people are not
exclusively trained in mathematics, making writing research papers
a little bit more challenging if you want to do it well. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>Whether proofs should be included in machine learning papers at
all is still a matter of debate. I think that a rigorous, principled
exposition in a paper is to be welcomed. Yet, the more our community
expands, the more we have to think about how to successfully get the
point across in our papers! At some point, there will not be
a sufficient number of expert reviewers for highly specific papers,
I fear. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
              
              <article><p>I despise remote <em>desktop</em> access. The way it breaks keybindings is something that messes with my muscle memory pretty badly. That’s why I ended up working on Bazel’s macOS port at Google: I wanted to expand the ability to develop on Macs natively instead of relying on remote Linux workstations. But I now have to use remote Windows VMs for Azure development because that’s the way it is, so I’ll have to cope. Or will I?</p>
<p>As surprising as it may sound, recent versions of Windows ship with OpenSSH and, combined with PowerShell, it should be possible to operate a remote machine without the need for a graphical interface. (Except for editing files. I don’t understand how there is no built-in text-based editor. Bring back <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS_Editor"><code>EDIT.COM</code></a>!)</p>
<p>Furthermore, it seems like I’m free to choose any development environment I want (unlike at Google, where there were only a few blessed ways to operate) and some of my new teammates use VSCode. And this is a good thing because VSCode has excellent remote development abilities—<em>including</em> debugging—by means of a trivial SSH connection. Thus I want to see how far I can get by with using VSCode and a terminal, both connected to the remote VM via SSH.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, setting up SSH with key-based authentication wasn’t trivial. I spent about an hour figuring things out, in part because the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_overview">official documentation</a> is broken, and in part because all the “fixes” I found online in arbitrary forums were as misleading as you can imagine.</p>
<p>You can consider these to be my lab notes to get my Windows 10 laptop (build 19041) to connect to my VM on a Windows Server 2019 machine using SSH with key-based authentication. I’m sure I’ll need these in the future again.</p>

<p>Setting up the server was easy. The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse">instructions</a> worked without a problem and I could redirect you to them, but I’m reproducing them here for completeness:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install the SSH server optional feature by querying the exact package name and then installing it. Make sure to use the correct version printed in your case:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Get-WindowsCapability</span> <span>-Online</span> <span>|</span> <span>?</span> <span>Name</span> <span>-like</span> <span>'OpenSSH.Server*'</span>
<span>Add-WindowsCapability</span> <span>-Online</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>'OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0'</span>
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Start the <code>sshd</code> service and make sure it’s always available by configuring it as automatic:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Start-Service</span> <span>sshd</span>
<span>Set-Service</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>sshd</span> <span>-StartupType</span> <span>'Automatic'</span>
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Confirm that the firewall rule to allow inbound SSH access on port 22 is configured. If not, configure it:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Get-NetFirewallRule</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>*</span><span>ssh</span><span>*</span>
<span>New-NetFirewallRule</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>sshd</span> <span>-DisplayName</span> <span>'OpenSSH Server (sshd)'</span> <span>-Enabled</span> <span>True</span> <span>-Direction</span> <span>Inbound</span> <span>-Protocol</span> <span>TCP</span> <span>-Action</span> <span>Allow</span> <span>-LocalPort</span> <span>22</span>
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p><em>(Optional, but really, why put yourself through <code>cmd.exe</code>.)</em> Set PowerShell as the default shell:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>New-ItemProperty</span> <span>-Path</span> <span>"HKLM:\SOFTWARE\OpenSSH"</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>DefaultShell</span> <span>-Value</span> <span>"C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe"</span> <span>-PropertyType</span> <span>String</span> <span>-Force</span>
</code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<p>So far so good. These straightforward instructions should allow inbound SSH connections to the Windows Server to work. You can probably do most of the above from the UI too if that’s your game, but I’m trying to figure out CLI-based administration as I go.</p>

<p>Install the SSH client optional feature by querying the exact package name and then installing it. Make sure to use the correct version printed in your case:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Get-WindowsCapability</span> <span>-Online</span> <span>|</span> <span>?</span> <span>Name</span> <span>-like</span> <span>'OpenSSH.Client*'</span>
<span>Add-WindowsCapability</span> <span>-Online</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>'OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0'</span>
</code></pre></div><p>You can do this from the UI as well via the <em>Optional features</em> control panel and selecting <em>OpenSSH Client</em>.</p>
<p>But that’s it. There is no step two.</p>

<p>This is where things get tricky because <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_keymanagement">the official documentation</a> is wrong. You see, the official documents talk about installing the <code>OpenSSHUtils</code> package… but that package seems to be gone. And before you think that this is my fault for not knowing how Windows works yet (which, hey, it was my assumption too)… there are <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windowsserverdocs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+OpenSSHUtils">plenty of months-old issues</a> in the bug tracker describing this problem and I can’t understand how it hasn’t been fixed yet.</p>
<p>So, how do we get the SSH agent installed? We don’t: it’s already there (as part of the <em>OpenSSH Client</em> package, I suppose).</p>
<p>The problem is that, even after knowing that the agent is installed, enabling it as the instructions say doesn’t work:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">PS C:\&gt; Start-Service ssh-agent
Start-Service : Service 'OpenSSH Authentication Agent (ssh-agent)' cannot be started due to the following error:
Cannot start service ssh-agent on computer '.'.
At line:1 char:1
+ Start-Service ssh-agent
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : OpenError: (System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController:ServiceController) [Start-Service], ServiceCommandException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CouldNotStartService,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.StartServiceCommand
</code></pre></div><p>This is a very helpful (not) error message: OK, the service cannot be started. But… why? No information. Seeing this error and the request to install the <code>OpenSSHUtils</code> package made me assume that the service was missing. But it wasn’t as I already mentioned above. Then, how come the start request failed? Well, the service’s status defaults to <strong>Disabled</strong> and thus requests to start it fail. To fix:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="powershell"><span>Set-Service</span> <span>-Name</span> <span>ssh-agent</span> <span>-StartupType</span> <span>'Automatic'</span>
<span>Start-Service</span> <span>ssh-agent</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Alright. One fewer problem. With this, <code>ssh-add</code> started working as expected.</p>

<p>But there was one more problem. No matter what I did, the server would not accept my key: it would always fall back to password-based authentication even after the client correctly offered the key during connection establishment. A lot of the online “tips” talk about setting the right ACLs on the <code>%UserProfile%\.ssh\authorized_keys</code> file to ensure they are restrictive enough, and I sank a ton of time down this path without success.</p>
<p>My next guess was that key authentication was disabled for some super-strange reason, but I had to confirm this. I spent quite a while trying to find where the <code>sshd_config</code> file lived: I couldn’t guess its location from the documentation, and recursively searching through the contents of <code>C:\</code> didn’t yield any results. Strange. “Maybe <code>sshd</code> has been patched to assume certain defaults so that there isn’t a need for an <code>sshd_config</code> file”, I thought.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until later that I found a random blog post with a clue: if your (remote) account happens to have administrator privileges (and mine does)… then the public key has to be placed in the special location <code>%ProgramData%\ssh\administrators_authorized_keys</code>, <strong>not</strong> under your personal <code>%UserProfile%\.ssh\authorized_keys</code> file. Wonderful, because the documentation had no mention of this.</p>
<p>OK! Let’s try that then. I went to create this file, but was greeted by:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">PS C:\&gt; mkdir ProgramData
mkdir : An item with the specified name C:\ProgramData already exists.
At line:1 char:1
+ mkdir ProgramData
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ResourceExists: (C:\ProgramData:String) [New-Item], IOException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DirectoryExist,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.NewItemCommand
</code></pre></div><p>Wait, what? The call to create the directory failed because the directory <em>did</em> exist? I certainly had not seen it earlier when looking directly at <code>C:\</code>. Alright, so… what’s inside?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">PS C:\&gt; cd ProgramData
PS C:\ProgramData&gt; ls


    Directory: C:\ProgramData


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
... 🥁🥁🥁 ...
d-----        2020-05-10     22:43                ssh
...
</code></pre></div><p>Ta-da! The promised <code>ssh</code> directory. And guess what was within it? The <code>sshd_config</code> file I had been looking for earlier (which, by the way, confirmed the need to put administrator credentials into the <code>administrators_authorized_keys</code> special file).</p>
<p>This is when things clicked and explains why I hadn’t reached this point much earlier. Hidden files. I had forgotten about those. The <code>C:\ProgramData\</code> directory is hidden by default, and that’s why none of my earlier file searches had encountered the <code>sshd_config</code> file.</p>
<p>But wait! The <code>administrators_authorized_keys</code> file doesn’t exist by default, and if you create it without giving it a second thought, things won’t work: <code>sshd</code> for Windows expects obnoxiously specific permissions and, if they are wrong, silently ignores the file. The permissions <strong>must</strong> grant <em>Full Access</em> to the <em>System</em> and the <em>Administrators</em> scopes alone. This is how the ACLs should look like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">PS C:\ProgramData\ssh&gt; icacls .\administrators_authorized_keys
.\administrators_authorized_keys NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(F)
                                 BUILTIN\Administrators:(F)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
</code></pre></div><p>And, with that, I was able to finally log in without having to type my password every single time 🙌.</p>

				<p>Such metrics widely used in analytic and monitoring tools like Graphana or Newrelic. Usually in context of response time. Lets look in each of them:</p><p>Average - arithmetic mean: sum up all values and divide this total number by number of elements.</p><p>Median (or p50) - sort all given values by value and pick halfway point. Lets say if we have p50 as 219ms it means that 50% of monitored requests for the given period were completed in 219ms or less.</p><p>P90 (or 90th percentile) - same as p50 but in this case it is 90% of requests. &nbsp;</p>

There's a bunch of interesting maths behind it, but it's better to start with what it actually does, and why you'd want to use it first. If you want to know more about the how, there's some further reading suggestions below!</p>
<h2 id="sowhatisthisthing">So what is this thing?</h2>
<p>Put simply, the Fourier transform is a way of splitting something up into a bunch of sine waves. As usual, the name comes from some person who lived a long time ago called Fourier.</p>
<p>Let’s start with some simple examples and work our way up. First up we're going to look at waves - patterns that repeat over time.</p>
<p>Here’s an example wave:</p>
<canvas id="combo-sine-wave" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
<p>This wavy pattern here can be split up into sine waves. That is, when we add up the two sine waves we get back the original wave.</p>
<canvas id="combo-sine-wave-split" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>The Fourier transform is a way for us to take the combined wave, and get each of the sine waves back out. In this example, you can almost do it in your head, just by looking at the original wave.</p>
<p>Why? Turns out a lot of things in the real world interact based on these sine waves. We usually call them the wave's frequencies.</p>
<p>The most obvious example is sound – when we hear a sound, we don’t hear that squiggly line, but we hear the different frequencies of the sine waves that make up the sound.</p>



<p>Being able to split them up on a computer can give us an understanding of what a person actually hears. We can understand how high or low a sound is, or figure out what note it is.</p>
<p>We can also use this process on waves that don't look like they're made of sine waves.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at this guy. It’s called a square wave.</p>
<canvas id="square-wave" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
<p>It might not look like it, but it also can be split up into sine waves.</p>
<canvas id="square-wave-split" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>We need a lot of them this time – technically an infinite amount to perfectly represent it. As we add up more and more sine waves the pattern gets closer and closer to the square wave we started with.</p>
<canvas id="square-wave-build-up" width="500" height="500"></canvas>


<p><em>Drag the slider above to play with how many sine waves there are.</em></p>
<p>Visually, you'll notice that actually the first few sine waves are the ones that make the biggest difference. With the slider halfway, we have the general shape of the wave, but it's all wiggly. We just need the rest of the small ones to make the wigglyness flatten out.</p>
<p>When you listen to the wave, you'll hear the sound get lower, because we're removing the higher frequencies.</p>
<p>This process works like that for any repeating line. Give it a go, try drawing your own!</p>


<p><em>Move the slider to see how as we add more sine waves, it gets closer and closer to your drawing</em></p>
<p>Again, aside from the extra wigglyness, the wave looks pretty similar with just half of the sine waves.</p>
<p>We can actually use the fact that the wave is pretty similar to our advantage. By using a Fourier transform, we can get the important parts of a sound, and only store those to end up with something that's pretty close to the original sound.</p>
<p>Normally on a computer we store a wave as a series of points.</p>
<canvas id="wave-samples" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>What we can do instead is represent it as a bunch of sine waves. Then we can compress the sound by ignoring the smaller frequencies. Our end result won't be the same, but it'll sound pretty similar to a person.</p>
<canvas id="wave-frequencies" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>This is essentially what MP3s do, except they're more clever about which frequencies they keep and which ones they throw away.</p>
<p>So in this case, we can use Fourier transforms to get an understanding of the fundamental properties of a wave, and then we can use that for things like compression.</p>
<p>Ok, now let's dig more into the Fourier transform. This next part looks cool, but also gives you a bit more understanding of what the Fourier transform does. But mostly looks cool.</p>
<h2 id="epicycles">Epicycles</h2>
<p>Now at the start, I said it splits things into sine waves. The thing is, the sine waves it creates are not just regular sine waves, but they’re 3D. You could call them "complex sinusoids". Or just "spirals".</p>
<canvas id="complex-sinusoid" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>If we take a look from the side, they look like sine waves. From front on, though, these look like circles.</p>
<canvas id="complex-sinusoid-turn" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>So far everything we’ve been doing has only required the regular 2D sine waves. When we do a Fourier transform on 2D waves, the complex parts cancel out so we just end up with sine waves.</p>
<p>But we can use the 3D sine waves to make something fun looking like this:</p>
<canvas id="peace-epicycles" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>What’s going on here?</p>
<p>Well, we can think of the drawing as a 3D shape because of the way it moves around in time. If you imagine the hand being drawn by a person, the three dimensions represent where the tip of their pencil is at that moment. The x and y dimensions tell us the position, and then the time dimension is the time at that moment.</p>
<canvas id="peace-3d" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
<p>Now that we have a 3D pattern, we can't use the regular 2D sine waves to represent it. No matter how many of the 2D sine waves we add up, we'll never get something 3D. So we need something else.</p>
<p>What we can use is the 3D spiral sine waves from before. If we add up lots of those, we can get something that looks like our 3D pattern.</p>
<p>Remember, these waves look like circles when we look at them from front on. The name for the pattern of a circle moving around another circle is an epicycle.</p>
<canvas id="peace-build-up" width="500" height="500"></canvas>

<p><em>Use the slider above to control how many circles there are.</em></p>
<p>Like before, we get a pretty good approximation of our pattern with just a few circles. Because this is a fairly simple shape, all the last ones do is make the edges a little sharper.</p>
<p>All this applies to any drawing, really! Now it’s your chance to play around with it.</p>


<p><em>Use the slider to control how many circles are used for your drawing</em></p>
<p>Again, you'll see for most shapes, we can approximate them fairly well with just a small number of circles, instead of saving all the points.</p>
<p>Can we use this for real data? Well, we could! In reality we have another data format called SVG, which probably does a better job for the types of shapes we tend to create. So for the moment, this is really just for making cool little gifs.</p>
<canvas id="fourier-title" width="500" height="300"></canvas>
<p>There is another type of visual data that does use Fourier transforms, however.</p>
<h2 id="jpegs">JPEGs</h2>
<p>Did you know Fourier transforms can also be used on images? In fact, we use it all the time, because that's how JPEGs work! We're applying the same principles to images – splitting up something into a bunch of sine waves, and then only storing the important ones.</p>
<p>Now we're dealing with images, we need a different type of sine wave. We need to have something that no matter what image we have, we can add up a bunch of these sine waves to get back to our original image.</p>
<p>To do that, each of our sine waves will be images too. Instead of a wave that's a line, we now have images with black and white sections. To represent the size of a wave, each image will have more or less contrast.</p>
<p>We can also use these to represent color in the same way, but let's start with black-and-white images for now. To represent colorless images, we need some horizontal wave images,</p>
<p><img id="img-y-component" src="http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/img/components-4-0.png"></p>
<p>Along with some vertical wave images.</p>
<p><img id="img-x-component" src="http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/img/components-0-4.png"></p>
<p>By themselves, just horizontal and vertical images aren't enough to represent the types of images we get. We also need some extra ones that you get by multiplying the two together.</p>

<p>For an 8x8 image, here are all the images we need.</p>

</p>
<p>If we take the images, adjust their contrast to the right amount, and then add them up we can create any image.</p>
<p>Let's start with this letter 'A'. It's pretty small, but we need it to be small otherwise we'll end up with too many other images.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/img/a.png"></p>
<p>As we add more and more of these images, we end up with something that becomes closer and closer to the actual image. But I think you'll see the pattern here, as we get a reasonable approximation with just a few of them.</p>

<p>For actual JPEG images there are just a few extra details.</p>
<p>The image gets broken up into 8x8 chunks, and each chunk gets split up separately. We use a set of frequencies to determine how light or dark each pixel is, and then another two sets for the color, one for red-green, and another for blue-yellow. The number of frequencies that we use for each chunk determines the quality of the JPEG.</p>
<p>Here's a real JPEG image, zoomed in so we can see the details. When we play with the quality levels we can see this process happen.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So let's recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fourier transforms are things that let us take something and split it up into its frequencies.</li>
<li>The frequencies tell us about some fundamental properties of the data we have</li>
<li>And can compress data by only storing the important frequencies</li>
<li>And we can also use them to make cool looking animations with a bunch of circles</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just scratching the surface into some applications. The Fourier transform is an extremely powerful tool, because splitting things up into frequencies is so fundamental. They're used in a lot of fields, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Apple’s launch of macOS Big Sur was almost immediately followed by server issues which prevented users from running third-party apps on their computers. While a workaround was soon found by people on Twitter, others raised some privacy concerns related to that issue.</p>
<center><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hey Apple users:</p><p>If you're now experiencing hangs launching apps on the Mac, I figured out the problem using Little Snitch.</p><p>It's trustd connecting to <a href="https://t.co/FzIGwbGRan">https://t.co/FzIGwbGRan</a></p><p>Denying that connection fixes it, because OCSP is a soft failure.</p><p>(Disconnect internet also fixes.) <a href="https://t.co/w9YciFltrb">pic.twitter.com/w9YciFltrb</a></p></div>— Jeff Johnson (@lapcatsoftware) <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1326990296412991489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2020</a></blockquote></center> 
<h2 id="what-is-ocsp">What is OCSP?</h2>
<p>OCSP stands for Online Certificate Status Protocol<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. As the name implies, it is used to verify the validity of a certificate without having to download and scan large certificate revocation lists. macOS uses OCSP to make sure that the developer certificate <strong>hasn’t been revoked</strong> before an app is launched.</p>
<p>As Jeff Johnson explains in his tweet above, if macOS cannot reach Apple’s OCSP responder it skips the check and launches the app anyway - it is basically a fail-open behaviour. The problem is that Apple’s responder didn’t go down; it was reachable but became extremely slow, and this prevented the soft failure from triggering and giving up the check.</p>
<p>It is clear that this mechanism requires macOS to <strong>contact Apple</strong> before an app is launched. The sudden public awareness of this fact, brought about by Apple’s issues, raised some privacy concerns and a post from security researcher <strong>Jeffrey Paul</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> became very popular on Twitter. He claims that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the current version of the macOS, the OS sends to Apple a hash (unique identifier) of each and every program you run, when you run it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That would be creepy indeed.</p>
<p>To make things worse, it is common for OCSP to use HTTP - I’m talking about <em>good old <strong>plaintext HTTP</strong> on port 80, none of that HTTPS rubbish</em>. There is usually a good reason for this, that becomes especially clear when the OCSP service is used for web browsers: preventing loops. If you used HTTPS for checking a certificate with OCSP then you would need to also check the certificate for the HTTPS connection using OCSP. That would imply opening another HTTPS connection and so on.</p>
<p>Of course while OCSP does not mandate encryption, it does require that responses are signed by the server. This still doesn’t solve the initial concern that anyone with a traffic analyzer on your network could eavesdrop every app you open and when you open it.</p>
<h2 id="diving-deeper">Diving deeper</h2>
<p>Knowing some OCSP basics, more questions arise. OCSP is about checking certificates; why should this have anything to do with sending out <em><strong>hashes</strong></em> of apps you run? Does macOS really compute the hash of each executable at each launch? What about very large ones? That would take a significant amount of time; is it possible that nobody noticed? Maybe the hash is computed only once (e.g. the first time you run the app) and it is stored somewhere. But I’m not convinced and I think these claims needs more research.</p>
<p>Capturing a OCSP request is as easy as setting up an HTTP proxy or starting Wireshark. No HTTPS means no encryption, no certificate pinning, no problems whatsoever. I captured the following request while opening Firefox.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="http"><span>GET</span> <span>/ocsp-devid01/ME4wTKADAgEAMEUwQzBBMAkGBSsOAwIaBQAEFDOB0e%2FbaLCFIU0u76%2BMSmlkPCpsBBRXF%2B2iz9x8mKEQ4Py%2Bhy0s8uMXVAIIBseUIWx6qTA%3D</span> <span>HTTP</span><span>/</span><span>1.1</span>
<span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>ocsp.apple.com</span>
<span>Accept</span><span>:</span> <span>*/*</span>
<span>User-Agent</span><span>:</span> <span>com.apple.trustd/2.0</span>
<span>Accept-Language</span><span>:</span> <span>it-it</span>
<span>Accept-Encoding</span><span>:</span> <span>gzip, deflate</span>
<span>Connection</span><span>:</span> <span>keep-alive</span>
</code></pre></div><p>I should also add that after closing Firefox and opening it again, no requests were made. This is reasonable, and indicates that certificate checking isn’t performed at each launch but only after it hasn’t been performed for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>The request is a very simple GET that contains the payload as a base64-encoded string. The actual binary data can be easily dumped to a file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>echo</span> <span>'ME4wTKADAgEAMEUwQzBBMAkGBSsOAwIaBQAEFDOB0e/baLCFIU0u76+MSmlkPCpsBBRXF+2iz9x8mKEQ4Py+hy0s8uMXVAIIBseUIWx6qTA='</span> <span>|</span> base64 --decode &gt; output.bin
</code></pre></div><p>We obtain an 80-byte-long payload that looks nothing like a hash. Sure enough, it isn’t. We can use OpenSSL to extract readable information from the binary file.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">openssl ocsp -text -reqin output.bin
</code></pre></div><pre><code>OCSP Request Data:
    Version: 1 (0x0)
    Requestor List:
        Certificate ID:
          Hash Algorithm: sha1
          Issuer Name Hash: 3381D1EFDB68B085214D2EEFAF8C4A69643C2A6C
          Issuer Key Hash: 5717EDA2CFDC7C98A110E0FCBE872D2CF2E31754
          Serial Number: 06C794216C7AA930
</code></pre><p>It is clear that the <code>trustd</code> service on macOS doesn’t send out a hash of the apps you launch. Instead, it just sends information about some certificate - as we would certainly expect after understanding what OCSP is in the first place.</p>
<p>Well, this does not solve the problem, does it? If each app has a unique certificate, then it would still be possible to create a table that associates each serial number to the corresponding app, and thus this would still be a privacy concern. Let’s check if this is the case.</p>
<h2 id="developer-certificates">Developer certificates…</h2>
<p>First of all I would like to determine from which certificate this information comes from. I used Apple’s <code>codesign</code> utility to extract certificates from the Firefox app in order to look for matching data.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">codesign -d --extract-certificates /Applications/Firefox.app
</code></pre></div><p>This command results in several files being created with names <code>codesign0</code>, <code>codesign1</code>, etc. The first one is the leaf certificate, while others belong to the certificate chain up until the root. <code>codesign0</code> should be what we are looking for, and once again we can use OpenSSL to extract some info about it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">openssl x509 -inform der -in codesign0 -text
</code></pre></div><pre><code>Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 488521955867797808 (0x6c794216c7aa930)
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: CN=Developer ID Certification Authority, OU=Apple Certification Authority, O=Apple Inc., C=US
        Validity
            Not Before: May  8 19:08:58 2017 GMT
            Not After : May  9 19:08:58 2022 GMT
        Subject: UID=43AQ936H96, CN=Developer ID Application: Mozilla Corporation (43AQ936H96), OU=43AQ936H96, O=Mozilla Corporation, C=US
        ...
</code></pre><p>Check the serial number we got (<code>0x6c794216c7aa930</code>) and compare it with the payload of the OCSP request. We have a match! This proves that OCSP requests actually send out information about the app developer certificate.</p>
<h2 id="and-their-generality">…and their generality</h2>
<p>“So what?” you might ask. Well, developer certificates aren’t unique for each app. Once again, don’t take my word for it. We can quickly verify this by checking the certificate of a different app from Mozilla, say Thunderbird.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">codesign -d --extract-certificates /Applications/Thunderbird.app
openssl x509 -inform der -in codesign0 -text
</code></pre></div><pre><code>Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 488521955867797808 (0x6c794216c7aa930)

        Subject: UID=43AQ936H96, CN=Developer ID Application: Mozilla Corporation (43AQ936H96), OU=43AQ936H96, O=Mozilla Corporation, C=US
        ...
</code></pre><p>That’s exactly the same certificate used for Firefox (of course it is!). So Jeffrey Paul’s analysis isn’t quite accurate - at least for what concerns these parts (emphasis mine).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The OS sends to Apple a hash (unique identifier) of each and every program you run, when you run it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[An IP address]&nbsp;allows for a table that has the following headings:
Date, Time, Computer, ISP, City, State, <strong>Application Hash</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[This means that Apple knows] what apps you open there, and how often. They know when you open Premiere over at a friend’s house on their Wi-Fi, and they know when you open Tor Browser in a hotel on a trip to another city.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>macOS does actually send out some opaque information about <strong>the developer</strong> certificate of those apps, and that’s quite an important difference on a privacy perspective.</p>
<h2 id="a-word-about-notarization">A word about notarization</h2>
<p>I would like to clarify something that is probably at the root of this misunderstanding. In fact, there exists a situation where macOS can actually send Apple the hash of an executable, and that is when <strong>Gatekeeper</strong> checks if a notarization ticket exists on Apple’s servers upon first launch, in case the ticket isn’t stapled to the app<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This has nothing to do with OCSP. It happens under specific circumstances and the check is performed via a secure (HTTPS) endpoint located at <code>api.apple-cloudkit.com</code>. During this process, a pop-up with a progress bar is shown to the user.</p>
<h2 id="about-blocking-ocsp">About blocking OCSP</h2>
<p>As you probably have already learned during Apple’s OCSP responder outage, you can block OCSP requests in several ways, the most popular ones being Little Snitch<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> and editing your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file. Personally, I wouldn’t suggest doing that as it prevents an <strong>important security feature</strong> from working.</p>
<p>Now that you know the actual facts, if you think your privacy is put at risk by this feature more than having potential undetected malware running on your system, go ahead. Otherwise, don’t bother.</p>
<p>If you use macOS Big Sur, blocking OCSP might not be as trivial. Before crying conspiracy, however, keep in mind that common users are generally not able to fully understand and evaluate the impact of disabling such a complex and delicate security feature on their computer.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>No, macOS <strong>does not</strong> send Apple a hash of your apps each time you run them.</li>
<li>You should be aware that macOS <strong>might transmit</strong> some opaque information about the developer certificate of the apps you run. This information is sent out in clear text on your network.</li>
<li><strong>You shouldn’t</strong> probably block <code>ocsp.apple.com</code> with Little Snitch or in your hosts file.</li>

I want to get rid of it, but nothing's stopping someone from buying it and serving ads or malicious content. Even after two years, people still use it; linked from other websites and their bookmarks.

<![CDATA[How to specify data types in Python]]>

November 14, 2020 | https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/type-hints-python/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.pythonstacks.com/blog/type-hints-python/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>In the low-level programming languages like Java, C, C++, and C#, <span>variables are strictly typed</span> - which means you have to indicate the variable type when creating a variable.</p>

<p>For example, creating variables in <strong>Java</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>String name = "John";       

int age;                    # only an integer can be assigned to age

age = 23;                   # assigning a value to age</code></pre>



<p>Unlike Java, <span>Python gives us the flexibility to declare and assign variables without specifying their types</span> :</p>

<pre><code>name = "John"

age = 23</code></pre>

<p>In this type of coding, Python <span>automatically figures out the type of data that has been assigned to a variable</span>. You can verify that by using the <code>type()</code> function:</p>

<pre><code>print(type(name))              # &lt;class 'str'&gt;
print(type(age))               # &lt;class 'int'&gt;</code></pre>



<h2>Type Hints in Python</h2>

<p>Though <span>Python is not a strictly typed language</span>, you can still <span>give a hint of a variable's data type</span>.</p>

<p>To specify a variable type when declaring it,</p>

<p><code>variable_name: variable_type = value</code></p>

<pre><code>weather: str = "cloudy"

degrees: int                    # you can declare a variable before assigning
degrees = 32</code></pre>



<p>Also note that even <span>after a variable type is indicated in Python, you can still assign a different data type to the variable</span>:</p>

<pre><code>degrees: int = 32
print(degrees)                      # 32

degrees = "thirty-two"
print(degrees)                      # thirty-two</code></pre>



<p>Specifying a variable type in Python does not mean the variable can only accept values of that type. They are just hints that inform a user of the type which a variable is.</p>



<h2>Adding types to functions</h2>

<p>Type hints are very useful in Functions,&nbsp; mostly when declaring function parameters.</p>

<p>For example, here is a <span>simple function that takes in two arguments and returns the sum</span>.</p>

<pre><code>def sum(a, b):
    return a + b</code></pre>

<p>By looking at this code, <span>one cannot be sure if the caller is going to supply integers</span> as the argument or <span>strings</span> or any other data type.</p>

<p>A call to this function works when supplied with <span>int</span> values and with other values such as <span>strings, lists, and tuples</span>:</p>

<pre><code>sum(3, 5)                               # 8

sum([1, 0, 5], ['java', 'c++'])         # [1, 0, 5, 'java', 'c++']

sum('2', '3')                           # 23</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see that the<code> sum()</code> function works well when it is invoked with either <span>int</span> values, <span>string</span> values, or <span>even</span> lists.</p>

<p>But the goal of the <code>sum()</code> function is to<span> add two integers</span>, and not two <span>lists </span>or <span>strings</span>. We can now provide type hints for the parameters in the Function definition indicating the type that we want to allow.</p>

<p>To indicate that we only want to allow <span>int types</span> we can change our function definition to look like:</p>

<pre><code>def sum(a: int, b: int):
    return a + b</code></pre>

<p>This informs the function caller that <span>the arguments required for the sum() function </span>should be<span> integers </span>not otherwise.</p>

<p>Similarly, <span>to indicate only <code>str </code>types are allowed</span>, we'd change our function to specify it as:</p>

<pre><code>def sum(a: str, b: str):
    return a + b</code></pre>



<h2>Specifying A function's return type.</h2>

<p>One could also indicate the return value of a function call :</p>

<pre><code>def sum(number1, number2) -&gt; int :
    return number1 + number1</code></pre>

<p>This informs the caller that the return type of the <code>sum()</code> function should be an integer.</p>

<h3><i>How to lose weight and hair through stress and poor nutrition</i></h3>
<address>
By
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/" target="_top">John Walker</a>
</address>
</center>

<p>

<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite>, notwithstanding its silly
subtitle, is a serious book about how to lose weight and
permanently maintain whatever weight you desire.  It
treats dieting and weight control from an <em>engineering</em>
and <em>management</em> standpoint, and provides the tools
and an understanding of why they work and how to use
them that permit the reader to gain control of their
own weight.  The book is intended primarily for busy,
successful engineers, programmers, and managers who
have struggled unsuccessfully in the past to lose
weight and avoid re-gaining it.
<a href="#Comptools">Computer-based tools</a>
and experiments in Microsoft Excel or the Palm Computing
Platform are available, as well as an online Web application,
but a computer is not necessary to use
the techniques described in the book; paper and pencil
alternatives are provided.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">Fourth Edition (2005)</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/figures/hdpage4.png" width="256" height="288" alt=""></a>
The Fourth Edition of <cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> was
released in November 2005.  It is essentially identical in content with the
previous editions, but has been extensively re-formatted to improve
appearance, accessibility, ease of navigation, and standards compliance.
The Fourth Edition strictly complies with the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">XHTML&nbsp;1.0</a> (Transitional and Frameset)
and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">CSS&nbsp;2.1</a>
standards and requires a browser which implements these
standards.  (As of the release of this edition, current versions
of all of the most popular browsers, including Mozilla Firefox,
Opera, and Microsoft Internet Explorer supported these standards
sufficiently to display the book without problems.)  In addition, the
browser and operating system must display Unicode character entities.
JavaScript and DOM/DHTML are used in the navigation bar, but if they're
absent or disabled, everything will still work.  If your browser and/or
system cannot handle this version, the Third Edition (Frames) or the
No-Frame editions, both of which date from 1994, will almost certainly
work.  The content is the same; only the presentation is more rudimentary.

The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB" target="Hackdiet_Aux">EPUB</a>
edition is in the open document format
compatible with the iBooks application on the Apple iPad, iPhone, and
iPod&nbsp;touch; Sony Reader; Barnes and Noble Nook; and a variety of
other electronic book devices and mobile platforms.  EPUB books may be
opened directly with a Web browser using the
<a href="http://www.epubread.com/en/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">EPUBReader</a>
add-on for Firefox or the
<a href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/15552/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">eBook
Reader</a>
widget for Opera, although users of desktop and notebook computers
with Internet connectivity will probably prefer the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/">Web edition</a>,
due to its more flexible navigation options.
</p>

<p>
If your Web browser has an EPUB-compatible plug-in installed, you can
open the book simply by clicking on the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/epub/hackdiet.epub" target="Hackdiet_Aux"><cite>The
Hacker's Diet</cite> EPUB Edition</a>
link.  Otherwise, use your browser's idiom to download the
abovementioned file to your computer and then transfer it to your
reading device according to the manufacturer's directions.  For the
iPad and iPhone (etc.), just drag the downloaded
<tt>hackdiet.epub</tt> file to iTunes, where you should see it in the
“Books” section.  Then connect your reading device to the
computer and the book should be transferred to it by the Sync
process.  If the book is not installed, make sure that you've enabled
syncing books to that device, and that if you've opted not to sync all
books in your library to the device, that <cite>The Hacker's
Diet</cite> is checked to be copied.  You must also, of course, have
the Apple
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBooks" target="Hackdiet_Aux">iBooks</a>
application installed on the device; if it's missing, go to the App
Store and install it—it's free.
</p>

<p>
<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> EPUB edition contains no “Digital
Rights Management” constraints: you are free to install it on as
many devices as you wish, transfer it among them (if their hardware
and software so permit), and pass on copies to others.  It should be
compatible with any EPUB reader hardware and software which can open
standards-compliant unrestricted files.

<a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">downloaded
free of charge</a> directly from the
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">Adobe Systems</a> Web site.
The PDF edition preserves all the formatting of
the original book, and permits point-and-click navigation
among chapters and to follow cross-references in the text.

<p>
Adobe is one of the most consistently irritating companies
on Earth with which to do business.  I'd like to give you
a nice button for downloading your own copy of Adobe Reader,
but they won't let me use the image without “registering”
and “licensing” it, which I'm certainly not going to do
in order to promote their product and its file format.

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdps.zip">PostScript Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<cite>The Hacker's Diet</cite> was originally typeset
using <a href="http://www.tug.org/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">TeX</a> with the
<a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" target="Hackdiet_Aux">LaTeX</a>
macro package.  Camera-ready copy was generated
from PostScript created by the <tt>dvips</tt>
utility.  The PostScript edition is a single monolithic
file, almost 2.7 megabytes, containing the
entire book as originally typeset.  You can read it on-line
with a PostScript viewing program such as
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">GhostScript</a>
(which is free), or print it on any PostScript-compatible
printer.  <strong>Before sending this
file to a printer, consider that the book is almost
250 pages long!</strong>  This is a <em>big</em> print
job, which will consume lots of paper, toner, and,
potentially, good will of any colleagues with whom
you share the printer.  The PostScript edition may be
downloaded as either a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hdps.zip">ZIPped archive</a>
or a <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/hackdiet.ps.gz"><b>gzip</b> compressed Unix <b>tar</b>
file</a>; both are 702 Kb in length and uncompress to a 2.7
Mb PostScript file.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdietf.html">Third Edition (1994 Web Edition with Frames)</a></h2>

<p>
If your browser supports frames but isn't up to the demands
of the Fourth Edition, the original 1994 Web edition with
frames remains available.
It allows navigation with
a panel which lets you click chapter titles and go
directly to that chapter.  If, in addition, your browser
supports JavaScript, simply moving the mouse over a
footnote icon, like this one:
<a onmouseover="javascript:footOver(0);" href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/f/0.html"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/i/foot.gif" width="15" height="15" alt="[Footnote]"></a>
will pop up a window containing the footnote.  Moving the
mouse over other footnotes displays them in the auxiliary window.
Browsers without JavaScript (or users who have disabled
JavaScript in their browsers) may display footnotes in
the main document window by clicking the footnote icon,
then use their browser's “Back” button to return to the
main text.
</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html">No-Frame Web Edition</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/hackdiet.html"><img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/www/figures/any_browser.gif" width="88" height="31" alt="Works with Any Browser"></a>
Users with browsers which do not support frames, or those
who prefer a more linear presentation in a single
window, may access a no-frame edition of <cite>The Hacker's
Diet</cite> with identical content to the frame-based book.
The no-frame edition includes the pop-up footnotes present
in the frame edition, but since few browsers which lack
frames are likely to support JavaScript, you can simply click
on the footnote icon to display it, then use the
“Back” button or keystroke to return to the text containing
the footnote.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h4>What is the demo doing?</h4>
        <p>Neural networks achieve superhuman performance in many areas, but they are easily fooled.</p>
        <p>In the demo above, we can force neural networks to predict anything we want. By adding nearly-invisible noise to an image, we turn "1"s into "9"s, "Stop" signs into "120 km/hr" signs, and dogs into hot dogs.</p>
        <p>These noisy images are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning#Specific_Attacks_Types">adversarial examples</a>. They break the integrity of machine learning systems, and the illusion of their superhuman performance.</p>

        <h4>Why does this matter?</h4>
        <p>Our world is becoming increasingly automated, yet these systems have strange failure modes.</p>
        <p>If machine learning systems are not properly defended, attackers could:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Impersonate others in facial recognition systems</li>
          <li>Force autonomous vehicles to misrecognize street signs &amp; obstacles</li>
          <li>Bypass content moderation and spam filters in social networks</li>
          <li>Inject adversarial bytes into malware to bypass antivirus systems</li>
          <li>Digitally alter numbers on a check in a mobile banking app</li>
          <li>(and more)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Is this limited to image classification with neural networks?</h4>
        <p>No. Adversarial examples exist for almost every machine learning task: <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/code/audio_adversarial_examples">speech recognition</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07998.pdf">text classification</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3308558.3313533">fraud detection</a>, <a href="https://www.ericswallace.com/imitation">machine translation</a>, <a href="https://adversarialpolicies.github.io/">reinforcement learning</a>, ....</p>
        <p>Moreover, all machine learning models (not just neural networks) are vulnerable. In fact, simpler models such as logistic regression are <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf">even more easily attacked</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally – beyond adversarial examples – there are many more adversarial attack vectors, including data poisoning, model backdooring, data extraction, and model stealing.</p>

        <h4>How do I defend against adversarial examples?</h4>
        <p>There are several proposed defenses, including adversarial training and admission control.</p>
        <p>However, no defense is universal and many have proven ineffective, so work with an expert to quantify your risks and invest in defenses appropriately.</p>
        <p>(What happens if someone can make your system predict anything they want?).</p>

        <h4>Where can I learn more?</h4>

<![CDATA[The Best and Worst Microcontroller SDKs]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        <p>In 2020, an MCU is much more than a hunk of silicon. Indeed, it comes with a
whole ecosystem including a BSP, integrated third-party libraries, tooling,
field application support,  and more.</p>

<p>As firmware engineers, we are often handed down an MCU selection as a fait
accompli. Cost concerns, peripheral, or pinout requirements often take precedent
over the SDK.</p>

<p>Yet we are allowed to have an opinion. So here for you today is my first post in
a new “comparing MCU SDKs” series.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>In this post, I download SDKs for 10 popular Cortex-M4 microcontrollers, and
evaluate how straightforward it is to get a simple example compiling. I include
some step by step instructions to get started, a rating out of 10, and a few
comments.</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<p>It goes without saying that this is an opinion based on my own very specific
setup (MacOS, vim). Your mileage may vary!</p>

<h2 id="what-im-looking-for-in-a-chip-sdk">What I’m looking for in a chip SDK</h2>

<p>My ideal chip SDK provides a way to build and flash projects using tools of
my choosing. This seems like a low bar, but few meet it. Here are things chip
SDKs should <strong>not</strong> do.</p>

<h3 id="dont-choose-my-laptop-os-for-me">Don’t choose my laptop OS for me!</h3>

<p>I left Windows behind when I worked at Sun Microsystems, and I have not looked
back. Today, my daily driver is a MacBook Air.  Unfortunately, some chip vendors
require that you use their Windows-based tools to set up and build your projects.
Now that most compilers are cross-platform, there is no excuse for it.</p>

<h3 id="dont-choose-my-ide-for-me">Don’t choose my IDE for me!</h3>

<p>I’ve been using <code>vim</code> since college, and you can take it from my cold, dead
hands. I love <code>vim</code>! I have it configured just so. It’s lightweight, it’s fast,
and modal editing is the way to work (prove me wrong!). So you’ll understand my
dismay at the spate of Eclipse-based IDEs chip vendors want to foist upon me. I
want nothing to do with their boated, Java environments.</p>

<p>Instead of Eclipse-based IDE, I suggest SDKs provide Makefiles. <code>make</code> is the
lowest common denominator build system, and is well supported by many tools.
Bonus points for project files for IAR and Keil, since many of you like those
tools.</p>

<h3 id="do-include-some-examples">Do include some examples</h3>

<p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a working code example is worth a
million. Give me one example of each of the main use cases for your MCU. Bonus
points if you give me an example for each peripheral.</p>

<h2 id="ten-popular-chip-sdks-ranked">Ten Popular Chip SDKs, Ranked</h2>

<h3 id="nordic-semi-nrf5-sdk---1010">Nordic Semi nRF5-SDK - 10/10</h3>

<p>Nordic semiconductor’s line of Cortex-M4 MCUs includes the nRF52810, nRF52810,
and nRF52840. All feature a 2.4GHz radio, which may deter you if all you want is
an MCU.</p>

<p>The nRF5-SDK (soon to be replaced by the equally excellent nRF-Connect-SDK), is
in my view the best chip SDK out there.</p>

<h4 id="why-the-rating">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ✅</li>
</ul>

<p>The nRF5 SDK does everything right. No registration, no install, no online
configurator. It even is distributed under a BSD license!</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-blinky-example">Compiling a Blinky example</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Download the nRF5 SDK from <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Software/nRF5-SDK/Download#infotabs" target="_blank">nRF5 SDK downloads - nordicsemi.com</a>
</li>
  <li>Unzip the resulting <code>DeviceDownload.zip</code> file</li>
  <li>Unzip the SDK archive contained within. In my case that’s <code>nRF5SDK1702d674dde.zip</code>
</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the example you are interested in. Examples are contained within the <code>example</code> folder. In my case, <code>examples/peripheral/blinky/pca10040/blank</code>.</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the build system folder of your choice, in my case <code>armgcc</code>
</li>
  <li>Build the example, in my case by invoking <code>GNU_INSTALL_ROOT= make</code>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This will generate a <code>bin</code>, <code>elf</code>, and <code>hex</code> file (among others) under <code>_build</code>.</p>

<h3 id="texas-instruments-tivaware---910">Texas Instruments TivaWare - 9/10</h3>

<p>The Tiva C series is the latest entry in Texas Instruments’s line of Cortex-M
microcontrollers.  I do not have a lot of experience with them, but they seem
like solid microcontrollers with a broad range of peripherals (including USB).</p>

<h4 id="why-the-rating-1">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ✅</li>
</ul>

<p>Like Nordic, Texas Instruments gets a lot right: single-zip download, multi-IDE
support (including Makefiles), and lots of examples. I knocked off a point for
the wonky <code>exe</code> file (see below) and the more complicated license.</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-blinky-example-1">Compiling a Blinky example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Download TiWare SDK from <a href="https://www.ti.com/tool/download/SW-TM4C" target="_blank">SW-TM4C_2.2.0.295, TI.com</a>
</li>
  <li>Rename the downloaded file from <code>exe</code> to <code>zip</code>
</li>
  <li>Unzip it</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the example you are interested in. In my case <code>examples/boards/dk-tm4c129x/blinky</code>.</li>
  <li>Run <code>make</code>, or open the IDE-specific folder of your choice.</li>
</ol>

<p>You’ll be left with an <code>axf</code> (aka an ELF) and a <code>bin</code>  file in the <code>gcc</code> folder.</p>

<h3 id="nxp-mcuxpresso---910">NXP MCUXpresso - 9/10</h3>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/best-and-worst-mcu-sdks/E2992448-AC4D-4A31-9B86-E4806F729E51.png" alt=""></p>

<p>NXP Kinetis traces its lineage to Motorola via Freescale. It is one of two
Cortex-M lines from NXP (the other being the LPC).  Like many MCU vendors, NXP
generates their SDK via a configurator and provides an Eclipse-based IDE, both
under the “MCUXpresso” brand.</p>

<h4 id="why-the-rating-2">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ⚠️</li>
</ul>

<p>I found the online MCUXpresso SDK builder a breeze to use. It is snappy,
straightforward, and it keeps track of all your previously configured SDKs.
Great job, NXP! The only downside of the tool is that it requires you to
register on their website.</p>

<p>I still have a preference for the monolithic SDK with all examples and targets
in one place, but you could argue that this generates a smaller, more
streamlined SDK.</p>

<p>Best of all, the SDK uses <code>cmake</code> to generate build files. <code>cmake</code> is arguably
more portable than <code>make</code>, as it is supported natively on Windows.</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-hello-world-example">Compiling a hello world example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the MCUXpresso SDK builder and create an account: <a href="https://mcuxpresso.nxp.com/" target="_blank">MCUXpresso SDK Builder</a>
</li>
  <li>Once logged in, click on “Select Board” in the sidebar</li>
  <li>Enter the name of your MCU. In my case, a Kinetic K21</li>
  <li>Click on “Build MCUXpresso SDK” on the right</li>
  <li>Name your project, select a toolchain, and some third party software like FreeRTOS or mbedTLS.</li>
  <li>Click on “Download SDK” at the bottom</li>
  <li>After a bit, the SDK will be ready for download</li>
  <li>Unzip the SDK</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the example of your choice, in my case <code>boards/twrk21d50m/demo_apps/hello_world/</code>
</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to build system folder, in my case <code>armgcc</code>
</li>
  <li>Use the <code>build_debug.sh</code> build script and specify the<code>ARMGCC_DIR</code> environment variable:
e.g. <code>ARMGCC_DIR=/usr/local/Cellar/arm-none-eabi-gcc/9-2019-q4-major sh build_debug.sh</code>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This will generate an ELF file.</p>

<h3 id="stm32-cube---810">STM32 Cube - 8/10</h3>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/best-and-worst-mcu-sdks/6DA202F6-ED4E-4FFE-94B7-3A549D0F212F.png" alt=""></p>

<p>ST has gone through multiple iterations of the SDK for the STM32 family of ICs.
The latest is called STM32 Cube, which replaces the venerable Standard
Peripheral Library. While Cube introduces a lot of complexity, it does so for a
good reason: the STM32 family has grown to include 14 distinct series of MCUs
from the very low power L0 to the very high-performance H7.</p>

  <p>Note: Reader Nathan Jones <a href="https://community.memfault.com/t/the-best-and-worst-mcu-sdks-interrupt/294/12" target="_blank">pointed

still exist for STM32. For example, <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/embedded-software/mcu-mpu-embedded-software/stm32-embedded-software/stm32cube-mcu-mpu-packages/stm32cubef1.html" target="_blank">here is the SDK for the
STM32F1</a></p>

<h4 id="why-the-rating-3">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ❌</li>
</ul>

<p>While Cube comes with support for many IDEs, and more examples than any other
MCU SDK, it wraps it all in a clunky desktop app. I had a terrible time using
STM32CubeMX: I had to install it on my laptop, it’s slow, it’s large, it’s
clunky. I do not like it.</p>

<p>STM32CubeMX generates a “project” directory based on your configuration. This
means that you won’t have all the example code in one folder, and instead will
need to generate different projects for different examples.</p>

<p>Necessary complexity? Perhaps. But I miss the simpler Peripheral Library which
came as a single archive.</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-hello-world-example-1">Compiling a Hello World example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Download and install CubeMX: <a href="https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html" target="_blank">STM32CubeMX - STM32Cube initialization code generator - STMicroelectronics</a>. Note: this requires registration on ST’s website</p>
  </li>
  <li>Select “ACCESS TO MCU SELECTOR”</li>
  <li>Select the part you are using. In my case “STM32F429IE”</li>
  <li>In the Configuration view, click on the “Project Manager” tab</li>
  <li>Enter a project name, a path, and select a toolchain. In my case “Makefile”</li>
  <li>Click on “Generate Code” at the top right</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to the generated project directory</li>
  <li>Compile the project with your build system. In my case with <code>make</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Recently acquired by Microchip, Atmel has been making SAM-family MCUs for a long
time. The SAMD21 is well-liked in hobbyist circles and is featured in several
Arduino and Adafruit designs. Atmel’s peripheral library, AXF, went through a
similar transformation to ST’s: it went from a single zip archive to a
configurator.</p>

<h4 id="why-the-rating-4">Why the rating</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Cross-platform ✅</li>
  <li>Supports armcc/Keil, IAR, and Makefiles ✅</li>
  <li>Lots of bundled examples ✅</li>
  <li>Single zip, no install needed ❌</li>
</ul>

<p>Atmel’s configurator is web-based, and a tad more ergonomic than ST’s. However,
the resulting Makefiles are much worse and even feature a bug (I had to fix OS
detection).</p>

<h4 id="compiling-a-hello-world-example-2">Compiling a hello world example</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Go to start.atmel.com</li>
  <li>Click on “Create New Project”</li>
  <li>Select your MCU. In my case a SAMD51 Chip.</li>
  <li>Click on “Export Project” at the top right</li>
  <li>Give it a name, and tick the check-box for your IDE (for me: Makefile)</li>
  <li>Click on “Download Pack”</li>
  <li>Rename resulting file from <code>.azip</code> to <code>.zip</code>
</li>
  <li>Extract it</li>
  <li>
<code>cd</code> to into IDE folder, in my case <code>gcc</code>
</li>
  <li>Fix Makefile OS detection:

<p>Silabs Cortex-M MCU comes from its acquisition of Energy Micro who was famous for
the very low power consumption of their MCUs. Silabs now makes a range of
Cortex-M based MCUs, some with 2.4GHz radios.</p>

<p>Like many of the vendors in the lower half of this list, Silabs distributes
its SDK alongside an Eclipse-based IDE. In their case, they call it “Simplicity
Studio”. While Simplicity is the best of those IDEs, it does leave those of us
who do not love Eclipse with few solutions. Here, I …</p></div></div>

November 14, 2020 | https://slideslist.com/about | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://slideslist.com/about">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                <p>When you search for premium templates for online courses and start looking at the slides, what do you find? </p>

                <p>Fancy graphs. Big numbers. Animations. Stats. World Maps.</p>

                <p>So if you want to create your own online course and teach it using slides, you may think you have to
                    use that.</p>

                  <p>  <strong>Wrong.</strong></p>

                <p>I decided to analyze the best courses and webinars out there from people that are making thousands of dollars, some of them, even millions. I wanted 
                        to understand what type of slides and visuals the top content creators were using.</p>

                <p>I was very surprised after analyzing a couple of them.</p>

                <p>No fancy graphs. No stats, no world maps, no bright and shiny visuals.</p>

                <p>So I checked more. </p>

                <p>I went through 37 top online courses and webinars and... all the slides were fairly simple.</p>

                <p><strong>Here are the 10 types of slides that professional content creators are using for their online
                        courses. And this is all you need to create yours.</strong></p>

                <h3>1. The Main Title</h3>
                <p>This is where you present your course, the title of your lesson, or the main idea for your webinar.
                </p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/cover.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>2. What are you going to learn slide</h3>

                <p>Here you introduce what's coming. People like to know what to expect from the lesson or for the
                    webinar. Normally 3 main points work best.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/whatyou.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>3. Where are we in the course</h3>

                <p>A reminder of the situation of the student, how far are we within the lesson, within the module, or
                    within the course.</p>


                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/whereare.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>4. Alternative Title</h3>

                <p>Similar to the main title, but almost all courses have an alternative way to show another title.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/alttitle.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>The Content</h3>

                <p>There are different ways on how to go about teaching the material, these are the slides used for
                    that:</p>

                <h3>5. A one-line concept</h3>

                <p>Use to explain one concept or idea. You show it on the screen and explain it further talking over it.
                    It goes along with a number generally.</p>


                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/pilar.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>6. A photo on the left (or right) with a text</h3>

                <p>It could be a photo of a phone or tablet with some freebies you are offering. A photo of a person.
                    Uses go from telling people to wait until the end of the webinar, showing a testimonial, or telling
                    a story.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/leftphoto.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>7. The Big Photo</h3>

                <p>Similar that the previous one. A very common use for this is to show a picture of something
                    funny.</p>
                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/bigphoto.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>8. Long Text</h3>

                <p>Sometimes you need more text, and this is what this slide is about, to make people read. That's not
                    recommended, but sometimes could be useful.</p>
                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/titletext.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>9. A quote</h3>


                <p>Almost 100% of the courses I analyzed have quotes.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/quote.png" alt="cover"></p><h3>10. Wrap up</h3>


                <p>A list of the previous one-line concepts into one full slide where you can give a resume of
                    everything you talked about. Very useful to wrap-up your lesson.</p>

                <p><img src="https://d3clwvzq39rwxi.cloudfront.net/cab4dafb-2cb0-482c-b73c-7ca5fd76d81d/images/slidespics/resume.png" alt="cover"></p><p>If you don't want to create them yourself, <a href="https://slideslist.com/">feel free to use all of them</a>, so you can have a starting point to create your online course or
                webinar. If you want to remove the attribution <a href="https://slideslist.com/pricing"> buy a license</a>.</p>

November 14, 2020 | https://www.johnberry.us/blog/fromlogisticsworkertotechcareer/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.johnberry.us/blog/fromlogisticsworkertotechcareer/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The rapid advancement of technology is both a threat and an opportunity for logistics workers. Robotics, autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence could reduce the number of available jobs in certain categories. For example, <a href="http://driverlessreport.org/">one report</a> estimated that 294,000 US trucking jobs could be eliminated over the next 25 years as a result of autonomous vehicle technology. However, the growth of cloud technologies offers an opportunity for these workers to move beyond undifferentiated roles into knowledge work that is more aligned with their organization’s goals. This offers logistics workers the possibility to work in safer and more rewarding jobs that offer higher compensation.</p><p>Logistics employers are recognizing the impact of technology on their recruiting and employee retention efforts. In a <a href="https://www.supplychain247.com/paper/2019_third_party_logistics_study_the_state_of_logistics_outsourcing">2019 survey</a>, 59% of shippers and 3PLs reported that attracting talent was a top workforce issue facing their organization. The quality of an employer’s talent is a critical factor in their ability to execute on their strategic goals and succeed in competitive industries. Successfully leveraging technology investments like SaaS requires the right human resources. In the same 2019 survey, 52% of shippers said changing technology capabilities and advancements, such as digitization, automation, and predictive analytics have altered the workforce and talent strategy at their organizations. In response to these trends, employers are increasingly hiring more technology-savvy logistics workers, more business-savvy technology workers, or hybrid roles that can operate well in both competencies.</p><p>Logistics workers that understand the impact of cloud and the challenges it presents to employers can leverage these trends to transform their careers. A warehouse supervisor that focuses on simple order fulfillment tasks today could become a data analyst that rebalances inventory locations for optimal pick efficiency and reduces labor costs by analyzing seasonality and employee task performance. A customs brokerage associate that reviews trade documentation and keys data into customs software could become a process automation expert that uses cloud services like optical character recognition to automate labor-intensive tasks for her and the rest of her team. Often the first step into more differentiated roles will be value creation in their current position through the use of technology. When significant business results are delivered, leadership will want more. Eventually, new roles or career opportunities may be created to scale the initial results offered by the employee.</p><p>A career transformation from a first-line logistics worker to a logistics technologist requires planning and effort to develop the necessary skills. In work environments that use SaaS tools, these skills can often create career advancement opportunities quickly. Here are five actions logistics workers can take to support their career transformations.</p><h2 id="learn-the-logistics-domain">Learn the Logistics Domain</h2><p>A great technologist can identify business problems and build relevant solutions with technology. An individual cannot do this effectively without putting in the time and effort to learn the business domain. In logistics that means learning about transportation and warehousing. The best way to develop this domain knowledge is to get some experience doing real logistics work. Exposure to common tasks like picking orders, booking freight with carriers, auditing freight bills or communicating with customers will provide a better understanding of operational processes as well as empathy for the workers that perform these tasks.</p><p>Performing real logistics work helps the individual understand business constraints. At a superficial level, processes always appear simple and easy to improve. But by performing the task, it is possible to see the limitations and complexity that have resulted in the current state process. After executing a process in a wide range of conditions, the aspiring technologist can get an in-depth understanding of related problems and potential improvements.</p><p>Typically in any logistics organization, there are a handful of veterans that have a deep understanding of operations processes. Individuals wishing to grow their logistics careers should seek these veterans out and learn from them. An individual with a lengthy career can provide perspective about how business practices have evolved and how various types of technology affected those practices. In some cases, these veterans may not be as comfortable with newer cloud technologies, but their hesitations should be heard out and considered. Frequently SaaS products get things wrong, and highly experienced workers can provide valuable insights that can trigger enhancements or workarounds to the software to improve its efficacy. Perhaps a startup’s mobile app intended for trucker drivers may be failing to get traction. Further feedback from experienced drivers may reveal the app is not ergonomically designed for use while driving, or that the drivers have concerns with the GPS tracking feature. A worker that has spent a career driving a truck would be in an ideal position to recognize these types of obstacles.</p><p>The value of a technology solution is never fully understood until it starts facilitating business transactions with real customers. Logistics workers that interact with customers frequently are in a perfect situation to learn how technology can improve the customer’s experience. When customers need a problem to be solved, workers with strong technology capabilities reach into their toolkit of SaaS capabilities for a creative solution.</p><p>Performing daily logistics work is the most effective way to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the SaaS product. An order picking function on a mobile device may seem perfectly well-designed until an individual uses it to process a live order in the actual warehouse environment. Often constraints that were not initially considered are discovered. Those striving to become technologists in the logistics domain should seek to understand the true operational situation before attempting to automate.</p><h2 id="specialize-in-a-saas-product">Specialize in a SaaS Product</h2><p>Intimate knowledge of the organization’s SaaS products is a critical skill for an aspiring technologist. Typically, logistics workers are only trained on the specific SaaS functions that are relevant to their daily tasks. However, a holistic understanding of the SaaS and its capabilities provides a broader context about how the software is designed and how it can add value.</p><p>Logistics workers can develop their expertise by reviewing the SaaS product’s user documentation and training materials. Sometimes this information is publicly available on the provider’s web site or social media sites. Exploring the provider’s API documentation can also provide a better understanding of the software’s internal architecture and key database entities. If the SaaS provider offers a certification program, workers should use this opportunity to learn the system and demonstrate their knowledge to employers. Examples of these certifications in the logistics field are the Oracle Warehouse Management Cloud 2018 Certified Implementation Specialist and the CargoWise Certified Professional.</p><p>Actively working with the SaaS tool in live business operations will probably be the best way for logistics workers to deepen their knowledge. Whenever new business scenarios are encountered, workers should welcome these opportunities to learn new software features. When internal stakeholders or customers are looking for data, ambitious logistics workers should embrace the challenge to locate the data in the SaaS and extract it into a usable format. Solving real business problems and overcoming daily challenges will lead to a strong foundational knowledge about the SaaS which will support more advanced pursuits like developing automation or integrations.</p><h2 id="automate-and-integrate">Automate and Integrate</h2><p>A common path to creating business value will be automating business processes and integrating systems. Even a rudimentary ability to automate SaaS processes and integrate with the SaaS’s API will be highly valued in the cloud-powered workplace. Logistics workers can start by learning about any existing workflow capabilities in the SaaS tool. Often SaaS tools include built-in automation features that trigger emails, data extracts, or user tasks. One should learn which capabilities are supported natively in the software before moving on to more complex automation approaches.</p><p>Another approach to automating SaaS-based processes is using automation tools that manipulate the user interface. RPA tools like Blue Prism, UiPath, and Automation Anywhere are specifically targeted toward this. However there are simpler ways of automating processes and repetitive tasks. Browser automation tools allow users to record their interactions in a web browser and create scripts to repeat this interaction automatically. This type of tool could be used to start up the SaaS application, log in, navigate to a particular menu item, and trigger a process, at a certain time every day. There are a variety of tools that focus on automating web user interfaces including UI.Vision Kantu, Progress iMacros for Chrome, Katalon Recorder, or the Selenium browser test automation framework. Even simple text expansion tools can help automate some repetitive tasks. Perhaps it is necessary to type the same string of text in notes for every purchase order. A tool like Text Expander can insert snippets of text based on a short abbreviation, and the snippet library can be shared across team members.</p><p>Logistics technologists should also develop a deep understanding of their SaaS tool’s API. If the SaaS is already integrated with a process automation tool, that can be an effective way to start experimenting. Logistics workers can set up workflows that trigger emails when certain events happen in the SaaS, store data in third party services for analysis, or integrate the SaaS with other systems like …</p></div></div>

<article>

<p>
<time datetime="2020-11-14">Saturday, November 14, 2020</time>
</p>
<p>I’ve been running <a href="https://djharper.dev/post/2020/06/07/running-linux-on-my-macbook/">Linux</a> on my personal computer for nearly six months now and just thought I’d write about a neat feature in systemd called <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.socket.html">systemd.socket</a></p>
<h2 id="personal-finance-on-demand">Personal finance on-demand</h2>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Created a socket activated service to spin up a local webapp I use sometimes when something connects to it, and then tear it down again after 5 minutes</p>
<p>I’m a big personal finance nerd and have spent the last 3 years cultivating a ledger file that contains pretty much every facet of my financial life. This file is in a format understood by a suite of command line software called <a href="https://beancount.github.io/">Beancount</a>. It’s is made even better used in conjunction with <a href="https://beancount.github.io/fava/">Fava</a>, a webapp to explore your beancount file.</p>
<p>Fava is a HTTP a service that reads your beancount file stored on disk and presents you with a series of reports and charts to help you make sense of it. I usually only use it when editing my file or occasionally when I need to check something.</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://djharper.dev/img/fava.png"><img src="https://djharper.dev/img/fava.png" title="Example screenshot taken from https://beancount.github.io/fava/"></a>
<figcaption><br>Example screenshot taken from https://beancount.github.io/fava/ </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For quite some time I had this as a <code>--user</code> level systemd service, enabled to run on startup. This worked fine, but I noticed recently that the process seems to consume 2% CPU <em>at all times</em>. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things but battery life on my laptop comes at a premium.</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://djharper.dev/img/fava-cpu.png"><img src="https://djharper.dev/img/fava-cpu.png" title="Fava CPU usage"></a>
<figcaption><br>Fava CPU usage </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This made me think, <em>what if there is a way of starting up Fava only when I need it</em> 🤔, sort of like the serverless compute world where resources are spun up on-demand. It was at this point I remembered reading about <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.socket.html">systemd.socket</a> where you can activate a service when something connects on a socket. At the time I’d filed it away under the “that sounds cool but I’ll probably never use it” place in my brain, but it’s pleasing to now have an actual use case!</p>
<p>The setup is as follows</p>
<p>Create a <code>fava.socket</code> file under <code>~/.config/systemd/user</code> - this sets up the socket.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>Unit<span>]</span>
<span>Description</span><span>=</span>Fava Socket
<span>PartOf</span><span>=</span>fava.service

<span>[</span>Socket<span>]</span>
<span>ListenStream</span><span>=</span><span>127</span>.0.0.1:5000

<span>[</span>Install<span>]</span>
<span>WantedBy</span><span>=</span>sockets.target</code></pre></div>
<p>Create a <code>fava.service</code> file under <code>~/.config/systemd/user</code> - this defines the service</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>[</span>Unit<span>]</span>
<span>Description</span><span>=</span>Fava
<span>After</span><span>=</span>network.target fava.socket

<span>[</span>Service<span>]</span>
<span>Type</span><span>=</span>simple
<span>ExecStart</span><span>=</span>fava -H <span>127</span>.0.0.1 /home/djh/beancount/financials.beancount
<span>RuntimeMaxSec</span><span>=</span><span>300</span> <span># kill the service after 5 minutes.</span>

<span>[</span>Install<span>]</span>
<span>WantedBy</span><span>=</span>default.target</code></pre></div>
<p>Enable and start the socket + service</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user <span>enable</span> fava.socket
systemctl --user start fava.socket</code></pre></div>
<p>Go to a web browser and visit <code>http://127.0.0.1:5000</code> and Fava should load.</p>
<p>After 5 minutes the service will be terminated, but you can start it again by refreshing the page.</p>
<p>Ideally I’d want the socket to terminate the service if nothing connects to it for 5 minutes but I’m not sure how to do that, hence the <code>RuntimeMaxSec</code> setting in the service file 😞</p>
<h2 id="better-ways">Better ways</h2>
<p>You might be wondering why not just host Fava on a Raspberry Pi, it’s a web application afterall. In my case I tend to only use it when editing my beancount file which is stored locally on my Mac. Changes are committed to a git repository when I’m happy with them. The hosted version could listen to changes to this git repository and keep its local copy up to date I suppose, but I’d have to constantly create/push commits to see my changes. This approach also requires network access.</p>
<p>Another way would to just run <code>fava</code> directly on the command line when I need it, but I like the idea of requesting it on demand via a HTTP request and letting systemd handle the rest.</p>
<p>Anyways just thought I’d share x.</p>

      We need to talk.
    </p><div>

<p>Here’s a paraphrased conversation I’m having way to often, costing me way too much time, keeping me from doing things that are way more important:</p>

<pre>User: Hi, I'd like to report a bug in your application.
Me:   Great! Please open a support ticket, then.
User: But, it looks like I need to pay for that?
Me:   So?
User: I just want to tell you that your app is broken, so you can fix it.
Me:   Yes, that's a support request, please open a ticket.
User: ...
</pre>

From there it typically derails into a whiny tirade about me being a crappy two bit developer who doesn’t give a shit about his code (which is ridiculous, since, professional pride aside, I have every incentive to fix bugs, to prevent my inbox from getting flooded) and just wants to rip off his users.</p>

<p>In the past, I sometimes gave in (when it sounded like something might be wrong). I looked at the issue and almost always found that nothing was broken, just didn’t work as expected (which is actually to be expected for every reasonably complex piece of software). The user just didn’t bother reading the docs and tried to bypass the fee by masquerading the support request as a bug report. So, nowadays my policy simply is: no support ticket, no service. Any such request goes straight to the trash folder without even being looked at.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-such-an-asshole">Why am I such an asshole?</h2>

<p>Here’s the thing: I write open source software to solve <strong>my problem</strong>. I let you use my solutions because that comes at zero cost for me (well, almost, I still have to pay for the website, you are downloading from. You are welcome, by the way). I also provide the source code, so you can fix things yourself, should my solution turn out to be unsuitable. However, once you come to me with a “bugreport” that doesn’t also include a patch (or at least very precisely pinpoints the problem), then you are basically asking me to <strong>look at your problem</strong>. At this point, it is no longer zero cost for me and that’s the reason for why I am charging you money: you are asking me to spent time on your behalf. That is commonly called <strong>work</strong>. And surprisingly enough, work is what people expect to be paid for.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m happy to help. Selling support is what keeps the lights on here (did I mention the cost of running a webserver?). But coming to me under false pretense and/or expecting that I <strong>must</strong> provide free service on top of a software I gave away without charge is not going to win you any favours.</p>

<p>It stops being free, when it starts costing me! My time is valuable. If you want a piece of it, I want money in return. Period.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Seems like this post has struck a nerve and caused a few misunderstandings. <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/reactions-bugreport-free-support/">Clarification on my position here</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>I’ve been in big enterprises, as a day job, for almost 6 years now. I’ve also been working on, and growing, a large scale microservice architecture (about 150 microservices) for about 18 months.</p>
<p>In one way microservices give large enterprises the ability to split large work across a variety of teams with isolated codebases. If the published APIs for these microservices don’t change, none of the producers or consumers into that service care about maintenance or features added to that service.</p>
<p>Yet the working of the product as a whole requires all the micoservices to be deployed, with compatible versions, into the deployment environments.</p>
<p>From a high level perspective it doesn’t matter if these services communicate via HTTPS, protobuf, custom TCP protocols, or message buses like Kafka or an MQ flavor. Microservice A still acts on data that’s supposed to be created by Microservice B, and if it’s not there the user’s going to wonder.</p>
<p>If a user posts a photo on a social network type product, and it doesn’t show up after a couple of seconds the user gets worried. If it doesn’t show up ever - because Microservice A posted the photo to some message queue but Microservice B wasn’t deployed to read and respond to the message - that’s actually a bug. As much as a dialog box in the users face would be.</p>
<p>That dependence: Microservice A requires microservice B, which requires microservice C, all deployed for the product <em>and customer’s user journey</em> to work together, is why it’s called a “herd” of microservices. (or a web of microservices, but herd is the more industry-common name).</p>

<p>Enterprise software engineering is waayyy different from startups. Before my time in BigCo land I spent a lot of time in “small projects and startups” land.</p>
<p>I enumerate some of this article’s assumptions here, assuming they are close to universal. My sample size is small, but I don’t think I just got (un) lucky in my experiences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Of &gt; 500 engineers. Some of which work on things totally unknown to you!</li>
<li>codebases owned by teams. (Because in BigCos having a thing owned by a single person makes people antsy, at least in the BigCos I’ve been in. And having a single group of people makes it easy to <em>page them</em>).</li>
<li>Multiple teams per end user project.</li>
<li>The enterprise is now trying to - or successfully have - transitioned to microservices.</li>
<li>Unified discovery or apparent similar route (“oh look the /search api!“. Maybe behind the curtain it’s 5 teams with 20 microservices or lambdas - whatever, the caller doesn’t know or care)</li>
<li>Microservices can be grouped by what downstream or peer services they call or rely on. (The next section will talk about this cluster or “clique” effect)</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: it’s possible - but exceptional - for a microservice to <em>not</em> have an owner. Perhaps the team owning it all got laid off, or all quit before replacements could be hired. From a corporate perspective this is bad - a year or two from now when that microservice breaks, you’ll have a game of hot potato around who needs to fix it… on the double because there’s some customer facing bug. It’s also, very likely, making teams that depend on those microservices nervous, because, “ummm, who <em>is</em> maintaining the Ad Data Repository that we interface with? Ummm…”</p>
<p>Likewise, it’s possible - but should be exceptional - for a microservice to have <em>two</em> owners. In my experience this means you’re either starting to rebuild a monolith, or introducing situations where Team A doesn’t want to deploy but Team B does.</p>

<p>If we consider all the microservices required for a product - or products - to be a herd of microservices you’ll notice something. You’ll notice that these herds form microservice <em>cliques</em> - the login service only talks to the auth database and the email service, but never the file upload service, for example.</p>
<p>Additionally (because this is the enterprise) teams, not individuals, own services. A team may potentially own the majority of services in a clique, or a couple of cliques. If the enterprise is wise there may be some domain drive design modeling going on to better classify these cliques.</p>
<p>I suspect there are three, maybe four, ways to split up the enterprise to serve a product (or multiple products).</p>

<p>Note that the stars in these pictures may be microservices, but could be front end library components.</p>
<h2>Single product, layered approach</h2>

    </span></p>
<p>This organization has teams close to the user, and teams creating services uncoupled from any one product. Imagine the teams working on our social media app, and the a “data platforms” team that handles hard data storage, vendor data imports, or interfaces to the real source of records.</p>
<p>This is very likely Conway’s Law at play: the database team maintains the big database, and (because enterprise) everything currently flows through the big database. This big database is the Source Of Record.</p>
<h3>Another lens</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Teams-Strategies-Successful-Organizations/dp/149195227X/ref=nodl_">Scaling Teams</a> talks about these teams as potentially being part of a platform. Platform in the most generic of words: “the iOS team”, “the web team”, “the android team”. The “APIs” are provided by folks working on “the backend team”.</p>
<p>Yet the diagram still works for this structure of teams. Chapter 7 of <em>Scaling Teams</em> touches on several themes also in this blog entry.</p>
<h2>Many products, layered approach</h2>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Here we have multiple products. Notice that some products aren’t connected to the rest of the herd. Product B is somewhat connected: think how Instagram uses Facebook for authorization, but that’s it.</p>
<h2>Cross functional teams</h2>
<p>Cross functional teams aren’t super new - I heard about them when I was in Total Quality Management classes in college.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://blog.wilcoxd.com/static/7f84f9cd965c4d23f80eff6d50ea3e1b/636d3/cross-functional-teams.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>But the idea here is that a “two pizza team” should be empowered to change everything about some sliver of functionality from the UI all the way down the stack. Because - an often quoted definition - an agile feature isn’t shipped until a user <em>sees</em> it.</p>
<p>I would also posit that these cross-functional teams don’t break Conway’s Law, but may graft a cross-functional layer on top of the existing org structure.</p>
<p>Likewise, I suspect this approach means you have an implicit layered model too. Perhaps you have services created using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/backends-for-frontends">Backend For Frontend</a> design pattern. Our example social media enterprise might have a BFF microservice that supplies data for the mobile app, and a “data layer” service… which a BFF microservice for the Alexa app uses. I attempt to illustrate that in the diagram, in fact.</p>
<p>I’m not convinced GraphQL solves this problem either - you may have queries and mutations used heavily by some other team too.</p>

<p>Regardless of how your org chart really looks, if - and since - teams are coupled to microservices you can either make your system design look like your org chart <em>or</em> facade over that org chart. Either way you can draw a box around microservice owners and (hopefully!) find edges of parts of your business domain. Or, if that doesn’t work, find the cliques and draw boxes around <em>them</em>.</p>
<h2>on data, technical debt as a metaphor, and other cross cutting concerns</h2>
<p>Take a look back at those diagrams. Notice the different database organizations of the various structures. A layered organization will likely have <em>only</em> one or two databases controlled by the product teams (for “closeness of data” or “only <em>we</em> care about this particular part of the data”) where the teams downstream are the “source of record”.</p>
<p>In a fully cross-functional example there <em>is</em> no “downstream”. Yet the organization still has data to store, maintain and guard. Teams may create a database or two, or one per microservice, to store this data. Yet I would argue that “data standards” is an enterprise wide concern. Is the data secured in transmit and rest, potentially using approved data storage tech, with proper access rights? No enterprise wants a privacy leak and lawsuit like Target or Equifax.</p>
<p>So, how does an enterprise, or a group of teams working on a single product inside the enterprise, establish data standards?</p>
<p>Likewise, how does “technical debt” - perhaps “oh yeah we should secure this database, it’s some technical debt we need to clean up” of a microservice, of a clique, affect the herd? Or the product? Or the business?</p>
<p>In fact, I’m starting to dislike the analogy of technical debt, and starting to lean into the idea of the <a href="https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/1314311394406346752?s=21">functional capability</a> of a system.</p>
<p>In the US there’s often both bad roads and lots of road construction, so the model of functional capacity of a system being <strong>a road to deliver the customer journey</strong> feels natural to me.</p>
<p>If our journey is to drive features to the customer, then we want well paved roads so we can drive quickly, not dirt roads where 35MPH is all you can go. We also want certain, built in, abilities of the road: smooth ride, experts on call in case we break a tire (or a database!), and potentially some kind of guidance to ensure our car is safe to use on the road and not harming others or the environment (like spewing customer data everywhere).</p>
<p>This is the topic of a future blog post: roads and feature capacity of microservice herds. Which will be a much easier conversation to have now that we understand microservices, cliques, herds, products, teams, and how enterprises mash those concepts up in different ways.</p></section></div>]]>

  <article>

    <p>
        <time datetime="">10 Nov 2020</time>
      </p>

    <p>This post is clearing up confusions around mocking in Elixir. If you were ever confused about mocks and stubs in Elixir, I made it 100% clear for you.</p>

<p><strong>Mocking</strong> is the testing technique to replace underlying code behaviour with the response we want. Typically we use it to mock modules that depend on 3rd-party services, APIs, internet connection, or system dependencies. <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/mox/Mox.html">Mox</a> is my go-to library for mocking in Elixir.</p>

<p>Note that the distinction between mocks and stubs is highly inconsistent across the literature. I am using my own understanding of the terms that is aligned with the Mox documentation.</p>

<h2 id="stubs">Stubs</h2>

<p>Before we dive into mocking, let’s define stubs and how we can use them without any mocking at all.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub">Wikipedia</a> a <strong>stub</strong> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A method stub or simply stub in software development is a piece of code used to stand in for some other programming functionality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like to remember it as a counterfoil of a document in the physical world.</p>

<p>Replacing the real modules with stubs is as easy as using dependency injection or simply taking advantage of the environment configuration:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># config/config.exs</span>
<span>config</span> <span>:my_app</span><span>,</span> <span>Subscriptions</span><span>,</span> <span>stripe_service:</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>StripeService</span>

<span># config/test.exs</span>
<span>config</span> <span>:my_app</span><span>,</span> <span>Subscriptions</span><span>,</span> <span>stripe_service:</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceStub</span>

<span># lib/my_app/subscriptions.ex</span>
<span>defmodule</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>@stripe_service</span> <span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>get_env</span><span>(</span><span>:my_app</span><span>,</span> <span>__MODULE__</span><span>)[</span><span>:stripe_service</span><span>]</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>charge_customer</span><span>(</span><span>customer_id</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>@stripe_service</span><span>.</span><span>charge_customer</span><span>(</span><span>customer_id</span><span>)</span>
    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can also use a <code>test_helper.exs</code> file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Application</span><span>.</span><span>put_env</span><span>(</span><span>:my_app</span><span>,</span> <span>:stripe_service</span><span>,</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceStub</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>MyApp.StripeService</code> could be our wrapper around Stripity Stripe library accessing stripe.com. <code>StripeServiceStub</code> would be a module not too different from <code>MyApp.StripeService</code> returning predefined responses.</p>

<p>The idea is that all the code that needs Stripe working will be satisfied with a generic response. It’s straightforward.</p>

<p>I like to put such modules in <code>test/support/stubs/</code> directory with the full path and a name with appended <code>Stub</code>. This is just my convention.</p>

<p>If we want to stay organized, we should also define common behaviour:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># lib/my_app/subscriptions/stripe_service.ex</span>
<span>defmodule</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeService</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>@behaviour</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceBehaviour</span>

<span># test/support/stubs/stripe_service_stub.ex</span>
<span>defmodule</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceStub</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>@behaviour</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceBehaviour</span>

<span># lib/my_app/subscriptions/stripe_service_behaviour.ex</span>
<span>defmodule</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceBehaviour</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>@callback</span> <span>charge_customer</span><span>(</span><span>integer</span><span>())</span> <span>::</span> <span>tuple</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This behaviour will also become crucial when using Mox.</p>

<h2 id="mocks">Mocks</h2>

<p>Most of the time, stubs won’t be enough because we want some flexibility. If we call <code>MyApp.Subscriptions.charge_customer</code>, we might want to adjust the response based on the scenario we are working with. More likely than not, we want to test all possible error responses.</p>

<p><strong>Mock</strong> objects in object-oriented programming are mimicking the behaviour of the actual objects. Similarly, mocks in Mox mimick the behaviour of modules and their functions.</p>

<p>I like to remember mocking as mimicking someone in the physical world.</p>

<p>When introducing Mox, we should think about stubs as our defaults. I like to put a typical success path into the stub. Stubs are great for this because I can use 100 stubs across the whole system and still test a module at hand at any level of abstractions.</p>

<p>So, how to transform from plain stubs to stubs with Mox? First, we should write our behaviour as above. Then we can to define a mock module for our behaviour in <code>test/stubs/mox.ex</code> as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># test/stubs/mox.ex</span>
<span>Mox</span><span>.</span><span>defmock</span><span>(</span><span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceMock</span><span>,</span>
  <span>for:</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceBehaviour</span>
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The mock module can be named as you wish, but I like to keep things organized by appending <code>Mock</code>.</p>

<p>This mock module is a module Mox can now use to mimick the behaviour we predefined. With this change, we could import Mox in a test file and start mocking.</p>

<p>To make a fallback for our mock, we have to tell Mox to default to the stub module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># test/support/stripe_service_mock.ex</span>
<span>defmodule</span> <span>StripeServiceMock</span> <span>do</span>

<p>Awesome, now we are ready to change our test config to the mock module:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># config/test.exs</span>
<span>config</span> <span>:my_app</span><span>,</span> <span>Subscriptions</span><span>,</span> <span>stripe_service:</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>StripeServiceMock</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="mocking">Mocking</h2>

<p>We configured a mock module in tests for our <code>MyApp.Subscriptions</code> module. We also told Mox to default to the stub module. We are ready to write some tests, aren’t we?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>SubscriptionsTest</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>alias</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>Subscriptions</span>

  <span>use</span> <span>StripeServiceMock</span><span>,</span> <span>async:</span> <span>true</span>

  <span>describe</span> <span>"charge_customer/1"</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>setup</span> <span>:create_customer</span>

    <span>test</span> <span>"charges the right amount"</span><span>,</span> <span>%{</span><span>customer:</span> <span>customer</span><span>}</span> <span>do</span>

      <span># asserts</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>By using the <code>StripeServiceMock</code> module, we are automatically defaulting to the stub modules as if we would specify it in the config directly. This is especially useful for higher level code that is not even concerned with Stripe at all.</p>

<p>What about the errors?</p>

<p>If we import Mox, we can <em>mock</em> any specific function.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyApp</span><span>.</span><span>SubscriptionsTest</span> <span>do</span>

      <span># asserts</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By piping the mock module to <code>Mox.stub/2</code> we are able to <em>mimick</em> the behaviour of <code>charge_customer/1</code> with another <em>stub</em>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><div><h2 id="because-they-probably-wont">…because they probably won’t</h2><p>I recently watched a few videos on YouTube about the latest and greatest LEGO sets. I didn’t do it because I’m super interested in LEGO (that was a while ago) but because the YouTube algorithm decided that I had to. I naturally obeyed. The results were as expected: I felt old and none of those sets triggered any kind of “I need to have this” response. Until I saw this:</p><p><img src="https://www.krewast.de/img/artikel-lego-tree-house.jpg" alt="Lego Tree House"></p><p>This beautiful tree house immediately sparked my interest. It’s cute, it’s not one of those boring license sets (Star Wars, Harry Potter, Minecraft, …), the price to number of LEGO pieces ratio is okay (still super expensive!) and it would fit nicely between my house plants which I foster - and sometimes kill - in my living room.</p><p>So, I did something I usually never do: I made an impulse buy. I put the 195&nbsp;€ tree house into the shopping cart, created a LEGO user account, entered all my data, chose “Invoice” as payment method and clicked “Buy”. I received the automatic “Thank you for your purchase” e-mail and felt happy.</p><h2 id="we-are-sorry">We are sorry</h2><p>On the next day I received another e-mail. This time from the LEGO customer service. You can find the original German version at the end of this post, here is a short translation of the important part:</p><blockquote>Dear Bastian Kres,<p>thank you for ordering your LEGO® toy directly from us.</p><p>Unfortunately, the total amount of your order exceeds the credit limit for payment on account and by direct debit. Therefore, we are not able to send this order yet.</p><p>Please call us to pay by VISA or MasterCard. […]</p></blockquote><p>Well, here’s the thing: LEGO knew that I was a first time customer and they also knew that the total amount of my order was about 195 €. If they didn’t want me to pay on account, why did they offer me the option?</p><h2 id="how-to-kill-enthusiasm">How to kill enthusiasm</h2><p>1.) I would like to mention that wouldn’t have had a problem to pay in advance. PayPal or credit card are good options which I use all the time. But by sending me this e-mail after I already selected my preferred payment method and ordered the thing, LEGO basically tells me that I cannot be trusted. And at the same time they want me to trust them…</p><p>2.) As I wrote before, this purchase was an impulse buy. The tree house is something I wanted. But after receiving this e-mail I had lot of time to think about whether or not I still do? Especially because I could buy a huge amount of real plants for 195&nbsp;€. That would be good for nature, but bad for LEGO.</p><p>3.) By postponing the delivery until after I paid, they also created a whole new experience for me. Now I don’t have the tree house in my hands, see how nice it is and pay happily. No, now I have this bitter taste in my mouth and a decision to make. Should I really be making decisions after I already ordered something?</p><h2 id="some-lessons-for-online-stores">Some lessons for online stores</h2><p>As a web developer I always find it interesting to see how even very big companies still make mistakes like this. But the good thing is: We can learn from them!</p><ul><li>Make it easy for customers to order from you, avoid any friction or inconveniences</li><li>Offer customers a broad set of payment options, omit those you deem too risky</li><li>Don’t send customers “We don’t trust you” messages after they already ordered something from you. It totally kills their enthusiasm</li></ul><p>And that’s it.</p><p>One last question remains: Did LEGO dodge a bullet because I would have sent the tree house back anyway? Maybe, but probably not. I rarely send anything back for two reasons: It’s an effort and I’m generally lazy ;)</p><p>If any of this sound snarky: I’m sorry, that was never my intention. I just found it interesting (and wanted to share) how LEGO decided to set up this process, what consequences it can have and how I probably won’t get a new toy but at least ten new house plants.</p><hr><p>Obligatory link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_EZd3lsmxudu3IQzpTzOgw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Held der Steine</a> and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIQJV2o6EPY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">LEGO Tree House</a> video.</p><h2 id="the-original-german-e-mail">The original German e-mail</h2><blockquote>Guten Tag Bastian Kres,<p>vielen Dank, dass Sie Ihr LEGO® Spielzeug direkt bei uns bestellt haben.</p><p>Leider überschreitet die Gesamtsumme Ihrer Bestellung die Kreditgrenze für Zahlung auf Rechnung und per Lastschriftverfahren.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<div>

			
<p>Governments are back on their anti-encryption bullshit again.</p>



<p>Between the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/">U.S. Senate’s “EARN IT” Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">E.U.’s slew of anti-encryption proposals</a>, and <a href="https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/">Australia’s new anti-encryption law</a>, it’s become clear that the authoritarians in office view online privacy as a threat to their existence.</p>



<p>Normally, when the governments increase their anti-privacy sabre-rattling, technologists start talking more loudly about Tor, Signal, and other privacy technologies (usually only to be drowned out by paranoid people who think Tor and Signal are government backdoors or something stupid; conspiracy theories ruin everything!).</p>



<p><strong>I’m not going to do that.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, I’m going to show you how to add end-to-end encryption to any communication software you’re developing. (Hopefully, I’ll avoid making <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/">any bizarre design decisions</a> along the way.)</p>



<p>But first, some important disclaimers:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Yes, you should absolutely do this.</strong> I don’t care how banal your thing is; if you expect people to use it to communicate with each other, you should make it so that you can never decrypt their communications.</li><li>You should absolutely NOT bill the thing you’re developing as an <em>alternative</em> to Signal or WhatsApp.</li><li>The goal of doing this is to increase the amount of end-to-end encryption deployed on the Internet that the service operator cannot decrypt (even if compelled by court order) and make E2EE normalized. The goal is NOT to compete with highly specialized and peer-reviewed privacy technology.</li><li>I am not a lawyer, I’m some furry who works in cryptography. The contents of this blog post is not legal advice, nor is it endorsed by any company or organization. Ask the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> for legal questions.</li></ol>



<p>The organization of this blog post is as follows: First, I’ll explain <a href="#symmetric-key-encryption">how to encrypt and decrypt data between users</a>, assuming you have a key. Next, I’ll explain <a href="#key-agreement">how to build an authenticated key exchange</a> and <a href="#session-key-management">a ratcheting protocol to determine the keys used in the first step</a>. Afterwards, I’ll explore <a href="#identity-key-management">techniques for binding authentication keys to identities and managing trust</a>. Finally, I’ll discuss <a href="#backdoor-resistance">strategies for making it impractical to ever backdoor your software (and impossible to silently backdoor it)</a>, just to piss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the creeps and tyrants of the world</a> off even more.</p>



<p>You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing.</p>







<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>



<h3 id="choosing-a-cryptography-library">Choosing a Cryptography Library</h3>



<p>In the examples contained on this page, I will be using the <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">Sodium cryptography library</a>. Specifically, my example code will be written with the <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus">Sodium-Plus</a> library for JavaScript, since it strikes a good balance between performance and being cross-platform.</p>


<pre title="">const { SodiumPlus } = require('sodium-plus');

(async function() {
     // Select a backend automatically
     const sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();
     
     // Do other stuff here
})();
</pre>


<p>Libsodium is <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html">generally the correct choice for developing cryptography features in software</a>, and is available in most programming languages,</p>



<p>If you’re prone to choose a different library, you should consult your cryptographer (and yes, you should have one on your payroll if you’re doing things different) about your design choices.</p>



<h3>Threat Modelling</h3>



<p>Remember above when I said, “You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing”?</p>



<p>How far you go in implementing the steps outlined on this blog post should be informed by <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">a threat model</a>, not an ad hoc judgment.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re encrypting user data and storing it in the cloud, you probably want to pass <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/">the Mud Puddle Test</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.<br>2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but<em>&nbsp;won’t for the life of you&nbsp;</em>be able to&nbsp;recall your device passwords or keys.<br>3. Now try to get your cloud data back.</p><p>Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way around your provider’s internal policy checks.</p></div><cite>Matthew Green describes the Mud Puddle Test, which Apple products <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">definitely don’t pass</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you must fail the Mud Puddle Test for your users, make sure you’re clear and transparent about this in the documentation for your product or service.</p>







<h2 id="symmetric-key-encryption">I. Symmetric-Key Encryption</h2>



<p>The easiest piece of this puzzle is to encrypt data in transit between both ends (thus, satisfying the loosest definition of end-to-end encryption).</p>



<p>At this layer, you already have some kind of symmetric key to use for encrypting data before you send it, and for decrypting it as you receive it.</p>



<p>For example, the following code will encrypt/decrypt strings and return hexadecimal strings with a version prefix.</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v1";

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Under-the-hood, this is using <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-xchacha20poly1305">XChaCha20-Poly1305</a>, which is less sensitive to timing leaks than AES-GCM. However, like AES-GCM, this encryption mode doesn’t provide <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">message- or key-commitment</a>.</p>



<p>If you want key commitment, you should derive two keys from <code>$key</code> using a KDF based on hash functions: One for actual encryption, and the other <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153">as a key commitment value</a>.</p>



<p>If you want message commitment, you can use AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 or XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b-MAC.</p>



<p>If you want both, ask <a href="https://mumble.net/~campbell/">Taylor Campbell</a> about his BLAKE3-based design.</p>



<p>A modified version of the above code with key-commitment might look like this:</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v2";

/**
 * Derive an encryption key and a commitment hash.
 * @param {CryptographyKey} key
 * @param {Uint8Array} nonce
 * @returns {{encKey: CryptographyKey, commitment: Uint8Array}}
 */
async function deriveKeys(key, nonce) {
    const encKey = new CryptographyKey(await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x01].append(nonce)),
        key
    ));
    const commitment = await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x02].append(nonce)),
        key
    );
    return {encKey, commitment};
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(commitment) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(114));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const storedCommitment = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50, 114));
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);
    if (!(await sodium.sodium_memcmp(storedCommitment, commitment))) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect commitment value");
    }
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Another design choice you might make is to encode ciphertext with base64 instead of hexadecimal. That doesn’t significantly alter the design here, but it does mean your decoding logic has to accommodate this.</p>



<p>You SHOULD version your ciphertexts, and include this in the AAD provided to your AEAD encryption mode. I used “v1” and “v2” as a version string above, but you can use your software name for that too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>For the past year, I've been on a leave of absence from college working on a startup. As I prepare for my return to school, what comes next has been on my mind.</p><p>Leaving college made me realize there are more career options than ever seemed available to me as a student. I would have expected that taking time off would have had the opposite effect—bringing me up to speed on the areas that interest me and those I should steer clear of. Naturally, the list of options should have winnowed after stepping outside of the college bubble. On the contrary, I find myself with dozens of ideas of things to work on, far more than what seemed possible in college.</p><p>College made it seem like there were just a few worthwhile career tracks. When I chose to take time off, I left in the middle of my junior year during the peak of on-campus recruiting, the process by which Harvard students compete for internships at a narrow list of companies. I say "narrow" to emphasize the fact that just three industries captured the attention of my peers: <strong>finance, big tech, and consulting (FTC)</strong>. When you subtract out the students attending grad school or who don't immediately enter the workforce, nearly half choose one of these fields.<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> Why?</p><h3>Why FTC?</h3><p>The simplest explanation is money. Students want high-paying jobs and these are industries that pay higher on average. But it's naive to chalk all of this up to economics—there are many instances when students are offered an equally competitive job in terms of salary and still opt for FTC. I recall many different industries, such as consumer packaged goods companies, recruiting and offering salaries similar to entry-level management consulting—but they were seldom the talk of campus.</p><p>Neither is it interest. The average Harvard student would probably prefer to work on Google Maps over Kraft Mac &amp; Cheese, but this doesn't explain why students have such narrow interests <em>within</em> FTC. Why are Google and Facebook so attractive to prospective engineers while Stripe and Nvidia are never brought up? Or why do aspiring consultants obsess over McKinsey, Bain, and BCG to the exclusion of more boutique firms with similar compensation structures?<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> Holding interest constant, students' decisions are still clustered around a few companies.</p><p>When discussing management consulting, many students talked about how they liked the "optionality" that the industry offered. In short, they viewed it as a few more years of college without the pressure to choose a particular career path. I think people felt similarly about finance and big tech—they didn't narrow your career trajectory in the same way a more niche company might have. But again, this doesn't explain why within FTC, students are still so fixated on a few specific companies.</p><p>When I asked my peers why they preferred these particular firms, they often answered that they were better than the rest of the industry. But by which logic are they better? When asked about the specifics, they'd often give vague non-answers that seemed almost scripted. "I like Bain because I feel like I have a good fit with the firm". Or, "Goldman is attractive to me because it has a culture of excellence." These answers were unsatisfying because it was clear they were ad hoc rationalizations. Thankfully, one student was once blunt enough to confirm what everyone already knew: "I want Google on my resume because it is prestigious." For most, these firms were top of mind because they were prestigious, not because they resonated particularly well with the individual applicant.</p><p>For students unsure of what career to pursue, prestige is often the driving metric in job selection. For many, prestige is useful in that it guarantees one is respected and admired for the job they ultimately choose. This explains the ad hoc rationalizations from before and why students often expressed interest in FTC before they even fully understood what their work would entail. it's like a kindergartener saying "doctor" when adults ask them what they want to be when they grow up. Their answer says more about the desires of the group than themselves.<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p><h3>What is Prestige?</h3><p>Prestige is a measure of how much status a group assigns to something. From this definition, a lot of interesting qualities of prestige can be discerned.</p><p>Since prestige depends upon what the <em>group</em> thinks, then it follows that it is not a fixed nor immutable quality. Groups of people differ everywhere, so what is prestigious in one place is not necessarily prestigious in another.</p><p>For example, many college students would love to work for a Silicon Valley startup—but I know of few Harvard students who prefer startups over big tech. Again, this isn't an economic decision—recruits of later-stage startups can command the same or even better compensation than FAANG in some cases—but I've never heard of a Harvard CS major wanting to work for Stripe.<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> This is surprising since Stripe is prestigious <em>within</em> the Valley itself. Prestige's dependence on the group makes it a localized phenomenon.</p><p>Prestige also changes over time. What we considered prestigious a hundred years ago is very different from what we do today because social status has changed a lot. Understanding the evolution of social status is worthy of a whole separate essay (or perhaps a book). However, I suspect that prestige is closely linked to our economy and thus downstream of culture, policy, and most of all, technology. This would explain why it's more prestigious to start a startup today than it was a hundred years ago—one can simply become a lot richer than they could before.</p><h3>The Roots of Prestige</h3><p>So if prestige depends upon what people find to be high status, then where does it originate in the first place? That is, how does a group come to deem something prestigious initially? The best <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">explanation</a> for prestige I've seen thus far comes from Paul Graham:</p><blockquote><p>"Prestige is just fossilized inspiration. If you do anything well enough, you'll <em>make</em> it prestigious. Plenty of things we now consider prestigious were anything but at first. Jazz comes to mind—though almost any established art form would do. So just do what you like, and let prestige take care of itself."</p></blockquote><p>Groups assign status to the things which accurately signal the values and aspirations of that group. For elite college students, FTC originally became prestigious because they represented the height of excellence in the workforce at some point—something this group deeply values.</p><p>Each of the top companies within FTC once transformed their industries, inspiring the ambitious to follow suit. For example, James McKinsey <a href="https://longreads.com/2013/10/23/the-making-of-mckinsey-a-brief-history-of-management/">invented</a> managerial accounting and dramatically improved his clients' budgeting processes. Goldman employees <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/history/a-brief-history-of-gs.pdf">pioneered</a> the price-to-earnings ratio, now ubiquitous in modern finance. And of course, Gates, Jobs, and other big tech founders are revered in American culture. These accomplishments earned their firms a prestigious reputation once, and they've managed to keep it ever since.</p><p>Prestige is self-reinforcing for its holders in the same way that network effects make big tech hard to topple. Namely, prestigious firms leverage their name and rigorous hiring practices to target top students for recruitment. As students see the best of their class joining these firms, the companies' reputation becomes further entrenched, attracting the next generation of talent. Prestige acts as a competitive moat for these firms and replicates itself over time.</p><h3>The Prestige Trap</h3><p>At first glance, it doesn't seem worrisome to factor prestige into one's job search. If these firms benefit so greatly from their prestige, wouldn't students also be well-served by having them on their resume? Maybe, but only if students are focusing on the right thing.</p><p>Prestige, like the social status it serves as a proxy for, is useful as a form of signaling. To the uninformed observer, it indicates that one is a member of the highly successful creative class. We assume, because we associate these firms with excellence, that possessing prestigious titles demonstrates excellence too. Furthermore, it's hard to evaluate people individually, so we often outsource our decision making and rely upon prestige as a neutral arbiter, regardless of its accuracy.</p><p>If third-parties look at prestige as an indicator of excellence, then it becomes a rough heuristic for replicating success in one's social environment. The top FTC companies represent an opportunity for elite students to become a James McKinsey or Henry Goldman in their own right. Ambitious students seek out prestige thinking it is the missing ingredient to achieving their own excellence. In reality, they have it backward—prestige <em>follows</em> excellence. Exposure to prestige can't make you successful any more than spending time around rich people can make you wealthy.<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup></p><p>Achieving prestige and excellence are not mutually exclusive. Although, one does depend upon the other. Pursuing prestige for its own sake will not lead to excellence, but the reverse can occur. When most ambitious students turn to prestige as a heuristic, they're really just trying to answer the question: "How do I become successful in life and achieve great things?" This explains why many of my peers returned from these prestigious jobs and internships, feeling more dissatisfied than before. They realized that what they were looking for was deeper and more nuanced than could be provided for by an additional resume item.</p><p>Unfortunately, optimizing for prestige is a poor source of evolutionary pressure. It is usually easier to feign excellence than for one to actually cultivate it. Getting a job at a big tech company is a very different thing than becoming an excellent software engineer. A student can find themselves with all of the trappings of success—the distinguished credentials, resume fillers, and prestigious titles—but without having achieved the true excellence they were seeking in the first place. In this way, prestige becomes a trap.</p><p>Why do top students fall for this trap and chase …</p></section></div>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The Polish QWERTY variant named "lefty", introduced below, moves all the Polish
letters to keys that are accessed by the left hand.  The right hand's sole
responsibility is simply holding the <code>AltGr</code> modifier key.</p>

<p>This eliminates the three awkward typing positions for the letters: <code>Ł</code>, <code>Ó</code>
and <code>Ń</code>.</p>

<h2>Streszczenie</h2>

<p>Przedstawiam poniżej wariant polskiej klawiatury QWERTY o nazwie
"lefty". Wariant ten umieszcza wszystkie polskie litery pod klawiszami
obsługiwanymi lewą ręką. Jedyną rolą prawej ręki pozostaje przytrzymywanie
klawisza <code>AltGr</code>.</p>

<p>Pozwala to na wyeliminowanie uciążliwych kombinacji dla liter <code>Ł</code>, <code>Ó</code>, oraz
<code>Ń</code>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Polish Letters</h2>

<p>Here is a standard PC ISO QWERTY keyboard. This is the kind of (physical)
keyboard we use in Poland. Some computers come with an ANSI keyboard (flat,
wide Enter key), and other come with an ISO keyboard (tall Enter key,
pictured). To Polish typists, however, the ISO/ANSI distinction doesn't make
that much of a difference, because neither of these layouts have decidated keys
for our special letters.</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty.png" alt="qwerty keyboard"></p>

<p>We must fit the following 9 letters (in upper- and lowercase) in our keyboard
layout, on top of all the standard Latin letters:</p>

<p><strong><code>Ą</code> <code>Ć</code> <code>Ę</code> <code>Ł</code> <code>Ń</code> <code>Ó</code> <code>Ś</code> <code>Ź</code> <code>Ż</code></strong></p>

<p>How will we do this? We'll need to use special key combinations.</p>

<h2>AltGr, the Lopsided Alt</h2>

<p>They way most systems (Windows, Linux) accomplish the task of adding Polish
letters to an ISO keyboard is by using the right 'Alt' key as 'AltGr' — a
modifier key that upgrades regular letters on the keyboard to weird
glyphs. (For example, holding <code>AltGr+2</code> emits the <code>²</code> character,
<code>AltGr+Shift+-</code> gives me the emdash:—.)</p>

<p>The thing to note is that <strong>there is only one AltGr key on the keyboard!</strong> This
is the right <code>alt</code> key, because the left one is still necessary to function as
the regular <code>alt</code>. Case in point: <code>alt+tab</code> window switching does not work with
the <code>AltGr</code> key.</p>

<p>To type Polish letters, we hold down the <code>AltGr</code> key and press the
corresponding key to type a lowercase letter, and <code>AltGr+Shift+key</code> to get the
uppercase.</p>

<table>
  <thead> <tr><td>Key</td><td>Polish letter</td><td>Typing hand</td></tr> </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr><td>E</td><td>Ę</td><td>left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>O</td><td>Ó</td><td><b>right</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td>A</td><td>Ą</td><td>left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>S</td><td>Ś</td><td>left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>L</td><td>Ł</td><td><b>right</b></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Z</td><td>Ż</td><td>left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>X</td><td>Ź</td><td>left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>C</td><td>Ź</td><td>left</td></tr>
  <tr><td>N</td><td>Ń</td><td><b>right</b></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>Now, most of these keys are in nice positions at the left edge of the keyboard,
so that one can hold the <code>AltGr</code> key with the right hand, and type the letter
key with the left. There are, however, three very uncomfortable typing positions:</p>

<h3>The Awkward <code>Ł</code></h3>

<p>The letter <code>ł</code>, once pronounced as <em>dark l</em> <code>ɫ</code>, now pronounced roughly like
the English <code>w</code>, is the most common of the Polish special letters, and
comprises ~1.80% of Polish texts. That's a lot!</p>

<p>Look how awkward it is to type:</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_logonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + l key highlighted in red"></p>

<p>This is manageable if your right Alt Key is right underneath the <code>,</code> key, where
it can be held down with the right thumb. Like on this Thinkpad keyboard:
<img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/altgr_nice.png" alt="thinkpad keyboard AltGr position"></p>

<p>It's much worse if your <code>AltGr</code> key is way out to the right, like on this old
mechanical keyboard:</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/altgr_bad.png" alt="classic keyboard AltGr position"></p>

<h3>The Odious <code>Ó</code></h3>

<p>This letter is pronounced exactly like <code>u</code>, but is used in different
grammatical contexts. That's not important, but what's important is that it
comprises roughly 0.9% of all Polish texts, so you need to type it quite often.</p>

<p>Here's its default position:</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_oogonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + o key highlighted in red"></p>

<h3>The Noisome <code>Ń</code></h3>

<p>The letter <code>Ń</code> is pronounced rougly like the Spanish <code>Ñ</code>. Comprising only 0.2% of
Polish texts, it's not all that frequent, but still a pain to type.</p>

<p>The right hand must contort like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_nogonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + polish n key highlighted in red"></p>

<h2>The Well-Placed Letters</h2>

<p>The remaining letters of the Polish alphabet are placed conveniently under the
left typing hand. Interestingly, the letter <code>Ź</code> is placed under the <code>X</code> key,
because <code>Z</code> is already occupied by the letter <code>Ż</code>.</p>

<p>Here they are, all in one happy bunch:</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_good_ogonki.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + polish ę,ą,ś,ż,ź,ć keys highlighted in green"></p>

<h2>Some Rearragements</h2>

<p>You might have noticed in the image above, that the <code>Q</code>, <code>W</code>, and <code>D</code> keys are
not used for typing Polish letters. Let's take advantage and complete the 3x3
square, like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_move_ogonki.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + polish ę,ą,ś,ż,ź,ć keys highlighted in green, ó,ł,ń keys highlighted in orange,  and arrows from ó->q, ł->w, ń->d keys"></p>

<h3>Q is an Upside-down Ó</h3>

<p>This one is easy. <code>Q</code> looks like an upside-down <code>Ó</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_oogonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + polish ó key highlighted in red">
<img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_lefty_oogonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + q key highlighted in green"></p>

<h3>W is English for Ł</h3>

<p>This one is phonetically very natural. Polish speakers are used to <code>W</code> being
pronounced like <code>Ł</code> in words of English provenance, such as <em>Whiskey</em> or
<em>Weekend</em>, so let's make it official!</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_logonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + polish ł key highlighted in red">
<img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_lefty_logonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + w key highlighted in green"></p>

<h3>D is Ń. Just Because</h3>

<p>The odd one out is the letter <code>ń</code>. I don't have a good justification for this,
apart from wanting to fit all the Polish letters in the leftmost 3x3 grid on
the keyboard.</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_nogonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + polish ń key highlighted in red">
<img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_lefty_nogonek.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + d key highlighted in green"></p>

<h2>The Polish Lefty Layout</h2>

<p>And so we arrive at the following layout, which removes the awkwardness
associated with having to use the right hand for modifier key combinations.</p>

<p><img src="https://pzel.name/img/lefty/qwerty_lefty_ogonki.png" alt="qwerty keyboard with altgr + q,w,e,a,s,d,z,x,c keys highlighted in green"></p>

<h2>A Call for Ports</h2>

<p>If you like this layout and happen to port it to Windows or Mac OS, please
let me know and I will add it to this page.</p>

<p><em>There is a massive amount of libraries and frameworks written in PHP, providing useful functionalities, some even commercially. You may have come across libraries, such as PDF generators, the Twig templating engine, random data generators, etc. Let’s take a look at how to develop the library for both PHP and .NET, so that C# developers will be able to <em>seamlessly</em></em> <em>consume the functionality, as well.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->


<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following guide explains how to target both PHP and .NET at the same time. The same PHP code that already works will become available as a .NET library, as well. Most importantly, however, a C# developer won’t even notice the library had ever been written in PHP, nor will it matter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code {"language":"bash"} -->
<pre>dotnet add package mjaschen.phpgeo --version 3.2.0-*</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code {"language":"csharp","className":"language-csharp csharp"} -->
<pre>// "Coordinate" and "Vincenity" classes are a part of PHPGeo library which is written in PHP
// It's used in the following sample C# code:

var coordinate1 = new Coordinate(19.820664, -155.468066); // Mauna Kea Summit
var coordinate2 = new Coordinate(20.709722, -156.253333); // Haleakala Summit

Console.WriteLine(coordinate1.getDistance(coordinate2, new Vincenty());</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As an example, we can take a look at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://apps.peachpie.io/Item?id=mjaschen.phpgeo" target="_blank">PHPGeo</a> (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://apps.peachpie.io/" target="_blank">apps.peachpie.io</a>), which we provided as a .NET NuGet package, without any modifications to the original PHP code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:separator -->
<hr>
<!-- /wp:separator -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are a few recommended things to keep in mind when developing for both PHP and .NET. Most of the existing packages are actually following those recommendations already.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Sample Library</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s create a sample library – Dogchi – that provides an instance of a dog with some actions, like the Tamagotchi. The project structure will be as follows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->
<pre>- src
  - dog.php
- composer.json
- dogtchi.msbuildproj</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our sample <code><strong>dog.php</strong></code> code will look like this:</p>

<h2>Strong Typing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The most important part of the project is strong typing. In order to provide a great experience for a C# developer, type hint all the parameters and return types. This has several benefits:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>The code is <strong>cleaner</strong>; obviously, your code will be self-descriptive and forces you to provide a unified and safe API. Also, the runtime will take care of the wrong parameters and NULL checks automatically.</li><li>The code editor will <strong>become smarter</strong>; your development environment can understand your code better and provide better code completion and error checking.</li><li>Finally, the provided library will have the <strong>type-information</strong>. This is important in strongly typed languages, such as C#, where every variable has to be typed. Additionally, the C# editor will understand your code and the user will benefit from the guidance IntelliSense provides – without having to read any of your documentation. </li></ul>

    }
}</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A standard project descriptor – <code>composer.json</code> – provides various metadata. The most important part is the <code>"autoload"</code> section. In .NET, this will be used to take care of the autoloading by itself, <a href="https://www.peachpie.io/2020/05/autoloading-and-composer.html">fully handled by the compiler and runtime</a>. As a result, the C# developer who is not used to explicitly include the magic “autoload.php” script, won’t have to worry about this specific PHP behavior at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>getters and setters</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Properties in PHP are somewhat magical; they can be references, or not. They can be typed, or not. For convenience reasons, it is better to provide the get/set function, like <code>function getAge(): int</code>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>doc comments</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>PHPDoc comments are well understood by everyone. When building a .NET library, all of the source code is removed, but PHPDoc comments become a part of the library and will be provided in the editor’s IntelliSense.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Write the doc comments on all the public functions, so that the users have their documentation where it’s most useful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>project file</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After you have written the PHP library, you are ready to target .NET with it. All of the original source code remains the same, you only have to add a project file – <code><strong>dogtchi.msbuildproj</strong></code>. Its features are described at <a href="https://docs.peachpie.io/php/msbuild/">docs.peachpie.io/php/msbuild/</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code {"language":"xml"} -->
<pre>&lt;Project Sdk="Peachpie.NET.Sdk/1.0.0-preview3"&gt;
  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;OutputType&gt;library&lt;/OutputType&gt;
    &lt;TargetFramework&gt;netstandard2.1&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;
    &lt;GenerateDocumentationFile&gt;true&lt;/GenerateDocumentationFile&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;Compile Include="**/*.php" /&gt;
  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This file is somewhat similar to the <code>composer.json</code> file, but it’s supposed to be used by the <code>dotnet</code> build tool.The important part is the <code>&lt;Compile&gt;</code> element, where you specify what is included in the resulting library.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having installed your <strong>.NET Core SDK</strong>, run the following on the command line, or “build” the project from a development environment, such as Microsoft Visual Studio. The IDE will verify whether everything is set up correctly and compiles your project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->
<pre>dotnet build</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to create a NuGet package that can be consumed by C# developers, run the following command. It builds the release version of the library and packs it into the package:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->
<pre>dotnet pack -c Release -p:Version=0.1.2

Microsoft (R) Build Engine version 16.8.0-preview-20451-02+51a1071f8 for .NET
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

  Determining projects to restore...
  Restored dogtchi.msbuildproj (in 445 ms).
  dogtchi -&gt; bin\Release\netstandard2.1\dogtchi.dll
  Successfully created package 'bin\Release\jakubmisek.dogtchi.0.1.2.nupkg'.</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><code>jakubmisek.dogtchi.0.1.2.nupkg</code> is the newly created NuGet package containing the library without the original source code. Basically, it is a ZIP file containing a descriptor and the library compiled into a dogtchi.dll file.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Consuming the library in C#</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, to demonstrate how it looks from the C# developer’s perspective, let’s use the library in a C# project. There are two ways of consuming the package – from the sources and from the package. During the development, we choose the first option. Consuming the library from the package is for our users and customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Create a sample C# console app</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let’s create a sample .NET console application. In an empty folder, write the following. It creates a new C# project and adds a dependency to the PHP library project.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->
<pre>dotnet new console
dotnet add reference ..\dogtchi\dogtchi.msbuildproj</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the newly created code, you are already ready to use the <code>Dog</code> class:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code {"language":"csharp"} -->
<pre>var dog = new Dog("Smurf");
dog.pet();</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":18927,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="612" height="397" src="https://www.peachpie.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dogtchi-sample.gif" alt=""></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Using the library from the package</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you deploy the package <code>dogtchi.nupkg</code> to a public NuGet feed, e.g. nuget.org or myget.org, or your private NuGet feed, like the one you can have on Azure DevOps or GitHub, you can consume the library as a package. The following command adds <code>&lt;PackageReference&gt;</code> to the C# project:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->
<pre>dotnet add package doghtchi</pre>
<!-- /wp:syntaxhighlighter/code -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks to PeachPie and the .NET development toolchain, it is possible to provide virtually any PHP library or app, regardless of its size, as a single NuGet package, which is perfectly understood by the entire .NET ecosystem. Not only does this mean you can take whatever PHP application you have and distribute it for .NET developers to use, it also means you can provide your app without ever giving away its source code.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That means it’s now possible to sell your PHP application to the .NET world without actually providing your sources.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what about web applications? For those, the process is quite different from regular console libraries – we’ll cover that in another blog post in the future.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
		<p>If you are looking for a good resolution for 2020 still (I know, it’s a bit late), you can’t go wrong with this one: <em>this year, I will focus on making the networks and products I work on truly simpler. </em>Now, before you pull Tom’s take out on me—</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://networkingnerd.net/2019/12/27/fast-friday-keeping-up-with-the-times/">There are those that would say that what we’re doing is just hiding the complexity behind another layer of abstraction, which is a favorite saying of Russ White. I’d argue that we’re not hiding the complexity as much as we’re putting it back where it belongs – out of sight. We don’t need the added complexity for most operations.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Three things: <em><strong>First,</strong> complex solutions are always required for hard problems.</em> If you’ve ever listened to me talk about complexity, you’ve probably seen this quote on a slide someplace—</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://faculty.nps.edu/dlalders/docs/AldersonDoyle-tsmca-July2010.pdf">[C]omplexity is most succinctly discussed in terms of functionality and its robustness. Specifically, we argue that complexity in highly organized systems arises primarily from design strategies intended to create robustness to uncertainty in their environments and component parts.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>You <em>cannot</em> solve hard problems—complex problems—without complex solutions. In fact, a lot of the complexity we run into in our everyday lives is a result of saying “this is too complex, I’m going to build something simpler.” <em>(here I’m thinking of a blog post I read last year that said “when we were building containers, we looked at routing and realized how complex it was… so we invented something simpler… which, of course, turned out to be more complex than dynamic routing!)</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Second,</strong> abstraction can be used the right way to manage complexity, and it can be used the wrong way to obfuscate or mask complexity.</em> The second great source of complexity and system failure in our world is we don’t abstract complexity so much as we obfuscate it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Third,</strong> abstraction is not a zero-sum game</em><strong>.</strong> If you haven’t found the tradeoffs, you haven’t looked hard enough. This is something expressed through the state/optimization/surface triangle, which you should <em>know</em> at this point.</p>
<p>Returning to the top of this post, the point is this: Using abstraction to manage complexity is fine. Obfuscation of complexity is not. Papering over complexity “just because I can” never solves the problem, any more than sweeping dirt under the rug, or papering over the old paint without bothering to fix the wall first.</p>
<p>We need to go beyond just figuring out how to make the user interface simpler, more “intent-driven,” automated, or whatever it is. We need to think of the network as a system, rather than as a collection of bits and bobs that we’ve thrown together across the years. We need to think about the modules horizontally and vertically, think about how they interact, understand how each piece works, understand how each abstraction leaks, and be able to ask hard questions.</p>
<p>For each module, we need to understand how things work well enough to ask <em>is this the right place to divide these two modules?</em> We should be willing to rethink our abstraction lines, the placement of modules, and how things fit together. Sometimes moving an abstraction point around can greatly simplify a design while increasing optimal behavior. Other times it’s worth it to reduce optimization to build a simpler mouse trap. <em>But you cannot know the answer to this question until you ask it.</em> If you’re sweeping complexity under the rug because… <em>well, that’s where it belongs…</em> then you are doing yourself and the organization you work for a disfavor, plain and simple. Whatever you sweep under the rug of obfuscation will grow and multiply. You don’t want to be around when it crawls back out from under that rug.</p>
<p>For each module, we need to learn how to ask <em>is this the right level and kind of abstraction?</em> We need to learn to ask <em>does the set of functions this module is doing really “hang together,” or is this just a bunch of cruft no-one could figure out what to do with, so they shoved it all in a black box and called it done?</em></p>
<p>Above all, we need to learn to look at the network as a system. I’ve been harping on this for so long, and yet I still don’t think people understand what I am saying a lot of times. So I guess I’ll just have to keep saying it. 😊</p>
<p>The problems networks are designed to solve are hard—therefore, networks are going to be complex. You cannot eliminate complexity, but you can learn to minimize and control it. Abstraction within a well-thought-out system is a valid and useful way to control complexity and understanding how and where to create modules at the edges of which abstraction can take place is a valid and useful way of controlling complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t obfuscate. Think systemically, think about the tradeoffs, and abstract wisely.</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1605368314078_14495"><div><p>On November 12, 2020 Apple released macOS Big Sur. In the hours after the release went live, somewhere in Apple's infrastructure an Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder cried out in pain, dropping to its knees, begging for mercy as load increased beyond what it could handle. The OCSP responder slowing down, being a critical aspect of a modern public key infrastructure (PKI), makes it hard for clients of the PKI to verify the validity of identity documents. These documents, called X.509 Certificates, are attached to every verified application the user is launching on their Mac. Mayhem ensued, and after the issues were cleaned up, many questions remained about the implications of this failure. But first, let's take a look at the mechanisms involved in authenticating an application package, at the most fundamental level.</p>

<p>The X.509 is a ratified ITU specification that defines (among other things) a standard representation for documents that convey trust relationships between entities, known as Certificates. Certificates can be thought of as policy documents. Any X.509 certificate consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>a public key,</li>
<li>an indication who the certificate was issued for,</li>
<li>what actions the authority allows the certificate holder to perform,</li>
<li>the date the certificate is first valid on,</li>
<li>the date the certificate expires on,</li>
<li>metadata about how to check if the certificate has been revoked (optional, but highly recommended),</li>
<li>the authority who issued the certificate, and</li>
<li>a signature across all this metadata, from the authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>By retrieving the authority certificate, one can verify the integrity of the issued certificate. In fact, most authority certificates were issued by an even higher authority. By verifying all the way up to the root entity certificate (the "self-signed" highest level authority), it is possible to get a high degree of confidence of the provenance of the end entity certificate. Oftentimes a certain set of policy requirements must be met for an authority to issue a certificate to an end entity, or any intermediate entity. A certificate can be viewed as an embodiment of the proof that the authorities involved performed the appropriate checks to make sure all these conditions were met. If you fail these checks, an authority should not issue you a certificate!</p>
<p>The ceremony of creating these documents, how to interpret the document, how to represent the hierarchy of business trust decisions are all encoded in a certificate chain. Certificate chains are powerful concepts: they can be used to verify an authority who generated a public key, and who verified it was done to a certain standard. By reducing the scope of public keys to only keys you trust by specifying only certain root authorities you will accept certificate chains originating from, you can make a policy to reject any public keys (and thus any certificates) that were issued by a different authority.</p>
<h2 id="the-hard-part-revocation">The Hard Part: Revocation</h2>
<p>But what if, after the date the certificate is issued and before the date the certificate expires, something goes wrong? Maybe the authority decides that the entity the certificate was issued to has committed some malfeasance, and revokes their certificate. Sometimes the private key for a certificate is stolen, and so the assertions about who the party is that the certificate represents are no longer true, since an entity with the stolen key could impersonate the legitimate original party. There are numerous reasons why a certificate could be revoked.</p>
<p>One of the fantastic design attributes of X.509 is the fact that you should be able to perform X.509 certificate chain validation offline. So long as you have an accurate idea of what the current date is and what root entities you trust, it's (relatively) easy for a party to verify a certificate chain. The offline verification confers a great deal of resilience upon the system. But this revocation problem remains a challenge - for some systems you need to be able to check back with the authority who issued the certificate and ask "hey, is this assertion you made still valid?"</p>
<p>To solve this problem, there are three common mechanisms in use today. First, most authorities publish certificate revocation lists (CRLs). This list, signed by the issuing authority, can be periodically downloaded from a location specified in the certificate's metadata (say on a daily basis). When performing certificate validation, the locally downloaded copy of the CRL will provide a indication if a certificate has been revoked. These CRLs can get quite large though, and having to wait for the CRL to be refreshed for a revocation to take effect could be risky for certain applications. CRLs work for certain use cases, but the storage and update frequency trade-offs are significant.</p>
<p>Enter OCSP. When an authority offers an OCSP responder, the URL for the responder is also encoded in the certificate. A certificate verifier can make a call to the OCSP responder, with the serial number of the certificate to be verified. The OCSP responder checks against its database of revoked certificates. The OCSP responder will then respond with a simple "valid" or "revoked" to the query, and the calling party can then decide what to do with that information. Of course, this means that the OCSP responder can log each and every one of these queries, and build a very useful paper trail to help monitor user behaviour. This risk, along with the systemic resiliency challenges, led to a search for a middle ground.</p>
<p>The final mode is a variant on calling the OCSP responder. An OCSP responder can issue a short-lived, cryptographically signed document to a certificate holder. This document is "stapled" together with the certificate, and is sent to to the verifying party. So long as the time stamps match up, the recipient can assume (within some bounded risk) that the certificate is still valid, per the issuing authority. Of course, this approach only works for certain use cases (usually connectivity-oriented usage), but it does anonymize the certificate verifying parties.</p>
<p>Apple chose the second revocation model for app certificate verification. This mode has its benefits - revocation can be performed in real-time. So, if Apple finds that an app they issued a certificate to is actually malware, they can rapidly revoke this certificate and prevent the malware from running, even on machines it has already installed itself on. This does put a lot of policy control in Apple's hands. This is where you have to make a business decision as to whether or not you trust Apple to be benevolent or not.</p>

<p>A signed application is an interesting corner case in certificate validation. Certificates are valid for a certain range of dates. Additionally, applications don't involve (at least at launch time) any sort of exchange between a server and a client that can perform an OCSP lookup on your behalf. This limits the options we have.</p>
<p>The first problem is more nuanced than one might think. Should an application, signed at a specific point in time, be only launchable between the validity start/end dates of the certificate issued to sign the application? Probably not - this puts an artificial horizon on the application being valid, and if this is an app you paid a lot of money for, this might be frustrating. Implementation details might vary, but there is a concept of a trusted timestamp server, where a timestamp with a nonce is signed by a trusted authority. By integrating a trusted timestamp into the bundle of attributes cryptographically verified by the application launcher, we can reduce this problem to only needing to verify the app signing certificate was valid <em>at the time the bundle was signed</em>. So the current calendar date is irrelevant for determining this validity, but rather the date that has been bundled into the signed app is to be used.</p>
<p>The second problem limits your options for handling revocation. A CRL might be useful in a subset of cases - for example if large swaths of certificates are to be revoked. However, there are some concerns with this approach, beyond scalability and size of these revocation lists. One operational concern is that you could be leaking information about which certificates have been revoked, or providing insight into the revocation process. This could be exploited by malfeasant actors to game the certificate issuing process, or at least make it more obvious which certificates have been revoked and when, so malware developers could get more insight into the process, giving them an edge in "gaming the system."</p>
<p>Apple opted to solve this problem with an OCSP responder. So at every launch of an app (perhaps outside of some window where the OCSP response could be cached - I have not looked into this detail), macOS would dutifully check if the certificate used by the signer is still valid, per the OCSP responder. Of course, if macOS couldn't reach the OCSP responder, it would go about its merry way launching an app. After all, a computer needs to work offline, too.</p>

<p>An OCSP responder certainly would generate logs, as we discussed before. Those logs could contain the serial numbers of certificates that users had requested be checked, as well as the IP address of the requestor. Apple certainly has a database that maps a serial number back to the actual X.509 certificate, which then can likely be used to identify what app(s) this certificate was used to sign. The metadata about the request could likely be mapped back to who you are (through the power of AppleID, perhaps), the and the attributes of the certificate could be tied to your app store purchases (or lack thereof). Theoretically, this could be used to clamp down on piracy, private software distribution and other free use of a device.</p>
<p>But here is where we have to consider the user. I'm knee-deep in systems security problems, day-in and day-out. All these systems we interact with have become more complex than what most people (myself included) can maintain a mental model of. …</p></div></div></div>

Ladder's used Clojure since day 1 in 2015, and we wouldn't want it any different! In particular, Clojure's Lisp heritage, focus on pure functions and immutable data structures, unified client-server support, and superior developer experience have helped us write higher quality code faster.</p>
<p><strong>Ladder is hiring! If you're interested, please check out our job description <a href="https://grnh.se/5cebfb331us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://grnh.se/5cebfb331us&quot;})">here</a>!</strong></p>
<!-- excerpt -->
<h2 id="pure-functions-and-immutability">Pure functions and immutability</h2>
<p>One of the challenges with ordinary, imperative programming languages like Javascript or Python is the increasing complexity of state management. As your application grows, it becomes harder and harder to isolate where in the codebase specific changes to your application state occur. This is because with typical application architectures in those languages, any function can perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29&quot;})">side effects</a> or modify incoming or global state. On the other hand, Clojure strongly emphasizes working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function&quot;})">pure functions</a> (well, if you discount I/O...) and <a href="https://clojure.org/about/state" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://clojure.org/about/state&quot;})">immutable data structures</a>. A Clojure programmer must be explicit when defining and modifying mutable state - this helps minimize its usage and makes it easier to reason about.</p>
<p>Immutable data structures and pure functions also lend themselves well to concurrent programming. We rarely find ourselves worrying about locks and shared data in a multi-threaded environment, because our functions are rarely modifying shared state. And when we do, Clojure provides <code>atom</code>, a thread-safe wrapper around ordinary data structures. Behind the scenes, setting an <code>atom</code>'s value calls <code>compare-and-set!</code>. That means no fussing around with locks or mutexes and no worrying about your data changing before you modify it. With this one simple construct, Clojure removes 99% of our concurrency headaches.</p>
<h2 id="clojure-is-a-lisp">Clojure is a Lisp</h2>
<p>There are probably enough Lisp arguments on the Internet already - I'll defer to <a href="https://clojure.org/about/rationale#_lisp_is_a_good_thing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://clojure.org/about/rationale#_lisp_is_a_good_thing&quot;})">Rich Hickey</a> (Clojure's creator) and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html&quot;})">Paul Graham</a> instead of adding another rehash. That said, Clojure provides some advantages over other Lisps like Common Lisp and Scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li>CL only includes lists in its core language spec. Clojure introduces vectors, sets, and maps which makes reading and writing code so much less tedious. Of course Scheme has all of these except sets.</li>
<li>Clojure's core data structures are immutable which, as discussed above, makes reasoning about code, especially concurrent code, much easier.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="clojure-runs-everywhere">Clojure runs everywhere</h2>
<p>Clojure provides first class support for sharing code between platforms with <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals&quot;})">reader conditionals</a>. Most of our namespaces at Ladder take advantage of this and are shared across our client (Clojurescript) and server (Clojure). In fact, all of our client React code (aside from browser-specific API calls like clipboard, input handlers, etc) supports being run on the JVM. This lets us run what we call "full-stack tests" entirely within a Java process. For example, we can run full user flows like "user can accept a life insurance policy" and assert against both client and server state <strong>in the same test</strong>. The closest analogue without this superpower would be running a Selenium test against a running webserver, which introduces all sorts of potential flakiness. For more on full-stack tests, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qijWBPYkRAQ&amp;t=346s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qijWBPYkRAQ&amp;t=346s&quot;})">this talk</a> two of our engineers gave at Clojure West in 2017.</p>
<p>Clojure also provides easy <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals#_host_interop" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://clojure.org/guides/reader_conditionals#_host_interop&quot;})">host interop</a> for each supported platform. This lets us leverage the full JVM (and Javascript) ecosystem. For example, we use popular Java libraries like <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/&quot;})">Jetty</a>, <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients&quot;})">kafka-clients</a>, <a href="https://github.com/google/tink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/google/tink&quot;})">Tink</a>, and more. On the frontend, we use React, and can easily include other Javascript libraries for analytics, error handling, and session replays.</p>
<h2 id="developer-experience">Developer experience</h2>
<p>When Iâ€™ve worked with Typescript and Python in the past, I was constantly waiting for my development server to reload. Clojure makes updating code on your local server as simple as reloading the updated namespace in your REPL. If you want, you can even <a href="https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" onclick="window.gtag(&quot;event&quot;, &quot;link-click&quot;, {&quot;event_label&quot;:&quot;markdown&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/nrepl/nrepl&quot;})">update remote, (hopefully) non-production webservers</a>! Being able to evaluate code in a REPL and have your running web server update in less than a second makes exploration and iteration on your actual backend so much faster. Instant feedback makes developers more playful and experimental. Ultimately, it helps them write better code faster.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s also super easy to run small chunks of code in the REPL. Ladder, like other Clojure shops, has a convention of documenting namespace usage with a <code>comment</code> block at the bottom. Developers can use the code within to learn the namespaceâ€™s API, run commonly used procedures, or test changes to the rest of the namespace - all without leaving their editor!</p>
<h2 id="why-not-clojure">Why not Clojure?</h2>
<p>While we're extremely satisfied with our choice of Clojure, we've had our fair share of headaches. First, Clojure processes take a long time to start up - especially as the size of the application grows. Our webserver at Ladder takes a full minute before it can accept web requests. This makes autoscaling in response to load more challenging - some of our load can spike in well under a minute, so we have to be consistently overprovisioned to handle it. Second, Clojure produces pretty big artifacts. This matters less on the backend, where our webserver JAR is over 1.5GB, but hurts us on the frontend. We still have work to do here, but our initial bundle is 7.2MB uncompressed (1.0MB gzipped)! If raw performance or bundle size is your primary concern, you might be better off choosing another language.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As a small company, we have more ideas to try than we have bandwidth to implement. Using Clojure has helped our team be more iterative and more productive, so we can ship more experiments and projects than we would otherwise be able to. I feel super lucky that Ladder introduced me to Clojure - and I'm excited to see how Clojure and our use of it continues to evolve!</p>

                    <p>Take a look at this research <a href="https://www.supermonitoring.com/blog/website-monitoring-tools-market-in-2020/">https://www.supermonitoring.com/blog/website-monitoring-tools-market-in-2020/</a></p><p>It states that there are around 170 uptime monitoring services. Despite this fact, I decided to make another one. Before you roll your eyes, let me explain the reasons for making such a decision. At the end of the article, you'll find a comment on hacker news that answers the question.</p><p>First of all, let's accept the term that I consider people who are solo-founders who have enough time &amp; desire to make their products. I'm not talking about an investment of millions of dollars, complex financial calculations of risks/profits, creating a big company with hundreds of employees. I'm talking about small businesses.</p><p>Having such people in mind, let's see what their thoughts can be before starting a new product.</p><p>Most of them refuse to create something alleging that:</p><ul><li>They don't have a brilliant idea</li><li>They don't have enough money/time</li><li>The idea was already implemented / there are a lot of competitors in the area</li></ul><p>Let's examine these statements.</p><h3 id="no-brilliant-idea">No brilliant idea</h3><p>Let me ask: Does every successful product have a brilliant idea? Does every successful business have an idea at all? If so, <a href="https://alternativeto.net/">https://alternativeto.net/</a> didn't exist.</p><p>Everyone knows that idea worth nothing. Implementation does. Marketing does.</p><p>How often do we hear: "Gosh, why nobody solves this, isn't it obvious that people should solver this?!". But why the person who says that didn't solve it, if it's obvious?</p><p>Now, you may argue that new products appearing in the market have USP, Unique Selling Proposition. Usually, yes, however, the USP turns around the idea which was already implemented. They just enhanced it a bit but haven't invented something completely new.</p><p>There are hundreds of to-do apps that solve the task of taking notes of what a person should do.</p><p>There are hundreds of chat apps that solve the task of communicating between people.</p><p>There are hundreds of CRM apps that sole the task of handling customers.</p><h3 id="no-money-time">No money / time</h3><p>When it comes to money, I have the same question: Did every successful business have initial funding?</p><p>As for time, I would agree that this is somewhat necessary if we don't consider funding or investment. Even if we do, we still need to spend some amount of time.</p><h3 id="it-was-already-implemented">It was already implemented</h3><p>Okay, now a person has desire and time. Then, the person goes to Google and finds out that somebody already implemented the idea. Moreover, the "somebody" is a relatively large and famous company. What a pity.</p><p>But what happens if there weren't any competitors at all?</p><p>Well... the chances are that nobody needs this. But you cannot know for sure, so you need to spend time for validation.</p><p>Beware, here comes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">cognitive bias</a>: if you stick to your idea, really love it, then despite your validation process, you might keep on working on it because people tend to find arguments that sustain their opinion, not vice versa.</p><h3 id="what-others-say">What others say</h3><p>The most common objection for a person who wants to start a business starts with: "Who needs...".</p><p>This is an established human pattern.</p><ul><li>Who needs google if there is Yahoo?</li><li>Who needs dropbox if you have flash drives?</li><li>Who needs yet another... if ... already exists?</li></ul><h3 id="the-answer">The answer</h3><p>Let me show an HN comment from a post by Unsplash <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5794083">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5794083</a></p><figure><img src="https://pingr.io/blog/content/images/2020/11/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://pingr.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/11/image.png 600w, https://pingr.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/11/image.png 1000w, https://pingr.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/11/image.png 1600w, https://pingr.io/blog/content/images/2020/11/image.png 2150w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Every week, every day, and every hour, a lot of new products are founded. By "products," I mean pretty much everything: a new store, a new SaaS, a new B2B company.</p><p>In most cases, something similar already exists. In most cases, you don't even have a USP (Unique Selling Proposition).</p><p>But does it mean that you:</p><ul><li>Cannot create something already exists</li><li>Cannot make it better</li><li>Cannot get revenue from it?</li></ul><p>Tell me why it's not possible to open an e-commerce shop, which would be much easier/pleasant to use. Okay, tell me why cloning the existing one won't bring some revenue?</p><p>My father sells radio receivers in 2020. Even in his case, somebody needs them.</p><h3 id="reasons">Reasons</h3><p>So why I've decided to do yet another uptime monitoring service? Because I hated the experience, I got with others &amp; because I immediately understood the idea of such services.</p><p>Stop laughing at this moment, and consider this: when Medium was created, WordPress already existed.</p><p>When yet-another-CMS is created and become famous, WordPress already existed.</p><p>Some may say: hey, but WordPress is ugly and slow. And you should host it on your hosting, while Medium is excellent, and you don't need a server for posting your articles!</p><p>Yes, exactly. I hope I'll be able to get Pingr to the same level.</p><p>I'd be like Pingdom (WordPress). But better.</p><h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3><ol><li>Having high competition means that the idea was already validated for you</li><li>You can create a product without a brilliant idea</li><li>You can create a product without funding</li><li>You still need to invest much time</li></ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>The purpose of your technical resume is to generate interview requests. A successful resume attracts more interest, from more of the companies you want to interview with, for more of the jobs you would be happy to take.</p><p>You might think of a resume as your personal summary document, covering all of your life’s work to date. But it’s better to think of your resume as a business document that helps you advertise your capabilities to a future employer.</p><p>I’ve worked with thousands of employers, published the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-recruiters-look-at-during-the-6-seconds-they-spend-on-your-resume-2012-4">ground-breaking research</a> into recruiter resume review time, and written several bestsellers on resumes and other career topics. And that’s why I’m now writing <a href="https://signup.meetleet.com/">great technical resumes for free</a>. Resumes, when done right, are great help in accelerating your career.</p><p>Here are a few things a <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-a-great-technical-resume">technical resume</a> is not:</p><ul><li>Not your autobiography</li><li>Not a comprehensive catalog of everything you’ve done</li><li>Not a way to make you feel good about yourself (though it might also do that)</li><li>Not an academic CV</li><li>Not where you need to explain past ‘bad situations’</li><li>Not where you need to explain why you left prior jobs</li></ul><p>No, a technical resume is none of those things. And that’s because none of those things help get you hired.</p><p>Instead, a technical resume’s primary purpose is to generate interview requests for you. It’s where you make the case to “please pick me out of the pile.”</p><p>(Secondarily, a resume is a useful page of notes to use during interviews, especially behavioral interviews. We all know how our minds can go blank during interviews and it’s useful to have something to aid your memory in those moments.)</p><p>What’s the best way to get a hiring manager or future boss to select your resume from the pile? </p><p>It’s to make it as clear as possible which types of problems you’ve solved in the past, and how well you solved them. With that information, hiring managers have the easiest time in predicting what you can do for them in the future.</p><p>Unfortunately, most technology professionals take the easy way out, and copy and paste their job description into their resume. As a result, their <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">bullet points</a> are full of sentences that begin “Responsible for” or “Worked on” or “Assigned to.”</p><p>This is a mistake because your future employer is not going to hire you for your past <strong>responsibilities</strong>. Rather, they will hire you for your past <strong>successes</strong>. It’s your achievements and results in technology that get you promoted and elevated to ever-higher levels.</p><p>And that’s why great technical resumes focus on results, <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">numbers</a> and method. </p><p><strong>Results</strong>: for the technology you were working on, how did it make your company, team, or systems better? Did it increase, decrease, grow, shrink, improve, suppress, optimize, deprecate, add or remove something important for your company? For everything you’ve worked on, there was some reason you were doing it. Hopefully, that reason had to do with making things better. Share the result with your resume readers. </p><p><strong>Numbers</strong>: by how much did you make things better? As a technology professional, you’re used to numbers. We measure the success of what we do in numbers all the time: latency, loadtime, DAUs, Google score. Using numbers to describe the work you’ve done comes naturally in the field.</p><p>So the more you can use numbers to <strong>quantify</strong> how much you helped increase, decrease, grow, shrink, etc., the important metrics in your prior roles, the better and more persuasive your resume will be in getting picked out of the pile. </p><p><strong>Method</strong>: this is the technical “how I did it” part of a great technical resume. If you increased something by 50% what technologies or solutions or methodologies did you use to get there? If you shrank a different metric by 70%, what activities or behaviors or actions did you need to take to achieve this reduction?</p><p>Many technical resumes miss the results and the numbers and only list the method of how they did something. Unfortunately, that’s not as effective at attracting attention to get your resume picked out of the pile.</p><p>To demonstrate, the <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-bullet-points-for-a-technical-resume">bullet points</a> below <strong>with</strong> <a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/why-you-should-include-numbers-on-your-technical-resume">numbers</a> are much more powerful than the same bullet point <strong>without</strong> numbers.</p><ul><li>Responsible for for managing our AWS cloud services for cost, reliability and scalability.</li><li>Reduced costs 17% by decommissioning 42 ec2 instances in our AWS implementation while managing for costs, reliability and scalability.</li></ul><ul><li>Refactored our front/end experience using React.</li><li>Increased user engagement 27% by refactoring our front-end experience in React.</li></ul><p>Combining results, numbers and methods on your resume makes your experience stand out from the pile. And that’s the best way to fulfill the purpose of your resume - to get you interview requests.</p><p><a href="https://www.meetleet.com/blog/how-to-write-a-great-technical-resume">Great technical resumes</a> increase your chances of getting hired, and getting ahead in your career.

<![CDATA[H.264 Specification Sucks]]>
            </title>

November 14, 2020 | https://codecs.multimedia.cx/2020/11/h-264-specification-sucks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://codecs.multimedia.cx/2020/11/h-264-specification-sucks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>So it has come to a stage where I have nothing better to do so I tried to write H.264 decoder for <code>NihAV</code> (so I can test the future <code>nihav-player</code> with the content beside just sample files and cutscenes from various games). And while I’ve managed to decode at least something (more about that in the end) the specification for H.264 <em>sucks</em>. Don’t get me wrong, the format by itself is not that bad in design but the way it’s documented is far from being good (though it’s still serviceable—it’s not an audio codec after all).</p>
<p>And in the beginning to those who want to cry “but it’s <del>GNU/Linux</del>, err, MPEG/AVC”. ITU H.264 was standardised in May 2003 while MPEG-4 Part 10 came in December 2003. Second, I can download ITU specification freely and various editions too while MPEG standard still costs money I’m not going to pay.</p>
<p>I guess the main problems of H.264 come from two things: dual coding nature (i.e. slice data can be coded using variable-length codes or binary arithmetic coder) and extensions (not as bad as H.263 but approaching it; and here’s a simple fact to demonstrate it—2003 edition had 282 pages, 2019 edition has 836 pages). Plus the fact that is codified<a href="https://codecs.multimedia.cx/2016/05/on-variable-length-codes-names/"> the wrong name for Elias gamma’ codes</a> I ranted on before.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the extensions part since most of them can be ignored and I don’t have much to say about them except for one thing—profiles. By itself the idea is good: you have certain set of constraints and features associated with the ID so you know in advance if you should be able to handle the stream or not. And the initial 2003 edition had three profiles (baseline/main/extended) with IDs associated with them (66, 77 and 88 correspondingly). By 2019 there have been a dozen of various profiles and even more profile IDs and they’re not actually mapped one to one (e.g. constrained baseline profile is baseline profile with an additional <code>constraint_set1_flag</code> set to one). In result you have lots of random profile IDs (can you guess what <code>profile_idc</code> 44 means? and 86? or 128?) and they did not bother to make a table listing all known profile IDs so you need to search all specification is order to find out what they mean. I’d not care much but they affect bitstream parsing, especially sequence parameter set where they decided to insert some additional fields in the middle for certain high profiles.</p>
<p>Now the more exciting part: coding. While I understand the rationale (you have simpler and faster or slower but more effective (de)coding mode while using the same ways to transform data) it created some problems for describing it. Because of that decision you have to look at three different places in order to understand what and how to decode: syntax tables in 7.3 which present in which order and under which conditions elements are coded, semantics in 7.4 telling you what that element actually means and what limitations or values it has, and 9.2 or 9.3 for explanations on how certain element should be actually decoded from the bitstream. And confusingly enough coded block pattern is put into 9.1.2 while it would be more logical to join it with 9.2, as 9.1 is for parsing generic codes used not just in slice data but various headers as well and 9.2 deals with parsing custom codes for non-CABAC slice data.</p>
<p>And it gets even worse for CABAC parsing. For those who don’t know what it is, that abbreviation means context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding. In other words it represents various values as sequences of bits and codes each bit using its own context. And if you ask yourself how the values are represented and which contexts are used for each bit then you point right at the problem. In the standard you have it all spread in three or four places: one table to tell you which range of contexts to use for a certain element, some description or separate table for the possible bit strings, another table or two to tell you which contexts should be used for each bit in various cases (e.g. for <code>ctxIdxOffset</code>=36 you have these context offsets for following bits: 0, 1, (2 or 3), 3, 3, 3), and finally an entry that tells you how to select a context for the first bit if it depends on already decoded data (usually by checking if top and left (macro)blocks have the same thing coded or not). Of course it’s especially fun when different bit contexts are reused for different bit positions or the same bit positions can have different contexts depending on previously decoded bit string (this happens mostly for macroblock types in P/SP/B-slices but it’s still confusing). My guess is that they tried to optimise the total number of contexts and thus merged the least used ones. In result you about 20 pages of context data initialisation in the 2019 edition (in initial edition of both H.264 and H.EVC it’s just eight pages)—compare that to almost hundred pages of default CDFs in AV1 specification. And CABAC part in H.265 is somehow much easier to comprehend (probably because they made the format less dependent on special bit strings and put some of the simpler conditions straight into binarisation table).</p>
<p>To me it seems that people describing CABAC coding (not the coder itself but rather how it’s used to code data) did not understand it well themselves (or at least could not convey the meaning clearly). And despite the principle of documenting format from decoder point of view (i.e. what bits should it read and how to act on them in order to decode bitstream) a lot of CABAC coding is documented from encoder point of view (i.e. what bits you should <em>write</em> for syntax element instead of what <em>reading</em> certain bits would produce). An egregious example of that is so-called UEGk binarisation. In addition to the things mentioned above it also has rather meaningless parameter name <code>uCoff</code> (which normally would be called something like escape value). How would I describe decoding it: read truncated unary sequence up to <code>escape_len</code>, if the read value is equal to <code>escape_len</code> then read an additional escape value as exp-Golomb code shifted by <code>k</code> and trailing <code>k</code>-bit value, otherwise escape value is set to zero. Add escape value to the initial one and if the value is non-zero and should be signed, read the sign. Section 9.2.3.2 spends a whole page on it with a third of it being C code for writing the value.</p>
<p>I hope I made it clear why H.264 specification sucks in my opinion. Again, the format itself is logical but comprehending certain parts of the specification describing it takes significantly more time than it should and I wanted to point out why. It was still possible to write a decoder using mostly the specification and referring to other decoders source code only when it was completely unclear or worked against expectations (and JM is still not the best codebase to look at either, HM got much better in that aspect).</p>
<p>P.S. For those zero people who care about <code>NihAV</code> decoder, I’ve managed to decode two random videos downloaded from BaidUTube (funny how one of them turned out to be simple CAVLC-coded video with no B-frames) without B-frames and without apparent artefacts in first hundred frames. There’s still <em>a lot</em> of work to make it decode data correctly (currently it lacks even loop filter and probably still has bugs) plus beside dreaded B-frames with their co-located MVs there are still some features like 8×8 DCTs or high-bitdepth support I’d like to have (but definitely no interlaced support or scalable/multiview shit). It should be good enough to play content I care about and that’s all, I do not want to waste extremely much time making it a perfect software that supports all possible H.264/AVC features and being the fastest one too.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" id="item-5f874104a7228719beb6a67c"><div><div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-30d8fede11f47c2dce9d"><div><p>A big challenge for most early-stage startups is developing a clear Go-To-Market (GTM for short) strategy for growth and success. Early in a companies life, the value-prop and ideal customer can be murky and being resource and cash strapped, most startup will grab any customer that comes their way. We wanted to discuss some simple tips startups and founders can do with their revenue/billing data to help unearth insights that can help direct your GTM game plan.</p><p>The first thing you can easily do is go into your billing/subscription system (<a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.zuora.com/" target="_blank">Zuora</a>, etc.) and analyze your revenue retention. Revenue retention is the amount of revenue still being paid by an initial group of customers (ie, all the new customers you landed in July or everyone that is a software company). Say to start they paid you $10,000 in MRR back in July and now in October they are paying you $9,200 in MRR then their <a href="https://talkinsaasy.com/saasy-math" target="_blank">Net Revenue Retention</a> would be 92%. Some billing/subscription management systems can perform these calculations for you though they usually only can do it for your entire customer base as a whole which can be misleading.</p><p>An easy work around is to pull the data into excel or google sheets and just go through it a group customer by certain characteristics like we discussed above. If you are early-stage (less than 1,000 customers) this should be easy enough to do manually, you can do some analytics on it using SQL if you have someone with the requisite skill sets on your team. Once you have a few defined characteristics (customer segments) you can then go through your monthly billing data and see how much those groups are still paying over a period of time. Then look across these groups and see which ones have the best Net Retention, ideally you would like to find a group with retention &gt;100% but for early-stage companies still finding product-market fit it is ok if you don’t just yet.</p><p>Once you have identified the best group or two, take a look at their customer journey, which channels did they come in through, what products/services did they buy initially and did they add additional products or units after their initial purchase? These are all clues to help you uncover a clear go-to-market plan. Say most of your leads came in via marketing buys, and bought a certain product to start and then expanded to another feature later shows you the value-props they are finding as a customer, so you can start putting that message into your marketing messaging. Once you identify that group, mapping that journey will reveal to you their GTM experience with your brand and allow you to emulate it moving forward.</p><p>Starting with billing data is an easy way for an early-stage startup to segment their customers and find their top performers. From there a review of their customer journey and you find yourself with a pretty nice roadmap for a GTM strategy. If you and your team are working on a GTM strategy and you want to chat more with me about how you can use billing and other data to help uncover customer insights, shoot me and <a href="mailto:ross.andrews543@gmail.com?subject=Data%20Driven%20GTM%20Strategy">email</a> and mention this post!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Serverless</strong> is a scalable, fast and reliable architecture for APIs. By deploying your API to cloud providers such as <strong>AWS</strong>, you don't have to think about server administration, you just focus on code. Using the <a href="https://www.serverless.com/">Serverless framework</a>, it becomes really easy as you can deploy a <strong>Lambda function</strong> in seconds.  </p>
<p><a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a query language simplifying client-server interactions. It's also very efficient thanks to its declarative data fetching. It's no surprise that <a href="https://github.blog/2016-09-14-the-github-graphql-api/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/coursera-engineering/evolving-the-graph-4c587a4ad9a8">Coursera</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/how-airbnb-is-moving-10x-faster-at-scale-with-graphql-and-apollo-aa4ec92d69e2">AirBnB</a> are using it.</p>
<p>Today we're going to bring the best of both worlds, by building a <strong>Serverless</strong> <strong>GraphQL</strong> API and deploy it to <strong>AWS</strong> !</p>

<p>Here are the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup the <strong>Serverless</strong> framework</li>
<li>Test the Lambda locally</li>
<li>Setup <strong>GraphQL</strong> with <strong>Apollo Server</strong></li>
<li>Manage data through <strong>DynamoDB</strong></li>
<li>Deploy the Lambda to <strong>AWS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The full code of this tutorial is <a href="https://github.com/LucasLeRay/serverless-graphql-api-boilerplate">available on GitHub</a>, feel free to use it for your next project ! It's a more complete version, with <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>ESLint</strong> and <strong>Prettier</strong>.  </p>
<hr>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>To use the <strong>Serverless</strong> framework and deploy to <strong>AWS</strong>, you have to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/">Setup an AWS account</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html">Install the AWS CLI</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html">configure it</a></li>
<li>Install the <strong>Serverless</strong> framework: <code>yarn global add serverless</code></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Setup the Serverless framework</h2>
<p>First, init your <strong>Node.JS</strong> project:</p>

<p>Then, add the <strong>Serverless</strong> configuration in <code>serverless.yml</code>:</p>
<div data-language="yml"><pre><code><span>service</span><span>:</span> serverless<span>-</span>api<span>-</span>example 

<span>provider</span><span>:</span>
  <span>name</span><span>:</span> aws 
  <span>runtime</span><span>:</span> nodejs12.x
  <span>versionFunctions</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span> 
  <span>region</span><span>:</span> us<span>-</span>east<span>-</span><span>1</span> 
  <span>apiGateway</span><span>:</span>
    <span>shouldStartNameWithService</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>

<span>functions</span><span>:</span>
  <span>graphql</span><span>:</span>
    <span>handler</span><span>:</span> src/graphql.handler 
    <span>events</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>http</span><span>:</span>
          <span>path</span><span>:</span> graphql 
          <span>method</span><span>:</span> any 
          <span>cors</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span> </code></pre></div>
<h6>The full list of options is in the <a href="https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/serverless.yml/">Serverless framework documentation</a></h6>
<p>We gave <strong>Serverless</strong> instructions to deploy our new service <code>serverless-api-example</code>. It has a Lambda called <code>graphql</code> and is accessible at <code>/graphql</code> through HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Let's create the handler for our Lambda, for the moment put the following in <code>src/graphql.js</code>:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>exports<span>.</span><span>handler</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'wow such api'</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<hr>
<h2>Test a Serverless function in local</h2>
<p>I recommend you to install the <code>serverless-offline</code> plugin to test your Lambda locally:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>yarn</span> <span>add</span> -D serverless-offline</code></pre></div>
<p>Add this at the end of <code>serverless.yml</code>:</p>
<div data-language="yml"><pre><code><span>plugins</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> serverless<span>-</span>offline</code></pre></div>
<p>And this script in <code>package.json</code>:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  ...
  <span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"start"</span><span>:</span> <span>"sls offline"</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, enter <code>yarn start</code> and go to <code>localhost:3000/dev/graphql</code>:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> <span>yarn</span> start

offline: <span>[</span>HTTP<span>]</span> server ready: http://localhost:3000 🚀
offline: ANY /dev/graphql <span>(</span>λ: graphql<span>)</span>


wow such api </code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we created our Lambda, let's code its behavior !</p>
<hr>
<h2>Setup a GraphQL Lambda with Apollo Server</h2>
<p><code>apollo-server-lambda</code> is a great way to build a <strong>GraphQL</strong> API in <strong>Serverless</strong>. Add it to your project:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>yarn</span> <span>add</span> -D apollo-server-lambda</code></pre></div>
<p>Define the <strong>GraphQL</strong> schema in <code>src/schema.graphql</code>:</p>
<div data-language="graphql"><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Query</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>item</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Item
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Mutation</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>createItem</span><span>(</span><span>content</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> Item
<span>}</span>

<span>type</span> <span>Item</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span>
  <span>content</span><span>:</span> String
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the schema, We're defining what's an <code>Item</code>: an entity containing <code>id</code> and <code>content</code>. We also define a mutation <code>createItem</code>, which creates an item from a <code>content</code>, and a query <code>item</code> which gets it from an <code>id</code>. </p>
<p>Now, add the following in <code>src/graphql.js</code>:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> fs <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'fs'</span><span>)</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> ApolloServer<span>,</span> gql <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'apollo-server-lambda'</span><span>)</span>


<span>const</span> schema <span>=</span> fs<span>.</span><span>readFileSync</span><span>(</span><span>'./src/schema.graphql'</span><span>,</span> <span>'utf8'</span><span>)</span>


<span>const</span> resolvers <span>=</span> <span>{</span> 
  Query<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>item</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>

  Mutation<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>createItem</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> server <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>ApolloServer</span><span>(</span><span>{</span> typeDefs<span>:</span> schema<span>,</span> resolvers <span>}</span><span>)</span>


exports<span>.</span>handler <span>=</span> server<span>.</span><span>createHandler</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This code will create an <strong>Apollo</strong> server and return a response, using the <code>schema</code> and the <code>resolvers</code>. You can test it in <code>localhost:3000/dev/graphql</code>:
<img src="https://lucas-le-ray.com/articles/build-serverless-graphql-api/2.png" alt="Apollo server test"></p>
<p>As you can see, it works ! But our resolvers don't do anything, that's why <code>item</code> is null.
The next step is to use real data from a database.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Get data from DynamoDB with GraphQL</h2>
<p>I recommend using <strong>AWS DynamoDB</strong> as a database because it's very easy to setup with <code>serverless.yml</code>. Add the following to the existing configuration:</p>
<div data-language="yml"><pre><code><span>provider</span><span>:</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>environment</span><span>:</span>
    <span>ITEM_TABLE</span><span>:</span> $<span>{</span>self<span>:</span>service<span>}</span><span>-</span>items<span>-</span>$<span>{</span>self<span>:</span>provider.stage<span>}</span> 
  <span>iamRoleStatements</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-</span> <span>Effect</span><span>:</span> Allow 
      <span>Action</span><span>:</span>
        <span>-</span> dynamodb<span>:</span>GetItem 
        <span>-</span> dynamodb<span>:</span>PutItem
      <span>Resource</span><span>:</span> <span>'arn:aws:dynamodb:${opt:region, self:provider.region}:*:table/${self:provider.environment.ITEM_TABLE}'</span>

<span>resources</span><span>:</span>
  <span>Resources</span><span>:</span>
    <span>ItemsTable</span><span>:</span> 
      <span>Type</span><span>:</span> <span>'AWS::DynamoDB::Table'</span>
      <span>Properties</span><span>:</span>
        <span>AttributeDefinitions</span><span>:</span>
          <span>-</span> <span>AttributeName</span><span>:</span> itemId
            <span>AttributeType</span><span>:</span> S
        <span>KeySchema</span><span>:</span>
          <span>-</span> <span>AttributeName</span><span>:</span> itemId
            <span>KeyType</span><span>:</span> HASH
        <span>ProvisionedThroughput</span><span>:</span>
          <span>ReadCapacityUnits</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span>
          <span>WriteCapacityUnits</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span>
        <span>TableName</span><span>:</span> $<span>{</span>self<span>:</span>provider.environment.ITEM_TABLE<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We are asking Serverless to create a new table for <code>items</code> and to give the Lambda the permissions to interact with it. More infos on the <a href="https://www.serverless.com/dynamodb">Serverless documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Now we can interact with our new <strong>DynamoDB</strong> table through the <code>aws-sdk</code>:</p>

<p>All that remains is to update our resolvers. I recommend you to declare resolvers in different files, as it'll be more maintainable.
Here's our new <code>item</code> query:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>AWS</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'aws-sdk'</span><span>)</span>

<span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>item</span><span>(</span><span>_<span>,</span> <span>{</span> id <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> dynamoDb <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AWS<span>.</span>DynamoDB<span>.</span>DocumentClient</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

  <span>const</span> params <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    TableName<span>:</span> process<span>.</span>env<span>.</span><span>ITEM_TABLE</span><span>,</span>
    Key<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
      itemId<span>:</span> id<span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>const</span> <span>{</span> Item <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> dynamoDb<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>params<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>promise</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>...</span>Item<span>,</span>
    id<span>:</span> Item<span>.</span>itemId<span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then our new <code>createItem</code> mutation:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>AWS</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'aws-sdk'</span><span>)</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> v4 <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'uuid'</span><span>)</span>

<span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>createItem</span><span>(</span><span>_<span>,</span> <span>{</span> content <span>}</span></span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> dynamoDb <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>AWS<span>.</span>DynamoDB<span>.</span>DocumentClient</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> id <span>=</span> <span>v4</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

  <span>const</span> params <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    TableName<span>:</span> process<span>.</span>env<span>.</span><span>ITEM_TABLE</span><span>,</span>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>If you’ve had a Pokemon GO phase or been fooled by that PS5 AR filter on Instagram, you’ve seen augmented reality in action.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more--><p>With AR technology accessible to us on our mobile devices, it’s no news that we can now virtually see what makeup looks like on us, or which furniture would look good in our homes with apps like <a href="https://www.ikea.com/au/en/customer-service/mobile-apps/say-hej-to-ikea-place-pub1f8af050"><span>IKEA Place</span></a> and <a href="https://giphy.com/apps/giphyworld"><span>GIPHY World</span></a>.</p>
<p>That’s the AR that most people know, where digital input is projected onto physical dimensions through a device's camera and responds to real time changes. But did you know this process could be reversed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can now bring physical objects into the digital world instead.</p>
<h2><strong>As Easy as Clip and Drop</strong></h2>
<p>A while ago in October, this <a href="https://twitter.com/cyrildiagne/status/1319262984523448323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1319262984523448323%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fentertainment%2Fhow-to-use-viral-copy-and-paste-app-clip-drop-1438367%2F"><span>tweet</span></a> by software designer Cyril Diagne caught the attention of many. In the video he posted, a user seamlessly “copies” and “pastes” physical objects into a computer screen with the <a href="https://clipdrop.co/"><span>ClipDrop</span></a> app.</p>
<p>People were blown away by how simple the process was. Gone are the days we had to manually capture, transfer, and remove backgrounds on Photoshop. It all happens within seconds now.</p>

<p>With this AR Copy Paste app, users are able to:<br>1. Clip surrounding objects with their mobile phones and paste them into another device on the same network.<br>2. Extract objects, people, drawings and text with a simple point and tap.<br>3. Instantly extract desktop objects and drop them to any other app. <br>4. Save cutouts to cloud for future use.</p>
<h2><strong>How the App Works</strong></h2>
<p>What goes behind the screen when you “copy” an object and “paste”? Diagne and Blanchet’s app uses patented and open source technologies to perform the two most important functions of the app — clipping and dropping.</p>
<h3><strong>Copying with BASNet</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Qin_BASNet_Boundary-Aware_Salient_Object_Detection_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf"><span>Boundary-Aware Salient Object Detection</span></a> (BASNet), a predict-refine architecture, is what detects, isolates and extracts the subjects you point your camera at.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Composed of an Encoder-Decoder network in charge of saliency prediction and a residual refinement module that handles saliency map refinement, this new hybrid loss effectively segments salient object regions and predicts fine structures with clear boundaries.</p>
<h3><strong>Pasting with SIFT</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.opencv.org/master/da/df5/tutorial_py_sift_intro.html"><span>Scale-Invariant Feature Transform</span></a> (SIFT), a patented algorithm on OpenCV, then enables the app to match the coordinates on your mobile phone with those on your desktop, and finally place extracted objects in specific positions on your computer screen.</p>
<p>For this to happen, the algorithm involves multiple steps: Scale-space construction, keypoint localization, orientation assignment, keypoint descriptor, and finally keypoint matching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re interested to go deeper, <a href="https://aishack.in/tutorials/sift-scale-invariant-feature-transform-introduction/"><span>AI Shack</span></a> and <a href="https://medium.com/data-breach/introduction-to-sift-scale-invariant-feature-transform-65d7f3a72d40"><span>Data Breach</span></a> go very much into detail about each step of the process.</p>

<p>ClipDrop beta is available on Android, iOS, macOS and Windows, currently offering 30 days of free cloud storage and 10 free clips.</p>
<p>Although this is just the beginning of AR innovation, I think we can all agree that this little peek is enough to give us an idea of how unimaginable the future of advanced technology is.</p>

					Firstly, if you are not using SSL for all your sites, you should step it up! NameCheap's 
					<a href="https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/domain-validation.aspx?aff=79458" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/namecheap/');">SSL certificates</a> 
					start at only $9. There's no excuse!
				</p>
				<p>
					Firstly, if you have not tried Digital Ocean's 
					<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=2b75c85f8a5b" onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/digital-ocean/');"> SSD Virtual Servers</a> 
					for only $5/mo, I highly recommend them!

				<p><em>Warning: Hyperbole and blind speculation follows.</em></p>
<p>Apple was always touted as having the more user-friendly computer. At a high level, they aren’t any different than PCs. You click around, install software, plug in some hardware, configure some system preferences and download programs from wherever you want. Macs have a few less buttons and subjectively prettier UI – which I guess lends to its ease of use. However, from Grandma’s point of view, it’s not much easier to use than a PC. There are lots of confusing icons, menus, and tiny text. Click the wrong thing, open the wrong app – how do you get back? Grandma is lost. In the end, it’s still hard to use for the layman.</p>
<p>I’d often wonder, in 50 years will everyone be a computer expert? A lot of our parents were around before 8-Tracks existed. So, it makes sense that understanding USB, HDMI, Gmail, or Playstation is not second nature. In 50 years, will Moms know how to get rid of spyware and install a new harddrive?* Will the general population’s knowledge of computers increase? Then I thought of cars which were a technical marvel at one point. Nowadays, most people have no idea how their car works but if they’re lucky, they can change the oil themselves.</p>
<p>Back to Apple. When iPad rumors were floating around, a lot of people were thinking it would be a tablet with OS X and USB ports and expandability and good times – like a “real” computer. Then it launched and Jobs was so excited to show us it ran iOS and had access to the App Store. Something clicked in my mind when that happened. I knew that when you own a Mac (I don’t) you pay the Apple Tax. You pay for more software, you pay for over-priced accessories and you pay to buy a new computer every year or two because of Apple’s slowing-dripping must-have features. We always knew Jobs was a control freak and perfectionist. However, Jobs’ want for total control was never as clear as it was when the iPad launched with iOS and the AppStore.</p>
<p>Apple doesn’t want you use your computer to control an <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.arduino.cc/');" href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, write custom printer drivers, run a game server or control your house lights. They want you to shut up and consume. Us nerds? We’re fine with our Space Station Control computers. But everyone else? Apple wants them to have their iPad, bag of Cheetos and credit card handy. You want to watch 30 Rock on your iPad? Apple gets 30%. You want to buy the latest BedazzleMyAngryBirdGemLoop game? Apple get 30% and could not be happier.</p>
<p>But let’s not get carried away. Everyone still has their Mac laptops and towers and they’re free to do what they want with them – for now. Apple’s <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.engadget.com/2010/10/20/app-store-for-os-x-unveiled/');" href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/10/20/app-store-for-os-x-unveiled/">announcement </a> yesterday signifies another big leap forward in the controlling and dumbing down of consumer computers. The AppStore will now be running right on your lovely desktops and laptops! Please <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.slashgear.com/firefox-director-says-apple-is-looking-to-bypass-the-web-21109568/');" href="http://www.slashgear.com/firefox-director-says-apple-is-looking-to-bypass-the-web-21109568/">do not go elsewhere</a> for software. AppStore software is safe and Steve-Certified. Stop going on the internet. Stop visiting websites. Just get the app, pay for the subscription and live merrily. Can you see where this is going? Really, the majority of computers <i>should</i> be running something like iOS and us nerds should have our super-computers. The problem is that Apple is in control and what can that mean? </p>
<p>Firstly, I think it means Apple could shift towards selling desktops with iOS – this is all the functionality that most people need. The rest of you, you’ll have to pay for an expensive “developer” or “professional” computer and a license to be in the “professional” program to have your open OS X operating system. Your computer will also cost a lot more because you’re a professional. So Apple can bump up the profit margin that it once lost because of the commodification of fast computers.</p>
<p>Second is the problem that <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=2878');" href="http://www.bit-101.com/blog/?p=2878">Bit-101</a> brings up. The AppStore will be the defacto place to go to get any software. You know Apple will promote the shit out of it. Your new mac with have a Safari icon, an iTunes AppStore icon and an icon of Steve Jobs’ head that will tell you want to eat for lunch (and he gets 30% for the referral). So now, as a developer, if you want to sell your software it better be in the AppStore. If not, Mom will never find it and Mom wouldn’t trust it if she did. So, please pony up $99 for Apple’s developer program and start learning Objective C. Well, since you’re now in the AppStore – how does your app work on the iPad? The iPhone? The iPod touch? (What was Jobs saying about <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/10/18/apple.earnings/');" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/10/18/apple.earnings/">fragmentation</a>?) Better go buy all 3. Jobs loves fragmentation if it means you have to buy all his devices.</p>
<p>So, while I don’t like Apple’s general direction, I do think that an iOS-like OS is great for consumer computers. I’m just not sure it’s great for the rest of us and everyone’s wallets when Apple is in control.</p>
<p>*We probably won’t have spyware or harddrives in 50 years, eh?</p>

<p>This week, I want to talk about the discipline of military history: what it is, why it is important and how I see my own place within it.  This is going to be a bit of an unusual collections post as it is less about the past itself and more about how we study the past; it is also going to be a bit unusual in that it is mostly my own personal reflections, rather than a historical argument.</p>



<p>We do quite a lot of different kinds of history here on the blog.  There is a fair bit of<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/09/07/new-acquisitions-class-status-and-the-early-church/"> social history,</a> some <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/05/collections-a-trip-through-thucydides-fear-honor-and-interest/">intellectual </a><a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/12/12/collections-a-trip-through-cicero-natural-law/">history</a>, just a<a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/05/20/new-acquisitions-elective-monarchy-and-the-future-of-westeros/"> little bit of political history</a> and an absolute <a href="https://acoup.blog/tag/organic-economy/"><em>ton</em> of economic history</a>.  Obviously, I think all of those analytical lenses (and several I have not done, of course) are very important ways of understanding the past.  But a lot of what we discuss on the blog fits, narrowly or broadly, into the realm of <strong>military history</strong>.  And I want to talk about that.</p>



<p><strong>Now I should note that I do not consider myself purely a military historian</strong> – indeed, in my experience, few historians are ‘pure’ anything and if you narrow down their specialization enough, you simply end up with, “I am a historian of things which interest me” followed by a long list of what those are.  <strong>I see myself as both an economic and military historian (of the Mediterranean world, broadly construed)</strong> and my research tends to exist in the places where those two strands meet.  Sometimes that means processes that read as non-military (if it isn’t evident I have active research projects on farming and metal production, you haven’t been here long!) and sometimes those projects are more narrowly military.  <strong>I am a firm believer that a historian must be prepared to use whatever tools are going to provide the best answers to their research questions</strong>; for my own work, that has included (basic) statistical analysis, textual close reading, economic theory, archaeology (both traditional and experimental), social history, and even some chemistry and physics.  Whatever works!  But certainly, the methods of military history are one tool in my toolbox, even when I am looking to answer questions about non-military aspects of Mediterranean antiquity.</p>



<p><strong>It is no real secret that as a discipline, military history is sometimes held in low regard by other historians</strong>.  There are a number of reasons for this.  Often it has to do with outdated views on what military history <em>is</em> and what military historians <em>do</em>.  Frequently military history, because it has a large enthusiast and amateur audience, is regarded as an amateur field (something which is not helped by publishers who push quite out reams of quite frankly substandard works of this sort) lacking in sophistication, which is not accurate, but often believed.  And perhaps most often, in my experience, <strong>these opinions serve as cover for a deeper conviction that studying militaries and warfare is icky and only done by people who <em>like</em> war</strong> (when I was a student, this opinion when it was expressed by a certain generation of scholars, now mostly retired, came with a <em>very</em> predictable dose of Vietnam-era anti-military sentiment).  Often it seems the study of military history is neglected by other historians precisely because they find the subject matter uncomfortable.</p>



<p>So I want to talk about three major things here: what military history actually is and how it is done these days, why we should study military history and finally what my experience of being a military historian (both as a scholar and a teacher) has been, particularly given that I am a life-long civilian.  </p>

<h2>What is Military History?</h2>



<p>The popular conception of military history – indeed, the conception sometimes shared even by other historians – is that it is fundamentally a field about charting the course of armies, describing ‘great battles’ and praising the ‘strategic genius’ of this or that ‘great general.’  One of the more obvious examples of this assumption – and the contempt it brings – comes out of the popular CrashCourse youtube series.  When asked by their audience to cover military history related to their coverage of <em>the American Civil War</em>, the response was <a href="https://youtu.be/25HHVDOaGeE">this video listing battles </a>and reflecting on the pointless of the exercise, as if a list of battles was all that military history was (the same series would later say that military historians <a href="https://youtu.be/rlx6ur_D51s?t=323">don’t talk about about food</a>, a truly baffling statement given the important of logistics studies to the field; certainly in my own subfield, military historians tend to talk about food more than any other kind of historian except for dedicated food historians).</p>



<p>The term for works of history in this narrow mold – all battles, campaigns and generals – is <strong>“drums and trumpets” history, a term generally used derisively</strong>.  The study of battles and campaigns emerged initially as a form of training for literate aristocrats preparing to be officers and generals; it is little surprise that they focused on aristocratic leadership as the primary cause for success or failure.  Consequently, the old ‘drums and trumpets’ histories also had a tendency to<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/04/16/collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility/"> glory in war </a>and to glorify commanders for their ‘genius’ although this was by no means universal and works of history on conflict as far back as Thucydides and Herodotus (which is to say, as far back as there have been any) have reflected on the destructiveness and tragedy of war.  But military history, like any field, matured over time; I should note that it is <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/07/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-iiia-by-the-princess-irulan/">hardly the only field of history to have less respectable roots</a> in <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/02/14/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-iiib-myths-of-the-atreides/">its quite recent past</a>.  Nevertheless, as the field matured and moved beyond military aristocrats working to emulate older, more successful military aristocrats into a field of scholarly inquiry (still often motivated by the very real concern that officers and political leaders be prepared to lead in the event of conflict) the field has become far more sophisticated and its gaze has broadened to include not merely non-aristocratic soldiers, but non-soldiers more generally.</p>



<p>Instead of the ‘great generals’ orientation of ‘drums and trumpets,’ the field has moved in the direction of three major analytical lenses, laid out quite ably by Jeremy Black in “Military Organisations and Military Charge in Historical Perspective” (<em>JMH</em>, 1998). <strong> He sets out the three basic lenses as technological, social and organizational, which speak to both the questions being asked of the historical evidence but also the answers that are likely to be provided</strong>.  I should note that these lenses are mostly (though not entirely) about <em>academic</em> military history; much of the amateur work that is done is still very much ‘drums and trumpets’ (as is the occasional <em>deeply frustrating</em> books from some older historians we need not discuss here), although that is of course not to say that there isn’t good military history being written by amateurs or that all good military history narrowly follows these schools.  <strong>This is a classification system, not a straight-jacket and I am giving it here because it is a useful way to present the complexity and sophistication of the field as it is, rather than how it is imagined by those who do not engage with it.</strong></p>



<p>(I should note that <em>campaign studies</em> have not been entirely abandoned either.  What distinguishes the modern campaign or battle study from the old ‘drums and trumpets’ style is a broader use of historical causality that reaches beyond just upper-level command decisions. <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/10/30/fireside-friday-october-30-2020/"> Our recent recommendation, <em>Shattered Sword</em></a> is a good example of how what might have been a ‘drums and trumpets’ narrative of admirals and captains can instead be developed, using more sophisticated historical methods, into a much more complete and compelling historical argument about organizations, doctrines, technologies and so on.  And of course campaign histories will never go out of style – they are the essential foundation on which all other kinds of analysis must be laid)</p>



<p><strong>The technological approach is perhaps the least in fashion these days</strong>, but Geoffery Parker’s <em>The Military Revolution</em> (2nd ed. 1996) provides an almost pure example of the lens.  This approach tends to see changing technology – not merely military technologies, but often also civilian technologies – as the main motivator of military change (and also success or failure for states caught in conflict against a technological gradient).  <strong>Consequently, historians with this focus are often asking questions about how technologies developed, why the developed in certain places, and what their impacts were</strong>.  Another good example of the field, for instance, is the debate about the impact of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0700623833/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">rifled muskets</a> in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/171985727X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">American Civil War</a>.  While there has been a real drift away from seeing technologies themselves as decisive on their own (and thus a drift away from mostly ‘pure’ technological military history) in recent decades, this sort of history is very often paired with the others, looking at the ways that social structures, organizational structures and technologies interact.</p>



<p><strong>Perhaps the <em>most</em> popular lens for military historians these days is the social one</strong>, which used to go by the “new military history” (<em>decades </em>ago – it was the standard form even back in the 1990s) but <strong>by this point comprises probably the bulk of academic work on military history</strong>.  In its narrow sense, the social perspective of military history seeks to understand the army (or navy or other service branch) as an extension of the society that created it.  We have, you may note,<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/05/22/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-iv-men-of-rohan/"> done a bit of that here</a>.  Rather than understanding the army as a pure instrument of a general’s ‘genius’ it imagines it as a <em><strong>socially embedded</strong></em> institution – which is …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I have come to talk with you again, this time for my <code>fastpages</code> blog.</p>

<p><code>fastpages</code> gets a lot of things right for someone who uses <code>Jupyter</code> notebooks and wants to get into blogging. Prashanth Rao’s <a href="https://prrao87.github.io/blog/blogging-for-data-scientists/">article</a> does a great job of making the case for that.</p>



<p>However, being a long time user of the <a href="https://darkreader.org/">Dark Reader</a> browser extension, it was unusual to not have widespread dark mode support on many Jekyll themes, one of which <code>fastpages</code> is built on. Therefore, I decided to bring back the dark mode experience in this post.</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/dark-side.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>I personally prefer dark mode to light as it causes lesser strain on the eyes. It also helps illuminate content while the background fades away. For someone who spends a good part of the day stuck behind a screen, I’ve made it a point to keep the bright light intake for outdoors.</p>

<p>Since I have not dabbled in designing dark mode experiences before, I plan to keep this process simple and understandable. We shall be using a bunch of simple css rules while following Material Design dark theme <a href="https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html">guidelines</a> (mostly).</p>

<p>Here’s the sample fastpages sample blog <a href="https://fastpages.fast.ai/jupyter/2020/02/20/test.html">post</a> without Dark mode:</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/light-mode.png" alt="" title="Curb your light mode"></p>

<p>And here’s the <a href="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/jupyter/2020/02/20/test.html">same one</a> with dark mode enabled!</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/dark-mode.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Pretty cool, yeah? Let’s check out the code now.</p>

<p>If you’re in a hurry to join the dark side, feel free to scroll to the end of this post and download the dark mode stylesheet.</p>

<p>If your curious about the design choices I’ve made and would like to customize for yourself, stick with me here.</p>



<p>Let’s start with defining our palette.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$high-emph</span><span>:</span> <span>rgba</span><span>(</span><span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>.87</span><span>);</span> <span>// Colour 1 -&gt; White</span>
<span>$med-emph</span><span>:</span> <span>rgba</span><span>(</span><span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>.69</span><span>);</span> <span>//Noice</span>
<span>$low-emph</span><span>:</span> <span>rgba</span><span>(</span><span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>.38</span><span>);</span>
<span>$dark-grey</span> <span>:</span> <span>#121212</span><span>;</span> <span>// Colour 2</span>
<span>$overlay</span><span>:</span> <span>mix</span><span>(</span><span>$dark-grey</span><span>,</span> <span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>95%</span><span>);</span>
<span>$overlay-light</span><span>:</span> <span>mix</span><span>(</span><span>$dark-grey</span><span>,</span> <span>white</span><span>,</span> <span>86%</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it. Two colours and their shades.</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/palette.svg" alt="" title="From left, dark grey and its shades and then the whites"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Baseline <code>dark-grey</code> theme colour which is recommended by Material design and <em>lighter</em> variants of it for components such as code blocks and tables.</li>
  <li>Shades of <code>white</code> for different levels of emphasis of text. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>This also gives us the flexibility to choose <em>our own</em> primary dark color. For eg, if we change the value of <code>dark-grey</code> to that of something like <code>deep-purple</code> (<code>#1F1B24</code>). Voilà, we get the following palette:</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/palette-2.svg" alt=""></p>

<p>and theme:</p>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/purple-mode.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The palette can be easily customized to support your own favorite dark colour!</p>



<p>The rest of the stylesheet is more or less straightforward. Here are some additional quirks that I thought were cool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t forget to turn over your faithful scrollbar to the dark side</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>*</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>scrollbar-color</span><span>:</span> <span>$dark-grey</span> <span>$overlay-light</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/scrollbars.png" alt=""></p>

<ul>
  <li>You can invert the colour of your charts and plots to keep that dark consistency going.</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>canvas</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>filter</span><span>:</span> <span>invert</span><span>(</span><span>100%</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/light-dark-viz.png" alt="" title="I like my graphs like I like my chocolate, dark"></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Psst, Check out the dark graphs in action <a href="http://prudhvirampey.com/new_blog/jupyter/2020/02/20/test.html#Example-1:-DropDown">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>We also got some dark tables in the house babyy 👾</li>
</ul>

<div><div><pre><code><span>table</span> <span>th</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>background-color</span><span>:</span> <span>$overlay</span><span>;</span>
    <span>border-color</span><span>:</span> <span>$overlay-light</span><span>;</span>
    <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>$high-emph</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>table</span> <span>td</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>background-color</span><span>:</span> <span>$dark-grey</span><span>;</span>
    <span>border-color</span><span>:</span> <span>$overlay-light</span><span>;</span>
    <span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>$med-emph</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://prudhvirampey.com/blog/images/light-dark-tables.png" alt="" title="Let there be shiny data"></p>



<p>You can get the stylesheet from this Github gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/prampey/aac8f8436827ea09f53a67873142706c">here</a>. Save it to <code>_sass/minima</code> and add this import line in <code>custom-styles.scss</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/*-----------------------------------*/</span>
<span>/*----- ADD YOUR STYLES BELOW -------*/</span>

<span>@import</span> <span>"minima/dark-mode"</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it! <code>fastpages</code> finally has the power of the dark side.</p>

<p>Enjoy ⚡</p>

		<p><em>First published 26 January 2019. Last updated 26 January 2019.</em></p>
<p>I don’t know if I’m allowed to do this, but I’m just posting the full text of this article by Arthur Koestler, because it’s not easy to find without an NYT subscription.</p>
<p>NYT published this as “The Nightmare That Is a Reality” on 9 January 1944.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>There is a dream which keeps coming back to me at almost regular intervals; it is dark, and I am being murdered in some kind of thicket or brushwood; there is a busy road at no more than ten yards distance; I scream for help but nobody hears me, the crowd walks past laughing and chatting. I know that a great many people share, with individual variations, the same type of dream. I have quarrelled about it with analysts and I believe it to be an archetype in the jungian sense: an expression of the individual’s ultimate loneliness when faced with death and cosmic violence; and his inability to communicate the unique horror of his experience.</p>
<p>I further believe that it is the root of the ineffectiveness of our atrocity propaganda. For, after all, you are the crowd who walk past laughing on the road; and there are a few of us, escaped victims or eyewitnesses of the things which happen in the thicket and who, haunted by our memories, go on screaming on the wireless, yelling at you in newspapers and in public meetings, theatres and cinemas. Now and then we succeed in reaching your ear for a minute. I know it each time it happens by a certain dumb wonder on your faces, a faint glassy stare entering your eye; and I tell myself: now you have got them, now hold them, bold them, so that they will remain awake. But it only lasts a minute. You shake yourself like puppies who have got their fur wet; then the transparent screen descends again and you walk on, protected by the dream barrier which stifles all sound.</p>
<p>We, the screamers, have been at it now for about ten years. We started on the night when the epileptic van der Lubbe set fire to the German Parliament; we said that if you don’t quench those flames at once, they will spread all over the world; you thought we were maniacs. At present we have the mania of trying to tell you about the killing, by hot steam, mass-electrocution and live burial of the total Jewish population of Europe. So far three million have died. It is the greatest mass-killing in recorded history; and it goes on daily, hourly, as regularly as the ticking of your watch. I have photographs before me on the desk while I am writing this, and that accounts for my emotion and bitterness. People died to smuggle them out of Poland; they thought it was worth while. The facts have been published in pamphlets, White Books, newspapers, magazines and what not.</p>
<p>But the other day I met one of the best-known American journalists over here. He told me that in the course of some recent public opinion survey nine out of ten average American citizens, when asked whether they believed that the Nazis commit atrocities, answered that it was all propaganda lies, and that they didn’t believe a word of it. As to this country, I have been lecturing now for three years to the troops and their attitude is the same. They don’t believe in concentration camps, they don’t believe in the starved children of Greece, in the shot hostages of France, in the mass-graves of Poland; they have never heard of Lidice, Treblinka or Belzec; you can convince them for an hour, then they shake themselves, their mental self-defence begins to work and in a week the shrug of incredulity has returned like a reflex temporarily weakened by a shock.</p>
<p>Clearly all this is becoming a mania with me and my like. Clearly we must suffer from some morbid obsession, whereas the others are healthy and normal. But the characteristic symptom of maniacs is that they lose contact with reality and live in a phantasy world. So, perhaps, it is the other way round: perhaps it is we, the screamers, who react in a sound and healthy way to the reality which surrounds us, whereas you are the neurotics who totter about in a screened phantasy world because you lack the faculty to face the facts. Were it not so, this war would have been avoided, and those murdered within sight of your day-dreaming eyes would still be alive. I said: perhaps, because obviously the above can only be half the truth.</p>
<p>There have been screamers at all times-Prophets, Preachers, Teachers and Cranks, cursing the obtuseness of their contemporaries, and the situation-pattern remained very much the same. There are always the screamers screaming from the thicket and the people who pass by on the road. They have ears but hear not, they have eyes but see not. So the roots of this must lie deeper than mere obtuseness. Is it perhaps the fault of the screamers? Sometimes no doubt, but I do not believe this to be the core of the matter. Amos, Hosea, Jeremiah were pretty good propagandists and yet they failed to shake their people and to warn them. Cassandra’s voice was said to have pierced walls, and yet the Trojan war took place.</p>
<p>And at our end of the chain–in due proportion–I believe that on the whole the M.O.I. and B.B.C. are quite competent at their job. For almost three years they had to keep this country going on nothing but defeats, and they succeeded. But at the same time they lamentably failed to imbue the people with anything approaching a full awareness of what it was all about, of the grandeur and horror of the time into which they were born. They carried on business-as-usual style, with the only difference that the routine of this business included killing and being killed. Matter-of-fact unimaginativeness has become a kind of Anglo-Saxon racial myth; it is usually opposed to Latin hysterics and praised for its high value in an emergency. But the myth does not say what happens between emergencies and that the same quality is responsible for the failure to prevent their recurrence. Now this limitation of awareness is not an Anglo-Saxon privilege, though they are probably the only race which claims as an asset what others regard as a deficiency. Nor is it a matter of temperament; stoics have wider horizons than fanatics.</p>
<p>It is a psychological fact, inherent in our mental frame, which I believe has not been given sufficient attention in social psychology or political theory. We say, “I believe this,” or, “I don’t believe that,” “I know it,” or “I don’t know. it”; and regard these as black-and-white altematives. Now in reality both “knowing” and “believing” have varying degrees of intensity. I know that there was a man called Spartacus who led the Roman slaves into revolt; but my belief in his one-time existence is much paler than that of, say Lenin. I believe in spiral nebulae, can see them in a telescope and express their distance in figures; but they have a lower degree of reality for me than the inkpot on my table. Distance in space and time degrades intensity of awareness.</p>
<p>So does magnitude. Seventeen is a figure which I know intimately like a friend; fifty billions is just a sound. A dog run over by a car upsets our emotional balance and digestion; three million Jews killed in Poland cause but a moderate uneasiness. Statistics don’t bleed; it is the detail which counts. We are unable to embrace the total process with our awareness; we can only focus on little lumps of reality. So far all this is a matter of degrees; of gradations in the intensity of knowing and believing. But when we pass the realm of the finite and are faced with words like eternity in time, infinity of space, that is, when we approach the sphere of the Absolute, our reaction ceases to be a matter of degrees and becomes different in quality.</p>
<p>Faced with the Absolute, understanding breaks down, and our “knowing” and “believing” become pure lip-service. Death, for instance, belongs to the category of the Absolute and our belief in it is merely a lip-service belief. “I know” that, the average statistical age being about 65, I may reasonably expect to live no more than another 27 years, but if I knew for certain that I should die on November 30, 1970, at 5 A.M., I would be poisoned by this knowledge, count and recount the remaining days and hours, grudge myself every wasted minute, in other words develop a neurosis. This has nothing to do with hopes to live longer than the average; if the date were fixed ten years later, the neurosis-forming process would remain the same.</p>
<p>Thus we all live in a state of split consciousness. There is a tragic plane and a trivial plane, which contain. two mutually incompatible kinds of experienced knowledge. Their climate and language are as different as Church Latin from business slang. These limitations of awareness account for the limitations of enlightenment by propaganda. People go to cinemas, they see films of Nazi tortures, of mass-shootings, of underground conspiracy and self-sacrifice. They sigh, they shake their heads, some have a good cry. But they do not connect it with the realities of their normal plane of existence. It is Romance, it is Art, it is Those Higher Things, it is Church Latin. It does not click with reality. We live in a society of the Jekyll and Hyde pattern, magnified into gigantic proportions.</p>
<p>This was, however, not always the case to the same extent. There were periods and movements in history-in Athens, in the early Renaissance, during the first years of the Russian Revolution-when at least certain representative layers of society had attained a relatively high level of mental integration; times, when people seemed to rub their eyes and come awake, when their cosmic awareness seemed to expand, when they were “contemporaries” in a much broader and fuller sense; when the trivial and the cosmic planes seemed on the point of fusing. And there were periods of disintegration and dissociation. But never before, not even during the spectacular decay of Rome and Byzantium, was split thinking so palpably evident, such a uniform mass-disease; never did human psychology reach …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><img src="http://www.upv.es/noticias-upv/imagenes/int_itq.jpg" alt="" title=""></p><p>A team of researchers from the Universitat Politècnica de València  (UPV) and the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) has discovered a new method that makes it possible to transform electricity into hydrogen or chemical products by solely using microwaves – without cables and without any type of contact with electrodes. This can represent a disruption in the field of energy research and a key development for the decarbonisation of process industry, as well as for the future of the automotive sector and the chemical industry, among many others. The study has been published in the latest edition of Nature Energy.</p> 
<p>The technology developed and patented by the UPV and CSIC is based on the phenomenon of the microwave reduction of solid materials, in this study exemplified by the reduction of Cerium oxide. This method enables to carry out electrochemical processes directly without requiring electrodes, which simplifies and significantly reduce capital costs, as it provides more freedom in the design of the structure of the device and choosing the operation conditions, mainly the electrolysis temperature.</p> 
<p>“It is a technology with great practical potential, especially for its use in energy storage and production of synthetic fuels and green chemicals. This aspect has significant importance nowadays, as both transportation and industry are immersed in a transition towards decarbonisation and electrification, meaning they have to meet very challenging targets in 2030 and 2040 in order to decrease the consumption of energy and substances from fossil sources, mainly natural gas and oil,” highlights Prof. José Manuel Serra, researcher from the Chemical Technology Institute (ITQ).</p> 
<h3>Green hydrogen for industrial and transportation uses</h3> 
<p>The main use of this “disruptive” technology reported by researchers from the Information Technologies and Communications Institute (ITACA) of the UPV and ITQ, joint centre of the UPV and CSIC, is the production of green hydrogen (produced without emitting greenhouse gases) from water, for industrial and transportation uses.</p> 
<p>As noted by the ITQ and ITACA team, it is a technology with great potential for the automotive sector, specifically for cars fuelled by fuel cells and hybrids or large vehicles such as trains or ships. But also for the chemical industry, metallurgy, the ceramic sector or the production of fertilisers, among many other sectors. “This method will make it possible to transform renewable electricity, typically of solar or wind origin, into added value products and green fuels. It has countless uses and we hope that new uses will emerge for energy storage and process industry, by tuning materials composition and operation conditions”, highlights Prof. José Manuel Catalá, researcher at the ITACA institute of the UPV.</p> 
<p>In the article published in Nature Energy, the researchers also provide a techno-economic study that reveals that this technology would enable to obtain high energetic efficiency, and that the cost of the facilities (CAPEX) to carry out the hydrogen production process are very competitive compared to conventional technologies for hydrogen production.</p> 
<h3>Ultra-fast charging of batteries… and space exploration</h3> 
<p>The UPV and CSIC team is studying other future uses for this technology, and is currently focusing its efforts on the use for the ultra-fast charging of batteries “Our technology could enable a practically instantaneous reduction (electron injection) of the electrode (metallic anode) that stores energy. In other words, we would go from a (2D) layer-based progressive charging process, which can take hours, to a simultaneous recharging process in the entire (3D) volume of the material storing the energy, which would make it possible to charge a battery in a few seconds,” says Prof. Catalá.</p> 
<p>Another use would be the direct generation of oxygen with microwaves, which opens a broad spectrum of new uses. “One specific use would be the direct production of oxygen with extra-terrestrial rocks (regoliths), which could have a key role in the future exploration and colonisation of the Moon, Mars or other moons in the solar system,” concludes Prof. Serra.</p> 
<h3>A short history of the discovery</h3> 
<p>The team of researchers observed that when ionic materials were treated with microwaves, the materials displayed unusual changes in their properties, especially in their electronic conductivity, changes that did not happen upon conventional heating. “We were very intrigued about these sudden changes in their electrical properties and wanted to understand what process was going on. For this reason, we keep on designing new experiments, new microwave reactors and utilizing other analytical techniques,” explains Prof. Catalá.</p> 
<p>The team from the ITACA and ITQ institutes verified that microwaves interact with these materials by ‘accelerating’ the electrons and triggering the release of molecules of oxygen from their structure (which is also called reduction). This change became visible to us by sudden alterations to the conductivity at relatively low temperatures (approximately 300ºC). “This non-equilibrium state is maintained while microwaves are applied, but tends to revert back via reoxygenation (reoxidation) when microwaves are switched off. At first sight, we realised the great practical potential of this discovery, especially now that very ambitious goals should be meet in the next two decades to reach an economy with zero net greenhouse gas emissions,” concludes Prof. Serra.</p>

  <p>Being able to feel empathy and to take in the other person's perspective – these are two abilities through which we understand what is going on in the other person's mind. Although both terms are in constant circulation, it is still unclear what exactly they describe and constitute. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI CBS) in Leipzig, together with colleagues from Oxford University and other institutions, have now developed a model which explains what empathy and perspective taking are made of. They show that it is not one specific skill that enables us to put ourselves in another person's shoes. These skills are made up of many individual factors that vary according to the situation.</p>

<p>Understanding what other people want, how they feel, and how they see the world is becoming increasingly important in our complex, globalised society. Social skills enable us to make friends and create a network of people who support us. But not everyone finds it easy to interact with other people. One of the main reasons is that two of the most important social skills - empathy, i.e. being able to empathise with the other person's emotions, and the ability to take a perspective, i.e. being able to gain an information by adopting another person’s point of view - are developed to different degrees.</p>
<p>Researchers have long been trying to find out what helps one to understand others. The more you know about these two social skills, the better you can help people to form social relationships. However, it still not exactly clear what empathy and perspective taking are (the latter is also known as “theory of mind“). Being able to read a person's emotions through their eyes, understand a funny story, or interpret the action of another person—in everyday life there are always social situations that require these two important abilities. However, they each require a combination of different individual subordinate skills. If it is necessary to interpret looks and facial expressions in one situation, in another it may be necessary to think along with the cultural background of the narrator or to know his or her current needs.</p>

          Both capabilities, empathy and theory of mind, are processed in the brain by a 'main network' specialised in empathy (red brain areas) or changing perspective (blue brain areas), which is activated in every social situation. But, depending on the situation, it also involves additional networks.

<p>To date, countless studies have been conducted that examine empathy and perspective taking as a whole. However, it has not yet been clarified what constitutes the core of both competencies and where in the brain their bases lie. Philipp Kanske, former MPI CBS research group leader and currently professor at the TU Dresden, together with Matthias Schurz from the Donders Institute in Nijmegen, Netherlands, and an international team of researchers, have now developed a comprehensive explanatory model.</p>
<p>"Both of these abilities are processed in the brain by a 'main network' specialised in empathy or changing perspective, which is activated in every social situation. But, depending on the situation, it also involves additional networks," Kanske explains, referring to the results of the study, which has just been published in the journal&nbsp;<i>Psychological Bulletin</i>. If we read the thoughts and feelings of others, for example, from their eyes, other additional regions are involved than if we deduce them from their actions or from a narrative. "The brain is thus able to react very flexibly to individual requirements."</p>
<p>For empathy, a main network that can recognise acutely significant situations, for example, by processing fear, works together with additional specialised regions, for example, for face or speech recognition. When changing perspective, in turn, the regions that are also used for remembering the past or fantasising about the future, i.e., for thoughts that deal with things that cannot be observed at the moment, are active as the core network. Here too, additional brain regions are switched on in each concrete situation.</p>
<p><strong>Complex social problems require a combination of empathy and perspective taking</strong></p>
<p>Through their analyses, the researchers have also found out that particularly complex social problems require a combination of empathy and a change of perspective. People who are particularly competent socially seem to view the other person in both ways­—­on the basis of feelings and on the basis of thoughts. In their judgement, they then find the right balance between the two.</p>
<p>"Our analysis also shows, however, that a lack of one of the two social skills can also mean that not this skill as a whole is limited. It may be that only a certain factor is affected, such as understanding facial expressions or speech melody," adds Kanske. A single test is therefore not sufficient to certify a person's lack of social skills. Rather, there must be a series of tests to actually assess them as having little empathy, or as being unable to take the other person's point of view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scientists have investigated these relationships by means of a large-scale meta-analysis. They identified, on the one hand, commonalities in the MRI pattern of the 188 individual studies examined when the participants used empathy or perspective taking. This allowed the localisation of the core regions in the brain for each of the two social skills. However, results also indicated how the MRI patterns differed depending on the specific task and, therefore, which additional brain regions were used.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src="https://www.andrewdenty.com/blog/assets/img/catalina-vs-big-sur.jpg" alt="Catalina vs Big Sur">
This post is an attempt to provide a visual comparison of pretty dramatic UI changes between macOS Catalina and Big Sur.</p>
<p>Why did I end up doing this? Well, this week I installed the developer beta of macOS Big Sur as I was curious what impact the new UI would have on the <a href="https://www.andrewdenty.com/airtame-desktop-app.html">app I currently design</a>. I wanted to make sure my team was ahead of any coming changes as we were burned by changes in last year’s release of Catalina.</p>
<p>I found myself taking lots of screenshots to try and track the changes and thought this might be worth sharing. I decided to carry out a quick catalogue of the UI changes as this may be helpful to other people getting ready for macOS Big Sur.</p>
<p>All of the screenshots below are taken on a default install of macOS and the Catalina version is always on the left. I made a conscious effort not to resize any windows or change any default settings. I haven’t captured everything, but it is a good taste of the changes so far.</p>
<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions</h2>


<p>At first glance macOS is a lot more colourful with, and the biggest obvious change is the bright, slightly more cartoonish iOS shaped icons. Everything is more rounded and it feels like everything has gotten a little bigger. Could this be the first hint that macOS is preparing for touch support in the future? One interesting tidbit, is that even though the icons are based around the capsule shape, many of them (like Contacts, or Preview) have elements which protrude from them giving an extra feeling of depth.</p>
<h2 id="finder-and-preview">Finder and Preview</h2>
<p>Finder sees some significant changes. Of all the places I think Apple needs to get the new UI spot on, is Finder. Overall the default size of Finder seems to be bigger in macOS Big Sur.</p>


<p>One thing that struck me at this point is that Finder looks a mess with many of the more advanced features enabled. The bottom screenshot shows Finder with a Path Bar, Status Bar and multiple tabs. To me, it seems like the design team have not yet been able to find a way to elegantly integrate these elements into the iOS inspired UI.</p>
<p>One final thing to note is that in Finder the search bar at the top right has been replaced with a search icon that expands when clicked. This change seems a little inconsistent as it’s not made it to Preview. I can guarantee this will result in fewer people discovering Finder’s Spotlight search goodness.</p>
<h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>
<p>Preferences sees quite a lot of change in some areas.
The Dock preferences pane has become “Dock and Menu Bar” and now integrates controls for the new macOS control center. It uses a nicely integrated sidebar to manage different categories.</p>
<p>It’s a shame that this sidebar hasn’t yet made it to other parts of the preferences UI with Network and Notifications still using a very old looking sidebar.</p>
<p>One aspect of preferences that has been quite controversial (on Twitter at least) is the new icons. I’m going to hold off judgement for now as they don’t yet look finished. For example, the Notifications icon does not even support retina displays.</p>


<p>You’ll notice that the Startup Disk pane uses apples new dialog (or sheet) UI. This is quite a departure from the existing sheet drop-down - it feels much more iOS-like.</p>
<h2 id="menu-bar-and-notification-center">Menu Bar and Notification Center</h2>
<p>This is one of the areas where macOS has changed the most. It’s also difficult to take decent screenshots of both of these. Control Center looks like it’s been badly photocopied and the Notification Center in Catalina has a bug whereby it renders at double it’s normal width.</p>
<p>What was obvious within a few minutes of use was that the Control Center is a massive improvement on Catalina’s row of scattered Menu bar icons. The updated WiFi menu is also a massive improvement, as the old list could easily be overwhelming with the number of WiFi networks displayed.</p>
<p>I’m less convinced that the Notification Center is easier to use though. Now it has no background, there is less to separate a list of notifications from my messy desktop!</p>
<p>I will try and get better screenshots for this section and update it in the near future.</p>


<h2 id="safari">Safari</h2>





<h2 id="reminders">Reminders</h2>


<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>The biggest news in Notes is that after years, the Skeuomorphic paper texture has finally been retired!</p>


<h2 id="photos">Photos</h2>


<h2 id="apple-music-and-podcasts">Apple Music and Podcasts</h2>
<p>Music and Podcasts were brand new last year with the release of Catalina. It’s obvious that the new UI has been planned for a while as Apple Music and Podcasts are mostly indistinguishable from their initial Catalina release. For example both apps already include the new full height sidebar.</p>
<p>For me this illustrates a bigger point that <a href="https://twitter.com/stevesi/status/1275311056672325633" target="_blank">Steven Sinofsky recently made on Twitter</a> - that Apple is executing a meticulous multi-year strategy.</p>


<p>One area where changes are evident are is in preferences windows. Both apps make use of Apple’s new accent colour and new glyph icon library.</p>
<h2 id="other-bundled-apps">Other bundled apps</h2>
<p>It was impossible to go into depth with every single bundled app. On the whole, the updates to Maps, Books and Mail all look solid with extensive use of the new sidebar.</p>


<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>
<p>Both Activity Monitor and Disk Utility have received a new style toolbar. As with Finder, there are no longer any rows meaning all elements are at the same level. On first impressions, I feel this is a little visually confusing and makes it harder to scan. The search field also loses a lot of its contrast.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly Terminal is almost unchanged.</p>


<h2 id="almost-unchanged">Almost unchanged</h2>
<p>On the subject of unchanged apps, there were a number of other apps that are so far relatively unchanged.</p>
<p>Siri in macOS Big Sur shows no apparent changes. I think this is a little strange considering the overhaul Siri is receiving in iOS 14. There don’t even seem to be any radius changes to the borders.</p>
<p>The most extreme case of no change is Stickies. It’s completely identical between both releases. What’s more, I don’t think it’s changed much since MacOS 9 judging from its weird, retro controls.</p>


<p>Boot Camp is also practically unchanged, although this is perhaps unsurprising given Apple’s move to Apple Silicon, so presumably Boot Camp’s days are numbered. It did receive a new icon though.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>Overall, the UI changes in macOS aren’t as dramatic as I was expecting. Big Sur’s new UI feels like a largely incremental set of changes to make macOS feel more coherent with iOS and iPad OS. Even if there are a few teething issues and the look is a little jarring at first, this has to be a good thing in the long-term.</p>
<p>Having said that, Apple still has a vast amount of work to do to perfect the new macOS UI. It unsurprising as this is the first developer beta, but there are still many rough edges.</p>
<p>I hope in the long term they focus on creating consistent patterns: for example for the first launch experience of apps. Right now there are several different layouts and approaches to this UI. I also hope Apple don’t leave pro users behind. Right now some of the less frequently used UI elements such as status bars and path bars look a little unloved. They don’t feel well integrated into the UI and in some cases lack visual separation.</p>

        <h2>Cold Email for Interesting People</h2>
        <p>Whether you want a new job, to meet your heroes, a feature on someone's show, or a unique opportunity that the public doesn't know about, the best way to get it is simple: just ask for what you want. I built an international career from the middle of Iowa, thousands miles away from the action. If you're like me and don't have tons of connections, you'll need to cold-contact people who you've never met to get things started. This course equips you with specific tactics for writing successful cold emails and encourages you to take your shot.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Video Introduction</h5>
        <p>In a short video, I discuss fundamental concepts relating to cold email including social proof, overcoming
            objections, and formulating a specific ask. <i>16 Minutes</i>.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Handbook</h5>
        <p>The handbook walks step-by-step through the process of deciding to write a cold email, figuring out who to email, finding their contact information, writing a compelling first message, and closing the conversation. <i>31 Pages</i>.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Six Annotated Examples</h5>
        <p>Go behind the scenes of my cold email success. I've annotated six examples from the past two years to share with you. Each example includes one or two emails, the context, and the
        payoff. For each email, I go through line-by-line and discuss the impact of the words and phrases. <i>48 Pages</i>.</p>

    <div>
        
        <h5>What is a cold email?</h5>
        <p>A cold email is sending an email to someone who you do not know, or do not know well. The "cold" in cold email doesn't
        refer to the tone (which should generally be warm, friendly, and professional), but rather to the lack of previous
        relationship.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Am I an interesting person?</h5>
        <p>I think so! Whether or not someone is interesting is quite situational. For example, Tom Brady wouldn't be interested in
        hearing from me with ideas for plays to run, but a developer advocate might be interested in hearing from me with ideas
        for technical content. Being interesting isn't so much an attribute but an action, so anyone can be interesting to the right person in the right situation!</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Who is this course not for?</h5>
        <p>This isn't a course about copywriting for mass emails or other bulk outreach. It isn't about generating leads or making
        tons of LinkedIn connections with some boilerplate message. It is about thinking deeply about how to connect with
        individuals about mutually interesting things.</p>
        <br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h5>How much should I pay?</h5>
        <p><i>Cold Email for Interesting People</i> is a pay-what-you-want product. You can pay any amount, even zero dollars, but I'd appreciate it if you paid for the product for both of our benefits. Paying for the product helps me run my business and makes you more invested in the content. You can also download for free, see if you like it, and then buy it again if you found it valuable.</p>
        <p>I did pay-what-you-want without a minimum to achieve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination#First_degree">perfect price discrimination</a> and avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)">price anchoring</a>. But, if you really want guidance, let's say that if twenty bucks isn't a big deal for you, you should pay about that much, but if twenty bucks is a big deal for you, you should pay five or grab it for free and not feel bad either way. If you know me personally, you get it for free.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Is there a refund policy?</h5>
        <p>I have a 30-day no-questions-asked refund policy. If you don't like your purchase, let me know and I will refund your
            money. Because the product is pay-what-you-want, if you think you'd ask for a refund, I'd rather you just download for free because that saves us both time.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>What if I have another question?</h5>
        <p>Send me an email at <a href="mailto:philip@kiely.xyz">philip@kiely.xyz</a>.</p>

<p>American Bank Systems (ABS), a company that provides services to U.S. financial institutions and banks helping them “operate efficiently and confidently in a rapidly evolving – highly regulated – environment” has been hit by a ransomware attack this month.</p>



<p><strong><em>Avaddon</em>,</strong> the ransomware group behind the attack had earlier alleged they had acquired over 50 GB of the company’s proprietary data but had leaked a partial 4 GB dump earlier this month, part of which has been analyzed by <em>Security Report News.</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="554" height="401" src="https://cdn-5f9bf324c1ac1811c804b9cf.closte.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://cdn-5f9bf324c1ac1811c804b9cf.closte.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-3.png 554w, https://cdn-5f9bf324c1ac1811c804b9cf.closte.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-3-300x217.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px" data-srcset="//cdn-5f9bf324c1ac1811c804b9cf.closte.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-3.png 554w, //cdn-5f9bf324c1ac1811c804b9cf.closte.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-3-300x217.png 300w" data-src="//cdn-5f9bf324c1ac1811c804b9cf.closte.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/image-3.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Screenshot of files present in leaked data dump (source: Avaddon)</figcaption></figure>



<p>It appears, this week, the threat actors have published the full 52.57 GB dump after ABS had likely refused to cooperate with <em>Avaddon’s</em> ransom demands.</p>



<p>The incident seems to have occurred sometime in or before early October, given the timestamps on the screenshots of leaked files.</p>



<p>The cyberattack is concerning as ABS’ clients included multiple banking names and mortgage companies, such as <em>First Federal Community Bank</em>,<em> Rio Bank</em>, <em>Citizens Bank of Swainsboro,</em> <em>First Bank &amp; Trust</em>, etc.</p>



<p>Although ABS’ clients—banks and mortgage providers, may not have been directly hit by this cyberattack, ABS does provide banking software and systems to facilitate bank processes and compliance requirements to these banks. </p>



<p>By breaching ABS, threat actors may have therefore gained access to their clients’ data, and further the banking customers’ data.</p>



<h2>Data contains loan documents, emails, contracts, network shares, passwords</h2>



<p>The leaked data in the dump includes files such as loan documents, business contracts, private emails, invoices, credentials for network shares, and other confidential information.</p>

<p>Another document, a spreadsheet shown below appears to be financial records of a bank that had used ABS’ services. This is likely how the attackers got access to the bank’s files.</p>



<p>In the financial document, along with personal information and loan amounts, the banking customers’ Tax ID numbers (likely Social Security Numbers) are also exposed.</p>

<p>Other proprietary information leaked includes what appears to be employee and customer data.</p>



<h2>Not clear how many customers impacted</h2>



<p>Ransomware attacks can hit any business despite having state-of-the-art security controls in place as <em>human element</em> remains the weakest link.</p>



<p>However, this incident is particularly chilling.</p>



<p>By breaching just one company <em>American Bank Systems (ABS) </em>that touts itself as providing compliance and risk management services to multiple banks, the threat actors gained access to not only ABS’ client systems (i.e. banks and financial institutions) but also got their hands on data of individuals who are customers of these banks.</p>



<p>It is not clear how many individual banking customers and financial organizations are impacted as a result of this breach. </p>



<p><em>Security Report</em> had been monitoring the ransomware operators’ claims for weeks but waited to publish our findings after they were made public on Twitter:  </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It is also not known what steps has ABS taken to protect their systems moving forward, and those of the partner banks after this incident.</p>



<p>And more importantly, who is addressing the individual banking customers whose personal information has been compromised as a part of this cyberattack?</p>



<p><em>Security Report</em> reached out to multiple ABS contacts via email for comment but we have not heard back yet.</p>

      Papers are like poems. Some are dazzling, some are pedestrian, some are insightful, and some reward long periods of quiet contemplation. They stir up an emotional reaction that goes beyond the strictly rational, and can often be deeply personal.</p>

    <p>
      In graduate school, during a period of identity crisis, I came across <a href="https://felleisen.org/matthias/">Matthias Felleisen's</a> “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016764239190036W">On the Expressive Power of Programming Languages</a>”. At a time when the world was ruled by C++, I had immersed myself in Scheme, so I always looked skeptically at mainstream linguistic claims. However, the language wars seemed beyond rational discourse. So the idea that someone could take a concept as nebulous as “expressiveness&amp;rdquo and formalize it was already a revelation. But the beauty of this paper goes well beyond that: it also lies in the cleanliness of the approach, the correspondence of the formalism to intuition, and the tautness of its execution.</p>

    <p>
      It was the most stunning paper I had ever read, and remains so. It's like the poem that never leaves your soul.</p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, this paper may not be easy to read for the uninitiated: it depends on a certain amount of “cultural knowledge” of programming language theory. I hope to peel off some of those layers and help you, too, understand the paper — hopefully while preserving the joy and beauty I experienced.</p>

    <p>This post contains three updates at different points in time on formalizing
chapter 1 of Michael Spivak’s <em>Calculus</em> book and its problems in <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/">Lean</a>.</p>
<p>You can find the proofs <a href="https://github.com/tomhoule/spivak-calculus/">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="just-starting">Just starting</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>On n’écrit qu’à la pointe de son savoir, à cette pointe extrême qui sépare
notre savoir et notre ignorance, et qui fait passer l’un dans l’autre. C’est
seulement de cette façon qu’on est déterminé à écrire.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_and_Repetition"><em>Différence et
répétition</em></a>, towards
the beginning)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They say the right time to write about something is while learning. I just got
through <a href="https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean/"><em>Theorem proving in
Lean</em></a> — tons of fun,
warmly recommended — and now feels like the time to see what I can do with it.</p>
<p>I have Michael Spivak’s
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/328645.Calculus"><em>Calculus</em></a>, third
edition, lying around at home. It should be accessible with a bit of help from
the internet, so this is what I will attempt to go through. I expect nearly all
of the book’s content to be new to me.</p>
<p>What I want to validate is that for someone reasonably familiar with programming
who wants to learn more mathematics, it is possible to learn by writing proofs
and solving problems from regular maths textbooks with existing tools, and in
particular the Lean theorem prover. <strong>The hard part should be the mathematics,
not handling the theorem prover</strong>.</p>
<p>I have the feeling this would be the best way for me to learn, since I lack the
confidence in my hand-written proofs, and I know by experience that I make a lot
of mistakes. On paper, these mistakes end up derailing the proof, but they
wouldn’t have serious consequences if every step was checked by a computer: I
can just correct them.</p>
<p>I will frequently refer to
<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib">mathlib</a>, the Lean community’s
library of formalized theorems. It contains basic facts and structures you do
not want to build again when writing your own proofs, as well as extremely
useful tactics like <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#linarith"><code>linarith</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="first-chapter">First chapter</h3>
<p>The first chapter is titled <em>Basic properties of numbers</em>. Its purpose is to
reformulate and condense facts that the reader supposedly already knows.</p>
<p>Twelve properties are treated. Four properties of addition:</p>
<ol>
<li>Associativity: $$ a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c $$</li>
<li>Zero as the identity element: $$ a + 0 = 0 + a = a $$</li>
<li>Addition of opposites: $$ a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0 $$</li>
<li>Commutativity: $$ a + b = b + a $$</li>
</ol>
<p>By now, subtraction is already defined, and two small proofs already carried
out. I used the standard library’s <code>int</code> module for the time being, but
I suspect we’ll have to switch to mathlib’s real number module or something
else, after I read a bit more about it.</p>
<p>The next properties are about multiplication:</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Associativity: $$ a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c $$</li>
<li>One as the identity element: $$ a \cdot 1 = 1 \cdot a = a $$</li>
<li>Multiplication of inverses:
$$ \forall a, a ≠ 0 \to \exists a^{-1}, a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = 1 $$</li>
<li>Commutativity: $$ a \cdot b = b \cdot a $$</li>
</ol>
<p>Division is then defined in terms of multiplication. The part of property 7
about <em>a</em>&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0 explains why division by zero doesn’t work (it has no meaningful
inverse).</p>
<p>At this point, I feel an itch to generalize this beyond integers. We’re going to
need at least real numbers, I figure. I start browsing Wikipedia:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">groups</a> aren’t what we want
(numbers under addition are a group, but not multiplication because it lacks
invertibility). Next stop is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication#Multiplication_of_different_kinds_of_numbers">multiplication</a>,
which points me to the page on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_of_the_real_numbers#Construction_from_Cauchy_sequences">construction of real
numbers</a>,
where I&nbsp;learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)">ordered
fields</a>. This is apparently
what we&nbsp;want, and mathlib <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html">apparently supports
them</a>.</p>
<p>I hope this attitude of digging just as deep as I need to in order to make
progress is going to work out.</p>
<p>After a little while digging into how to import mathlib (combination of using
the right lean version in <code>leanpkg.toml</code>, learning the existence of <code>import</code>
statements, and the right <code>leanpkg</code> invocations — <em>Note added later: use
<code>leanproject</code> instead if you want to avoid compiling mathlib, it is very
time-consuming</em>), I realize working with fields won’t let you use convenient
numeric notations. I try real numbers — appropriately located at
<code>data.real.basic</code> in mathlib — only to realize that reflexivity doesn’t work for
things as simple as <code>5 - 3 = 2</code>. Looking at the source for the <code>data.real.basic</code>
module, it seems like many definitions are non-computable. It makes sense,
because real numbers aren’t the floats we know and love, π isn’t some
approximation but really π, and we can’t compute that exactly. I don’t know whether Lean
can “specialize” computable instances automatically, and detect that even though
<code>5</code> and <code>3</code> are real numbers in this context, <code>5 - 3</code> is computable. I’d have to
know more about representations of reals to know if it’s a temporary limitation
in mathlib or something deeper. So I go with rational numbers for the examples
involving reflexivity. <code>α</code> is a field, rational numbers are a field, so it works
out nicely.</p>
<p>The consequences of the properties of multiplication give rise to two nice
examples we can prove in Lean:</p>
<pre><code>example : (a ≠ 0) → (a * b = a * c) → b = c :=
assume hnzero h,
    calc
        b   = 1 * b : by rw one_mul
        ... = (a⁻¹ * a) * b : by rw [inverse_mul α a hnzero]
        ... = a⁻¹ * (a * b) : by rw [mul_assoc']
        ... = a⁻¹ * (a * c) : by rw [h]
        ... = c : by rw [mul_assoc', inverse_mul α a hnzero, one_mul]

example : a ≠ 0 → (a * b = 0) → (a = 0 ∨ b = 0) :=
assume hnzero h,
or.inr $ calc
    b = 1 * b : by rw one_mul b
    ... = (a⁻¹ * a) * b : by rw [inverse_mul α a hnzero]
    ... = a⁻¹ * (a * b) : by rw [mul_assoc']
    ... = a⁻¹ * 0 : by rw h
    ... = 0 : by rw mul_zero
</code></pre>
<p>I started by adding <code>decidable α</code> instance on top of <code>field α</code> to get
<code>a&nbsp;=&nbsp;0&nbsp;∨&nbsp;¬(a&nbsp;=&nbsp;0)</code> for the second example. It felt like it should be possible to
prove it without, but it seemed like even mathlib uses <code>classical</code> (see
<code>mul_eq_zero'</code> in <code>group_with_zero.lean</code>, and <code>division_ring.to_domain</code> in
<code>field.lean</code>). Then I noticed the book relies on <code>a ≠ 0</code> and added the hypothesis.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Distributivity: $$ a \cdot (b + c) = (a \cdot b) + (a \cdot c) $$</li>
</ol>
<p>For the next proof, I needed a proof of <code>0&nbsp;≠&nbsp;2</code>, which I got to from <code>0&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;2</code>,
which required changing the instance of <code>field&nbsp;α</code> to <code>linear_ordered_field&nbsp;α</code>.
That seems reasonable.</p>
<p>Writing down the proof also made it clearer that the part that needs
distributivity is <code>a&nbsp;+&nbsp;a&nbsp;= 2&nbsp;*&nbsp;a</code>:</p>
<pre><code>def add_self_eq_two_mul : a + a = 2 * a :=
calc
    a + a   = (a * 1) + a : by rw mul_one'
        ... = (a * 1) + (a * 1) : by rw mul_one'
        ... = a * (1 + 1) : by rw [←mul_distrib']
        ... = a * 2 : by refl
        ... = 2 * a : by rw mul_comm'
</code></pre>
<p><code>-a</code> can also be called an additive inverse. Interesting.</p>
<p>…<em>ellipsis</em>…</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="two-weeks-later">Two weeks later</h2>
<p>I continued going through the chapter step by step, and now getting started on
the problems.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some patterns like “divide both sides of the equation by the same amount” do
not translate easily to Lean. I had to learn to “summon” values, adding zero,
then opposite, or multiplying by one, then inverse.</li>
<li>Represent sequences with inductively defined functions (gizmo).</li>
<li>A lot of function names to memorize</li>
<li>I somehow find some facts easier to grasp through induction rules:
<ul>
<li><code>choose k n = choose k-1 n-1 + choose k n-1</code></li>
<li><code>n! = n * (n-1)!</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I had to figure out big operators and how to use finite sets (<code>finset</code>)</li>
<li>For problem 4, I had to figure out casts and
<code>rwa</code>, <code>simpa</code>. Do the computable parts with integers, then cast to reals to
work with square roots. Computations with real numbers were a pain at first,
since they are not computable: you need to cast to something computable, like
rational numbers, to make any progress. <em>Note added later: this was all solved when I learned
about the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#norm_num"><code>norm_num</code></a> and <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#norm_cast"><code>norm_cast</code></a> tactics</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#library_search">library_search</a>,
<a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/tactics.html#squeeze_simp%20/%20squeeze_simpa%20/%20squeeze_dsimp%20/%20squeeze_scope">squeeze_simp</a>
are big time-savers and enormously helpful in discovering more of mathlib. One
pattern that works really well when you are looking for the right theorems to
invoke for the next step in your proof, is to write it in the most general way
possible in an example or a helper function, and try <code>library_search</code> on that.</li>
<li>Try <code>#lint</code> — it’s quaint.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll stop here now, and focus on solving the problems without worrying about
whether this will make a good blog post.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-few-months-later">A few months later</h2>
<p>Let’s follow up on the experience report, where I wrote down my impressions as I
just started working on the problems from Michael Spivak’s
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/328645.Calculus"><em>Calculus</em></a> (3rd ed.) with
the Lean theorem prover.</p>
<p>A few months later, <a href="https://github.com/tomhoule/spivak-calculus/">I finished writing Lean proofs for all the problems in chapter 1</a>.</p>
<p>After the expected period of familiarization with Lean and
mathlib, what I hoped for is what happened: <strong>at this point, for the problems I
am solving, the hard part is the maths, not the theorem prover</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="writing-down-the-problems">Writing down the problems</h3>
<p>Some problems took some thinking to translate from natural language into Lean.
Stating the problem precisely is part of the proof effort.</p>
<p>Take problem 24 (c):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <code>s(a_{1},...,a_{k})</code> be some sum formed from <code>a_{1},...,a_{k}</code>. Show that
$$s(a_{1},…,a_{k}) = a_{1} + … + a_{k}$$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “some sum” part is open to interpretation. It could mean different ordering
of the terms, or different precedence. I went with precedence, and wrote the
following proof</p>
<pre><code>-- For any list of lists of sums, show that the sum of the list_sum's is equal
-- to the list_sum of the concatenated lists. This shows the order of
-- additions does not matter.
def part_c : ∀ (sums : list (list ℝ)), list_sum (list.join sums) = sums.foldl running_list_sum 0
| [] := rfl
| (head::tail) := by {
    let consed := list.cons head tail,
    have ih : list_sum (list.join tail) = tail.foldl running_list_sum 0, from part_c tail,
    have left : list_sum …</code></pre></div></div>

            <h4>Using Matrix to replace proprietary and centralized chat apps</h4><p>
            Reading time: 3 minutes.
            </p><p>As you may know it, I am a fervent user of the chat protocol Matrix.
If you don’t know what Matrix is, this is basically a protocol developed by the Matrix Foundation. Matrix is made to be federated, it means that servers implementing correctly the Matrix specification can communicate and therefore, users that are not on the same servers can still talk to each other. Some examples of federation would be with Activitypub (Mastodon) or Usenet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But wait Jae, we already have countless other chat apps already, Telegram, Signal and even XMPP which is federated!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, here are the advantages of Matrix over all of those:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Matrix is 100% open-source. As you may know Telegram’s servers are currently closed-source which poses a problem about trust. Nobody can say what the server is doing nor what it is harvesting which could be very dangerous. On the other hand, Signal, XMPP and Matrix are all fully open-source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matrix isn’t centralized to a single server. Currently, Telegram and Signal are centralized apps which means if the server goes down, everyone else goes down. moxie0 of Signal even wrote a <a href="https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/">blog post</a> on ‘why Signal will never have federation’ which is in my opinion a big mistake. XMPP still stands up as it is federated as well and has plenty of server implementations.</p>

<p>Matrix has a flagship client which has a great UX. <strong>This</strong> is a big point, as other federated protocols such as XMPP are kinda like a jungle for new users, you are greeted with a list of all clients which you can use and then comes the step where you have to choose your server. Lots of those servers are sometime hard to find, have very spartan UIs or even no web form or easy way to register whatsoever. On the other hand, Matrix has a flagship, <strong>Element</strong>, which is deemed as the ‘official Matrix client’ since it implements the Matrix specification correctly and is made by basically the same people. While other projects would have only done a server, Element made a polished client, focused mainly on the UX in order for people to take the first steps of moving to anything else easier. Even if the UX is still not perfect and some aspects aren’t finished yet, moving to Element will be easier than moving to any other XMPP client.</p>

</ol>
<p>I have been using Matrix since 2016 now and it has considerably improved over time, coming from “barely usable” to “let’s host my own homeserver”.
Even in its current state, lots of things are to be improved such as communities or custom stickers but everything is on the right way.
From now on, everything can <strong>only improve</strong>, we are seeing new server implementations, new clients, bots, communities moving to Matrix.</p>
<p>Matrix has several other features such as E2EE (end-to-end encryption) which is now enabled by default and bridges which can be used to temporarily bridge a Matrix room and a slack chat for instance.</p>
<p>If you want to give Matrix a try, download <a href="https://element.io/">Element</a> and create an account, it doesn’t even requires an email address!
You can also come and say ‘hello’ in my very own channel <strong>#home:jae.moe</strong> !</p>
<p>That’s all for today,
I’ll see you next time!

    <p>Hi Wendy,</p>

<p>I hope you’re having a great day. I came across your profile on Tinder and wanted to introduce myself. My name is Steve McDichael and I’m a Technical Recruiting Partner for Serf.com.</p>

<p>At this time, we have a great opportunity* for a Software Engineering role with the Digital Overseer team in our Provider Operations department. The team is developing a revolutionary new technology to improve our efficiency in extracting work from Providers on our platform, thereby increasing satisfaction for our Customers. It’s a small team, and an elite one (kind of like the Navy Seals of Serf.com), which means we’re only considering applicants who are passionate about our mission, and who have a track record of building tools to help the extremely powerful maintain their illegitimate hold on power. A B.S. in Computer Science is also a plus.</p>

<p>The team is filled with rockstars who have experience at world-class companies like WitchHunt, SlaveX, Genocidr and Palantir Technologies. Furthermore, the team reports directly to the CEO, who has an MBA from the Bowser School of Business at Tyrant University.</p>

<p>We’re still just a few months out of seed stage, but we’ve already secured several billion in funding from King Henry VI, Joffrey Baratheon, Darth Vader, and the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia. In the last six months, we’ve doubled our Customer count and have already saved them millions through AI-powered regulatory arbitrage as well as execution recommendations for Dissenting Providers. In the next six months, we are hoping to roll out our cutting-edge automated whipping prototype, which has been successful in trials and which will allow us to more quickly scale up to meet customer demand.</p>

<p>Our compensation packages are highly competitive, and we offer great benefits that go above and beyond other companies. We have fully-stocked microkitchens as well as daily breakfast, lunch and dinner, lovingly prepared and served by our in-house serfs; we have weekly <em>prima nocta</em> nights; we have frequent team bonding events including a live darts game featuring the most impertinent Providers. You can also bring your dog to the office.</p>

<p>I’m sure you’re busy, but if this sounds like an opportunity you’d be interested in, I would love to hop on the phone with you and give you a better sense of what we’re looking for. You can reach me at XXX-XXX-XXXX.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,
Steve McDichael</p>

<p><em>*This is a contract position for 3 months; a full-time employment offer is not guaranteed, as it depends on performance as well as culture fit.</em></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><time datetime="2020-11-14">14 Nov 2020</time></header><h2 id="i">I.</h2><p>In 1842, Morse pressed Congress into allowing him to demonstrate his telegraph by sending a message from one congressional conference room to another. As a result, he was given about a million dollars (inflation-adjusted):</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=005/llsl005.db&amp;recNum=655"><em>(March 3, 1843)</em></a> Be it enacted… That the sum of thirty thousand dollars be… appropriated… for testing the capacity and usefulness of the system of electro-magnetic telegraphs invented by Samuel F. B. Morse… The Secretary of the Treasury [is] authorized to pay… Morse, and the persons employed under him, such sums of money as he may deem to be a fair compensation…</p></blockquote><p>Today, this seems like an astonishingly implausible story — a single person pesters Congress for a massive sum of money, and <em>gets it</em>.</p><p>This was not Morse’s first demonstration to Congress, though. It took him five years to secure funding.</p><p>In 1837, the Secretary of the Treasury (Levi Woodbury) was instructed by the House to investigate the feasibility of constructing a system of telegraphs for the United States. At the time, “telegraph” generally meant “optical telegraph”; the relays in such a system were humans, who watched one signal and then passed it on. When Woodbury called for proposals, though, Morse replied with his electromagnetic telegraph. This was the beginning of his engagement with Congress.</p><p>In 1838 and 1839, both the House and the Senate considered bills to support the development of Morse’s magnetic telegraph. In the Senate, the issue was whether to allow duty-free importation of construction materials; the House considered a bill for testing the practicality of constructing such a system (presumably with an eye towards directly financing it). Morse demonstrated the system, in 1838, to Congress and the President. Nevertheless, neither bill was ever voted on.</p><p>In 1842, Morse convinced Congress to allow him to demonstrate again. I can’t find any claim that Morse’s second demonstration was noticeably more impressive, but in 1843, Congress finally passed an appropriate for Morse and his colleagues.</p><p>Morse reported in 1844 that the line from the District to Baltimore was complete. Side note: “What hath God wrought” was not, in fact, Morse’s first transmission. The first public transmission, according to wikipedia, was “A patient waiter is no loser”. The famous “What hath God wrought” was the opening line for the D.C.-Baltimore line.</p><p>The Congressional Journal over the next decade is filled with references to petitions and bills for funding expansion of the telegraph system across the country. Congress wasn’t just pleased with the telegraph, though. Morse’s demonstration — and the fact that he delivered on his promises — had made him personally popular. In 1845, the House Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds was instructed to ask Morse</p><blockquote><p>if, in his opinion, he can invent or adopt a more expeditious plan of taking the yeas and nays in this hall…</p></blockquote><p>He seems to have declined, as the House didn’t vote electronically <a href="https://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Electronic-Technology/House-Technology/">until 1973</a>.</p><p>In 1845, Congress approved an expansion of the telegraph system to New York, and began referring to “Professor Morse” instead of “Samuel F. B. Morse”. In the subsequent years, telegraph lines were often built alongside railroads, funded by Congress in the same bill. By 1870 the magnetic telegraph reached California.</p><p>An astonishing journey, beginning with the audacity of an ordinary man to write to Congress for money.</p><h2 id="ii">II.</h2><p>Or not. To start with, Morse was no ordinary man. He was a consumate self-promoter, intensely concerned with his own reputation, and quite politically active.</p><p>Wikipedia discusses his political activites <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse">at some length</a>. He published a political tract (explaining how the Catholics were conspiring to take over the country) in 1835. He ran for mayor of New York (to fight the “deep Catholic state”, I assume) in 1836. Note the timeline: neither a prelude nor an afterthought, these activites were essentially contemporary with his creation of the telegraph.</p><p>After the telegraph was well established, in the 1850s, Morse turned his attention to the question of slavery, comparing it favorably to employment, parenting, and government.</p><p>In 1871, H.R. 285 was passed, allowing a statue of Morse to be erected on government land. Morse died in 1872, and a memorial service was held in Congress. I’m assuming this service primarily focused on the telegraph, rather than his paintings (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Morse#/media/File:Samuel_Finley_Breeze_Morse_001.jpg">not bad</a>, actually) or his support for slavey (none too popular with Congress during reconstruction, I guess).</p><h2 id="iii">III.</h2><p>Henry Hall Sherwood was a physician in New York. In the 1830s, the electromagnetic nature of the nervous system was still a relatively new discovery, and Sherwood seems to have gotten a bit over-excited. His <a href="https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/?f%5Bdrep2.authorAggregate%5D%5B%5D=Sherwood%2C+H.+H.+%28Henry+Hall%29">books</a> include case studies; for the most part, he seems to have waved magnets near his patients. He claims this cured them of various ailments. I’d laugh, but there’s an accupuncture clinic a couple blocks from my office. I’m afraid to find out whether this was classified an “essential service” during the lockdown.</p><p>Electromagnetism (or as it was often known then, “magnetism” — even when referring to phenomena we would call electric) was all the rage. A major challenge of the age was to understand the structure of the magnetic field of the Earth, although that’s slightly modern terminology — it was often referred to as “the variation of the compass”. This would be helpful, among other things, for navigation at sea: you can easily imagine that a precise model might allow the measurement of longitude. Sherwood, being an expert on the magnetic nature of the nervous system, decided to lend a hand to this closely related problem. Overall, this went about as well as you’d expect.</p><p>Like his better-known contemporary, Sherwood was bold enough to make requests directly of Congress. He petitioned the House, claiming to have invented an instrument (the <em>geometer</em>) for navigation purely from magnetic observations, and</p><blockquote><p>praying the aid of the Government of the United States in the publication of a work to explain the discoveries…</p></blockquote><p>among other things. It was proposed that he give the House a demonstration of his techniques, in June of 1838. This was voted down, and the matter dropped entirely.</p><p>That same month, Sherwood also petitioned the Senate; his petition was presented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_P._Tallmadge">Nathaniel Tallmadge</a> of New York. Like the House, on June 21st, the Senate considered and declined the possiblity of a demonstration. Sherwood’s petition was referred to the Committee on Naval Affairs, which submitted a report, presented again by Tallmadge, to the Senate on July 3rd.</p><p>Here it gets interesting. That report caused something of a stir in the scientific community. No less than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Henry">Joseph Henry</a>, soon to become the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, published a denunciation of the report. You can read his article <a href="https://siarchives.si.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/JHPVol/JHPP_V4_P75-79_Transcript.pdf">here</a>, which was written in protest</p><blockquote><p>against the plan of discussing such subjects in Congress before proper means have been taken to determine their true character.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, against Congressional meddling and speculation. Most of Henry’s complaint is taken up by a somewhat detailed critique (occasionally, mockery) of Sherwood’s theories. The above quote somewhat masks Henry’s true opinion. A few paragraphs later he writes:</p><blockquote><p>we do not believe that there is a person of any scientific reputation in our country, who has paid attention to this subject, who will not immediately say that the whole affair is perfectly peurile…</p></blockquote><p>Despite his earlier words, I don’t get the impression the Henry would object to Congressional support for a speculative endeavor: just not an entirely futile endeavor. After Henry’s rebuttal was published, the Senate seems to have forgotten about Sherwood’s petition for a while.</p><p>Sherwood again requested financial aid from Congress in mid-February, 1839. Another report was delivered by Tallmadge from his committee, but I can find no details on what it said. It must not have been positive: the last reference to H. H. Sherwood in the papers of Congress is on March 2, 1839, when the Committee on Naval Affairs was given permission, by the Senate, to drop the matter.</p><h2 id="iv">IV.</h2><p>It is sometimes argued that Congress’s support of Morse’s telegraph was not the really the first case in which the new government funded science: for a sufficiently broad definition of “science”, that honor belongs to the Lewis and Clark expedition nearly 40 years prior. But just as Morse’s was not the first time the government <em>considered</em> funding science, the 1803 expedition was not the first time the U.S. government <em>considered</em> funding an expedition.</p><p>John Churchman was <a href="https://bostonraremaps.com/inventory/john-churchman-magnetic-atlas/">a surveyor and mapmaker</a>, who in the 1780s became preoccupied with the task of measuring the longitude of a ship at sea via magnetic observations (much like Sherwood!). Churchman, however, was not a complete crank. Like Morse, he was no stranger to make requests of governments, having (for instance) <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-11-02-0378">written</a> to Thomas Jefferson in 1787 to request that a paper of his be presented to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris. (That puts things in perspective. There’s no excuse for not sending cold emails!)</p><p>In 1791, Churchman made a request of Congress: “praying the patronage of Government to enable him to undertake a voyage” to investigate the magnetic fields near the geomagnetic north pole. Of course, his <em>motivation</em> for this voyage was to confirm a theory of the behavior of magnetic field lines which is now known to be incorrect. In brief, the behavior of magnetic field lines is not as predictable as he assumed, and therefore not as useful for navigation beyond distinguishing north from south.</p><p>Nevertheless, exploratory voyages based on incorrect assumptions were commonplace and often productive, and Congress considered the matter serious — more seriously, in fact, than the Sherwood business. The House held <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&amp;fileName=003/llac003.db&amp;recNum=153">a lengthy discussion</a> on 6 Jan 1792 to consider the petition.</p><p>The representatives (at least those who participate in the debate) come across as reasonably knowledgable about the subject.

    </p>
    <p>Most of my work over the past 10 years has involved writing what is often called a <em>wizard</em>.</p>
<p>A wizard is essentially a multi-step process that guides a user through a particular workflow. For example, if you are installing a new application on your computer, the wizard might guide you through the following process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Enter your license registration details</li>
<li>Agree to the software author’s legal terms</li>
<li>Specify an installation location</li>
</ol>
<p>Most web applications provide something similar. If a user needs to input a large amount of data for the application to then run a bunch of calculations, you could of course just provide the user with one big web form. At a certain size though, a single web form can be intimidating and provide a less than ideal user experience. The canonical way to improve the user experience here is to break up the web form into several separate pages. This is another example of a wizard.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://jezenthomas.com/static/img/wizard-diagram.jpg" alt="Forms are easier to digest when they’re split into separate steps"><figcaption>Forms are easier to digest when they’re split into separate steps</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I’ve tried writing wizards in a number of different web technologies, and so far Elm has proven itself as by far the most robust and painless, <em>especially</em> when it inevitably comes to changing some conditional logic to meet the mutable needs of various business processes.</p>
<p>For any small Elm application, project structure is easy. There is no reason why a 1,000 line Elm application can’t live in a single file. In fact this is really how every Elm application ought to begin its life. Start with a single file with the usual boilerplate and the following contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single sum type to model all of the messages your application supports</li>
<li>A single model which contains all the application state</li>
<li>A single update function for advancing the application state</li>
<li>A single view function for rendering the application state on the page</li>
</ul>
<p>If your web form is complex enough to warrant being broken into separate pages however, then your application is naturally not going to consist of a small number of lines of code. A common concern among less experienced Elm programmers is that one big sum type for all of your messages becomes unwieldy to maintain. The same is said of having one big shallow record for all of the application state, or one big <code>update</code> function to match all the constructors of the one big <code>Msg</code> type. This is where unnecessary complexity starts to balloon as programmers add <em>clever</em> abstractions and misdirections, usually involving both <code>Html.map</code> and <code>Cmd.map</code>, separate <code>update</code> functions for each logical subsection of your application (usually with noticeably awkward type signatures), and some vague hand-waving in the direction of <em>encapsulation</em> and so-called <em>Clean Code</em>.</p>
<p>I’d argue that this kind of misdirection is almost <em>never</em> what you want. I’d argue further that this applies <em>especially</em> to you if your background is in maintaining complex React/Angular applications, where invented complexity is the status quo and this kind of misdirection is simply what you have become desensitised to.</p>
<p>So if the combination of <code>Html.map</code> and <code>Cmd.map</code> are to be avoided, how can we scale an Elm application without sacrificing developer ergonomics? In short, the tricks to employ are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nested sum types</li>
<li>Nested record types</li>
<li>Nested update functions</li>
<li>Small, composable view functions</li>
<li>Function composition</li>
<li>Lenses</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at a more concrete application of these ideas. As an example, we can model the process of a person applying for a bank loan.</p>
<p>The bank will want to ask the applicant a whole bunch of questions, which we could group into three categories:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Personal information</li>
<li>Details on the purpose of the loan</li>
<li>Financial information and creditworthiness</li>
</ol>
<p>This would suggest a three-step wizard or a three-page web form. A reasonable place to begin splitting our application apart into three smaller pieces is in our <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-msg-type">The Big Msg Type</h2>
<p>The naïve way to model the messages our application should support is with one big sum type, which might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>type Page
  = PersonalInformationPage
  | LoanPurposePage
  | FinancialDetailsPage

type Msg
  -- System-wide messages
  = NoOp
  | SetPage Page
  -- etc…

  -- Personal information
  | SetFirstName String
  | SetLastName String
  | SetAddressLine1 String
  -- …more messages for the personal information page

  -- Purpose of the loan
  | SetPurchaseItemCategory
  | SetPurchaseItemEstimatedValue
  -- …more messages for the loan purpose page

  -- Financial information
  | SetMonthlyIncomeBeforeTax
  | SetMonthlyRentPayment
  -- …more messages about the applicant's financial details</code></pre>
<p>This <em>does</em> work, but at some point it becomes cumbersome to support a large number of constructors. The value for “large” is of course determined by the individual programmer’s personal taste and/or pain threshold. To ease this pain, people typically <em>extract</em> groups of messages into their own separate sum types, which subsequently forces them to write update functions that return a type <em>other</em> than the top-level <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<p><em>Don’t do that!</em></p>
<p>The way to break these groups of constructors out is by first nesting them inside the <code>Msg</code> type, like this:</p>
<pre><code>type PersonalInformationMsg
  = SetFirstName String
  | SetLastName String
  | SetAddressLine1 String
  -- etc..

type LoanPurposeMsg -- etc…

type FinancialDetailsMsg -- etc…

type Msg
  = NoOp
  | SetPage Page
  | PersonalInformationMsg PersonalInformationMsg
  | LoanPurposeMsg LoanPurposeMsg
  | FinancialDetailsMsg FinancialDetailsMsg</code></pre>
<p>The new message types can live in the same file as the top-level <code>Msg</code> type. They can also be extracted to different files. That’s your choice.</p>
<p>The next thing to tackle is our <code>update</code> function, since it needs to mirror our <code>Msg</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="nested-update-functions">Nested Update Functions</h2>
<p>I’ve seen people advocate for page-specific <code>update</code> functions which take a page-specific model and return a tuple of that page-specific model and a page-specific <code>Cmd Msg</code> equivalent. This is typically where you see <code>Cmd.map</code> sneaking in. These functions almost inevitably end up needing <em>something</em> from the top-level application-wide state, so you’ll often see some type signature like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation
   : PersonalInformationMsg
  -&gt; Model
  -&gt; (PersonalInformationModel, Cmd PersonalInformationMsg)
  -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)</code></pre>
<p>This is <em>way</em> too complex already, and this approach doesn’t even actually buy you anything.</p>
<p>The far simpler way to do this is to have every nested <code>update</code> function take a page-specific message, the <em>entire</em> application state, and return the same type for that state along with the top-level <code>Msg</code> type, like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation : PersonalInformationMsg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
updatePersonalInformation msg model = case msg of
  SetFirstName a    -&gt; -- …
  SetLastName a     -&gt; -- …
  SetAddressLine1 a -&gt; -- …
  -- etc…

update : Msg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
update msg model = case msg of
  NoOp -&gt; (model, Cmd.none)
  SetPage page -&gt; ({ model | page = page }, Cmd.none)
  PersonalInformationMsg subMsg -&gt; updatePersonalInformation subMsg model
  LoanPurposeMsg subMsg -&gt; updateLoanPurpose subMsg model
  FinancialDetailsMsg subMsg -&gt; updateFinancialDetails subMsg model</code></pre>
<p>No complicated type signatures. No juggling of message types. No <code>Cmd.map</code>. Easy.</p>
<p>Of course the whole point of our <code>update</code> function is to advance the state of our model, and the structure of that model is also something that can swell and become unwieldy, so that’s what we will dissect next.</p>
<h2 id="record-surgery">Record Surgery</h2>
<p>Near the inception of the project, all of our individual bits of state might exist at the top level of our <code>Model</code>, which is typically represented as a record. Perhaps something like this:</p>
<pre><code>type alias Model =
  { page : Page
  , firstName : String
  , lastName : String
  , addressLine1 : String
  -- …more personal information fields

  , purchaseItemCategory : ItemCategory
  , purchaseItemEstimatedValue : Money
  -- …more loan purpose fields…

  -- …and also financial details, and system-wide state, etc…
  }</code></pre>
<p>Like the parts of our project we’ve addressed previously, this also can turn into a bit of a mess as it grows. Both application-wide data and page-specific data are mixed in together which feels a bit haphazard. Fortunately, grouping and extracting these fields is typically rather intuitive. We can start by grouping page-specific parts of the state together, and then group further until it no longer <em>feels</em> messy.</p>
<pre><code>type alias Address =
  { line1 : String
  , line2 : String
  , city : String
  , postcode : String
  -- …
  }

type alias PersonalInformation =
  { firstName : String
  , lastName : String
  , address : Address
  -- …
  }

type alias LoanPurpose =
  { purchaseItemCategory : ItemCategory
  , purchaseItemEstimatedValue : Money
  -- …
  }

type alias FinancialDetails = -- …

type alias Model =
  { page : Page
  , personalInformation : PersonalInformation
  , loanPurpose : LoanPurpose
  , financialDetails : FinancialDetails
  }</code></pre>
<p>The problem now however is that when we wish to update a deeply-nested field, we need to write all of the code to unwrap each level until we arrive at the depth we need. Illustrated another way, let’s say we want to update the first line of the applicant’s address.</p>
<p>Retrieving the value of this field is no problem, as we can use Elm’s dot syntax to succinctly get us all the way there, like this:</p>
<pre><code>model.personalInformation.address.line1</code></pre>
<p>What we <em>can’t</em> do here however is <em>update</em> that field in a similar fashion, <em>i.e.</em>, Elm won’t allow us to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>-- This won't work
{ model.personalInformation.address | line1 = newLine1 }

-- This also won't work
{ model | personalInformation.address.line1 = newLine1 }</code></pre>
<p>The naïve way to unwrap and subsequently update the field in this record is to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>updatePersonalInformation : PersonalInformationMsg -&gt; Model -&gt; (Model, Cmd Msg)
updatePersonalInformation msg model = case msg of
  SetFirstName _ -&gt; -- …

  SetLastName _ -&gt; -- …

  SetAddressLine1 newLine1 -&gt;
    let
        …</code></pre></article></div></div>

<p>Governments are back on their anti-encryption bullshit again.</p>



<p>Between the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/">U.S. Senate’s “EARN IT” Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">E.U.’s slew of anti-encryption proposals</a>, and <a href="https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/">Australia’s new anti-encryption law</a>, it’s become clear that the authoritarians in office view online privacy as a threat to their existence.</p>



<p>Normally, when the governments increase their anti-privacy sabre-rattling, technologists start talking more loudly about Tor, Signal, and other privacy technologies (usually only to be drowned out by paranoid people who think Tor and Signal are government backdoors or something stupid; conspiracy theories ruin everything!).</p>



<p><strong>I’m not going to do that.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, I’m going to show you how to add end-to-end encryption to any communication software you’re developing. (Hopefully, I’ll avoid making <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/">any bizarre design decisions</a> along the way.)</p>



<p>But first, some important disclaimers:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Yes, you should absolutely do this.</strong> I don’t care how banal your thing is; if you expect people to use it to communicate with each other, you should make it so that you can never decrypt their communications.</li><li>You should absolutely NOT bill the thing you’re developing as an <em>alternative</em> to Signal or WhatsApp.</li><li>The goal of doing this is to increase the amount of end-to-end encryption deployed on the Internet that the service operator cannot decrypt (even if compelled by court order) and make E2EE normalized. The goal is NOT to compete with highly specialized and peer-reviewed privacy technology.</li><li>I am not a lawyer, I’m some furry who works in cryptography. The contents of this blog post is not legal advice, nor is it endorsed by any company or organization. Ask the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> for legal questions.</li></ol>



<p>The organization of this blog post is as follows: First, I’ll explain <a href="#symmetric-key-encryption">how to encrypt and decrypt data between users</a>, assuming you have a key. Next, I’ll explain <a href="#key-agreement">how to build an authenticated key exchange</a> and <a href="#session-key-management">a ratcheting protocol to determine the keys used in the first step</a>. Afterwards, I’ll explore <a href="#identity-key-management">techniques for binding authentication keys to identities and managing trust</a>. Finally, I’ll discuss <a href="#backdoor-resistance">strategies for making it impractical to ever backdoor your software (and impossible to silently backdoor it)</a>, just to piss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the creeps and tyrants of the world</a> off even more.</p>



<p>You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing.</p>







<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>



<h3 id="choosing-a-cryptography-library">Choosing a Cryptography Library</h3>



<p>In the examples contained on this page, I will be using the <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">Sodium cryptography library</a>. Specifically, my example code will be written with the <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus">Sodium-Plus</a> library for JavaScript, since it strikes a good balance between performance and being cross-platform.</p>


<pre title="">const { SodiumPlus } = require('sodium-plus');

(async function() {
     // Select a backend automatically
     const sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();
     
     // Do other stuff here
})();
</pre>


<p>Libsodium is <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html">generally the correct choice for developing cryptography features in software</a>, and is available in most programming languages,</p>



<p>If you’re prone to choose a different library, you should consult your cryptographer (and yes, you should have one on your payroll if you’re doing things different) about your design choices.</p>



<h3>Threat Modelling</h3>



<p>Remember above when I said, “You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing”?</p>



<p>How far you go in implementing the steps outlined on this blog post should be informed by <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">a threat model</a>, not an ad hoc judgment.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re encrypting user data and storing it in the cloud, you probably want to pass <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/">the Mud Puddle Test</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.<br>2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but<em>&nbsp;won’t for the life of you&nbsp;</em>be able to&nbsp;recall your device passwords or keys.<br>3. Now try to get your cloud data back.</p><p>Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way around your provider’s internal policy checks.</p></div><cite>Matthew Green describes the Mud Puddle Test, which Apple products <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">definitely don’t pass</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you must fail the Mud Puddle Test for your users, make sure you’re clear and transparent about this in the documentation for your product or service.</p>







<h2 id="symmetric-key-encryption">I. Symmetric-Key Encryption</h2>



<p>The easiest piece of this puzzle is to encrypt data in transit between both ends (thus, satisfying the loosest definition of end-to-end encryption).</p>



<p>At this layer, you already have some kind of symmetric key to use for encrypting data before you send it, and for decrypting it as you receive it.</p>



<p>For example, the following code will encrypt/decrypt strings and return hexadecimal strings with a version prefix.</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v1";

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Under-the-hood, this is using <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-xchacha20poly1305">XChaCha20-Poly1305</a>, which is less sensitive to timing leaks than AES-GCM. However, like AES-GCM, this encryption mode doesn’t provide <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">message- or key-commitment</a>.</p>



<p>If you want key commitment, you should derive two keys from <code>$key</code> using a KDF based on hash functions: One for actual encryption, and the other <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153">as a key commitment value</a>.</p>



<p>If you want message commitment, you can use AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 or XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b-MAC.</p>



<p>If you want both, ask <a href="https://mumble.net/~campbell/">Taylor Campbell</a> about his BLAKE3-based design.</p>



<p>A modified version of the above code with key-commitment might look like this:</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v2";

/**
 * Derive an encryption key and a commitment hash.
 * @param {CryptographyKey} key
 * @param {Uint8Array} nonce
 * @returns {{encKey: CryptographyKey, commitment: Uint8Array}}
 */
async function deriveKeys(key, nonce) {
    const encKey = new CryptographyKey(await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x01].append(nonce)),
        key
    ));
    const commitment = await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x02].append(nonce)),
        key
    );
    return {encKey, commitment};
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(commitment) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(114));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const storedCommitment = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50, 114));
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);
    if (!(await sodium.sodium_memcmp(storedCommitment, commitment))) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect commitment value");
    }
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Another design choice you might make is to encode ciphertext with base64 instead of hexadecimal. That doesn’t significantly alter the design here, but it does mean your decoding logic has to accommodate this.</p>



<p>You SHOULD version your ciphertexts, and include this in the AAD provided to your AEAD encryption mode. I used “v1” and “v2” as a version string above, but you can use your software name for that too.</p>

<p>Shocking news! In an incredible breakthrough for American mass-transit engineering, the transportation technology company Virgin Hyperloop this past weekend successfully moved two people 500 meters across the barren Las Vegas desert at a top speed of just over 100 mph, setting a new world record for the absolute most pitiful thing anyone not named “Elon Musk” has ever tried to pass off as “high-speed rail.”</p>



<p>Here’s video of the shameful display:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Watch people travel in Virgin Hyperloop for the first time" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZruVz3Ccjk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Virgin Hyperloop, an American company despite the Richard Branson branding, proposes to use a combination of magnetic levitation, or “maglev”—a decades-old technology that has been in commercial operation moving real trains filled with real people in, for example, Shanghai, China, at speeds up to 268 miles per hour, for <em>17 goddamn years</em>—and “vactrain,” a concept design for an enclosed, artificially evacuated tunnel where air resistance may be as low as in the upper parts of Earth’s atmosphere, theoretically allowing for much higher top speeds at much lower levels of energy consumption. It is so goddamn embarrassing to type this. France’s electric TGV system has been in regular commercial operation for nearly 40 years; in April of 2007 one of its trains hit 357 miles per hour in a test.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/08/tech/virgin-hyperloop-passengers/index.html">CNN’s article about this event</a> paraphrases a Virgin Hyperloop executive claiming that the hyperloop pods “can travel at the speed of aircraft.” Which is true, in the sense that commercial aircraft with dozens if not hundreds of people aboard do sometimes travel at 100 miles per hour, on the ground, for seconds at a time, during takeoff or landing, when they are going only a fraction as fast as they’re capable of going. It is also true in the sense that, strictly speaking, a paper airplane is a form of “aircraft,” and you can really whip some of those suckers across a room. A more accurate but perhaps less flattering claim would be that my Honda Odyssey can travel at the fastest speed Virgin Hyperloop has yet attained, and with <em>four times as many people riding in it</em>.</p>



<p>Hell, for that matter, as <a href="https://twitter.com/leftistthot420/status/1326561247333134336">a Twitter user</a> helpfully pointed out, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNER_Class_A4_4468_Mallard">a freaking <em>steam locomotive</em> hit 126 miles per hour</a> in England, 82 years ago, in 1938.</p>



<p><em>Yeah, but, when it’s done, it’ll go 600 miles per hour</em>, you’re whining, <em>and it’ll have 25 to 30 people in a pod!</em> When exactly will that be? France opened the TGV in 1981. Japan’s oldest high-speed line debuted in 1964—<em>1964!</em>—and was better and faster then than Amtrak’s Acela trains go now. Shanghai’s maglev train has been operable since John Kerry was campaigning to unseat George W. Bush as president. Measure speed by the number of riders the respective services will have moved by, say, 2050. Measure it in carbon emissions. By the year 2020, the best-funded and most sophisticated high-speed rail developer in the United States moved two (2) people 500 meters.</p>



<p>The United States is generations behind much of the rest of the wealthy, industrialized world in this area. For all but a very narrow corridor along the East Coast serviced by the weak half-a-loaf shit that passes for high-speed rail in this country, the best an American commuter can hope for in intercity rail options are crappy and ancient diesel Amtrak trains that top out at around 80 miles per hour. Most American cities simply are not serviced by any intercity rail network at all. The U.S.’s shameful mass-transit situation—and thus its shameful dependence on personal vehicles, and all the downstream bad shit that comes from that—could be improved a zillion percent by just aiming for the level of railroad sophistication French people considered normal before the median 2020 French person was old enough to ride a bicycle. And here are these Professor Frink–ass Hyperloop dinguses, dumping resources beyond counting into inventing some shit that already exists when for a fraction of the cost and in a fraction of the time they could just <em>purchase</em> or at the very least <em>copy</em> what is already working just fine even in backward-ass doofus countries like freaking Italy. It wouldn’t need test tracks! It wouldn’t need years of iteration and development! They already did all that shit, all over the rest of the world! </p>



<p>In a vacuum (a figurative one: an alternate universe in which the rest of the post-industrial world were not absolutely goddamn <em>bursting</em> with operating networks of authentic high-speed rail; where high-speed rail were not already such a well-developed form of transit that the TGV system, which routinely moves huge numbers of day-to-day commuters across large distances of France at speeds well more than twice that achieved by this sad two-person billion-dollar pod going from nowhere to nowhere across a tiny patch of worthless desert, were not both infinitely better and more sophisticated than any presently available commercial rail in the United States <em>and</em> fairly outmoded in comparison to newer [yet still not all that new!] systems in China and Japan and elsewhere) the Virgin Hyperloop could almost look like an impressive accomplishment. Alas, here in the world of context, its only real accomplishment is a promotional one. The business of the American technology sector and its attendant courtier press is to continually recreate and exploit something like a vacuum in the public’s awareness of what the larger world is like, so that clueless observers will congratulate a bunch of boobs for “inventing” a shittier, more expensive version of something that is already regarded as boring and normal—fast, energy-efficient rail service!—pretty much everywhere outside of this stupid and embarrassing country.</p>



<p>Everything about the broken incentives and hollowed-out capacities of American society is crystallized in this dumb pod moseying its way along a track to nowhere in Las Vegas. The United States has a problem: It is too dependent on inefficient, dirty, and expensive forms of transportation, because the vast majority of its people have no practical access to other kinds. Its infrastructure and the health of its communities are all jacked up by the necessity of splattering asphalt all over everything in order for people to drive their big dumb cars to, and park them near, anywhere they’d decide to go. It cannot achieve efficient levels of density or make meaningful turns toward environmental responsibility for as long as this is the case. Thankfully, a solution to this problem already exists and is in operation throughout other parts of the world with comparable levels of wealth and technological capacity: Trains! Networks of fast-moving trains that do not need internal combustion engines in order to move lots of people very quickly along their tracks! Companies and agencies make and install and operate these train systems, and have been doing so for a long time, longer even than the lifetime of the graybeard crap-bag writing this blog. They know how to do it! They can probably just be hired to do it. At some level somebody can probably just buy some of those trains, and install them, and turn them on, and take people from here to there on them.</p>



<p>But who could make it happen? Broke-dick, systematically impoverished municipalities, lashed to budget-balancing like a cinderblock tied to their feet? Close your eyes and try to imagine how a sane and obviously good decision like <em>Just import the TGV and run it between the big American cities instead of spending years and fortunes inventing maglev from scratch for no reason</em> could get made in these United States. Imagine who’d make it, and what their goals would be, and where the money would come from. It simply can’t get made on those terms. It can’t get made at all. No level of American society even has a mechanism for that anymore. If it doesn’t require a messianic assbrain with a Steve Jobs cosplay fantasy pitching some sleepy billionaire or venture capital firm on the possibility of cornering the market on a brand-new technology that will conquer the world, then it will not get done. If it merely delivers a profound benefit to the common good rather than the promise of extravagant enrichment to a shrinking class of hyper-powered parasites, then it simply cannot exist.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>Today, we are going to take a look at <em>Application Performance Management 101</em>, its terminology, and its concepts. APM is incredibly essential for systems today, but many organizations still aren’t using it to its fullest effect.</p>
<p>Organizations need APM to remain in control of their network and infrastructure. However, they may not be able to effectively set up APM if they underestimate its importance and magnitude of their effect. Because of this, everyone needs an in-depth understanding of APM, why it matters in application development, and what are some of the best ways to manage and monitor it. </p>
<h2>What is APM?</h2>
<div><p>Let’s take a closer look at <a href="https://lightstep.com/apm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">APM</a>. Application Performance Management is a method that organizations use to track the performance of their applications <em>discreetly</em>, identifying those that malfunction or misbehave - forwarding bad requests, being slow on request-response, and so on. Every issue within an application should be exposed through application performance management, such as suspicious amounts of traffic going in and out, memory leaks or resource overload.</p><p>APM is something that <em>every</em> system needs today.</p><p>In the past, APM wasn’t that important, because each application could be managed on its own. A systems administrator might notice that a single application was being sluggish and would pull it and reboot it. But today, applications come in hundreds or thousands within a single system. Distributed computing, <strong><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/what-are-microservices">microservices architecture</a></strong>, virtualization, and containerization have all made applications work on multiple levels of a network organization. And each of these networks has independent maintenance and monitoring.<br>APM consolidates all of this into a singular system that makes it possible to identify issues with practically any application. It also means that the system must be working well as a standalone entity, be consistent and coherent, and track all applications through distributed tracing processes. This requirement can present a challenge, especially for organizations that are setting up their APM or tracing after the fact.</p></div>
<h2>Key features of APM</h2>
<p>There are many APM solutions out there. Some of them are relatively light and stripped down, while others are robust. A small organization could benefit from a lightweight APM solution, while a large enterprise needs a heavyweight APM solution with an extensive set of complementary features. Regardless of what a custom project might require specifically, APM key feature usually doesn’t change.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance of web requests</strong>. Most solutions today are cloud-based and web-based. APM will track the performance of web requests to determine whether some of them are lagging or whether the performance could otherwise improve. Every transaction is traced so that the organization can readily address pressing issues.</li>
<li><strong>Code-level performance profiling</strong>. APM can identify which methods within the code-level of an application could be slowing down a system. Applications today are growing more complex in and out of themselves, and therefore this type of maintenance becomes exceptionally important.</li>
<li><strong>Application dependencies</strong>. It may not be the application that is working incorrectly but one of its dependencies. As an example, the system might be tracking whether the application’s SQL queries are running slowly.</li>
<li><strong>Server monitoring metrics</strong>. Many people are familiar with the task manager; APM solutions will determine how the application is running in terms of CPU usage, memory usage, and more. This is very basic but can provide fast key insights.</li>
<li><strong>Log data</strong>. APM will take and manage a significant amount of log data, which can then be searched through, monitored, or analyzed. Some APM solutions will even export log data so other systems can analyze it.</li>
<li><strong>Errors management</strong>. One of the most essential systems, APM will also identify errors. A robust system will prioritize these errors so that it becomes clearer which errors must be addressed and when.</li>
<li><strong>User monitoring</strong>. In addition to the applications themselves, APM solutions will also identify what users are doing and how they interact with applications. APM solutions should always be geared toward the user; making sure the applications deliver what they need to deliver to the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like other advanced systems, APM solutions can usually be extended. When they are extended, they are integrated with other solutions, or given add-ons to their existing solutions. But APM solutions as a whole are always going to include the above feature sets.</p>
<h2>APM terminology</h2>
<p>APM terminology had grown significantly since 2013 when an APM boom was encountered. Before <strong><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/tech-expertise/cloud-solutions">cloud services</a></strong>, microservices, and other architecture changes, APM really wasn’t as necessary as it is today. But as the industry grows, it also becomes more complex. And as it becomes more complex, there become specific terms that need to be used.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distributed tracing</strong>. This is a method by which tracing is performed end-to-end throughout applications, to ensure that the requests can be traced back to any issue that occurred. Distributed tracing is an incredibly important factor in APM but it shouldn’t be confused with APM itself, just as observability should not be confused with monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Tracing</strong>. Tracing is what tracks requests throughout a system. It’s important because without it - a request can enter into a system incorrectly. The fault may occur within an application, but a previous interaction could have passed on flawed data. Without tracing, you could determine where the fault is, but not where it originated, and a single microservice could be sending faulty requests throughout the whole system.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>. Monitoring identifies issues as they occur and reports them back. Tracing, management, analytics, and more, is what provides the data. But the monitoring system alerts the organization when issues have occurred, and it’s one of the most important aspects of any APM solution. Without robust enough monitoring, the system may identify faults, but most would remain unaddressed.</li>
<li><strong>Tags</strong>. Tags make it easier to trace things throughout the system by attaching important, and sometimes critical, information. Tags within an APM system make it far easier to track important issues.</li>
<li><strong>Filters</strong>. Filtering and searching through APM logs makes it easier to reach critical information. APM logs provide analytical data, such as performance issues that could remain hidden because they are not yet critical.</li>
<li><strong>Services</strong>. Services are the core building blocks of a system, which make it possible to build an application. Services are incredibly important today because of microservices, which are often used throughout application architecture, and which need to be traceable in and of themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong>. Resources can refer to the domains within a customer application, including background jobs, database queries, web endpoints, and other accessible and discrete units. Resources are used by applications and may have their own errors or performance issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding the above terms can make the process of understanding APM much easier. But APM is a discipline in itself, and organizations that are interested in improving their capacity for robust APM should consider getting the help of a managed partner.</p>
<h2>APM concepts</h2>
<p>What are the core APM concepts? What is it that makes APM so important? In general, the core APM concepts are: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observability</strong>. It is important that <em>everyone</em> knows where things have gone wrong within a system. In addition to knowing where systems have gone wrong, it’s important to know the general status of the system as well.</li>
<li><strong>Continuity</strong>. End-to-end tracing is incredibly important because otherwise, it’s not always clear where an error occurred. Greater levels of continuity are growing in importance, along with systems becoming larger and more complex.</li>
<li><strong>Prioritization</strong>. It’s important that an organization be able to prioritize its systems. High-level errors need to follow different channels than lower-level errors, or IT will have a hard time addressing them properly.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong>. As more applications are added, it’s vital that the system be able to adjust without any issues. Otherwise, the system is going to need to be modified every time new applications are introduced, which can be quite frequently.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, APM is all about ensuring that the organization maintains control over its application performance monitoring. If it is not able to do so, the system itself becomes fragile and prone to malfunction.</p>
<h2>APM best practices</h2>
<p>What are some of the best APM practices? It all has to do, of course, with the systems and suites. There are many APM technologies today, and they’re continually growing. But when it comes to the best methods with APM, there are several things everyone should agree on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency and standardization</strong>. Application names, tracing, reporting, and more, should all be standardized so that it’s easier to trace them back.</li>
<li><strong>Unique identifiers</strong>. All events that are handled through applications should have unique identifiers no matter where they are within the system so that they can be traced back. </li>
<li><strong>Prioritization</strong>. As mentioned above, prioritization is a key concept. Different applications should be prioritized based on how essential they are to the system.</li>
<li><strong>Logging</strong>. Robust logs are key to APM and distributed tracing, and ideally, they should be ready for search, analysis, and customization</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above best practices, organizations can get started with their application performance monitoring. But the more complex the network, the more complicated their APM too. It’s important for organizations to always keep an eye on structural improvements and try out the newest APM technologies as they emerge. Now that containerization, docker services, and microservices architecture are here to stay, it will become increasingly more difficult to track errors across an entire system.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <h2>Information and its abundance</h2>
<p>There has been a strange world in the post generations of iPhone. Some updates didn’t change a thing from the user perspective.</p>
<p>Both in hardware, software and design. The updates that basically either forced you to buy a new phone or updates that were talked about as revolutionary didn’t do anything.</p>
<p>That is a crazy thing to think about. We live in a world of constant information overdrive. There is just too much information for us to waste our time looking and investing in something sub-par.</p>
<p>There has been a concept that the most successful writers and content creator have been using to get the best reach and get the biggest impact from their content.</p>
<p>It was to make the best content that is different from the mass. Make it so that people are eager to get more content from you with your personal style embedded.</p>
<h2>Apple disappointing</h2>
<p>Apple has been putting out content in each of their conferences that didn’t really move anyone it seems.</p>
<p>Yes, it is something new, but it is not something completely new like the iPad or iPhone or iPod was. There is nothing revolutionary coming any more.</p>
<p><img alt="iPhone one 1" src="https://i.gyazo.com/af09e6e1c58052507af91c5dcedaebbc.jpg"></p>
<p>There can be 3 reasons for this in my opinion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most of the upgrades these days is switching old, manual algorithm that hard-coded behaviour and responses are being switched to faster and more advanced and flexible machine learning and neural networks algorithms. So, the most significant change for the iPhone is happening under the hood, which is not really seen until Apple can do some really crazy stuff after everything is integrated.</li>
<li>The death of Steve Jobs has been too big of a blow on the creative and time side. He propelled people into new gadgets and forced deadlines. He was the most passionate person in making money and creating something so huge and amazing that everyone would want it.</li>
<li>There is a technological limit being hit. The biggest thing these days with all the hardware manufacturers is that their progress is about to slow down as there is not enough technology to make their products faster and quieter and smaller. NVidia is using machine learning to boost their graphics cards. AMD has had to resort to neural networks to boost their performance. Intel has been stuck with the same idea of improving their product from 2000.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this is either very exciting or very disappointing. </p>
<p>It means that maybe, just maybe, there is a huge technological breakthrough coming in the couple of years that will bring the whole industry upside down.</p>
<p>Or it means that we have hit a plateau in the technology field and their technology will be more of a tool to work on other components of life, rather than being the biggest focus.</p>
<p>I am not sure what it is, but I see that our life will be very different from what it is right now in 10 years. Not even taking coronavirus into account.</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
<p>As we know, technology is like a weapon that can either make you a villain if misused or a hero if used correctly.</p>
<p>Technology is just like that. You can either destroy your life by being a slave to social media and other forms of time wasters. Or you can elevate yourself to the next level by creating, learning, and researching with it.</p>
<p>What matters the most to the normal human being is not what you have, but how you use it.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if it’s iPhone 12 or iPhone 24. What matters is what you do with it.</p>
<p>Like with everything, you need to work your way from the bottom:</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Lately, I’ve been playing a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Us">Among Us</a> with my friends. It’s a refreshing change of pace from the competitive FPS titles that we usually play. However, we’ve managed to inject a ‘healthy’ dose of competitiveness into our games in the form of a league that I built some software for. </p>
<p>We recently crossed the 100 game mark and players have been making feature requests and also submitting PRs! It has been open sourced at <a href="https://github.com/healeycodes/among-us-friends">healeycodes/among-us-friends</a>.</p>
<p>The league website is a Node/Express application that calculates a player’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo rating</a> — a relative measure of one player’s skill against another — as well as other performance statistics like crew/imposter win rate. It ranks players and graphs their recent performance on the home page. </p>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>When a player goes to their auto-generated player page, they can see a history of their games and who played on each side, the amount of Elo they won or lost each game, and an Elo history graph for the whole season.</p>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>I manually track each game we play in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This data is brought into the application via the Google Sheets API v4. To set this up, I grabbed the spreadsheets ID (which can be copied straight from the URL bar) and created a restricted API key via Google Console.</p>
<p>The data arrives in a series of rows with each row representing one game. An Among Us game can be split up into three parts of data. </p>
<ul>
<li>The crew (7 or 8 players)</li>
<li>The imposters (2 players)</li>
<li>The winner (crew or imposters)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since a spreadsheet cannot be efficiently queried, and page requests are unlikely to exceed 0.15/s, and the amount of data will grow linearly, we bring in all the rows on every request (Sheets API usage is unlimited and free).</p>
<p>There is a performance cost to recalculating the statistics but this can be solved in the future with caching. The performance cost for each additional game is a constant amount so, loosely, we could say that the cost of generating league statistics grows at the same rate as additional games. It has a time complexity of <code>O(n)</code>.</p>
<p>A player object is built for each person in the league and the following information is calculated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crew wins/losses</li>
<li>Imposter wins/losses</li>
<li>Current Elo</li>
<li>Elo history</li>
<li>Their game history</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="elo-ratings"><a href="#elo-ratings" aria-label="elo ratings permalink"></a>Elo ratings</h2>
<p>For Elo calculations, I use the npm package <code>elo-rating</code>. In the Elo rating methodology, the <em>K-factor</em> is the maximum possible adjustment for a game. I have based the league’s system off the International Chess Federation’s rules. Before a player reaches 30 games, their rating is more volatile. After 30 games, their K-factor drops from 40 to 20.</p>
<p>Elo was designed for games with two players. I was initially unsure how to solve the problem of Among Us having different team sizes. Other people have created rating systems for Among Us that separate a measure of a player’s skill into crew/imposter. However, I made a product decision to reduce a player’s performance down to a single number. As a result, a player is compared against the average Elo of the side they are playing against.</p>
<p>We alter our game settings (e.g. crew vision, kill cooldown) over time to encourage a 50/50 win rate of crew and imposter teams. Even if the win rate is skewed, the effects on a player’s general rating will even out in the long run because players will have a similar number of games on each side (20% imposter, 80% crew).</p>
<p>Elo systems in video games are not tuned to be mathematically perfect but to reward and encourage players — a mixture of fun and correctness.

<p>The backend of the application is tested using Jest, and SuperTest for mocking requests to the server. The statistic functions are unittested. All the tests are ran on commit/PR using GitHub Actions with the default Node YAML file that runs the following commands across the three latest versions of Node.</p>
<div data-language="yaml"><pre><code>    <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> npm ci
    <span>-</span> <span>run</span><span>:</span> npm run build <span>-</span><span>-</span>if<span>-</span>present

<h2 id="charts-and-pages"><a href="#charts-and-pages" aria-label="charts and pages permalink"></a>Charts and pages</h2>
<p>For the line graphs that chart player ratings, I use Chart.js. There is a shared graph function for the home page and the player page. It takes an array of Elo history and a <code>sample</code> argument which allows the home page to show the last 30 games and the player pages to show all of the season’s games.</p>
<p>The home page generates a list of players and their graphs after hitting an endpoint of the application that sends back a blob of statistics. In the future, depending on the size of the player base, this will need to allow querying specific players. For now, the page load cost of this is imperceivable (i.e. sub-100ms).</p>

<p>I manually deploy and maintain the application via Glitch. I import the latest changes from the default GitHub branch and any changes to the <code>package.json</code> file are reconciled. This means there is ~20 seconds of downtime. The Glitch IDE allows for hotfixing in production (or even development), as well as viewing application logs, and a terminal window that connects to an SSH session.</p>

<p>I started this project by coding directly in Glitch’s browser IDE which can export to a GitHub repository’s <code>glitch</code> branch where PRs can be created. After a while, I took development offline when users started visiting the website more often.</p>
<p>My current workflow is: develop locally, check tests locally, create PR, check the CI tests, merge to main, go to Glitch, and import from GitHub.</p>
<p>I also added a route <code>/raw-stats</code> so that myself and other developers can work with read-only production data when we work locally.</p>
<h2 id="feedback"><a href="#feedback" aria-label="feedback permalink"></a>Feedback</h2>
<p>Like most online games that have rating systems, there have been comments about the fairness of the rating system. As of writing, the key unsolved problem is that the player’s team is not taken into account (only the opposing team’s rating is used). If you are paired with new players, or very experienced players, the probability of you winning a game is altered but not captured in the Elo calculations.</p>
<p>A player on a strong team should be rewarded less for their win and vice versa. The change required to implement this is to ‘walk’ the player’s Elo towards the average of their team before determining their rating change after a game.</p></section></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <div>
      <p>OpenCSPM is an open-source platform developed by <a href="https://darkbit.io/">Darkbit</a> that aims to make continuous cloud security posture assessments of cloud environments a practical reality for security and compliance teams alike.  It offers a unique approach to manage the firehose of security and compliance check results that can even modest AWS and GCP environments can surface, and its control definitions allow for simple yet powerful levels of introspection of its graph data model.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-we-build-opencspm">Why Did We Build OpenCSPM?</h2>

<p>Performing cloud-native and Kubernetes security posture assessments is our laser-focus at <a href="https://darkbit.io/services">Darkbit</a>, and helping our customers at every stage of their journey manage appropriate levels of risk in their environments is what drives us.  With every engagement, we learn more and more about what drives our customers and the contributing factors to their cloud security challenges.  Overwhelmingly, the challenge is getting control of and keeping control of security risks in ever-growing and changing cloud environments.  It’s just too much data, too often, and the surface area keeps expanding.</p>

<p><img src="https://darkbit.io/img/opencspm-demo-search.gif" alt="OpenCSPM Demo Search"></p>

<p>There are several SaaS offerings and open-source tools that focus in this space, but our perspective as a two-person consulting company made us see and feel a lot of our customers’ pain.  It highlighted multiple areas that we wanted to address differently, and we felt the community could benefit from our lessons learned.</p>

<h2 id="what-have-we-seen">What Have We Seen?</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can’t manage what you can’t see. Without a complete inventory, you’re flying blind when it comes to cloud security posture management.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Incomplete Collection Coverage</strong> - Many solutions don’t have the capability to collect the metadata from all available cloud resources.  They tend to focus on the core types of compute, networking, database, and IAM service resources which means the results are by definition limited in completeness.  What do you do if you use a service that your CSPM solution doesn’t even look at?</li>
  <li><strong>Data Ownership</strong> - Many solutions are delivered as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and provide quick onboarding experiences, but they inherently are a third-party with account-wide or organization-wide “read-only/security audit” access to your cloud resources.  This may present challenges with data ownership, compliance attestations of an external third party, and adherence to regional compliance mandates.</li>
  <li><strong>Customization</strong> - Solutions can vary widely in their ability to make adjustments to how data is collected, how security checks are defined, how results are filtered/excluded and reported, and how and when teams are alerted for issues.  Without full control over all aspects, you may end up with results and notifications that cannot be properly tuned, and this can lead to ignoring the tool and overall alert fatigue.</li>
  <li><strong>Answering Complex Questions</strong> - All CSPM solutions can answer “Is this S3 Bucket Public?”, but very few of them can answer questions like “Are there any publicly accessible virtual machines with attached instance credentials that allow reading from S3 buckets tagged ‘sensitive’?” or “Which GKE Clusters have pods with access to escalate to ‘Project Owner’ via the attached Service Account?”</li>
  <li><strong>Point-in-Time vs Continuous</strong> - A solution designed with tunable results tracking and results triage workflows across multiple assessment intervals in mind is a giant upgrade in value from running a tool every day and getting the report in your inbox.</li>
  <li><strong>Unattainable Perfection</strong> - The concept of reaching “zero” failing checks is much like reaching “Inbox Zero”. If you can, it’s short-lived, but it may never be possible with certain requirements in place.  Being able to calibrate the tool to <strong>your baseline</strong> instead of <strong>perfection</strong> is the only way to make the results stay meaningful and accurate.  Having a list of failing issues delivered to your inbox every day that you know you can’t fix dilutes the value of those results by increasing the cognitive load and context required to make use of them.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus on Compliance</strong> - Most security practitioners are aware of the differences between an environment that is only compliant with one that is compliant and also well hardened.  Compliance is a key driver for obtaining project funding and being able to operate their business legally, but going no further than compliance still leaves you open to critical risks.  Cloud security posture assessment tools don’t often cover both security best practices and compliance objectives equally.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design-goals">Design Goals</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make answering the simple questions simple and answering even the most complex questions possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Support for cloud providers, Kubernetes resources, and other related types of data types using a standardized approach</strong> - OpenCSPM is targeting AWS, GCP, and soon, Kubernetes resources, but adding other types of data like Identity mapping, container image vulnerability metadata, and more are on the roadmap.  Resources are to be collected in a standardized JSON format using dedicated collection mechanisms and delivered to cloud storage buckets like GCS and/or S3.</li>
  <li><strong>Separation of Collection from Analysis</strong> - Scanning/collecting and then analyzing the data from a single tool is convenient, but when deployed into a cloud account, it becomes quite the target for an attacker. Having processes with just enough permissions to collect the data and write to a bucket separate from the system that ingests/analyzes that data helps minimize that risk, but it also enables more flexible deployment scenarios for larger organizations with multiple teams, each with their own levels of access to the data.</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced Data Model</strong> - Answering lots of complex questions of this inventory and configuration data requires parsing and storing the data with relationships intact.  A graph database is best suited for this task, and it provides a window to this data that makes answering the simple questions simple and answering even the most complex questions possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Campaigns as Workflows</strong> - When making the cost of checking thousands of settings across multiple accounts extremely cheap and quick, even small organizations will generate an overwhelming amount of results they have to manage.  The most important results can be triaged and tracked in one or more “campaigns”, and this is the touchpoint where activities such as filtering and notifications can be handled.  You should be in full control over what to care about and be notified on, not the system.</li>
  <li><strong>Full control</strong> - A platform with this much potential capability and power should be in the hands of the teams that need to get work done.  That means full control over where that system is deployed, its access model, and fine-grained control over what it checks and how it represents that data.  The system should be open and transparent about what it’s doing.  More importantly, you should be able to know what it’s <strong>not</strong> doing.</li>
  <li><strong>Compliance Objectives and Tagging</strong> - It should be possible to associate controls with one or more compliance requirements with relative ease, and the user interface, filtering, and workflows should be driven from those tags.  For example, filtering controls by “PCI”, “NIST 800-53”, or “CIS” should narrow down the list to the controls that align with those frameworks with an identical mechanism that can also be used to filter controls for “lateral movement” or “privilege escalation”.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="who-is-opencspm-for">Who Is OpenCSPM For?</h2>

<p>Organizations looking for an open-source solution to help them gain more complete control over how cloud security posture data is collected, analyzed, measured, and handled on a continuous basis.  For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Security Teams looking for a way to identify cloud security risks and automatically track the progress down to a desired baseline across the entire organization.</li>
  <li>Compliance Teams looking for a more complete picture of adherence to and deviations from the various compliance frameworks and a way to measure and track those statistics over time.</li>
  <li>Development and Operations Teams looking for continuous and early feedback during greenfield infrastructure development to avoid surprises when Security or Compliance Teams review said infrastructure.</li>
  <li>Red Teams looking for common mistakes and trends in their organizations to help them devise more useful scenarios to run against their Blue Teams, and Blue Teams looking to be made aware when those common mistakes reoccur to be able to address them.</li>
</ul>

<![CDATA[A GAN to generate dithers minimising frame difference for a slow movie player]]>
            </title>

November 13, 2020 | http://matpalm.com/blog/dithernet_vsmp/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://matpalm.com/blog/dithernet_vsmp/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
  
<p>it's been about two years since i first saw the awesome
   <a href="https://medium.com/s/story/very-slow-movie-player-499f76c48b62">very slow movie player</a>
   project by bryan boyer. i thought it was such an excellent idea but never got around
   to buying the hardware to make one. more recently though i've seen a couple of references
   to the project so i decided it was finally time to make one.
</p>
<p>one interesting concern about an eink very slow movie player is the screen refresh. simpler
   eink screens refresh by doing a full cycle of a screen of white or black before displaying
   the new image. i hated the idea of an ambient slow player doing this every few minutes
   as it switched frames, so i wanted to make sure i got a piece of hardware that could do
   incremental update.
</p>
<p>after a bit of shopping around i settled on a
   <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/6inch-hd-e-paper-hat.htm">6 inch HD screen from waveshare</a>
</p>
<p>it ticks all the boxes i wanted
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     6 inch
 </li>

 <li>
     1448×1072 high definition
 </li>

 <li>
     comes with a raspberry pi HAT
 </li>

 <li>
     and, most importantly, support partial refresh
 </li>
</ul>
<p>this screen also supports grey scale, but only with a flashy full cycle redraw,
   so i'm going to stick to just black and white since it supports the partial redraw.
</p>
<p>note: even though the partial redraw is basically instant it does suffer from a ghosting problem;
   when you draw a white pixel over a black one things are fine, but if you draw black over
   white, in the partial redraw, you get a slight ghosting of gray that is present until a
   full redraw :/
</p>


<p>so how do you display an image when you can only show black and white?
   dithering! here's an example of a 384x288 RGB image dithered using
   <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.convert">PILS implementation of the Floyd-Steinberg algorithm</a>
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/eg.dither.png"></td></tr>
<tr><td>original RGB vs dithered version</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>it makes intuitive sense that you could have small variations in the exact locations of the
   dots as long as you get the densities generally right. s
   so there's a reasonable question then; how do you dither in such a way that you get a
   good result, but with minimal pixel changes from a previous frame? (since we're
   motivated on these screens to change as little as possible)
</p>
<p>there are two approaches i see
</p>
<p>1) spend 30 minutes googling for a solution that no doubt someone came up with 20 years
   ago that can be implemented in 10 lines of c running at 1000fps ...
</p>
<p>2) .... or train an
   <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/">jax</a>
   based GAN to generate the dithers with a loss balancing a good dither vs no pixel change. :P
</p>


<p>when building a very slow movie player the most critical decision is...
   what movie to play?
   i really love the 1979 classic <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/">alien</a>,
   it's such a great dark movie, so i thought i'd go with it.
   the movie is 160,000 frames so at a play back rate of a frame every 200 seconds
   it'll take just over a year to finish.
</p>
<p>note that in this type of problem there is no concern around overfitting.
   we have access to all data going in and so it's fine to overfit as much as we like;
   as long as we're minimising whatever our objective is we're good to go.
</p>


<p>i started with a
   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597">unet</a>
   that maps 3 channel RGB images to a single channel dither.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/models.v1.png"></td></tr>
<tr><td>v1 architecture</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>i tinkered a bit with the architecture but didn't spend too much time tuning it.
   for the final v3 result i ended with a pretty vanilla stack of encoders &amp; decoders
   (with skip connections connecting an encoder to the decoder at the same spatial resolution)
   each encoder/decoder block uses a residual like shortcut around a couple of convolutions.
   nearest neighbour upsampling gave a nicer result than deconvolutions in the decoder
   for the v3 result.
   also, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415">gelu</a> is my new favorite activation :)
</p>
<p>for v1 i used a binary cross entropy loss of P(white) per pixel
   ( since it's what worked well for my
   <a href="http://matpalm.com/blog/counting_bees/">bee counting project</a> )
</p>
<p>as always i started by overfitting to a single example to get a baseline feel for capacity required.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/overfit.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
v1 overfit result
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>when scaling up to the full dataset i switched to training on half resolution images
   against a patch size of 128. working on half resolution consistently gave a better
   result than working with the full resolution.
</p>
<p>as expected though this model gave us the classic type of problem we see with
   straight unet style image translation; we get a reasonable sense of the shapes, but no
   fine details around the dithering.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v1.upsample.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
v1 vanilla unet with upsampling example
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>side notes:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     for this v1 version using deconvolutions in the decoder
     (instead of nearest neighbour upsampling) actually looked pretty good!
     nicely captured texture for a dither with a surprisingly small network.
 </li>

 <li>
     i actually did some experiments using branches in the decoder for both upsampling
     and deconvolutions but the deconvs always dominated too much. i thought that would
     allow the upsampling to work as a kind of residual to the deconv but it never happened.
 </li>
</ul>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v1.deconv.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>



<p>for v2 i added a GAN objective in an attempt to capture finer details
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/models.v2.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
v2 architecture
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>i started with the original
   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004">pix2pix</a>
   objective but reasonably quickly moved to use a
   <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875">wasserstein</a>
   critic style objective since i've always found it more stable.
</p>
<p>the generator (G) was the same as the unet above with the discriminator (D) running patch based.
   at this point i also changed the reconstruction loss from a binary objective to just L1.
   i ended up using batchnorm in D, but not G.
   to be honest i only did a little did of manual tuning, i'm sure there's a better result
   hidden in the hyperparameters somewhere.
</p>
<p>so, for this version, the loss for G has two components
</p>
<pre>1. D(G(rgb))             # fool D
2. L1(G(rgb), dither)    # reconstruct the dither
</pre>

<p>very quickly (i.e. in &lt; 10mins ) we get a reasonable result that is started to
   show some more detail than just the blobby reconstruction.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v2.eg.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
v2 partial trained eg
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>note: if the loss weight of 2) is 0 we degenerate to v1
   (which proved a useful intermediate debugging step).
   at this point i didn't want to tune to much since the final v3 is coming...
</p>


<p>for v3 we finally introduce a loss relating the previous frame
   (which was one of the main intentions of the project in the first place)
</p>
<p>now G takes not just the RGB image, but the dither of the previous frame.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
<img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/models.v3.png">
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
v3 architecture
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>the loss for G now has three parts
</p>
<pre>1. D(G(rgb_t1)) =&gt; real      # fool D
2. L1(G(rgb_t1), dither_t1)  # reconstruct the dither
3. L1(G(rgb_t1), dither_t0)  # don't change too much from the last frame
</pre>

<p>normally with a network that takes as input the same thing it's outputting
   we have to be careful to include things like teacher forcing.
   but since we don't intend to use this network for any kind of rollouts
   we can just always feed the "true" dithers in where required.
   having said that, rolling out the dithers from this network would be interesting :D
</p>


<p>the third loss objective, not changing too many pixels from the last frame,
   works well for generally stationary shots
   but is disastrous for scene changes :/
</p>
<p>consider the following graph for a sequence of frames showing the pixel difference
   between frames.
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/pixel_diff_between_scenes.png"></p><p>when there is a scene change we observe a clear "spike" in pixel diff. my first thought
   was to look for these and do a full redraw for them. it's very straightforward to
   find them (using a simple z-score based anomaly detector on a sliding window) but
   the problem is that it doesn't pick up the troublesome case of a panning shot where we don't
   have a scene change exactly. in these cases there is no abrupt scene change, but there
   are a lot of pixels changing so we end up seeing a lot of ghosting.
</p>
<p>i spent ages tinkering with the best way to approach this before deciding that a simple
   approach of <code>num_pixels_changed_since_last_redraw &gt; threshold</code> was good enough to decide
   if a full redraw was required (with a cooldown to ensure we not redrawing all the time)
</p>


<p>the v3 network gets a very good result <em>very</em> quickly; unsurprisingly since the dither at time
   t0 provided to G is a pretty good estimate of the dither at t1 :)
   i.e. G can get a good result simply by copying it!
</p>
<p>the following scenario shows this effect...
</p>
<p>consider three sequential frames, the middle one being a scene change.
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v3.scene_eg.1.png"></p><p>at the very start of training the reconstruction loss is dominant and
   we get blobby outlines of the frame.
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v3.scene_eg.2.png"></p><p>but as the contribution from the dither at time t0 kicks it things look good in general but
   the frames at the scene change end up being a ghosted mix attempt to copy through the old
   frame along with dithering the new one.
   (depending on the relative strength of the loss terms of G).
</p>
<p><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/v3.scene_eg.3.png"></p>
<p>so the v3 version generally works and i'm sure with some more tuning i could get a better result
   but, as luck would have it, i actually find the results from v2 more appealing when testing
   on the actual eink screen. so even though the intention was do something like v3 i'm going to end
   up running something more like v2 (as shown in these couple of examples (though the resolution
   does it no justice (not to mention the fact the player will run about 5000 times slower than these
   gifs)))
</p>




<p>i'll update this section when i get a proper frame made (though i might try myself?) but for now the
   prototype lives balanced precariously on a piece of foam below it's younger sibling pi zero eink screen
   running game of life.
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><img src="http://matpalm.com/blog/imgs/2020/dn/prototype.png"></td></tr>
<tr><td>prototype on desk</td></tr>
</tbody></table>



<ul>
 <li>
     for reconstruction and frame change i used L1 loss, but that's not exactly what we
     want. since we want to avoid the ghosting (white changing to black resulting in grey)
     we should try to avoid white to black but ignore black to white.
 </li>

 <li>
     we might be able to better handle scene changes by also including a
     loss component around the <em>next</em> frame.
 </li>

 <li>
     there's a padding issue where i train G on patches but when it's run on the full res
     version we get an edge artefact the size of the original patch (see image below).
     as a hacky fix i just padded the RGB image before passing it to …</li></ul></div></div>

<![CDATA[A Visual Guide to Regular Expression]]>

November 13, 2020 | https://amitness.com/regex/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://amitness.com/regex/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>It’s a common task in NLP to either check a text against a pattern or extract parts from the text that matches a certain pattern. A regular expression or “regex” is a powerful tool to achieve this.</p>
<p>While powerful, regex can feel daunting as it comes with a lot of features and sub-parts that you need to remember.</p>
<p>In this post, I will illustrate the various concepts underlying regex. The goal is to help you build a good mental model of how a regex pattern works.</p>
<h2 id="mental-model">Mental Model</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a simple example where we are trying to find the word ‘cool’ in the text.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-mental-model-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With regex, we could simply type out the word ‘cool’ as the pattern and it will match the word.</p>

<p>While regex matched our desired word ‘<strong>cool</strong>’, the way it operates is not at the word level but the character level. This is the key idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Idea</strong>: Regex works at the character-level, not word-level.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-working.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The implication of this is that the regex <code>r'cool'</code> would match the following sentences as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-exact-word-match.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="basic-building-blocks">Basic Building Blocks</h2>
<p>Now that we understand the key idea, let’s understand how we can match simple characters using regex.</p>
<h3 id="a-specific-character">a. Specific character</h3>
<p>We can simply specify the character in the regular expression and it will match all instances in the text.</p>
<p>For example, a regular expression given below will match all instances of ‘a’ in the text. You can use any of the small and capital alphabets.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-only-a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also use any digits from 0 to 9 and it will work as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-python-3.7-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that regex is case-sensitive by default and thus the following regex won’t match anything.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-not-matched-by-capital-a.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="b-white-space-character">b. White space character</h3>
<p>We can detect special characters such as whitespace and newlines using special escape sequences.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-white-space-characters.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Besides the common ones above, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>\r</strong> for carriage return</li>
<li><strong>\f</strong> for form feed</li>
<li><strong>\e</strong> for escape.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-special-sequences">c. Special sequences</h3>
<p>Regex provides a bunch of built-in special symbols that can match a group of characters at once. These begin with backslash <code>\</code>.</p>
<h4 id="pattern-d">Pattern: <code>\d</code></h4>
<p>It matches any single-digit number between 0 to 9.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-single-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Notice that matches are single digit. So we have 4 different matches below instead of a single number <code>18.04</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-ubuntu-18.04.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-s">Pattern: \s</h4>
<p>It matches any whitespace character (<span>space</span>, <span>tab</span> or <span>newline</span>).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-any-whitespace.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-w">Pattern: \w</h4>
<p>It matches any of the small alphabets(a to z), capital alphabets(A to Z), digits (0 to 9), and underscore.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-slash-w.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="pattern-">Pattern: .</h4>
<p>It matches any character except the new line (\n).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-everything-except-newline.png" alt=""></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r'.'</span><span>,</span> <span>'line 1</span><span>\n</span><span>line2'</span><span>)</span>
<span>[</span><span>'l'</span><span>,</span> <span>'i'</span><span>,</span> <span>'n'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>' '</span><span>,</span> <span>'1'</span><span>,</span> <span>'l'</span><span>,</span> <span>'i'</span><span>,</span> <span>'n'</span><span>,</span> <span>'e'</span><span>,</span> <span>'2'</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="pattern-negations">Pattern: Negations</h4>
<p>If you use the capitalized versions of the patterns above, they act as negation.</p>
<p>For example, if “\d” matched any digits from 0 to 9, then “\D” will match anything except “0 to 9”.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-negation.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="d-character-sets">d. Character sets</h3>
<p>These are patterns starting with <code>[</code> and ending with <code>]</code> and specify the characters that should be matched enclosed by brackets.</p>
<p>For example, the following pattern matches any of the characters ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, and ‘u’.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-aeiou.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also replicate the functionality of <code>\d</code> using the below pattern. It will match any digits between 0 to 9.
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-1-to-9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Instead of specifying all the digits, we can use <code>-</code> to specify only start and end digits. So, instead of <code>[0123456789]</code>, we can do:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-refactor-all-digits.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, <code>[2-4]</code> can be used to match any digits between 2 to 4 i.e. (2 or 3 or 4).</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-year-2014-example.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can even use the special characters we learned previously inside the brackets. For example, you can match any digit from 0 to 9 or whitespace as:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-whitespace-or-digit.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Below, I have listed some useful common patterns and what they mean.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-common-pattern-for-bracket.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="e-anchors">e. Anchors</h3>
<p>Regex also has special handlers to make the pattern only match if it’s at the start or end of the string.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>^</code> anchor to match patterns only at the start of a line. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-start-anchor.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Similarly, we can use the <code>$</code> anchor after the character to match patterns only if it’s the end of the line. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-anchor-end.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="f-escaping-metacharacters">f. Escaping metacharacters</h3>
<p>Consider a case where we want to exactly match the word “Mr. Stark”.</p>
<p>If we write a regex like <code>Mr. Stark</code>, then it will have an unintended effect. Since we know dot has a special meaning in a regex.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-dot-issue.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, we should always escape the special metacharacters like <code>.</code>, <code>$</code> etc. if our goal is to match the exact character itself.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-dot-fixed.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the list of metacharacters that you should remember to escape if you’re using them directly.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>^ $ . * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="repetition-of-basic-blocks">Repetition of basic blocks</h2>
<p>Now that we can pattern match any characters, we could repeat things and start building more complicated patterns.</p>
<h3 id="a-naive-repetition">a. Naive repetition</h3>
<p>Using only what we have learned so far, a naive way would be to just repeat the pattern. For example, we can match two-digit numbers by just repeating the character-level pattern.</p>

<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-slash-d-slash-d.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="b-quantifiers">b. Quantifiers</h3>
<p>Regex provides special quantifiers to specify different types of repetition for the character preceding it.</p>
<h4 id="i-fixed-repetition">i. Fixed repetition</h4>
<p>We can use the <code>{...}</code> quantifier to specify the number of times a pattern should repeat.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-manual-counts.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, the previous pattern for matching 2-digit number can be recreated as:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-it-is-2020.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also specify a range of repetitions using the same quantifier. For example, to match from 2-digit to 4-digit numbers, we could use the pattern:</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-min-max-count.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When applied to a sentence, it will match both 4-digit and 2-digit numbers.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-20-years-old.png" alt=""></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>
There should not be any space between minimum and maximum count For example, \d{2, 4} doesn't work.
</p>
</div>
<h4 id="ii-flexible-quantifiers">ii. Flexible quantifiers</h4>
<p>Regex also provides quantifiers “*”, “+” and “?” using which you can specify flexible repetition of a character.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>0 or 1 times</strong>: <code>?</code><br>
The <code>?</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats 0 or 1 times. This can be useful to make certain parts optional. It is equivalent to <code>{0,1}</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-question-mark-clarify.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to match both the word “sound” and “sound” where “s” is optional. Then, we can use the <code>?</code> quantifier that matches if a character repeats 0 or 1 times.<br>
<img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-question-mark-example.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>one or more times</strong>: <code>+</code><br>
The <code>+</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats 1 or more times. It is equivalent to <code>{1,}</code>.</p>
<p>For example, we could find numbers of any arbitrary length using the regex <code>\d+</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-example-of-plus.png" alt=""></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>zero or more times</strong>: <code>*</code><br>
The <code>*</code> quantifier matches the previous character if it repeats zero or more times. It is equivalent to <code>{0,}</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage-in-python">Usage in Python</h2>
<p>Python provides a module called “re” in the standard library to work with regular expression.</p>
<h3 id="need-for-raw-strings">Need for raw strings</h3>
<p>To specify a regular expression in Python, we precede it with <strong>r</strong> to create raw strings.</p>

<p>To understand why we precede with <strong>r</strong>, let’s try printing the expression <strong>\t</strong> without <code>**r**</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pattern</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>\t</span><span>'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You can see how when we don’t use raw string, the string <code>\t</code> is treated as the escape character for tab by Python.</p>
<p>Now let’s convert it into raw string. We get back whatever we specified.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>pattern</span> <span>=</span> <span>r'\t'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>pattern</span><span>)</span>
\<span>t</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="using-re-module">Using re module</h3>
<p>To use <code>re</code> module, we can start by importing the <code>re</code> module as:</p>

<h4 id="1-refindall">1. re.findall</h4>
<p>This function allows us to get all the matches as a list of strings.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>
<span>re</span><span>.</span><span>findall</span><span>(</span><span>r'\d'</span><span>,</span> <span>'123456'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']
</code></pre></div></div>
<h4 id="2-rematch">2. re.match</h4>
<p>This function searches for a pattern at the beginning of the string and returns the first occurrence as a match object. If the pattern is not found, it returns None.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code>&lt;re.Match object; span=(0, 6), match='batman'&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/regex-match-object.png" alt=""></p>
<p>With the match object, we can get the matched text as</p>


<p>In a case where our pattern is not at the start of the sentence, we will not get any match.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'The batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="3-research">3. re.search</h4>
<p>This function also finds the first occurrence of a pattern but the pattern can occur anywhere in the text. If the pattern is not found, it returns None.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>re</span>

<span>match</span> <span>=</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>search</span><span>(</span><span>r'batman'</span><span>,</span> <span>'the batman is cool'</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>match</span><span>.</span><span>group</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

The sensors can take temperature readings everywhere a fiber is placed, thereby generating a continuous heat diagram of a given site – even if the site stretches for dozens of kilometers. That provides crucial insight into possible accidents before they happen.</p><h2><b>Improving signal quality</b></h2><p>Working in association with the <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fenglish.bupt.edu.cn%2F&amp;t=OTgyYWFiYzA0MWU4YzgzMTM3OWI0OWQyNDk3YzU0NzY5Y2Y5YzU3OCx6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605660924">Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</a>, two GFO engineers – postdoc Zhisheng Yang and PhD student Simon Zaslawski – developed a new system for encoding and decoding data sent along the fibers. With their method, sensors can receive higher-energy signals and decode them faster, resulting in measurements taken more rapidly and over a larger area. Their research <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-020-19201-1&amp;t=Yjg2ZjMyZTg3ZjE4MzFmM2JiOTMwZmZlYmZkZjg0YTUzNjgxYzljYix6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605660924">has just been published in <i>Nature Communications</i>.</a></p><p>The engineers describe their system as working like an echo. If you shout a single word, you hear that word back. But if you sing out a song, what you hear back is a blend of sounds that are hard to distinguish. You would need a “key” to decipher the sounds and make them intelligible. Fiber optic sensors function in a similar manner, except that an instrument sends out light pulses – rather than sounds – along a fiber. Signals bounce back up the fiber and a device decodes them, turning the signals into usable data.</p><p>To make the sensors more efficient, Yang and Zaslawski grouped the light pulses into sequences so that the signals bounce back with greater intensity. However, that didn’t solve the “echo” problem – that is, finding a key to make the signals readable. So they developed a method for encoding the data sent along a fiber; their method employs special genetic optimization algorithms to cope with imperfections. “Other systems are either limited in scope or expensive,” says Thévenaz. “But with ours, you just have to add a software program to your existing equipment. No need to adapt your sensors or use complex devices.”</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Factu.epfl.ch%2Fnews%2Fnew-fiber-optic-sensors-transmit-data-up-to-100-ti%2F&amp;t=N2IxN2FhNTgwZTdjMDhjNjc4MDZkNTVjYjNlODYzNTk2Y2RlODdjZix6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605660924">École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“Genetic-optimised aperiodic code for distributed optical fibre sensors”, <i>Nature Communications</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1038%2Fs41467-020-19201-1&amp;t=ZTU0NzgxM2FiMzFhM2Q1OWU0YzFkYzVjNGExMTQxZTg4OGZiYzYzZCx6YW5YWDQyOA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F634716239692955648%2Fnew-fiber-optics-100x-faster&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1605660924">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19201-1</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/627187404240027648/world-record-internet-speed-record-set-by-ucl-scientists">New world record internet speed set</a></p>
