<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>The beginning of this year itself had some random and surprising plans lined up on the previous grounds. Well, that might make sense of why we are still stuck in 2019 while living in 20.</p>







<p>The Covid-19 disease and its upshots had a severe impact on every life form, be it in a good way or bad but the worst it affected are us, humans, and our lifestyle. Our daily routine was disrupted, we were stuck inside with just a hope of a new vaccine or natural elimination of Corona Virus, and most importantly the economy was interrupted.</p>



<p>People with income based on their businesses, and especially the daily wagers were the ones who noticed a drastic downfall. Many were forced to permanently shut their business down, who have no idea from where to initiate now. This pandemic hit everyone on a global scale.</p>



<p>Yet, there were some businesses which somehow had either no effect or very less amount of loss faced. These were mainly online businesses or the ones who were somehow had associated themselves with online services. </p>



<h2><strong>Restriction on public movement</strong></h2>



<p>Gyms were affected as they were the ones with a high amount of public movement, who then switched to online training sessions; meanwhile, the most thriving business was health care, treating not just the virus affected patients but also the regular diseases and accidents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>People being stuck in their home, with their loved ones have developed an interest in many household activities. This gave a boon to the sale of gardening tools and cooking utensils. Talking about business, people started with their home run bakery, supplying cakes, cookies, bread and other lip-smacking dishes that are easy to cook and can be freshly served.</p>



<h2><strong>New</strong> <strong>business ideas</strong></h2>



<p>Another new business idea amongst the list, which is heated up these days is Pottery and growing &amp; selling of saplings. With day by day number of people being added in the list of artists, as they are quarantined at one place, some have now developed their interest in making sculptures and doing pottery. </p>



<p>In effect to these activities, many have also tried their hands in growing plants, which luckily turned out to be so effective that they finally grew a business out of it, which can also be called a small nursery, at a homegrown level.</p>



<p>Similarly, there are many small business ideas which can be started off with little money on which you can have a shot at.</p>



<h3><strong>Handmade laundry:</strong></h3>



<p>Learn some DIY skills, maintain proper hygiene and invent your own way to attract customers. Visit a few social media DIY pages and go through some online YouTube lessons. These will help you to come up with your own product. Start selling your own homemade laundry detergents, fabric softener and other similar items.</p>



<h3><strong>Be crafty:</strong></h3>



<p>Unleash your creativity, with random material in front of you. This opportunity of being stranded can be very productive with learning and crafting new ideas. The Internet has thousands of lessons which can teach you to make wall clocks, wax items and other artefacts.</p>



<p>You can try your hands on waste material which can be recycled into something that can be hung up on a wall or can be placed on an office table. Once you are an expert start a business with it.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Business Consultant:</strong></h3>



<p>Just as you are looking for the ideas to manage your income, there are several other people, whose lives are affected as the workload has taken a huge rise but with slashed salaries.</p>



<p>If you got plenty of ideas and have problem-solving strategies, you can start your own business consultancy. Give people expert guidance; make their effective campaigns, have a smooth way out through which you can guide your clients off their issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Online lesson:</strong></h3>



<p>If you are a musician or have any other talent which you can share, start online lessons of it. Well, just as the old clown once said, â€œIf youâ€™re good at something, never do it for freeâ€�. We give you another add on to it, donâ€™t do it for free and donâ€™t let your talent go to waste.</p>



<p>You can start with the publicity of your classes on your own social media platforms, spread the word with a poster of what you will be teaching, what charges you take per session, book a zoom call or even a Whatsapp video call will work and start earning.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Become a YouTuber:</strong></h3>



<p>Follow a simple rule here, keep on adding as many videos as you can and gain more &amp; more subscribers. There is only one way to start earning from YouTube, which is through subscribers. Gain more subscribers, have content that is in trend nowadays or come up with something that has been not yet covered. Keep on adding videos regularly, to keep your subscribers attached to your channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Online Fitness Lessons, Yoga, Calisthenics:</strong></h3>



<p>People are tending more towards fitness, since all the workplaces, as well as gyms, are closed.   Most of the people donâ€™t actually have access to gym equipment at their place. This could be your chance to teach them Yoga or Calisthenics through online lessons or maybe through your YouTube channel.</p>



<h3><strong>Gifts supply:</strong></h3>



<p>Remember you are stuck but not the festivals. People will surely celebrate all the festivals coming this year with more zestfulness as they are at home, with family and have a reach to the outer world and products.</p>



<p>Start with gift items; this can be anything, crafts, food, and beverages. Prepare yourself beforehand to the festival and start a sufficient amount of supply ready, for whatever festival is nearby.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Sell healthcare products:</strong></h3>



<p>Making a hand sanitizer is an easy job while making crafty, the designer face mask is way in trend. Many SMEs and MSMEs have emerged with this idea of business. You can reach out to local shop owners, wholesalers to sell your product or you can even directly sell them online.</p>



<h3><strong>Doorstep food delivery:</strong></h3>



<p>Start with just your kitchen; reach out to thousands around you. Just like a Home-run bakery, you can start with food delivery as well.&nbsp; Cook the best dishes you know, approach online delivery partners and kick start your business which will surely boon in this pandemic.</p>



<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong></p>



<p>Investing your time in <a href="https://business.taxolawgy.com/how-to-develop-your-business-even-during-recession/"><strong>research and development during an economic slowdown</strong></a> can be very helpful for any business startup, even during a period of recession.  </p>



<h4><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h4>



<p>Achieve greatness out of a void. These above-mentioned ideas will lead you to something which will help you start earning.&nbsp; Have your interest lined up and choose anything or many things out of these mentioned businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

August 18, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/fly-decentralized-graphql-server/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/fly-decentralized-graphql-server/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fly is a smart, decentralized hosting that allows your application to run faster by assigning virtual machines in the data centers that are located close to your users.  When users connect to your global IPs, Fly dynamically assigns compute powers in datacenters closest to that particular user’s location, contrary to solutions globally duplicating resources in every datacenter near where your customers are. So basically Fly is a solution allowing you to run Docker images on servers in many different cities and a global router connecting users to the nearest available instance.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location-Smart</strong> - when a user connects to a Fly application, the system determines the nearest location for the lowest latency and starts the application there.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-scaling</strong> - with Fly new instances are being created as more connections appear at a specific location,</li>
<li><strong>Agile</strong> - your applications adjust to users’ demand, relocating power to the locations where demand is expected to be higher,</li>
</ul>
<h2>GraphQL Server example with Fly</h2>
<p>Creators of <a href="https://github.com/fly-examples/edge-apollo-cache">Fly provided an example presenting the performance benefits</a> coming from using their service combined with a global Redis cache and Apollo Server. These three technologies power a GraphQL server able to perform queries super efficiently.</p>
<ol>
<li>When a query arrives at the Apollo Server, it is being filtered through the set of defined GraphQL types and being matched with corresponding resolvers. </li>
<li>When a REST query is executed, the server will respond with a JSON containing the requested data and cache the results (if it was configured to do so). Next incoming queries will be checked if the server already has cached results ready to be served.</li>
<li>The app creates the RedisCache (either locally or using Fly’s global Redis service), environment variables with a connection string to the server. The last step is the creation of an Apollo Server using provided configurations so it could start listening for incoming requests.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://blog.graphqleditor.com/fly-decentralized-graphql-server/fly.io">Fly</a> offers significant performance improvement over traditional hosting. Here are some sample results of the response times test performed for this example app. As you can see results when being hosted on Fly looks much better than results of requests made to the Open Library API directly:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Request Method</th>
<th>Test 1</th>
<th>Test 2</th>
<th>Test 3</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Open Library API</td>
<td>2.06s</td>
<td>1.70s</td>
<td>1.24s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fly.io (uncached)</td>
<td>1.01s</td>
<td>1.03s</td>
<td>2.27s</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fly.io (cached)</td>
<td>0.13s</td>
<td>0.11s</td>
<td>0.09s</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h5>Source: <a href="https://github.com/fly-examples/edge-apollo-cache">github.com/fly-examples</a></h5>
<p>The above results were possible thanks to requests being served from the node located closest to the user’s querying for data, as well as using Redis to cache responses. After the first request made to a specific location Redis will keep data live for approximately an hour, so the next matching requests being sent to this location could be served significantly faster.</p>
<p>If you are still skeptical just visit the example app page on <a href="https://github.com/fly-examples/edge-apollo-cache">GitHub</a>. There is a detailed instruction provided on how to deploy it using Fly so you could test it yourself. </p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs. Our all-in-one development environment for GraphQL will help you build, manage &amp; deploy your GraphQL API much faster thanks to dozens of built-in micro features. Its graphical interface will also fix communication within your product team. Visualization is the key!</p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="abstract"><div><h6><i></i> Abstract</h6><p>Risk-based Authentication (RBA) is an adaptive security measure that improves the security of password-based authentication by protecting against credential stuffing, password guessing, or phishing attacks. RBA monitors extra features during login and requests for an additional authentication step if the observed feature values deviate from the usual ones in the login history. In state-of-the-art RBA re-authentication deployments, users receive an email with a numerical code in its body, which must be entered on the online service. Although this procedure has a major impact on RBA's time exposure and usability, these aspects were not studied so far.</p><p>We introduce two RBA re-authentication variants supplementing the de facto standard with a link-based and another code-based approach. Then, we present the results of a between-group study (N=592) to evaluate these three approaches. Our observations show with significant results that there is potential to speed up the RBA re-authentication process without reducing neither its security properties nor its security perception. The link-based re-authentication via "magic links", however, makes users significantly more anxious than the code-based approaches when perceived for the first time. Our evaluations underline the fact that RBA re-authentication is not a uniform procedure. We summarize our findings and provide recommendations.</p></div></div></div>]]>

              <div>
              <p>Navigating in the ocean of Haskell possibilities is challenging even though Haskell is a powerful language that helps to implement robust and maintainable programs. The language supplies you with tons of awesome approaches, but it is not always trivial to see how and where to use them properly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, like any other mainstream programming language, Haskell also has its best-practices and recommended ways for producing high-quality code. Knowing Haskell programming patterns helps you create better libraries and applications and make their users more pleased. And, yes, Haskell actually has FP-oriented programming patterns in addition to the best-practices shared with other languages.</p>
<p>If you are aware of the best ways to solve common problems, you can become a better Haskell developer by using more efficient programming techniques specific to the language. Likewise, you can apply Haskell-specific patterns successfully outside of Haskell.</p>
<p>This blog post contains a structured collection of some programming mini-patterns in Haskell with the detailed description and examples, some small “quality of life” improvements that would help everyone on their developer journey.</p>
<p>📚 In this article, each pattern contains at least one task with the hidden solution, so you can test your understanding of a pattern by solving the proposed task.</p>
<h2 id="newtype">Newtype<a href="#newtype">🔗</a></h2>
<div>

<p>Newtype</p>

<p>Lightweight data wrapper.</p>

<p>When using the same primitive type (<code>Int</code>, <code>Text</code>, etc.) to represent semantically different entities (name, title, description, etc.).</p>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>Improves maintainability.</li>
<li>Increases code readability.</li>
<li>Enables writing custom instances.</li>
<li>Allows reusing instance definitions with <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#deriving-via">DerivingVia</a>.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>Additional wrapping and unwrapping.</li>
<li>Deriving boilerplate is required to duplicate existing behaviour of the underlying type.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the most common and useful Haskell features is <code>newtype</code>. <code>newtype</code> is an ordinary data type with the name and a constructor. However, you can define a data type as <code>newtype</code> instead of <code>data</code> only if it has <strong>exactly</strong> one constructor with <strong>exactly</strong> one field.</p>
<p>It is extremely easy to define a <code>newtype</code> in Haskell as no extra effort is required from the user compared to the data type declaration. For example, the following are the valid <code>newtype</code> definitions:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>-- + Valid definition of a wrapper around Double</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>newtype</span> <span>Volume</span> <span>=</span> <span>Volume</span> <span>Double</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>-- + Also valid newtype definition with the record field</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>newtype</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=</span> <span>Size</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">    {<span> unSize ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But you can’t declare the following data types as a <code>newtype</code>:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>-- - Invalid newtype definition: more than 1 field</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>newtype</span> <span>Point</span> <span>=</span> <span>Point</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">    {<span> pointX ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">    ,<span> pointY ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5">    }</span>
<span id="cb2-6"></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span>-- - Ivalid newtype definition: more than 1 constructor</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><span>newtype</span> <span>Shape</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9">    <span>=</span> <span>Circle</span> <span>Double</span></span>
<span id="cb2-10">    <span>|</span> <span>Square</span> <span>Double</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>newtype</code>s have a lot of great benefits but I’m going to focus only on the <em>code maintainability</em> in this section.</p>
<p>You can think of a <code>newtype</code> as a lightweight data type. Newtype has the same representation in memory as the wrapped type. Wrapping and unwrapping are also free operations in runtime. So, <code>newtype</code> is a <strong>zero-cost</strong> abstraction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding from the compiler point of view, different <code>newtype</code>s are different data types. And since they don’t have any runtime overhead compared to the ordinary data types, you can provide a safer interface to your API without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>Shall we look at the example now. Consider, that you have a function which takes a password, a hash and verifies whether the given hash is the hash of the given password. Since both password and hash are merely textual data, we could write the following function:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>validateHash ::</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The problem with this function is that you can easily pass arguments in a different order and get faulty results. And you need to think about proper order of arguments each time you are calling this function. Should it be <code>validateHash password hash</code> or <code>validateHash hash password</code>? This approach is error-prone.</p>
<p>But if you define the following <code>newtype</code>s instead:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Password</span> <span>=</span> <span>Password</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">    {<span> unPassword ::</span> <span>ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">    }</span>
<span id="cb4-4"></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><span>newtype</span> <span>PasswordHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>PasswordHash</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6">    {<span> unPasswordHash ::</span> <span>ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can implement a more type-safe version of the <code>validateHash</code> function, and additionally this improves the code readability:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>validateHash ::</span> <span>Password</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>PasswordHash</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, <code>validateHash hash password</code> is a compile-time error, and it makes it impossible to confuse the order of arguments.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another popular way of increasing code readability without sacrificing performance is introducing a new alias (which is simply another name for a data type) by using the <code>type</code> keyword. Unfortunately, this approach is only a partial solution since it helps only a developer, not the compiler as the compiler doesn’t see the difference between type alias and type itself. And if you don’t help your compiler, the compiler won’t be there for you when you need it.</p>
<p>For example, the following code is flawed:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>type</span> <span>Attack</span>  <span>=</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>type</span> <span>Defense</span> <span>=</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>calculateDamage ::</span> <span>Attack</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Defense</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Attack</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, the above type signature is better than <code>Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int</code>, but the compiler sees it exactly like this. So, you still can write <code>calculateDamage monsterDefense playerAttack</code> and get a runtime bug.</p>
<p>The approach of using <code>type</code>s instead of <code>newtype</code> can bring even more damage when you have a lot of similar data types. The more types you have the harder to maintain them without external help. Below you can see a code sample from one of the Haskell libraries:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>WorkerId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>type</span> <span>SupervisorId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><span>type</span> <span>ProcessId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>type</span> <span>ProcessName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><span>type</span> <span>SupervisorName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><span>type</span> <span>WorkerName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The library safety can be improved by replacing all these type aliases with <code>newtype</code>s, and it can even help to discover some bugs that happen due to passing arguments in the wrong order.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <code>newtype</code> approach is more flexible since you can provide your custom instances or restrict some instances allowing you to create values in an unsafe way.</p>
<p>The cost of using <code>newtype</code> is small — you only need to wrap and unwrap it when necessary. But the benefits hugely outweigh this small price.</p>

<p>Smart constructor</p>

<p>Once you have a <code>newtype</code>, first you need to create its value to work with it. And sometimes you want to validate a value before proceeding with it. Usually you would create a value of a data type by using its constructor. However, when programming in a modular way, you want to have boundaries in your interface and avoid providing unsafe ways of constructing values without validation.</p>
<p>This programming pattern in Haskell is called <strong>smart constructor</strong>. It can be understood better by looking at the implementation of such approach based on the <code>Password</code> data type:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>module</span> <span>Password</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">    ( <span>Password</span> (unPassword)</span>

<h4 id="a-perfect-storm-of-a-global-pandemic-a-bleak-love-life-and-impending-global-recession-caused-one-of-my-friends-to-consider-making-an-onlyfans-account">A perfect storm of a global pandemic, a bleak love life, and impending global recession caused one of my friends to consider making an OnlyFans account.</h4>

<p>OnlyFans has become part of the zeitgeist recently.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/8/1/20748707/egirl-definition-what-is-an-eboy">rise of e-girls</a> and the <a href="https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/wa-model-jem-wolfie-breaks-social-media-makes-millions-on-onlyfans-ng-b881158181z">prospects of making millions</a>
make it a fun thing to gawk at in a reality-tv kind of way. It has benefitted fabulously from the pandemic too. With everyone stuck at home all day, less of us have jobs and we all have less to entertain ourselves with.
More existential boredom equals more “fans” and “creators” alike.</p>

<p>I was curious about this <a href="https://www.complex.com/life/2020/03/onlyfans-trending-on-twitter-weird-specific-interests">trending</a> yet mysterious company, and wanted to find out more.</p>

<p>Despite dipping its toe in the mainstream, there wasn’t much about OnlyFans in the news. There are many interviews with OnlyFans creators, but I wanted some hard data.</p>

<p>To get it, I scraped the Onlyfans website and did some analysis. The results are presented below for your pleasure. At the very bottom, I explain how I got them.</p>

<p>To start I go through OnlyFans as a business, explaining why I think it is a unicorn in disguise.
Next, we’ll look at how OnlyFans is more unequal than the least equal country in the world.
Finally, I’ll return to the question I began this essay with. Should you make an OnlyFans account?</p>

<h2 id="onlyfans-is-a-billion-dollar-business">OnlyFans is a billion dollar business</h2>

<p>Sex has always sold well. Now OnlyFans use the leverage of software to multiply its profits, giving power to the performers along the way.</p>

<p>Their business is as simple as it gets. They provide a platform for paywalled content.
Creators, mostly fitness models and amateur pornstars, post exclusive content, to which only their paying “fans” have access.
OnlyFans takes a 20% cut, one giant pimp in the middle of an online marketplace of punters and showgirls.</p>

<p>It’s the Uber-isation of wanking; the logical conclusion to <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/02/28/markets-are-eating-the-world/">markets eating the world</a>.
Instead of monetising a spare room or a Prius you monetise your selfies.</p>

<p>While Uber and Airbnb disrupted taxi-companies and hotel chains, OnlyFans are disrupting a seedier incumbent — the porn industry.
Big Porn is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Girls_Wanted">notorious</a> for taking advantage of young women.
Via their commission-based model, OnlyFans pays the performers their share, giving power back to the pornstars.</p>

<p>OnlyFans is actually an even better business model than Airbnb or Uber.
As the owner of a rental property, or a gig taxi driver, I can only cater to one group of people at any one time.
But as an OnlyFans creator, I can broadcast content to the multitude all at once.
Making money on Airbnb or Uber is linear — I always have to do one more ride, or host one more visit.
On OnlyFans it’s multiplicative — the same selfie can serve 10 adoring fans or 1000.</p>

<p>If you have minimal shame, a drooling audience and are willing to get your togs off its a pretty sweet deal: Creators can make millions of dollars a year just posting photos and videos.</p>

<p>Since they take a share of their revenues, what is good for creators is good for OnlyFans themselves. And by the looks of recent trends, business has been very good indeed.</p>

<p>OnlyFans have benefited massively from the coronavirus crisis. Search activity has doubled since the lockdown, and according to Alexa, their traffic has surged.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.xsrus.com/images/writing/onlyfans/trends.png" alt="Google trends" width="600"></p>

<p><em>Source: Google Trends</em></p>

<p>Even before the pandemic they were growing rapidly. They paid <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10354575/filing-history">£641k corporation tax in 2018</a>, which at an effective tax rate of 15% implies 2018 revenues of around £4m, or $5.5m.
Today in 2020, their top users alone make this much money through their site.</p>

<p>With a couple of assumptions, it’s easy to estimate their yearly revenue today. And oh god is it big.</p>

<p>In 2019, <a href="https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/wa-model-jem-wolfie-breaks-social-media-makes-millions-on-onlyfans-ng-b881158181z">they had over 60,000 content creators and 7m registered users</a>.
Extrapolating from the Google growth trends, it’s safe to say they have at least 10m users today. I calculated the average revenue per creator per month (about $250) and the average subscription fee (about $8.7) from my scraped data. Applying the 20% commission and assuming only half the users and creators are active, we end up with a lower bound of $90m, and an upper bound of $104m.</p>

<p>That’s an annual growth rate of between 304% and 334%. Absolute nuts.</p>

<p>But how much are they worth? According to this article, OnlyFans takes home 60% of their revenue net of processing and fees.
This means they make profits between $54m and $62m.
Since the business really doesn’t have to do anything besides host the platform, collect fees, and store content securely, its probably worthy of an EBIT multiple of around 15x.
This gives a total valuation of between $810m and $936m.</p>

<p>Who knew you could make so much money hosting nudes? The crazy thing is that this valuation is probably still too low.
The estimate of the number of users is likely too conservative – <a href="https://www.1843magazine.com/people/onlyfans-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-topless-creator">The Economist has it at 12m</a>.
Also, it doesn’t take into account their recent surge in traffic, nor the likely sustained increase in traffic due to social distancing (See if you can work out why).</p>

<p>There are risks too. In any business that sells exclusivity, security is paramount. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/884dgx/onlyfans-leak-isnt-anything-new">Apparently</a> there was a big leak in February, but the company denies this.</p>

<p>Risks aside, OnlyFans is a stunningly good business. But for a company which claims to democratise paid content, its amazing how unequal it is.</p>

<h2 id="almost-all-money-is-made-by-the-top-creators">Almost all money is made by the top creators</h2>

<p>This is a histogram of the monthly revenue per OnlyFans account from the set that I scraped. <a href="https://www.xsrus.com/writing/posts/power-laws-school">Remind you of anything</a>?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.xsrus.com/images/writing/onlyfans/rev_hist.png" alt="Revenue histogram" width="500"></p>

<p>The revenue of content creators follows a classic power law distribution. The top accounts make something like $100,000 a month (these aren’t in my sample).
The median account makes $180 a month.</p>

<p>The top 1% of accounts make 33% of all the money. The top 10% of accounts make 73% of all the money.
This isn’t the 80:20 rule; it’s the 80:14 rule.</p>

<p>The standard way to measure inequality of an economy is with a Gini Index. An index of 0 implies a communist utopia, a value of 1 implies a single greedy capitalist owns all the wealth.
The Gini index of OnlyFans is 0.83. The most unequal society in the world, South Africa, has a Gini index of 0.68. OnlyFans is less equal than an ex-apartheid state.</p>

<p>OnlyFans is so unequal because chancers make accounts with zero fans, while big Instagram stars take their following with them. A large proportion of accounts have no fans at all, and the lion’s share of fans are shared by the top accounts.</p>

<h2 id="most-creators-probably-lose-money">Most creators probably lose money</h2>

<p>Being an independent explicit online content creator is by <a href="https://www.1843magazine.com/people/onlyfans-a-day-in-the-life-of-a-topless-creator">many</a> <a href="https://extra.ie/2020/02/15/news/real-life/onlyfans-risks-creators-sex-work">accounts</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/neagv8/only-fans-sex-worker-interview">exhausting</a>.
Your “fans” are not merely fans, they’re paying customers. To keep that sweet money flowing into their bank accounts, content creators often have to work harder and harder to satisfy their patrons.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.xsrus.com/images/writing/onlyfans/rev_hist_low.png" alt="Bottom 50% revenue histogram" width="500"></p>

<p>Most accounts take home less than $145 per month (after commission). The modal revenue is $0.00, and the next most common is $4.99.</p>

<p>Creators put hours into each post, and on top of that, they interact one-on-one, with fans who can message them at any time.
To break even on an OnlyFans account, creators need to earn more per month than the cost of hours spent engaging.
The median take-home revenue is $136 per month. If you value a creator’s time at a $15 minimum wage, the median creator needs to be spending less than 9 hours per month on her OnlyFans to break even.
This is less than 20 minutes a day.</p>

<p>Fans expect regular, prompt engagement, and many creators compare OnlyFans to running a business.
It seems unlikely that you could satisfy all your fans demands in less time than it takes to make and eat breakfast.</p>

<p>Relative to effort, it looks like most accounts lose money.</p>

<p>For this reason, unless you already have a large following from somewhere like Instagram or Twitch, making an OnlyFans is unlikely to be worth the effort.</p>

<p>I’d invest my money in OnlyFans, but not my time. Sorry would-be fans, you’ll have to get your kicks elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="addendum-getting-the-tip">Addendum: Getting the tip</h3>

<p>One important thing this analysis of public data misses is tipping. A substantial proportion of the top accounts’ revenue comes from
tips – money which fans send directly to creators for private messages or photos. Unfortunately, tipping amounts aren’t published by onlyfans so there’s a lot I don’t know about it.</p>

<p>I do know it can be very lucrative – some accounts request minimum hundreds of dollars per tip.
Unlike posting public photos though, tipping doesn’t scale – you have to make every individual fan feel special. If you’re a large account and can charge hundreds per tip its easy money,
but if you’re just starting out, tips make it harder, not easier, to attain a sustainable income because they require more work.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="how-i-did-it">How I did it</h2>

<p>First I emailed them to ask if I could see their aggregate level data. They sent me this reply.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.xsrus.com/images/writing/onlyfans/email.png" alt="Onlyfans email" width="600"></p>

<p>Thanks Vlad. So I tried scraping their site instead.</p>

<p>I quickly learned that scraping OnlyFans is very difficult. This is not surprising — security is central to their business model. If you could scrape the images or videos off their platform, they wouldn’t have a business. I tried using Selenium and Beautiful Soup but neither one worked for me. So I used Sikuli instead.</p>

<p><a href="http://sikulix.com/">Sikuli</a> is a graphical user interface automation tool. It allows you to write scripts that mimic the behaviour of a real person — the computer physically moves the mouse to click on things, and types letters one by one into the search bar, just like you would. This means your script can “trick” websites into thinking you’re a real person, so they won’t block you. A disadvantage of Sikuli is it requires your entire machine to function. Like an AI villain in a sci-fi movie, the computer literally takes control of your keyboard and mouse, so you can’t do anything while its running. It also takes much longer than a conventional web scraper.</p>

<p>I used a Chrome plugin to get leaf urls from the root OnlyFans site. Then I ran the Sikuli script a couple of times overnight with a VPN randomiser, so the site wouldn’t block my real IP address. OnlyFans have a Javascript waiting page which …</p></section></div>

  <p>
    Hey, this is a quick introduction on how our app can help inside Slack. With this app, you can
  </p>

  <div>
    
    
    <p>
    As you have seen, you can choose a message, use our custom message action <b> Turn this message into</b> to attach a form to it, and turn it into a task, request, ticket, or whatever, then you can send it to a channel, assign it to a team member, and track its state.
    </p>
    <p>
    Wait, where does the form come from? It's created in our web app. You can do it after you add our app to your Slack workspace and get your Contalist account created.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    
    

    <p>
    To find John Smith, just type something like <b>/contalist john smith</b>. We will show the contact information to you, then you can edit his data or click the phone number to make a call.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can create forms to store more information about your contacts, for example profile, membership data, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add a new contact, use command <b>/contalist +</b>, and click the Contact button in the popup.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>
      Let's get started
    </h2>
    <p>
      Please click this <b>Add to Slack</b> button to install this app to your workspace. ( We will also create a Contalist account for you )
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=418365206418.1069360327878&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.contalist.com%2Fslack%2Fapp%2Finstall&amp;scope=commands%2Cchat%3Awrite&amp;state=rAUjmbcEaysatnzAWeIrOHm8hEnIPicrMO_eDD014QYJIEX3SMHp2LyTvJ9Esmh6smZu_4iqMYV3wL_IoP64Jl36skrhUAYGPNV0HK3tf3SsbCDycIurEs375kbJ95UxH2O4t7xxgvKqwgmE1UX1DkouFcZmrRY06MI2qYZ1Gv9fhGP_KHwEQYpJRUXxJVTQacxv2M5n6AbNMqbZZTpTLkNZ5UR0eAyQ8qxCjJ-1T6ymmw2rdvfL.WWMuw87d9X99WlVyC7KOsg.O1AFDwDQIDU&amp;user_scope=identity.basic%2Cidentity.email" target="_blank"><img alt="Add to Slack" height="40" width="139" src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png" srcset="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x"></a>
    </p>
    <p>
    Before trying with your message, <b>make sure our app has been added into the channel</b>. You can do it with command <i>/invite @Contalist</i>, otherwise our app will not be able to put messages into your channel. Now you can start to make your messages actionable.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a team member want to update the message or assign it to himself, he will need to create his Contalist account first. When he tries to make an update, we will send him a message with a sign up link.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>
      Q &amp; A
    </h3>
    <div>
      <h4>1. How to create a custom form?</h4>
      <p>
        A custom form is a group of custom fields. They are created at <a href="https://app.contalist.com/settings/custom-forms" target="_blank">the settings page</a> in our web app. It's quite simple, you can have a look at the example forms automatically created for you when your account was created.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        <i></i> NOTE
        <br>
        Custom field types are limited to text, selection and date in Slack. Although in our web app it's possible to create custom field for phone numbers, URL, numbers, they will become text field in Slack. Please aware of this.        <br>
        The only exception is <b>Contact</b>. You can create a custom field of Contact type, then in Slack you can search for a contact ( that is a contact stored in our app, not some team member in Slack ) and set him/her into the custom field.
      </p>
      <p>
      <i></i> Emojis are available!
      <br>
      As you can see in the first video, just like when editing a message, you can use shortcode like :fire: in option texts to show <img src="https://contalist.com/images/emoji-fire.png">
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>2. When updating a message's state, why do I get 'No state has been set'?</h4>
      <p>
        You need to set the states, for example New, Working in progress, when creating the form. Simply type the states into the State textbox in the custom form page, separate the states by newline. Then the states will be available in Slack.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

This means that US companies operating in the EU no longer enjoy the automatic right to transfer EU citizens’ data into the US. The fundamental reason is a conflict between the EU’s strong data protection rights (à la </span><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/"><span>GDPR</span></a><span>) and the US’s strong national security needs. While Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) were still ruled valid, the Schrems II ruling sent cross-Atlantic cloud computing into long-term uncertainty: Will EU data eventually need to stay inside the EU’s border, perhaps even under EU judicial control?</span></p><p><span>These issues are not new to our customers. Even before Schrems II, national sentiments required some of our customers to keep data within a certain country. Others made it a Unique Selling Point (USP) to outperform required regulation and keep data geographically close to their users. Moreover, some healthcare companies need to run their application both on-premise and as a SaaS, depending on their evaluation of shared responsibility. </span><b>These use-cases highlight the need for a cloud-agnostic or even multi-cloud strategy.</b></p><h2>How can Kubernetes help?</h2><p><span>Kubernetes and Cloud Native technologies promise to decouple the underlying infrastructure from the application. Thus, it should be trivial to move a Cloud Native application between public clouds to private clouds or even bare-metal servers.</span></p><blockquote><p><i><span>“Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds.” (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)</span></i></p></blockquote><p><span>However, this application-side simplicity pushes the complexity of dealing with the infrastructure onto Kubernetes in two ways. First, under the hood, Kubernetes needs to be packaged and configured with a specific </span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/cloud-providers/"><span>cloud provider</span></a><span>, a component that abstracting away the underlying infrastructure, e.g., how to mount a Persistent Volume. Second, as the saying goes, “Kubernetes is a powerful engine, but you still need to build a car around it”. Each major cloud provider, such as AWS, Google or Azure, provides their own Kubernetes distribution. Said distribution is tightly integrated with the provider’s identity access management, container registry and logging solution. Other Kubernetes distributions are slightly less coupled to provider-specific services, but are still focused on major US cloud providers.</span></p><h2>So does staying in the EU mean no Kubernetes?</h2><p><span>Of course not! Kubernetes can be configured not only to run on private clouds built on top of OpenStack, CloudStack or VMware, but also on bare-metal servers. Provider-specific services can be replaced with open-source solutions, such as </span><a href="https://github.com/dexidp"><span>Dex</span></a><span> for identity management, </span><a href="https://www.elastic.co/"><span>Elasticsearch</span></a><span> for logging, </span><a href="https://prometheus.io/"><span>Prometheus</span></a><span> for metrics and alerting, and </span><a href="https://goharbor.io/"><span>Harbor</span></a><span> for container registry.</span></p><p><span>Carefully integrating all these components can lead to a Kubernetes setup that is truly cloud agnostic. The engineering team gets the same experience, no matter if the application runs on a big US cloud provider or on a quality EU cloud provider. Even if the current plan is to run in a single cloud, a cloud agnostic strategy reduces uncertainty, by facilitating a future migration to a different cloud provider or a future multi-cloud setup.</span></p><p><span>With even more care, the Kubernetes setup can pass stringent requirements of regulated industries, such as healthcare. For example, Harbor can be configured with integrated image vulnerability scanning. OpenPolicyAgent can be added to enforce policies, such as container images should only be downloaded from the local Harbor. Finally, Elasticsearch can run in a separate environment for tamper-proof logging.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Unfortunately, doing all these from scratch can become a time consuming and costly adventure.</span></p><h2>Compliant Kubernetes</h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison.png" alt="" width="2584" height="1463" srcset="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison.png 2584w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison-300x170.png 300w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison-1024x580.png 1024w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison-1536x870.png 1536w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Compliant-Kubernetes-stack-comparison-2048x1160.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2584px) 100vw, 2584px"></p><p><span>To help our customers run their application effortlessly across multiple clouds, Elastisys developed Compliant Kubernetes. The distribution supports multiple cloud providers, including AWS, GCP, OpenStack and CloudStack, with Azure and VMware to come. It also comes fully equipped with identity, tamper-proof logging, vulnerability scanning and backups. Together with many other features, it significantly reduces the compliance burden for regulations, such as GDPR and HIPAA.</span></p><p><span>Compliant Kubernetes is available as open source software, with Elastisys providing support. In addition, Elastisys partnered with many EU cloud providers, such as </span><a href="https://www.exoscale.com/"><span>Exoscale</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.safespring.com/"><span>SafeSpring</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://citycloud.com/"><span>CityCloud</span></a><span>, to offer Compliant Kubernetes as a managed service. A managed service is desirable for allowing in-house resources to focus on core business development.</span></p><p><span>In brief, Compliant Kubernetes is a single Kubernetes distribution that allows the same application to run in multiple clouds. A multi-cloud or cloud-agnostic strategy is an effective solution for uncertainty around the future implications of Schrems II, and the fall of PrivacyShield.</span></p><p><a href="https://elastisys.com/contact-form/">Contact us</a> to find out more!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

</p><p>Prof.&nbsp;Akiyoshi Kitaoka makes images using the so-called “Popple illusion”. Using phase-shifted Gabor patches, these illusions cause your visual system to misinterpret concentric circles as non-concentric or even as spirals.</p><p>I love research papers that use illusions to reverse engineer our visual system. It’s cool to think that, as recently as the year 2000, we’re finding new and intriguing visual illusions that teach us something about our brain.

It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages.</blockquote>

So, their functioning may be considered a bit unorthodox taking into account the present technology available.</p><p>While this is not the first parallel system analysed for <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/">this series</a>, its design is very different from the rest. For instance, we are not talking about the ‘experimental’ master-slave configuration that the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/sega-saturn/">Saturn</a> debuted or the ‘co-processor’ approach found on the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/">PS1</a> or <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/nintendo-64/">N64</a>. The Nintendo DS includes two very independent computers that will perform exclusive operations, each one having a dedicated bus. This co-dependency will condition the overall performance of this console.</p><p>That being said, let’s take a look now at the two CPUs:</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-arm7tdmi">ARM7TDMI</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-arm946e-s">ARM946E-S</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-arm7tdmi"><h4>ARM7TDMI</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm7_core.8a9851c20df1dda3c252ae75f544a8ce7a6749026fa4bc870027741cda1003b4.png"><picture>

It still includes all its original features (especially <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/game-boy-advance/#whats-new">Thumb</a>).</p><p>Now for the changes: Because Nintendo’s engineers placed the ARM7 next to most of the I/O ports, this CPU will be tasked with arbitrating and assisting I/O operations. In fact, no other processor can directly connect to the I/O. As you can see, this is not the ‘main’ processor that will be in charge of the system, but rather the ‘sub-processor’ offloading the main CPU by passing data around many components.</p></div><div id="tab-1-2-arm946e-s"><h4>ARM946E-S</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/arm9_core.213329ca27287083c84d30b27fb9da63edd81998406a10b9ee7289089d0fe94d.png"><picture>

If you ignore the ill-fated ARM8 series, you could say the ARM946E-S is the ‘next-gen’ version of the ARM7. Part of the <strong>ARM9 series</strong>, this core in particular not only inherits all the features of the <strong>ARM7TDMI</strong> but also includes some additional bits:</p><ul><li>The <strong>ARMv5TE ISA</strong>: Compared to the previous v4, features some new instructions and a faster multiplier.<ul><li>If you take a look at the core name, the letter ‘E’ means <strong>Enhanced DSP</strong> which implies that lots of these new instructions have to do with applications for signal processing.</li></ul></li><li><strong>5-stage Pipeline</strong>: This is another increment from the previous 3-stage pipeline.</li><li><strong>12 KB of L1 Cache</strong>: The core now features cache, where 8 KB are allocated for instructions and 4 KB for data.</li><li><strong>48 KB of Tightly-Coupled Memory</strong> or ‘TCM’: Similar to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation/#cpu">Scratchpad memory</a>, however this one discriminates between instructions (32 KB) and data (16 KB).</li></ul><p>Nintendo also added the following components around it:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Divisor and Square root unit</strong> to speed up these type of operations (the ARM9 by itself is not capable of performing this type of math).</li><li>A <strong>Direct Memory Access Controller</strong>: Accelerates memory transfers without depending on the CPU. Combined with the use of cache, both CPU and DMA can potentially work concurrently.<ul><li>Cache and DMA can provide a lot of performance but also create new problems, such as data integrity. So programmers will have to manually maintain memory consistency by flushing the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/playstation-2/#preventing-past-mishaps">write-buffer</a> before triggering DMA, for instance.</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div><p>I guess with hardware like this, it’s easy to figure out the <em>real</em> reason kids loved this console, eh?</p><h4 id="interconnection">Interconnection</h4><p>So far I’ve talked about how the two CPUs work individually. But to work as a whole, they require to co-operate constantly. To accomplish this, both CPUs directly ‘talk’ to each other using a dedicated <strong>FIFO unit</strong>, this block of data holds two 64-byte queues (up to 16 elements) for <strong>bi-directional communication</strong>.</p><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/fifo.4c452b5f9236fb1e98454d2f90d2cab902ee4c561e165e8eaf8a8fc0cd7a05f4.png"><picture>

Alternatively, an <strong>interrupt unit</strong> can be activated to notify the receiver whenever there’s a new value in the queue.</p><h4 id="main-memory">Main memory</h4><p>Just like its predecessor, RAM is spread around many different locations, enabling to prioritise data placement by speed of access. In summary, we have the following general-purpose memory available:</p><div><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/nintendods/cpu/ram.99e9bd12e464182ef51ea4aa89a7fc60323a46a72550afbacd737957372cf190.png"><picture>

Therefore, behaving like SRAM (the faster, but more expensive alternative to DRAM). This design reminds me of <a href="https://www.copetti.org/projects/consoles/gamecube/#clever-memory-system">1T‑SRAM</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></div><h4 id="backwards-compatibility">Backwards compatibility</h4><p>Even though the architecture is significantly different from its predecessor, it still managed to maintain the critical bits that would grant it native compatibility with GameBoy Advance games.</p><p>But for the DS to revert to an ‘internal’ GBA, the former includes a set of software routines that set the console in <strong>AGB Compatibility Mode</strong>. In doing so, it effectively halts the ARM9, disables most of the ‘special’ hardware, redirects the buses, puts the ARM7 in charge and slows it down at 16.78 MHz. Finally, the ARM7 proceeds to boot the original AGB BIOS which bootstraps the GamePak cartridge (just like an original GameBoy Advance). This mode still exhibits some features not found in the original console, such as displaying the game with black margins (we’ll see in the next section that the new screen resolution happens to be bigger). Moreover, since the DS has two screens, users can set which screen will be used to display the GBA game.</p><p>Once in GBA mode <strong>there’s no going back</strong>, the console must be reset to re-activate the rest of the hardware.</p><h4 id="secrets-and-limitations">Secrets and limitations</h4><p>With so many sophisticated components fitted in a single and inexpensive chip, it’s no mystery that some issues emerged due to the way they were forced to work with each other.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-2-1-unused-power-link"><a href="#tab-2-1-unused-power">Unused Power</a></li><li id="tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice-link"><a href="#tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice">A question about the hardware choice</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-2-1-unused-power"><h4>Unused Power</h4><p>Sometimes I wonder how Nintendo planned the way the two CPU’s would be used, and if they already assumed some performance would be hit by the design they chose.</p><p>Let me start with the ARM9, this CPU runs at twice the speed of the ARM7, but most (if not all) of the I/O depends on the ARM7, so the ARM9 is vulnerable to excessive stalling until the ARM7 answers. If that wasn’t enough, <strong>ARM9’s external bus runs at half the speed</strong>, so there are a few bottlenecks identified.</p><p>Additionally, the Main Memory bus is only <strong>16-bit wide</strong>. Thus, whenever any CPU needs to fetch a word (32-bit wide) from memory, the interface <strong>stalls the CPU</strong> (up to 3 ‘wait’ cycles) until a full world is reconstructed. The worst impact happens when memory access is not sequential, which makes it stall for every single access. This issue will also arise when instructions are fetched (unfortunately, ARM didn’t support sequential opcode fetching back then) which, to my dismay, also affects Thumb code (since every 16-bit fetch is done as a 32-bit block). On the other hand, this penalty (as some sources call it) can be alleviated by making full use of cache and TCM.</p><p>All in all, this means that in the worst case, the ‘whooping’ ARM9’s 66 MHz horsepower is practically reduced to a mere ~8&nbsp;MHz. That is if the program makes an abysmal use of cache/TCM.</p></div><div id="tab-2-2-a-question-about-the-hardware-choice"><h4>A question about the hardware choice</h4><p>Back when I read about the CPU of the GameBoy Advance, I was really surprised by the potential of the ARM7: The CPU not only performed its designated tasks, but could also assist with others, such as providing audio sequencing or pseudo-3D graphics.</p><p>Now, during the commercialisation ARM7, ARM Holdings joined forces with DEC to design a high-end version of ARM’s chips. For this, DEC grabbed the datapath design of their processor, <strong>Alpha</strong>, and mixed it with ARM’s. The result was a new series of CPUs called <strong>StrongARM</strong> which was surprisingly <em>fast</em>. At the expense of removing certain features (Thumb and debug), DEC managed to cross the megahertz threshold by reaching speeds of up to 233 MHz. As a normal user prepared to buy a new ARM PC (let’s say a <em>RiscPC</em>), you could either choose one with the old ARM710 at 40 MHz or another one with a StrongARM running ~582% faster. The impact of StrongARM was so disruptive that ARM Holdings absorbed some of StrongARMs features to produce their next line of CPUs, starting with ARM9. And the rest is history.</p><p>But here’s where my question resides: Considering the new developments in the ARM world, why did Nintendo ultimately choose an awfully slow ARM9 combined by an even slower ARM7, instead of a faster ARM9 (or even a StrongARM)? To give you an idea, other companies like Apple just adopted the StrongARM with their Newton PDA line.</p><p>I don’t mean to criticise Nintendo’s choice, but I believe the amount of emerging technology was just too great for me to ignore. I guess their choice was done in an effort to preserve battery life and maintain production costs (by using the same CPU found in the GBA).</p></div></div></div><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>This section is a bit unusual because not only this console has multiple screens to draw, but also a combination of traditional tile engines working …</p></div></div></div>

engagement, having a click rate that is <a href="https://blog.e-goi.com/infographic-push-notification">7 times higher than that of email marketing</a>.
But be careful not to send too many irrelevant notifications. As <a href="https://uplandsoftware.com/localytics/resources/blog/the-inside-view-how-consumers-really-feel-about-push-notifications/">this report shows</a>,
50% of app users find push notifications annoying.</p><p>With that being said, in this tutorial, I'll show you how to create your own web push notifications,
using <strong>your own backend with NodeJS and TypeScript</strong>, and vanilla <strong>JavaScript on the frontend</strong>.</p><p>I'll go through all the steps you need to take to set up the backend and frontend, but you can skip those parts of course if you're

</span></p><p>Web push notifications are notifications that the user receives through the browser. These notifications were previously exclusive to native
web and desktop applications, but can now be used by websites as well.</p><p>To receive a web push notification, the user doesn't need to have the browser or the website open, thanks to the
<a href="https://felixgerschau.com/service-workers-explained-introduction-javascript-api">service worker technology</a>, which is an important part of Progressive Web Apps.</p><h2 id="the-technology-behind-web-push-notifications"><a href="#the-technology-behind-web-push-notifications" aria-label="the technology behind web push notifications permalink"></a>The technology behind web push notifications</h2><p>As the name already gives away, web push notifications are a combination of <strong>web push</strong> and <strong>notifications</strong>.
You also need to have an active <a href="https://felixgerschau.com/service-workers-explained-introduction-javascript-api/">service worker</a> to make this work.</p><h3 id="notification-api"><a href="#notification-api" aria-label="notification api permalink"></a>Notification API</h3><p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification">notification API</a> enables websites to show push notifications
to the user. You can use this in isolation without the push API if you want to display notifications while the user is browsing your site.</p><p>You can display a notification with the following code:</p><div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>'Notification'</span> <span>in</span> window<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>window<span>.</span>Notification<span>.</span>permission <span>===</span> <span>'granted'</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

is not open. We can use this API to receive messages and then display them, using the notification API.</p><p>This API is only available through service workers, which allow code to be executed in the background when the app is not open. I'll explain how
to set up a service worker for push notifications in the tutorial, but in case you want to learn more about them, I wrote

supposed to show up even when the user isn't browsing our website.</p><h3 id="browser-vendors-the-middlemen-for-sending-out-push-messages"><a href="#browser-vendors-the-middlemen-for-sending-out-push-messages" aria-label="browser vendors the middlemen for sending out push messages permalink"></a>Browser vendors: The middlemen for sending out push messages</h3><blockquote><p>Thanks <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Chaphasilor/">/Chaphasilor</a> for pointing out that I was missing this!</p></blockquote><p>We need to have our own server for storing and sending out push notifications, but our server can't send the push messages directly to all clients.</p><p>Instead, browsers that support web push notifications offer <strong>push services</strong>, which are completely free of charge. The <em>subscription</em> object that we will send
to our backend will contain an <em>endpoint</em> field, which points to the URL of the corresponding vendor.</p><p>You can read more about browser vendors in the docs of <a href="https://mozilla-push-service.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Mozilla</a> (autopush) and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging">Chrome</a> (Firebase Cloud Messaging).</p><p>We'll use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-push">web-push</a> package that handles the communication to those vendors for us.</p><h2 id="tutorial"><a href="#tutorial" aria-label="tutorial permalink"></a>Tutorial</h2><p>Let's see how this works in practice. As part of the tutorial, we'll write a full-stack application with a simple JavaScript client that
can subscribe or unsubscribe from push notifications. The frontend will also be able to trigger a notification that will be sent to all subscribed
clients.</p><blockquote><p><em>If you want to see the final application code, I uploaded it to this <a href="https://github.com/fgerschau/web-push-notification-example">GitHub repository</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
    <main role="main">

        
        
<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-0/header.png">
</p>

<p>
The way I was taught x86 assembly at the university had been completely outdated for many years by the time I had my first class. It was around 2008 or 2009, and 64-bit processors had already started becoming a thing even in my neck of the woods. Meanwhile, we were doing DOS, real-mode, memory segmentation and all the other stuff from the bad old days.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I picked up enough of it during the classes (and over the subsequent years) to be able to understand the stuff coming out of the other end of a compiler, and that has helped me a few times. However, I've never manually written any substantial amount of x86 assembly for something non-trivial. Due to being locked up inside (on account of a global pandemic), I decided to change that situation, to pass the time.
</p>

<p>
I wanted to focus on x86-64 specifically, and completely forget/skip any and all legacy crap that is no longer relevant for this architecture. After getting a bit deeper into it, I also decided to publish my notes in the form of tutorials on this blog since there seems to be a desire for this type of content.
</p>

<p>
Everything I write in these posts will be a normal, 64-bit, Windows program. We'll be using Windows because that is the OS I'm running on all of my non-work machines, and when you drop down to the level of writing assembly it starts becoming incresingly impossible to ignore the operating system you're running on. I will also try to go as "from scratch" as possible - no libraries, we're only allowed to call out to the operating system and that's it.
</p>

<p>
In this first, introductory part (yeah, I'm planning a series and I know I will regret this later), I will talk about the tools we will need, show how to use them, explain how I generally think about programming in assembly and show how to write what is perhaps the smallest viable Windows program.
</p>

<h2>Getting the Tools</h2>
<p>There are two main tools that we will use throughout this series.</p>

<h3>Assembler</h3>

<p>
CPUs execute machine code - an efficient representation of instructions for the processor that is almost completely impenetrable to humans. The assembly language is a human-readable representation of it. A program that converts this symbolic representation into machine code ready to be executed by a CPU is called an <b>assembler</b>.
</p>

<p>
There is no single, agreed-upon standard for x86-64 assembly language. There are many assemblers out there, and even though some of them share a great deal of similarities, each has its own set of features and quirks. It is therefore important which assembler you choose. In this series, we will be using 
<a href="http://flatassembler.net/">Flat Assembler</a> (or FASM for short). I like it because it's small, easy to obtain and use, has a nice macro system and comes with a handy little editor.</p>

<h3>Debugger</h3>

<p>
Another important tool is the debugger. We'll use it to examine the state of our programs. While I'm pretty sure it's possible to use Visual Studio's integrated debugger for this, I think a standalone debugger is better when all you want to do is look at the disassembly, memory and registers. I've always used <a href="http://ollydbg.de/">OllyDbg</a> for stuff like that, but unfortunately it does not have a 64-bit version. Therefore we will be using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windbg-preview/9pgjgd53tn86?activetab=pivot:overviewtab">WinDbg</a>. The version linked here is a revamp of this venerable tool with a slightly nicer interface. Alternatively, you can get the non-Windows-store version <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/debugger-download-tools">here</a> as part of the Windows 10 SDK. Just make sure you deselect everything else besides WinDbg during installation. For our purposes, the two versions are mostly interchangeable.
</p>

<h2>Thinking in Assembly</h2>

<p>
Now that we have our tools, I want to spend a bit of time to discuss some basics. For the purpose of these tutorials I'm assuming some knowledge of languages like C or C++, but little or no previous exposure to assembly, therefore many readers will find this stuff familiar.
</p>
<h3>A 10000-foot view</h3>
<p>
CPUs only "know" how to do a fixed number of certain things. When you hear someone talk about an "instruction set", they're referring to the set of things a particular CPU has been designed to do, and the term "instruction" just means "one of the things a CPU can do". Most instructions are parameterized in one way or another, and they're generally really simple. Usually an instruction is somthing along the lines of "write a given 8-bit value to a given location in memory", or "interpreting the values from registers A and B as 16-bit signed integers, multiply them and record the result into register A".
</p>

<p>
Below is a simple mental model of the architecture that we'll start with.
</p>

<p><img src="https://gpfault.net/assets/post-img/asm-tut-0/diag0.png">
</p>

<p>
 This skips a <i>ton</i> of things (there can be more than one core executing instructions and reading/writing memory, there's different levels of cache, etc. etc.), but should serve as a good starting point.
</p>

<p>
 To be effective at low-level programming or debugging you need to understand that every high-level concept eventually maps to this low-level model, and learning how the mapping works will help you.
</p>

<h3>Registers</h3>
<p>
 You can think of <b>registers</b> as a special kind of memory built right into the CPU that is very small, but extremely fast to access. There are many different kinds of registers in x86-64, and for now we'll concern ourselves only with the so-called <i>general-purpose</i> registers, of which there are sixteen. Each of them is 64 bits wide, and for each of them the lower byte, word and double-word can be addressed individually (incidentally, 1 "word" = 2 bytes, 1 "double-word" = 4 bytes, in case you haven't heard this terminology before).
 </p>
 
 <table>
 <tbody><tr>
  <td><b>Register</b></td>
  <td><b>Lower byte</b></td>
  <td><b>Lower word</b></td>
  <td><b>Lower dword</b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rax</td> <td>al</td> <td>ax</td> <td>eax</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rbx</td> <td>bl</td> <td>bx</td> <td>ebx</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rcx</td> <td>cl</td> <td>cx</td> <td>ecx</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rdx</td> <td>dl</td> <td>dx</td> <td>edx</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rsp</td> <td>spl</td> <td>sp</td> <td>esp</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rsi</td> <td>sil</td> <td>si</td> <td>esi</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rdi</td> <td>dil</td> <td>di</td> <td>edi</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>rbp</td> <td>bpl</td> <td>bp</td> <td>ebp</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r8</td> <td>r8b</td> <td>r8w</td> <td>r8d</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r9</td> <td>r9b</td> <td>r9w</td> <td>r9d</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r10</td> <td>r10b</td> <td>r10w</td> <td>r10d</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r11</td> <td>r11b</td> <td>r11w</td> <td>r11d</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>r12</td> <td>r12b</td> <td>r12w</td> <td>r12d</td>
 </tr> 
 <tr>
  <td>r13</td> <td>r13b</td> <td>r13w</td> <td>r13d</td>
 </tr> 
 <tr>
  <td>r14</td> <td>r14b</td> <td>r14w</td> <td>r14d</td>
 </tr> 
 <tr>
  <td>r15</td> <td>r15b</td> <td>r15w</td> <td>r15d</td>
 </tr>   
</tbody></table>  

<p>Additionally, the higher 8 bits of <code>rax</code>, <code>rbx</code>, <code>rcx</code> and <code>rdx</code> can be referred to as <code>ah</code>, <code>bh</code>, <code>ch</code> and <code>dh</code>.</p>

<p>
Note that even though I said those were "general-purpose" registers, some instructions can only be used with certain registers, and some registers have special meaning for certain instructions. In particular, <code>rsp</code> holds the stack pointer (which is used by instructions like <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>call</code> and <code>ret</code>), and <code>rsi</code> and <code>rdi</code> serve as source and destination index for "string manipulation" instructions. Another example where certain registers get "special treatment" are the multiplication instructions, which require one of the multiplier values to be in the register <code>rax</code>, and write the result into the pair of registers <code>rax</code> and <code>rdx</code>.
</p>

<p>
In addition to these registers, we will also consider the special registers <code>rip</code> and <code>rflags</code>. <code>rip</code> holds the address of the next instruction to execute. It is modified by control flow instructions like <code>call</code> or <code>jmp</code>. <code>rflags</code> holds a bunch of binary flags indicating various aspects of the program's state, such as whether the result of the last arithmetic operation was less, equal or greater than zero. The behavior of many instructions depends on those flags, and many instructions update certain flags as part of their execution. The flags register can also be read and written "wholesale" using special instructions.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot more registers on x86-64. Most of them are used for SIMD or floating-point instructions, and we'll not be considering them in this series.
</p>

<h3>Memory and Addresses</h3>

<p>
You can think of memory as a large array of byte-sized "cells", numbered starting at 0. We'll call these numbers "memory addresses". Simple, right?
</p>
<p>
Well... addressing memory used to be rather annoying back in the old days. You see, registers in old x86 processors used to be only 16-bit wide. Sixteen bits is enough to address 64 kilobytes worth of memory, but not more. The hardware was actually capable of using addresses as wide as 20 bits, but you had put a "base" address into a special segment register, and instructions that read or wrote memory would use a 16-bit offset into that segment to obtain the final 20-bit "linear" address. There were separate segment registers for code, data and stack portions (and a few more "extra" ones), and segments could overlap. 
</p>
<p>
In x86-64 these concerns are non-existant. The segment registers for code, data and stack are still present, and they're loaded with some special values, but as a user-space programmer you needn't concern yourself with them. For all intents and purposes you can assume that all segments start at 0 and extend for the entire addressable length of memory. So, as far as we're concerned, on x86-64 our programs see memory as a "flat" contiguous array of bytes, with sequential addresses, starting at 0, just like we said in the beginning of this section...
</p>
<p>
Okay, I may have distorted the truth a little bit. Things aren't quite as simple. While it is true that on 64-bit Windows your programs see memory as a flat contiguous array of bytes with addresses starting at 0, it is actually an elaborate illusion maintained by the OS and CPU working together.
</p>
<p>
The truth is, if you were really able to read and write any byte in memory willy-nilly, you'd stomp all over other programs' code and data (something that indeed could happen in the Bad Old Days). To prevent that, special protection mechanisms exist. I won't get too deep into their inner workings here because this stuff matters mostly for OS developers. Nevertheless, here's a very short overview:
</p>
<p>
Each process gets a "flat" address space as described above (we'll call it the "virtual address space"). For each process, the OS sets up a <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Paging">mapping</a> between its virtual addresses and actual physical addresses in memory. This mapping is respected by the hardware: the "virtual" addresses get translated to physical addresses dynamically at runtime. Thus, the same address (e.g. 0x410F119C) can map to two different locations in physical memory for two different processes. This, in a nutshell, is how the separation between processes in enforced.
</p>

<p>
The final thing I want to invite your attention to here is how the instructions and data which they operate on are held in the same …</p></main></div></div>

                    <p>Raspberry Pi and other single-board computers (SBCs) have always had minimal memory. At a maximum of 1GB in the <em>Raspberry Pi 3</em>, it was just sufficient to run lightweight programs and scripts. That trend held until the advent of the <em>Raspberry Pi 4</em> with <em>2GB</em>, <em>4GB</em> and a few months later, <em>8GB</em> models, opening doors to running databases and other memory intensive applications.</p><p>This shift is due in no small part to the explosive growth of the data industry, where previously the focus of SBCs was IoT and embedded applications and now the focus is slowly shifting towards data applications. Memory has also become cheaper over the years, allowing newer SBCs to have more memory while maintaining a similar price range.</p><h2 id="my-concerns">My concerns</h2><p>With the Raspberry Pi 3 trending towards obsolescence, I got worried about how my <a href="https://ikarus.sg/how-i-built-kraken/">28-core Kraken cluster</a> can stay relevant and useful for at least another year. </p><p>On the other hand, I'm secretly looking forward to deprecating the Kraken cluster as I've run into countless awkward situations where the system runs out of memory and all SSH sessions lock up while the kernel struggles for a good <strong>10 minutes</strong> before panicking and forcing a reboot. </p><blockquote>In fact, that happens to me about <strong>once a week</strong>! If you've run a good number of applications on the Raspberry Pi 3 before, I'm sure you share my pain.</blockquote><p>After a round of excavation in the depths of the Raspberry Pi forums, I found a glimmer of hope for the issues of impending obsolescence and restrictive memory capacity of the Raspberry Pi 3.</p><blockquote>The solution is <em><strong>zram swap</strong></em>. &nbsp;</blockquote><figure><a href="https://github.com/StuartIanNaylor/zram-swap-config"><div><p>StuartIanNaylor/zram-swap-config</p><p>Replacement for broken zram-config-0.5 package.

The block device created with zram can then be used for swap or as general-purpose RAM disk. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zram">Wikipedia</a>)</blockquote><p>In English, the idea behind zram is basically setting aside a portion of your available memory, using it as a block device à la conventional <em>disk</em> storage and enforcing compression/decompression on all data being written/read from it.</p><h2 id="is-there-a-performance-hit">Is there a performance hit?</h2><blockquote>With great power comes great responsibility</blockquote><p>Although this widely-abused Spider-Man quote applies in most cases, this is an exception. Indeed, it is generally true that whenever compression is used, there would be increased computational requirements. But compression is a mature technology that has seen advancements over the years, that the additional compute load is minimal in modern-day processors, allowing for real-time applications such as in random-access memory.</p><p>In the case of SBCs such as the Raspberry Pi 3, you are more likely to be memory-bound rather than CPU-bound in most self-hosting scenarios as self-hosted apps tend to be relatively CPU-light and memory-heavy. With 4 cores available and only 1 GB of RAM, you're unlikely to sustain full utilization all 4 cores for extended periods of time without first running out of memory.</p><p>Given that there is always some CPU resource available, increasing the memory at the cost of increased CPU utilization is definitely not going to produce a noticeable performance impact.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-get-out-of-it">What can you get out of it?</h2><figure><img src="https://ikarus.sg/content/images/2020/08/image-1.png" alt=""><figcaption>Memory bandwidth of Raspberry Pi devices from Zero thru 4 (<a href="https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/raspberry-pi-3bplus-specs-benchmarks">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the table above (<a href="https://github.com/StuartIanNaylor/zram-swap-config">Github</a>), we see the compression ratio and performances of each compression algorithm. With those performance numbers, we can easily see that majority of the compression algorithms qualify for real-time usage as their Compression/Decompression throughput exceeds or are close to the maximum memory Write/Read throughput of all Raspberry Pi models, respectively.</p><p>Even in the most conservative case, just using compression alone would yield an <em>additional <strong>108%</strong> of space</em>, and even that estimate itself is conservative. This is because the tests assume a mixture of data types to be compressed, non-compressible binary data as well as text. In memory, most of the data can be <em>safely assumed to be text</em> so the real-world space yield is expected to be vastly larger.</p><h3 id="example">Example</h3><p>Assuming that 512MiB of RAM was set aside for zram swap, and assuming a conservative compression ratio of 2, then we'd stand to gain 500MB additional memory.</p><p>For an RPi 3, that brings the total memory to a relatively comfortable 1.5GiB!</p><h2 id="installing-zram-swap-config">Installing zram-swap-config</h2><p>Enough idle talk, let's get down to business.

<p>One of these queries might quickly narrow down a problem with your Postgres database. With a little luck, the culprit has to do with either: queries, indexes, or disk space. Postgres exposes a lot of internal information in system tables like <code>pg_stat_activity</code> and <code>pg_stat_user_tables</code>, if you are not already familiar with them we will be looking at a few as we go:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Queries, <code>pg_stat_activity</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Long running queries?</li>
<li>What is blocking my lock?</li>
<li>Stop processes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indexes, <code>pg_stat_user_tables</code> &amp; <code>pg_stat_user_indexes</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Tables need vacuum?</li>
<li>Missing index?</li>
<li>Slow vacuum?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disk Space, <code>pg_stat_database</code> &amp; <code>pg_relation_size</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Database size?</li>
<li>Table size?</li>
<li>Index size?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Queries</h2>
<p><code>pg_stat_activity</code> has information on currently running processes, and in our case - queries. We can get all long-running queries based on <code>query_start</code>, including the SQL that is being run and additional data about what the process is doing.</p>
<h3>Long running queries?</h3>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  pid<span>,</span>
  usename<span>,</span>
  datname<span>,</span>
  state<span>,</span>
  <span>NOW</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> pg_stat_activity<span>.</span>query_start <span>AS</span> duration<span>,</span>
  wait_event_type<span>,</span>
  wait_event<span>,</span>
  query
<span>FROM</span> pg_stat_activity
<span>WHERE</span> <span>(</span><span>NOW</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> pg_stat_activity<span>.</span>query_start<span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>interval</span> <span>'1 minutes'</span>
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> duration <span>DESC</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are a few cases you are likely to find here:</p>
<ul>
<li>A query like <code>SELECT * FROM big_table</code> has been running since an incident started</li>
<li>A query like <code>SELECT * FROM big_table WHERE should_have_an_index</code> is missing an index</li>
<li>A query is stuck on locks, the <code>wait_event</code> and <code>wait_event_type</code> columns have information which could indicate locking bottlenecks (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/monitoring-stats.html">info on what the field values mean</a>)</li>
<li>Lots of idle queries, filter them out with <code>WHERE state &lt;&gt; 'idle'</code> unless something may be opening
more idle connections than we want</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of locks being the bottleneck, we can use <code>pg_blocking_pids</code> to walk backward and what is responsible for queries stumbling over each other locks.</p>
<h3>What is blocking my lock?</h3>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> pg_stat_activity
<span>WHERE</span> pid <span>IN</span> <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> pg_blocking_pids<span>(</span><span>&lt;</span>pid <span>of</span> blocked query<span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To take action use either <code>pg_cancel_backend</code> or <code>pg_terminate_backend</code>, the former
tries to cancel the running query and if that does not work the latter will terminate
the connection.</p>
<h3>Stop processes</h3>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> pg_cancel_backend<span>(</span><span>&lt;</span>pid<span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>SELECT</span> pg_terminate_backend<span>(</span><span>&lt;</span>pid<span>&gt;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Indexes</h2>
<p><code>pg_stat_user_tables</code> shows system information about tables. We can use this to see if our autovacuum or indexing strategy is not working for us.</p>
<h3>Tables need vacuum?</h3>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  schemaname<span>,</span>
  relname<span>,</span>
  n_dead_tup<span>,</span>
  n_live_tup<span>,</span>
  n_dead_tup <span>/</span> n_live_tup <span>AS</span> percent_dead_tuples
<span>FROM</span> pg_stat_user_tables <span>WHERE</span> n_live_tup <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> n_dead_tup <span>DESC</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A high number of <code>n_dead_tup</code> or <code>percent_dead_tuples</code> likely means our autovacuum is not running often enough on this table. This can cause queries and indexes to be less effective and slower, the solution is to usually autovacuum more frequently. The rest of the columns in the table can also help with identifying where to look next:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  schemaname<span>,</span>
  relname<span>,</span>
  seq_scan<span>,</span>
  seq_tup_read<span>,</span>
  idx_scan<span>,</span>
  idx_tup_fetch<span>,</span>
  n_tup_ins<span>,</span>
  n_tup_upd<span>,</span>
  n_tup_del<span>,</span>
  n_tup_hot_upd<span>,</span>
  n_mod_since_analyze<span>,</span>
  last_vacuum<span>,</span>
  last_autovacuum<span>,</span>
  last_analyze<span>,</span>
  last_autoanalyze<span>,</span>
  vacuum_count<span>,</span>
  autoanalyze_count<span>,</span>
  autovacuum_count
<span>FROM</span> pg_stat_user_tables<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Some common issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrequent vacuums or analyzes. <code>last_autovacuum</code> and <code>last_autoanalyze</code> will tell you if a table has not been vacuumed or analyzed recently. Likely the case for tables with large <code>n_dead_tup</code>. Can also be paired with <code>autovacuum_count</code> and <code>autoanalyze_count</code> to see if it is running frequently</li>
<li>Missing indexes. From high <code>seq_scan</code> and low <code>idx_scan</code>. For healthy indexes we want most of our reads to not be coming from seq scans. There are some cases where you can sequentially walk the whole table without a problem (e.g. <code>SELECT * FROM table_with_10_rows</code> needs no index)</li>
<li>Not performing hot updates. On high usage tables with low <code>n_tup_hot_upd</code>. With lots of updates, there are big performance improvements for more hot tuple updates. The fix here might live in the application on determining how to group affected rows together more easily</li>
</ul>
<p>The opposite of a missing index could be too many indexes slowing down updates. If an index has a low hit rate, we are doing an extra index update without any of the benefits.</p>
<h3>Missing index?</h3>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  schemaname<span>,</span>
  relname<span>,</span>
  indexrelname<span>,</span>
  idx_scan
<span>FROM</span> pg_stat_user_indexes</code></pre></div>
<p>Another potential issue is autovacuum is running but just taking too long.</p>
<h3>Slow vacuum?</h3>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  datname<span>,</span>
  usename<span>,</span>
  pid<span>,</span>
  state<span>,</span>
  wait_event<span>,</span>
  <span>current_timestamp</span> <span>-</span> xact_start <span>AS</span> xact_runtime<span>,</span>
  query
<span>FROM</span> pg_stat_activity
<span>WHERE</span> upper<span>(</span>query<span>)</span> <span>LIKE</span> <span>'%VACUUM%'</span>
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> xact_start<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>At the database level, the vacuum needs periodically run to clean up transaction ids for postgres to continue running. If you want to check this value before it gets too large (~2 billion):</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>max</span><span>(</span>age<span>(</span>datfrozenxid<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> pg_database<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There is a good <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/implement-an-early-warning-system-for-transaction-id-wraparound-in-amazon-rds-for-postgresql">article from amazon on setting up alarms to monitor this in AWS</a>. If it is climbing or triggers an alarm we can narrow down the area if there are multiple databases:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  datname<span>,</span>
  age<span>(</span>datfrozenxid<span>)</span> <span>AS</span> frozen_age<span>,</span>
  age<span>(</span>datfrozenxid<span>)</span>::<span>decimal</span> <span>/</span> <span>1000000000</span> <span>AS</span> frozen_age_percent
<span>FROM</span> pg_database
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> frozen_age <span>desc</span> <span>limit</span> <span>20</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Disk space</h2>
<p><code>pg_stat_database</code> stores database-wide statistics, and we will be looking at <code>pg_catalog</code> for table-level statistics.</p>
<p>Do we have a disk space problem? Let’s work from the top down.</p>
<h3>Database size?</h3>
<p>We can get our <code>current_database()</code> and check there are no size surprises:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> pg_size_pretty<span>(</span>pg_database_size<span>(</span>current_database<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Table size?</h3>
<p>Using <code>pg_catalog.pg_stat_user_tables</code> from tracking down table-level index issues, but this time for disk space:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> schemaname <span>AS</span> table_schema<span>,</span>
  relname <span>AS</span> table_name<span>,</span>
  pg_size_pretty<span>(</span>pg_relation_size<span>(</span>relid<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> data_size
<span>FROM</span> pg_catalog<span>.</span>pg_stat_user_tables
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> pg_relation_size<span>(</span>relid<span>)</span> <span>desc</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Index size?</h3>
<p>Using <code>pg_catalog.pg_stat_user_indexes</code> from index investigation, but now for disk space:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> schemaname <span>AS</span> table_schema<span>,</span>
  relname <span>AS</span> table_name<span>,</span>
  indexrelname <span>AS</span> index_name<span>,</span>
  idx_scan <span>AS</span> id_scans<span>,</span>
  pg_size_pretty<span>(</span>pg_relation_size<span>(</span>relid<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> data_size
<span>FROM</span> pg_catalog<span>.</span>pg_stat_user_indexes
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> pg_relation_size<span>(</span>relid<span>)</span> <span>DESC</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Disk space issues might be coming from temporary files. When Postgres attempts to sort a very large set without sufficient memory it uses temp files. A query like <code>SELECT * FROM large_table ORDER BY column_with_no_index</code> will try loading the dataset into memory to sort and then use disk:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> datname<span>,</span> temp_files<span>,</span> temp_bytes
<span>FROM</span> pg_stat_database <span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Hopefully, some of this helps, let me know if there are any others you use!</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

<p>It seems impossible, however, thanks to a particular initiative that is becoming more and more popular, this can become a reality. The project <strong>Case a 1 euro (1-euro houses)</strong> has sprung from a few Italian municipalities with the intent to counter the population outflow and to give a new birth to troubled areas.<br>
With this operation <strong>Case a 1 euro (1-euro houses)</strong> we try to repopulate gorgeous villages that are being deserted, with the young population leaving and the elderly slowly fading away.</p>
<p>This unprecedented proposal has struggled initially, but it’s gaining popularity in recent times. This long-term strategy is attractive for those who are looking for low-cost real estate investments in Italy, and to simply restore prestige to Italian villages famous all over the world for their extraordinary beauty, and for that vintage spirit so cherished nowadays.</p>
<p>[metaslider id=”207″]
</p><p>Additionally, the <strong>Project Case a 1 euro (1-euro houses)</strong> could positively shock to the Italian real estate market facilitating access to homes by young people, for whom it is becoming increasingly difficult to take out a mortgage.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the repopulation of these small villages also promotes tourist activities, regenerating the economy of the entire area. To enhance the tourism economy, it is possible to repurpose an old building as a boutique hotel, a B&amp;B, or even to create a bigger project involving multiple premises in the same village to create a scattered hotel.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are many very interesting possibilities and implications.</p>

<p>AndroidAPS is an open source app for people living with insulin-dependent diabetes that acts as an artificial pancreas system (APS) on Google Android smartphones. The main components are different openAPS software algorithms which aim to do what a living pancreas does: keeping blood sugar levels within healthy limits by using automated insulin dosing (AID). Additionally, you need at least a supported and FDA/CE approved insulin pump and continuous glucose meter.</p>
<p>The app does NOT use self-learning artificial intelligence. Instead, the calculations of AndroidAPS are based on the individual dosage algorithm and carbohydrate intake the user manually puts into their treatments profile, but they are verified by the system for safety reasons.</p>
<p>The app is not provided in Google Play - you have to build it from source code by yourself for legal reasons.</p>

<p><span>Despite the buzz around GPT-3, it is, in and of itself, not AGI.</span> In many ways, this makes it similar to AlphaGo or Deep Blue; while approaching human ability in one domain (playing Chess/Go, or writing <em>really</em> impressively), it doesn’t really seem like it will do <span><a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Intelligence_explosion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scary AGI Things™</a></span> any more than AlphaGo is going to be turning the Earth into paperclips anytime soon. While its writings are impressive at emulating humans, GPT-3 (or any potential future GPT-x) has no memory of past interactions, nor is it able to follow goals or maximize utility. However, language modelling has one <em>crucial</em> difference from Chess or Go or image classification. Natural language essentially encodes information about the world—the <em>entire</em> world, not just the world of the Goban, in a much more expressive way than any other modality ever could.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> By harnessing the world model embedded in the language model, it may be possible to build a proto-AGI.</p>

<p>The explicit goal of a language model is only to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maximize likelihood</a> of the model on natural language data. In the <a href="https://leogao.dev/2019/10/27/The-Difficulties-of-Text-Generation-with-Autoregressive-Language-Models/">autoregressive formulation</a> that GPT-3 uses, this means being able to predict the next word as well as possible. However, this objective places much more weight on large, text-scale differences like grammar and spelling than fine, subtle differences in semantic meaning and logical coherency, which reflect as very subtle shifts in distribution. Once the former are near-perfect, though, the only place left to keep improving is the latter.</p>
<p>At the extreme, any model whose loss reaches the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shannon entropy</a> of <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/1999-00/information-theory/entropy_of_english_9.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural language</a>—the theoretical lowest loss a language model can possibly achieve, due to the inherent randomness of language—will be <em>completely indistinguishable</em> from writings by a real human in every way, and the closer we get to it, the more abstract the effect on quality of each bit of improvement in loss. Or, said differently, stringing words together using <a href="https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markov chain generators</a> gets you 50% of the way there, figuring out grammar gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, staying on topic across paragraphs gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, being logically consistent gets you another 50% of the remaining distance, and so on.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>

\end{aligned}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p><p><span>Shannon Entropy: the number of bits necessary, on average to specify one piece of text.</span></p>
<p>Why? Because if you have a coherent-but-not-logically consistent model, becoming more logically consistent helps you predict language better. Having a model of human behavior helps you predict language better. Having a model of the world helps you predict language better. As the low-hanging fruits of grammar and basic logical coherence are taken, the only place left for the model to keep improving the loss is a world model. Predicting text is <a href="http://mattmahoney.net/dc/rationale.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">equivalent to AI</a>.</p>
<p>The thing about GPT-3 that <a href="https://leogao.dev/2020/05/29/GPT-3-A-Brief-Summary/">makes it so important</a> is that it provides evidence that as long as we keep increasing the model size, we can keep driving down the loss, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly right up until</a> it hits the Shannon entropy of text. No need for clever architectures or complex handcrafted heuristics. Just by scaling it up we can get a better language model, and a better language model entails a better world model.</p>
<p>But how do we use this language model if it’s buried implicitly-represented inside GPT-x, though? Well, we can literally just <em>ask</em> it, in natural language, what it thinks will happen next given a sequence of events, and its output distribution will approximate the distribution of what the average human thinks would happen next after those events. Great—we’ve got ourselves a usable world model.</p>
<p>“But wait!” you say, “<a href="https://aiweirdness.com/post/621186154843324416/all-your-questions-answered" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Various</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/eigenrobot/status/1284042570507542528" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experiments</a> have shown that GPT-3 often fails at world modelling, and just conjecturing that adding more parameters will fix the problem is a <em>massive</em> leap!” If you’re thinking this, you’re absolutely correct. The biggest and most likely to be wrong assumption that I’m making is that larger models will develop better world models. Since as loss approaches the Shannon entropy its world modelling ability has to become about as good than the average human on the internet<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, this boils down to two questions: “Will we really make models whose loss gets close enough to the Shannon entropy?” and “How close is close enough, in order to have the world modelling capabilities to make all this practical?”</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/gpt3/perf_scaling_compute.png" alt="Loss keeps going down with more parameters and compute. (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>The answer to the first question is “most likely”—that’s the <a href="https://leogao.dev/2020/05/29/GPT-3-A-Brief-Summary/">main takeaway of GPT-3</a>. The answer to the second question is… nobody knows. Some have demonstrated <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23990902" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ways of making GPT-3 better at world modelling</a>, but this alone is probably not sufficient. When models with 1 trillion, then 10 trillion, then 100 trillion parameters become available, we will have empirical evidence to see whether this assumption is correct. If GPT-x demonstrates uncanny ability to predict outcomes in the real world, then this just might work.</p>

<p>A world model alone does not an agent make, though.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> So what does it take to make a world model into an agent? Well, first off we need a goal, such as <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Paperclip_maximizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“maximize number of paperclips”</a>. Then, we just ask the world model “What action can I take to maximize the number of paperclips I have?” Simple, right? Actually, not quite. The problem is that our world model probably won’t be able to consider all the possible things that could happen next well enough to make a reasonable answer.</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/mesa.png" alt="GPT-3 considers mesa-optimization. (Source: OpenAI API)"></p>
<p>So what can we do instead? Well, asking the world model for a list of things you could do in a given world state would probably not be outside the capabilities of a sufficiently powerful language model (think: “I am in situation <span>xyz</span>. Here is a list of things I could do:”). Similarly, asking the world model how much reward you’d get in some hypothetical world where you took a sequence of actions would probably be possible too—imagine asking something along the lines of “I go to ebay. I look up paperclips, sorted by price ascending. I spend $100 on the first item on the list. How many paperclips will I have?”<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> This will let us figure out what actions the agent can take in any given step (policy function), as well as how much reward each sequence of steps will net the agent (value function).</p>
<p>So now, to estimate the state-action value of any action, we can simply do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monte Carlo Tree Search</a> to estimate the state-action values! Starting from a given agent state, we can roll out sequences of actions using the world model. By integrating over all rollouts, we can know how much future expected reward the agent can expect to get for each action it considers. Then, we can simply use, for example, a greedy policy with that state-action value function, to decide on actions to take.</p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/mcts.png" alt="Monte Carlo Tree Search visualized (<a href='https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Phases-of-the-Monte-Carlo-tree-search-algorithm-A-search-tree-rooted-at-the-current_fig1_312172859'>Source</a>)"></p>
<p>Each of these actions is likely to be very high level, such as “figure out the cheapest way to buy paperclips”, but thanks to the flexibility of language we can describe very complex ideas with short sequences of tokens. To actually execute these abstract actions once the agent decides on an action, that action can be broken down using the language model into smaller sub-goals such as “figure out the cheapest paperclips on Amazon”, similar to <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6233-hierarchical-deep-reinforcement-learning-integrating-temporal-abstraction-and-intrinsic-motivation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</a>. Possibly even just breaking actions down into a detailed list of instructions would be feasible, depending on the capabilities of the model and how abstract the actions are.</p>
<p>We can represent the agent state as natural language, too. Since the agent state is just a compressed representation of the observations, we can ask the language model to summarize the important information of any observations for its own internal world state. The language model could be used to periodically prune (i.e forget) the information inside its state, too, to make room for more observations.</p>
<p>Altogether, this gets us a system where we can pass observations from the outside world in, spend some time thinking about what to do, and output an action in natural language.</p>
<p>To handle input, you could have an input module that turns various modalities of observations into summarized text with respect to the current agent state. For instance, you could use something like <a href="https://openai.com/blog/image-gpt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iGPT</a> to input camera images or screenshots, or raw HTML from webpages that the agent requests. How exactly this is done is tangential to the point; all that matters is that somehow the inputs are all converted to text and added to the agent state. The examples I have provided are just to convince you that it’s absolutely not insurmountable.</p>
<p>Finally, to get the model to actually act in the world, you could again use the language model to translate natural language into <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/Microsoft/1OyKAYWPRrWKb?t=29m19s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">code that is then executed</a>, or <a href="https://vimeo.com/427943407/98fe5258a7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shell commands</a>, or sequences of keypresses, or any of a number of other possible ways. Like input, there are an infinitude of different ways to solve the output problem, and which one turns out to be the best is entirely irrelevant to our discussion; all that matters is that it’s possible to get various modalities in and out of the text-only agent.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://leogao.dev/images/agi-lms/paperclipsamzn.png" alt="An example of an input module taking a screenshot input combined with the current agent state to give an observation with the information needed by the agent."></p>

<p>This is more a thought experiment than something that’s actually going to happen tomorrow; GPT-3 today just isn’t good enough at world modelling. Also, this method depends heavily on at least one major assumption—that bigger future models will have much better world modelling capabilities—and a bunch of other smaller implicit assumptions. <strong><span>However</span></strong>, this might be the closest thing we ever get to a chance to <a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/10/13/fire-alarm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sound the fire alarm</a> for AGI: there’s now a concrete path to proto-AGI that has a non-negligible chance of working.</p>

<!--[^toolai]: One common line of argument is that such "tool AIs" are good enough and have desirable safety properties, and therefore agentistic AI need not ever be developed. One argument against this idea is that [agent AI will inevitably be more economically valuable than tool AI](https://www.gwern.net/Tool-AI), which would encourage their development.-->

Going from a model that just strings uniformly chosen words together to a simple [Markov chain generator](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild) makes a *massive* difference, but the loss difference between a Markov chain generator and GPT-2 is much smaller despite GPT-2 being able to manage grammatically correct sentences nearly all of the time, and the loss difference between GPT-2 and GPT-3 is smaller still, despite massive subjective improvements in quality. 

The difference between "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and "shxixpgozcvoomz jcxfgabsdcxfrevogjsqewdnmkj" is *massive*, but the difference between "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

Going from a model that just strings uniformly chosen words together to a model that uses words in the same [Zipf distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) as regular text earns a large decrease in loss, because if you always pick common words like "the" you have a much better chance of being right than picking rare words. Another big decrease comes from considering n-gram frequencies rather than just single-word frequencies; this is the driving idea behind [Markov chain generators](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify#markovify-in-the-wild), which generate surprisingly good text considering how just how simple they are. Now, these

                <p><em>This is the first in what will, hopefully, become a series. I would like to highlight projects that are widely used, even to the point of being part of critical infrastructure, but are nevertheless small projects with small (often unsponsored) development teams. We start the series talking to Simon&nbsp;Kelley.</em></p>
<p>dnsmasq is one of the unsung heroes of the Internet: a small piece of software used very widely, but with a <em>very</em> small development team, and no corporate backing. It is used as the <span>DHCP</span> and caching <span>DNS</span> server on a wide variety of home-market routers, as well as other devices, and is the default <span>DHCP</span> and <span>DNS</span> caching server for libvirt, and by extension, OpenStack. A couple years ago, I contacted Simon Kelley, the author of dnsmasq, and asked if he was up for an interview. He was, but my blog wasn’t in a maintainable position at that point, so it got pushed back. I contacted him again recently, and we managed to make it happen. This interview was conducted via e-mail on December 10,&nbsp;2017.</p>

<p>Simon, thank you for taking time out of your schedule (when you could be
programming) to answer my questions. This is quite an honor, and I hope you
enjoy the&nbsp;questions.</p>
<p>What itch were you scratching, that is, what was your original need and
intention for&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Long ago, around the turn of the century, I had a <span>PC</span>, running Linux, and
a net connection via a dial-up modem. If the <span>PC</span> was not connected to the
net then Netscape navigator would return an error immediately, because
the <span>UDP</span> packet doing a <span>DNS</span> query got a “no route to host” error. Then I
got a second-hand 486 laptop, and discovered that I could connect
that to my <span>PC</span> and give it a net connection too, using this amazing thing
called ip-masquerading (what later became <span>NAT</span>.) But when the Netscape on the
laptop would send the <span>UDP</span> <span>DNS</span> query to the <span>ISP</span>, it would get to the
desktop, where it would evaporate, and Netscape would hang (it was
single-threaded, at least in the <span>DNS</span> code) for a long time-out. I wanted
to fix that annoying behaviour. The <span>IP</span>-masquerade use is where the
DNSmasq name came&nbsp;from.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you intend to release it as open source from the&nbsp;beginning?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the extent that I intended to release it,&nbsp;yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much did you know about <span>DNS</span> and <span>DHCP</span> when you&nbsp;started?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost nothing, about the internals anyway. I started with <span>RFC</span> 1035 and
went from&nbsp;there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the most interesting bug you’ve run&nbsp;into?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not one of mine - I found a Linux kernel bug once, in the <span>API</span> to control
the <span>ARP</span> cache. The bug was long-ago fixed, but in a sense, the
work-around still persists in dnsmasq. It was difficult to find because
it was intermittent and hard to reproduce, and it took a long time to
consider that the problem may not have been mine, but in the&nbsp;Kernel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Related: when fixing a bug (found by you or reported), what has been your
most “What was I thinking when I wrote that”&nbsp;moment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Plenty of those. I once found a “&amp;” versus “&amp;&amp;” confusion which nobody
had spotted as a functional error, by code&nbsp;inspection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever found bugs in other <span>DHCP</span> and <span>DNS</span> products/libraries as a
result of your testing? What was the most interesting one? Feel free to share
others, if you&nbsp;wish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are lots of <span>DHCP</span> clients in things like printers and scanners and
general IoT devices which behave badly and need workarounds. Intel
produced some awful bugs in <span>PXE</span> implementations which went into netboot
<span>ROMS</span> and never got&nbsp;updated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was your most “you’ve got to be kidding me” moment when learning new
corners of <span>DHCP</span> and <span>DNS</span> and/or your biggest “I wish I had known that when I
started”&nbsp;moment?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s always amused me that the format of a <span>DNS</span> packet - which is very
size constrained to fit into <span>UDP</span> packets, wastes 16 bits for a count of
the number of questions in a query. This has been constrained to be
exactly one for all of the life of <span>DNS</span>, so the 16 bits are completely
wasted. <span>DNS</span> in general is an amazingly under-specified and obscure area.
It’s been around forever, and is developed by people who have been
around for a long time and grown up with it. They tend to vastly
underestimate how much implied knowledge they are assuming when writing
RFCs. As for what I wished I’d known: I wished I’d found the <span>RFC</span> which
is an errata  to the original three <span>DNSSEC</span> RFCs earlier; I found several
of the bugs the hard&nbsp;way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was your reaction when you found out dnsmasq was used as the default
forwarder/<span>DHCP</span> server for OpenStack? What is it like having your project used
in one the most well known open source projects in the&nbsp;world?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That happened after dnsmasq was incorporated into Android, so it was
sort of an anti-climax after getting into the majority of smart phones on
the&nbsp;planet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ed. note: point&nbsp;taken]</p>
<p>Besides OpenStack, what are some of the most interesting use cases you’ve
heard about for&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I took some patches from someone who was providing satellite Internet to
trans-oceanic sailors. Bandwidth costs were high enough that it made
sense to audit almost every byte sent and received, including for <span>DNS</span>&nbsp;resolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever gotten contributions (code or otherwise) back from router
manufacturers that have used&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Probably, but I don’t remember anything significant in terms of code.
Comcast paid for a year of my time to implement <span>DNSSEC</span>, which was pretty
good of&nbsp;them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What kind of contributions have you turned&nbsp;down?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s people who make a patch to solve their particular problem and
don’t give any thought to making it general, or generally&nbsp;useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you talk about one significant or difficult contribution you turned down
and why? - From my co-worker <a href="https://twitter.com/eduncan911">Eric Duncan&nbsp;@eduncan911</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The one that’s happened over and over again is to change the behaviour
on receiving a “no-such-domain” reply from an upstream nameserver.
People want to implement local <span>DNS</span> hacks by getting dnsmasq to keep
trying another upstream server when the first returns <span>NXDOMAIN</span>, but
that’s always seemed to me to be a really bad thing to do: <span>NXDOMAIN</span> is a
valid answer, and not a failure&nbsp;return.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have a group of steady contributors, or is it pretty much just you
(and occasional&nbsp;contributions)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are steady contributors, but long-term, it’s just&nbsp;me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are pretty active on the mailing list. For the second quarter of 2017,
nearly 80 messages of the 229 are from you. How much time do you spend on the
project (code and helping&nbsp;users)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very variable, and less than I used to. I used to have a job with a very
<span>FOSS</span>-friendly employer. I was sitting in front of computer most days,
and my boss was happy for me to spend time on dnsmasq. Nowadays, I’m
semi-retired, and I spend my days doing other stuff, so I have to make
time to sit down and work on&nbsp;dnsmasq.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your motivation for self-hosting, vs. moving to something like
Github or&nbsp;Bitbucket?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The self-hosting setup existed before Github etc, or at least before
they were visible and known to be reliable. It works, so I’ve never had
the activation energy to move it. I’m a sysadmin and I like having a
host to do my stuff, my&nbsp;way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your <span>FAQ</span> says it will run on Linux, *<span>BSD</span>, and embedded systems. What is the
most interesting platform you’ve heard of using&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Somebody ran it on <span>QNX</span> once, I&nbsp;believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Commit 1 in the dnsmasq git repository happened on January 22, 2004, and
says it is an “import of dnsmasq-2.0.tar.gz.”  When was your first public
release (version 0.4)? How long had you been working on it before&nbsp;then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Around 2000. There were quite a few releases in the 1.x series, which
were before the <span>DHCP</span> server was added. It didn’t seem worth adding those
when I moved into&nbsp;git.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What are your future plans, dreams, and hopes for&nbsp;dnsmasq?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like all code that’s 15 years old, there are deep design decisions and
trade-off that are hard to change but which don’t necessarily make sense
any more. I’d like to do a version 3.0 which addresses those, but I’m
not sure I have the commitment left in me to do&nbsp;it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In relation to the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/10/behind-masq-yet-more-dns-and-dhcp.html">recent security fixes contributed by Google</a> did
you know they were working on dnsmasq, or did the fixes come as a&nbsp;suprise?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They didn’t tell me they were working on dnsmasq before they started,
but once they’d found holes, they let me know well before the public
disclosure. There’s a whole raft of stuff which happens in case like
this, and the Google security people were really good at helping to work
through it.  A lot is helping distributions to get patched packages ready in
advance: I spend a lot of effort helping people backport the fixes to
the older&nbsp;versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have any steps been taken to do a full audit, or is that what Google&nbsp;did?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There have been quite a few audits over the years, before Google did its
stuff. <span>SUSE</span> did one, and the Mozilla foundation sponsored one. The
Google people used fuzzing to find the holes that had been missed by the
audits - it’s very&nbsp;impressive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Has the  recent security news changed the development process&nbsp;any?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I plan to use Google’s service to do ongoing fuzzing of new&nbsp;releases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anything significant on the dnsmasq road map? Are there additions that could
be done, or do you cover all of the <span>DNS</span>/<span>DHCP</span> spec&nbsp;now?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t cover the whole spec - the <span>USP</span> [ed. note: Unique Selling Point] is to cover the bits that my
users need, without carrying the bloat of everything else. I guess that
new stuff is still likely in the area of IPv6 address/name management.
IPv6 will take over the world one day, won’t&nbsp;it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[ed. note: We&nbsp;hope.]</p>
<p>Do you have a Patreon, Flattr, or other funding source to which people could&nbsp;contribute?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a PayPal account at simon@thekelleys.org.uk. Contributions
happily&nbsp;accepted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks again! I hope our paths will cross some&nbsp;day!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I hope that’s useful. Please feel free to come back with more questions,
or for clarifications on the&nbsp;answers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That wraps it up! I greatly appreciate Simon taking time to do this. If you have questions, ask them in the&nbsp;comments.</p>

<div>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/covid-19-u-s-fatalities-june-2020-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In June</a>, I made the prediction that it’s likely we’ll see hundreds of thousands dead by July from COVID-19.</p>
<p>According to official data, my prediction <span><em>was not entirely accurate</em></span>, being closer to the lower bound of my simulation(s) (a hundred thousand).</p>
<p>Today, we have more information about the virus and importantly improved data on death rates (via the CDC) – <strong>it appears the official death toll from COVID19 may be under reported</strong>. Perhaps more terrifying, it also appears <strong>if you are 25-85+ years old you have a 20-50% increased risk of dying in 2020 than you did in 2015-2019</strong> (given COVID19’s current penetration rate).</p>
<p>Some key takeaways from this analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official death COVID19 related deaths are likely higher than official count(s)</li>
<li>Testing capacity appears to be shrinking or not being reported</li>
<li>Age groups over 25 are seeing a 20-50% increased number of deaths in 2020 (over 2015-2019)</li>
<li>It is likely the increased fatality rate over prior years will continue as COVID19 prevalence increases</li>
<li>By year end 2020, it’s likely we will see over one million deaths in the U.S.</li>
<li>By April 2021, it’s likely we will see over two million deaths in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<p>For transparency:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code (&amp; Graphics): <a href="https://github.com/lettergram/covid19-analysis">Github</a></li>
<li>Data
<ul>
<li>Covidtracking.com: <a href="https://covidtracking.com/api/states/daily" rel="nofollow">https://covidtracking.com/api/states/daily</a></li>
<li>CDC: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm </a></li>
<li>CDC data is only [mostly] accurate up to the week of July 20 – 26, 2020</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>First and foremost, we aren’t testing enough to capture all cases. People are not being tested for various reasons: desire to work, no/minor symptoms, can’t receive a test, etc. Unfortunately, this will leave us vulnerable.</p>
<p>On a whole, the nation wide positive rate is still hovering well above lows, with around 7% tests coming back positive.</p>

<p>It is not clear if the reduction in tests are from collection errors, reduced testing capacity, issues with the data provider or some other unknown factor.</p>

<p>Overall, our accounting of deaths from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC</a> is only accurate up to the week of July 20 – 26, 2020, from week 1 to week 30 there has been 216,569 more deaths in 2020 over 2019.</p>

<p>It’s important to note, that it is not an entirely fair to compare 2019 to 2020, as each year has variance in deaths. With this in mind, I also created a simple regression model, then compared the predicted death count to the actual 2020 deaths and came to figure of <strong>178,598.40 deaths over the predicted number</strong> (remember, this is for the week of July 20, 2020):</p>

<p>Currently, in August — nearly three weeks passed the CDC numbers cut off and deaths are still increasing. At this point, it is likely we are well over 200,000+ deaths beyond the prediction. Further, it is quite possible we are now 250,000+ deaths above the 2019 figures. If true, we are likely under counting COVID related deaths by 40-60%.</p>
<p>This analysis doesn’t take into account mitigating factors (such as less car accidents) as it also doesn’t take into account confounding factors (such as more suicides).</p>
<h2><span>States Under Reporting COVID-19 Related Fatalities</span></h2>
<p>To highlight the clear under reporting of pandemic related fatalities, we can review states, where the issue becomes more pronounced.</p>
<p>Take <strong>Texas</strong>, for instance:</p>

<p>This implies one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>COVID19 deaths are being attributed to another illness</li>
<li>Hospitals are focusing on the COVID19 patients and other critically ill patients are dying (at an alarming rate)</li>
<li>Some other catastrophe is happening</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless, as more people test positive, more people are dying and there is a high correlation between the two. If I had to guess, this really means people aren’t being tested until after they are dead or critically ill &amp; in the hospital.</p>
<h2><span>Decreased Testing</span></h2>
<p>It’s also important to bring attention to the <span>decreasing number of tests from July 9, 2020 and August 13, 2020</span>. Time will tell if the rate of fatalities will drop (or if just the COVID19 related deaths will), the decreased testing volume correlates exactly with the declining positive cases (as one would suspect).</p>
<p>This holds true for many states, including <strong>Florida</strong>:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png" alt="" width="650" height="488" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-300x225.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-768x577.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-2048x1538.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1024x769.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-300x225.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-768x577.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-FL-2048x1538.png 2048w"></a>Testing capacity in Florida has dropped 40% in the past six weeks. At the same time, the death toll is rising. Frankly, I wouldn’t be surprised if reduced testing was a ploy related to opening schools.</p>
<p>There are some examples where the figures do appear to be <em>generally</em> accurate, such as <strong>New York</strong>:<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-203x150.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-NY-203x150.png 203w"></a>Another example is <strong>Illinois </strong>(although initially there was likely under-reporting due to lack of testing):</p>
<p><a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png" alt="" width="650" height="485" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-203x150.png 203w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1024x765.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-300x224.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-768x574.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-1536x1147.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-2048x1529.png 2048w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-stats-in-IL-203x150.png 203w"></a>In terms of which states are more prone to under-reporting vs others, there doesn’t appear to be a clear pattern. Under-reporting appears to be a signal that there is not enough testing – aka the system is overwhelmed. This makes logical sense, as the system becomes overwhelmed, resources are diverted on saving lives over identifying community spread. There’s also a question if the test results are being reported federally and outside my dataset for some reason.</p>

<p>It is difficult mid-pandemic with a lack of testing to determine the case <a href="https://newslit.org/updates/case-fatality-rate-vs-mortality-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fatality rate (CFR) or mortality rate</a>, which is typically what is being reported. Unfortunately, we don’t know the infection rate. With that in mind, it’s probably more accurate to track the “increased risk of dying in 2020”.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<blockquote><p>How much greater are my risks of dying in 2020 over 2019?</p></blockquote>
<p>Infection rate is included as part of metric, we don’t know the extent. COVID19 penetration is <em>maybe</em> 10% across the U.S. population (studies vary wildly). Regardless, as the year progresses, we are sure this number will increase.</p>
<p>With that in mind, on average all age groups over 25, are seeing roughly 10-15% increased risk of dying in 2020 over 2019 (again, this will likely increase):<a href="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" alt="" width="750" height="497" srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-old-src="//austingwalters.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png" data-srcset="https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1024x678.png 1024w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-300x199.png 300w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-768x509.png 768w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-1536x1017.png 1536w, https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/us-deaths-by-age-group-2048x1357.png 2048w"></a>Focusing on <strong>New York</strong>, which appears to have kept decent records &amp; has a decent infection rate – the data looks stark:</p>

<h2><span>COVID19 Spread due to Gatherings</span></h2>
<p>It’s important to acknowledge, that as people gather Coronavirus spreads more easily. Particularly, in <strong>Texas</strong>, <strong>Florida</strong>, <strong>Illinois</strong> and others started to see a rise in fatalities (and infections) following rises in heat (pushing gatherings in doors), protests, and generally opening bars.</p>
<p>Particularly, the rise of deaths in <strong>Texas</strong> coincide directly with the protests (Starting week 22 and rising to the present):</p>

<p><strong>Florida</strong> has seen the same effect, in the exact same time range:</p>

Personally, I suspect heat is the largest factor. People gathered outside to protest or celebrate (July 4th) and ended up congregating inside, without masks. This lead to an increase in spread and fatalities, as moving indoors confines people together, in air conditioning, with minimal mask protection or UV to kill the virus.</p>

<p>Finally, in prior discussions I’ve made predictions. Largely, these predictions came from running simulations (both on my own and available to me). As it stands, I continue to stand by my prior prediction:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 million COVID-19 deaths in the United States is likely (April 1, 2021)</li>
<li>25% [true] unemployment in the United States is likely</li>
<li>15% reduction in GDP is within reason</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s an estimated 180k to 1.85m dead by October 14th. Personally, for the officially count, I’d err on the side of the lower values, perhaps 250k. However, I suspect deaths will be under counted due to lack of testing, I suspect the real figures will be closer to 500k-800k after analysis, this would more closely matching the findings above (which indicate we are already over 200k).</p>

<p>There are still plenty of unknowns related to COVID19. Only time will tell, but we can see most people “checking out” so to speak. It’s important to keep up to date regarding COVID19 (and politics) in general. A disaster is …</p></div></article></div>

<p>In the movies, Thor keeps saying that he “is the strongest Avenger”. Some people say that it’s actually Hulk, but I guess it’s a matter of perspective. How can we find a solution to this riddle? By using <strong>Azure Durable Entities</strong> of course!</p>



<p>Azure Durable Functions have been a very nice addition to the Azure ecosystem. They basically let you write stateful functions and run them serverless. There’s as usual a whole plethora of patterns you can apply with them, like Function Chaining</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/media/durable-functions-concepts/function-chaining.png?ssl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/media/durable-functions-concepts/function-chaining.png?w=752&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></figure></div>



<p>or Fan out/Fan in</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/media/durable-functions-concepts/fan-out-fan-in.png?w=752&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>or Monitors</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://i2.wp.com/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/media/durable-functions-concepts/monitor.png?ssl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/media/durable-functions-concepts/monitor.png?w=752&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></figure></div>



<p>There’s a full list available in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview?tabs=csharp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official docs</a>, make sure to take a look.</p>



<p>Durable Functions currently come in four different types: Activity, Orchestrator, Entity, and Client. I’ve done a bit of work with all of them and today I’m going to talk a bit about <strong>Entity</strong> <strong>Functions</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Entity Functions</strong> define operations for reading and updating small pieces of state, known as&nbsp;<em>durable entities</em>. They act as small tiny services that talk between each other via messages. Each entity has a unique id and an internal state. When triggered, they can update their state and/or send a message to other entities. Or do other things like calling external services, triggering orchestrations, and so on.</p>



<h4>It is also very important to note that <strong>Entity Functions</strong> focus on reliability more than performance, by using reliable queues to handle messaging.</h4>



<p><strong>Entity Functions </strong>are basically another form of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Actor Model</a> and share a lot of similarities with <a href="http://dotnet.github.io/orleans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Orleans</a>, although with some <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-entities?tabs=csharp#comparison-with-virtual-actors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interesting differences</a>. </p>



<p>To showcase how they work, I prepared a super-duper example, <a href="https://whoisthestrongestapp.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WhoIsTheStrongest</a> 😀 It’s a distribute voting platform, aimed to decide who’s the <em>strongest Avenger</em>! The code is <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/WhoIsTheStrongest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on GitHub</a>, feel free to wander around.</p>



<p>The UI is written in <strong>Blazor </strong>and to be fair, there’s nothing much to say. You can pick your favorite Avenger, click on the button and vote. The system will record your choice and after few seconds you’ll see the updated leaderboard. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?ssl=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" width="752" height="303" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?resize=752%2C303&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?w=824&amp;ssl=1 824w, https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?resize=300%2C121&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.davideguida.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?resize=768%2C309&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></figure></div>



<p>The bulk of the logic is handled by Durable Entities: the first time an Avenger gets a vote, the system will generate an Id and spin up an Entity instance. The <a href="https://github.com/mizrael/WhoIsTheStrongest/blob/master/WhoIsTheStrongest.Server/Functions/CharacterScore.cs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Entity state</a> will hold the score and the last vote date. Azure will take care of the rest. The next time the score is incremented, the framework will instantiate the Entity, deserialize its state, and run the operation.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">[JsonObject(MemberSerialization.OptIn)]
public class CharacterScore 
{
	[JsonProperty("score")]
	public int Score { get; private set; }

	[JsonProperty("lastIncrement ")]
	public DateTime LastIncrement { get; private set; }

	public void Increment()
	{
		this.Score++;
		this.LastIncrement = DateTime.UtcNow;
	}

	[FunctionName(nameof(CharacterScore))]
	public static Task Run([EntityTrigger] IDurableEntityContext ctx) =&gt; ctx.DispatchAsync&lt;CharacterScore&gt;();
}</pre>



<p>Few things to note:</p>



<ul><li>The&nbsp;<code>Run</code>&nbsp;function contains the boilerplate required for using the class-based syntax. It must be a&nbsp;<em>static</em>&nbsp;Azure Function.&nbsp;</li><li>an Entity is a regular POCO class. Public callable operations must return a Task or void.</li><li>an Entity must be JSON-serializable</li></ul>



<p>A full list of constraint is as usual available<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-dotnet-entities#defining-entity-classes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in the docs</a>.</p>



<p>The score increment operation on an Entity can be triggered by a message in a Queue. The system also exposes an HTTP GET endpoint, returning the current leaderboard. Those are standard Azure Functions, which get an instance of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.webjobs.extensions.durabletask.idurableentityclient?view=azure-dotnet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IDurableEntityClient </a>as input. This client is what allows them to interact and call operations on Entities.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In the book Winning, the legendary General Electric CEO Jack Welch defines his rules of leadership:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule 3: Leaders get into everyone’s skin, exuding positive energy and optimism…your job as a leader is to fight the gravitational pull of negativism. That doesn’t mean you sugarcoat the challenges your team faces. It means you display an energizing, can-do attitude about overcoming them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn’t agree more. How many truly optimistic managers do you see on a day to day basis?  Not people that are so over-leveraged that fear pushes them to hope everything works out. Not people who ignore hard truths and escape into a good Spotify playlist.</p>

<p>Optimistic managers. Managers who see the world for what it is - a never-ending grind full of challenges, bad-breaks, luck, let-downs, inspirations, and everything in between - and approach it with a consistently positive energy and will to make things work.</p>

<p>The answer: not enough. Here are some ways you can uplevel your optimism.</p>

<p>To be optimistic, don’t:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Commiserate regularly with your reports. Commiseration is a little forfeit, every time. As a leader, you shouldn’t be signalling that the way to react to adversity is to lament. The film Saving Private Ryan calls this out beautifully: “Gripes only go up the chain of command, never down. Privates gripe to sergeants, sergeants gripe to captains, captains gripe to majors, majors gripe to colonels and colonels gripe to generals. Gripes always go up, never down.”</li>
  <li>Otherize other teams in the org. Or more bluntly: don’t talk shit about other teams. They might not be perfect, but neither are you. Otherizing only makes it harder to find the path forward.</li>
  <li>Pretend like everything is great. Again, optimism isn’t about pretending things are great. It’s a commitment to framing things as challenges to be solved, not problems to be lamented.</li>
</ul>

<p>To be optimistic, do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have a never-ending well of persistence. You might feel like Sisyphus pushing that boulder up the hill day in and day out. Optimistic people understand that most of one’s work life is pushing boulders up hills and have a good attitude about it.</li>
  <li>Get over things. If you can’t reset your opinion on people, problems, slights, and all other things to an absolute neutral, you’ll be saddled with a distracting and deteriorating buildup of resentment. Learn to get over things completely.</li>
  <li>Commit. If you’re second guessing yourself every step of the way you’ll never be able to sustain optimism. Set some timeframe for re-evaluation - maybe 6 months or a year - and then forget about anything that sounds like “maybe”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Optimism isn’t a feeling that puffs your lungs up with rejuvenating life and leads to transcendent moments of inspiration. It’s removing the friction that your ego and backbone want to instinctively introduce when faced with challenges. It’s a way to move forward.</p>

<p>This is the story of how I wrote a Twitter bot to automatically enter contests and ended up winning on average&nbsp;4 contests per day, every day, for about 9 months straight.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever used Twitter, you’ve probably seen a tweet that looks something like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rt2win.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rt2win.png" alt="rt2win" width="584" height="93" srcset="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rt2win.png 584w, https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rt2win-300x48.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 584px) 100vw, 584px"></a></p>
<p>Maybe you’ve actually retweeted it, maybe not, but everyone wants to know: does anyone ever win those contests? To discover the answer to that question, I wrote a Python script that logs into twitter, searches for tweets that say something along the lines of “retweet to win!” and then retweets them. I’m not sure if anyone else has done this before, but I didn’t see any evidence of other bots that were behaving like mine. I did however see evidence of real people who were manually doing the job of my bot by retweeting hundreds of contests over several hours.</p>
<p>Some contests require you to follow the original poster, so after discovering a candidate tweet I made sure it wasn’t an entry to a contest, but the original contest itself, and then checked to see if they wanted a follow. If so, I followed them and retweeted.&nbsp;The most difficult part of this project was preventing the bot from&nbsp;getting banned by Twitter. They have rate limits which prevent you from tweeting too often, retweeting too aggressively, and creating “following churn”, by rapidly following and unfollowing people. Twitter doesn’t publish these numbers, so I had to figure them out by trial and error. Twitter also limits the total number of people you can follow given a certain number of followers. If you have below a few hundred followers, you cannot follow more than 2000 people. Since a lot of contests required following the original poster, I used a FIFO to make sure I was only following the 2000 most recent contest entries. That gave me long enough to make sure the person I unfollowed had already ended their contest and it kept the follow/unfollow churn rate below the rate limit.&nbsp;<span>I got lucky in that the rate of new contests launched on Twitter is less than the rate that I could retweet, meaning I was able to enter every contest I could find. How many was that? Well, over the 9 months I ran my script, I entered approximately 165,000 contests. Of those, I won around 1000. So that means my win rate was just over half a percent, which is pretty miserable, especially when you consider that a good portion of those winnings were things like logos and graphics, which is Twitter slang for a customized image for use in a gaming or YouTube profile. They tend to look like this:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rIC3v1lz.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rIC3v1lz.png" alt="rIC3v1lz" width="301" height="301" srcset="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rIC3v1lz.png 500w, https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rIC3v1lz-150x150.png 150w, https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rIC3v1lz-300x300.png 300w, https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rIC3v1lz-120x120.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px"></a>Another very large percentage of the things I won were tickets to events. I did manage to go to an event that I won tickets to, but the majority of them were for concerts and events in other countries that I obviously couldn’t go to. I also won a lot of currency to online games (like FIFA). And when the game Destiny was giving out beta codes, I won about 30 of them through as many&nbsp;contests. I won a lot of cool stuff too though, and getting mysterious things in my mailbox each day was pretty fun. It ended up being a free way to get this effect:</p>

<p>My favorite thing that I won was a cowboy hat autographed by the stars of a Mexican soap opera that I had never heard of. I love it because it really embodies the totally random outcome of these contests. The most valuable thing I won was a trip to New York Fashion Week, which included a limo ride to the show if you lived in a state near New York for you and a friend, and $500 spending money each, and tickets to some of the shows. That had a retail value of $4000, but I didn’t claim it because 1) I don’t live near New York and 2) I didn’t want to pay the taxes on a $4000 prize.</p>
<p>I ended up not claiming the majority of the things I won because I wasn’t able to use them or attend them. In those cases, I just messaged them back and told them to give the prize to someone else. And before you report me to the IRS, yes, I reported and paid taxes on all of the winnings I actually accepted/received.</p>
<p>I had a lot of pretty interesting interactions with the unwashed masses of Twitter, like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture.png" alt="Capture" width="441" height="98" srcset="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture.png 441w, https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture-300x67.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px"></a></p>
<p>Most contests informed the winners by direct message, and a lot of people have an automatic direct message sent to you when you follow them (like the one above), so I had to spend a decent amount of time going though my DMs to find legit winner notifications.</p>
<p>In a strange turn of events, I even encountered an example of someone offering MY autograph as a prize. I have no idea how they were going to pull that off, because I had never even heard of this person.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wait-what2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wait-what2.png" alt="wait what2" width="598" height="115" srcset="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wait-what2.png 598w, https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wait-what2-300x58.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px"></a></p>
<p>Some people thought it would be hilarious if they mimicked contests by tweeting things like “RT this and you could win absolutely nothing!!”. Naturally, my bot found those tweets and dutifully retweeted them. So there were several instances of me winning “absolutely nothing”. Another variation on that was this guy who offered a unique prize:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lids.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lids.png" alt="lids" width="593" height="450" srcset="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lids.png 593w, https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/lids-300x228.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"></a>Yes indeed, I won this contest and the fantastic prize of warped “tupaware” lids. Unfortunately, like lots of other contests, I never got anything in the mail.</p>
<p>After a while of winning contests, I realized I could use my bot for good too. Lots of people raise money for charities by asking people to retweet. Something like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture1.png" alt="Capture" width="582" height="93" srcset="https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture1.png 582w, https://www.hscott.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Capture1-300x48.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 582px) 100vw, 582px"></a></p>
<p>Sometimes they’re fake, but what do I care? I added search terms for tweets like this and had enough bandwidth to retweet every tweet of this kind without going over the rate limit.</p>
<p>If you want to see the full list of stuff I won, it’s <a href="http://hscott.net/winnings.txt">here</a>. There are a few gems in there I’ve leave it to you to discover.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Lately, I’ve been playing around with inventing a visual writing system for lambda calculus.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda calculus</a> (λ-calculus) is a sort of proto-functional-programming, originally invented by Alonzo Church while he was trying to solve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem">the same problem</a> that led Turing to invent Turing machines. It’s another way of reasoning about computation.</p>

<p>Python’s lambda is an idea that was borrowed from λ-calculus. In Python, you can use a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions">lambda expression</a> like the following in order to define a function that returns the square of a number:</p>



<p>In λ-calculus, the idea is the same: we create a function by using <code>λ</code> to specify which arguments a function takes in, then we give an expression for the function’s return value. Pure lambda calculus doesn’t include operators of any sort –&nbsp;just functions being applied to other functions –&nbsp;so if we try to write a <code>square</code> function, we have to suppose that <code>multiply</code> is a function of two variables that has already been defined:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>square = λx. multiply x x
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>square</code> function, once defined, can be applied to arguments and evaluated into something simpler.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>square 4 = (λx. multiply x x) 4
         = multiply 4 4
         = 16
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One of the cool things about lambda calculus is that we can represent most common programming abstractions using λ-calculus, even though it’s nothing but functions: numbers, arithmetic, booleans, lists, if statements, loops, recursion… the list goes on. Before I introduce the visual writing system I’ve been using, let’s take a detour and discuss how we can represent numbers and arithmetic using lambda calculus.</p>

<h2 id="church-numerals-in-lambda-calculus">Church numerals, in lambda calculus</h2>
<p>Alonzo Church figured out how to represent numbers as lambda functions; these numbers are referred to as Church numerals.</p>

<p>We can represent any nonnegative integer as long as we have two things: (1) a value for <strong>zero</strong>, and (2) a <strong>successor</strong> function, which returns <code>n + 1</code> for any number <code>n</code>. To represent numbers as functions, then, we require that <code>z</code> (zero) and <code>s</code> (successor) be passed in as arguments, and go from there. Each number is actually secretly a function of those two inputs.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>zero = λs. λz. z
one = λs. λz. s z
two = λs. λz. s (s z)
three = λs. λz. s (s (s z))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The actual details of how to implement zero and successor should be implemented as are left as someone else’s problem — we can survive without them. All we care about is that our numbers do the right thing, given whatever zero and successor someone may provide.</p>

<p>What about <strong>addition</strong>? Addition is a function that takes in two numbers (let’s call them <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>), and produces a number representing their sum. To sum them together, we’ll want to produce a number that applies <code>s</code>, the successor function, a total of <code>x + y</code> times. For example, we could first apply it <code>y</code> times to the zero, then apply it <code>x</code> more times to that result.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus = λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s try proving that one plus one equals two. In λ-calculus, this proof looks like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>one = λs. λz. s z
two = λs. λz. s (s z)

plus = λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))

plus one one = (λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))) one one
             = λs. λz. one s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. (λs. λz. s z) s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. s (one s z)
             = λs. λz. s ((λs. λz. s z) s z)
             = λs. λz. s (s z)
             = two
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Long, but at least conciser than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principia_Mathematica">Bertrand Russell’s</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="lambda-circuitry">Lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>There are a lot of lambdas, parentheses, and arguments being pushed around in that proof. Mentally matching up parentheses is annoying. Scope is especially annoying: which <code>s</code> am I looking at again in <code>λs. λz. (λs. λz. s z) s (one s z)</code>, the inner one or the outer one?</p>

<p>A linear string of lambdas and parentheses is an ineffective way to provide intuition for the computations that are taking place. This problem isn’t unique to lambda calculus, either; consider trying to represent a binary tree using a linear string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Node(2, Node(7, Leaf(2), Node(6, Leaf(5), Leaf(11))), Node(5, None, Node(9, Leaf(4), None)))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unambiguous, but not very intuitive. Contrast that representation with the diagram we use when we’re trying to explain that same binary tree at a chalkboard, a more visual notation:</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Binary_tree.svg/288px-Binary_tree.svg.png" alt="Binary tree diagram, from Wikipedia"></p>

<p><em>Image from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Binary_tree.svg">Wikipedia</a>.</em></p>

<p>I remember programming constructs better when I can reason about them visually like this: when I imagine cutting an array in half for binary search, when I imagine pointers in a linked list being shuffled around to insert a new element, and when I imagine traversing up and down the branches of a binary tree.</p>

<p>Why can’t lambda calculus get some visual intuitions, in the same way? Lambda calculus is a dance of variables flowing through and being manipulated by functions, and I want a writing system for lambda calculus that will visually display this dance. It shouldn’t look like strings of parentheses and symbols: it should create visual intuition.</p>

<p>After some trial and error, here is the system I came up with. I aimed for something that would resemble circuitry.</p>

<p><strong>Values</strong> flow along wires, where they may be passed in as arguments to functions or applied as functions themselves. Some are inputs, some are outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Functions</strong> are represented as boxes which are applied to their inputs on one side and produce a single output on the other. The notation must indicate which function is applied; this may either be drawn within the box itself, or wired in to the middle of the box from some other value.</p>

<p><strong>Arguments</strong> are represented as inputs, coming in from the right side of the diagram; these arguments might pass through functions, or they might be functions-to-apply themselves. If an argument has not been passed in yet, it’s an empty arrow beginning a wire; if an argument has been passed in, its value is attached to the wire. Arguments are always passed in from top to bottom, in order.</p>

<p>As an example, here’s a function which takes in two functions, <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>, then a value <code>x</code>, and returns <code>f (g x)</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-f-g-x.png" alt="lambda f. lambda g. lambda x. f (g x)"></p>

<p>As another example, here’s the M combinator <code>M = λx. x x</code> (the “mockingbird” in <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A1P096Y"><em>To Mock a Mockingbird</em></a>):</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/m-combinator.png" alt="lambda x. x x"></p>

<h2 id="church-numerals-in-lambda-circuitry">Church numerals, in lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>Here’s the Church numeral <code>four = λs. λz. s (s (s (s z)))</code>, drawn out in lambda circuitry:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-four.png" alt="Four, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>Let’s take that proof from earlier that one plus one is two. What does it look like to draw that proof in lambda circuitry, instead?</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-oneplusoneistwo.png" alt="Proof that one plus one is two, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<p>We could also consider <strong>multiplication</strong>. A multiply function would take in two numbers, m and n, and computes a new number which is their product. In lambda calculus, we’d write:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>multiply = λm. λn. λs. λz. m (n s) z
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the notation of lambda circuitry, this looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply.png" alt="Multiplication function, in lambda circuitry"></p>

<p>Using this function, we can check that <code>multiply 2 3</code> evaluates to <code>6</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-1.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-2.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 2"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-3.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 3"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-4.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 4"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-multiply-5.png" alt="Multiply(2, 3), step 5"></p>

<p>∎</p>

<h2 id="sidenote-de-bruijn-indices">Sidenote: De Bruijn indices</h2>
<p>One of the nice things about lambda circuitry is that it completely removes the need for variable names.</p>

<p>There’s another notation for lambda calculus that does this too: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index"><em>De Bruijn indices</em></a>. A lambda expression written with De Bruijn indices indicates which variables are used where with a positive integer; the smaller the integer, the more recently the argument it refers to was passed in.</p>

<p>For example, the identity function <code>λx. x</code> may be written with De Bruijn indices like so:</p>



<p>The Church numeral for two, <code>λs. λz. s (s z)</code>, may be written like so:</p>



<p>The addition function, <code>λx. λy. (λs. λz. x s (y s z))</code>, may be written like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus = λ λ (λ λ 4 2 (3 2 1))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An evaluation of <code>plus one one</code> looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>plus one one = (λ λ (λ λ 4 2 (3 2 1))) (λ λ 2 1) (λ λ 2 1)
             = (λ (λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 (3 2 1))) (λ λ 2 1)
             = λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 ((λ λ 2 1) 2 1)
             = λ λ (λ λ 2 1) 2 (2 1)
             = λ λ 2 (2 1)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One of the tricky things about writing a lambda calculus interpreter is getting the renaming rules right; De Bruijn indices are convenient because they remove the need for this. Lambda circuitry is similar in spirit to De Bruijn indices in that it doesn’t require variable names at all, but instead indicates which variables are passed where by connecting values directly to an arrow indicating when they were passed in.</p>

<h2 id="argument-switching-function-in-lambda-circuitry">Argument-switching function, in lambda circuitry</h2>

<p>I’ll provide more examples just to further demonstrate how the notation works in different situations. Let’s consider the “argument-switching” function <code>C</code>, where <code>C f x y</code> returns <code>f y x</code>. (This is actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B,C,K,W_system">C combinator</a>.)</p>



<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator.png" alt="C combinator"></p>

<p>Suppose we try applying this to a silly function <code>f</code> where <code>f x y</code> discards <code>y</code> and just returns <code>x</code>. Then, <code>C f</code> should switch around <code>f</code>‘s arguments and create a function which returns <code>y</code> instead. Let’s check:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>f = λx. λy. x

C f = λf. λx. λy. (f y x) f
    = λx. λy. f y x
    = λx. λy. (λx. λy. x) y x
    = λx. λy. y
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/lambda-f.png" alt="f = lambda x. lambda y. x"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-1.png" alt="C(f), step 1"></p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/c-combinator-of-f-2.png" alt="C(f), step 2"></p>

<p>We could also try a function <code>g</code> where <code>g x y</code> returns <code>x y</code>. Then <code>C g x y</code> should return <code>y x</code>. Let’s check:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>g = λx. λy. x y

C g x y = λf. λx. λy. (f y x) g x y
        = g y x
        = (λx. λy. x y) y x
        = y x

<p><a href="http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/"><em>To Dissect a Mockingbird</em></a> describes a notation that is actually very similar to the one I’ve described, and demonstrates it on various problems from <em>To Mock a Mockingbird</em>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>
  Everybody loves remote work until it’s time to get promoted.
  </p>
  <p>
  In 2015, Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom conducted a <a href="https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/wfh.pdf">work from home experiment</a> in China with Ctrip, a 16,000-employee, NASDAQ-listed Chinese travel agency.
  </p>
  <p>
  The study found that remote workers had a 13 percent performance increase over onsite employees as well as better work satisfaction and lower turnover. 
  </p>
  <p>
  But the study also found that remote workers were still about <em>50 percent less likely</em> to get a performance-based promotion than the onsite employees. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Focus group interviews reveal how supervisors did not notice home-based employees’ performance as much and were less likely to promote them. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Another reason behind reduced promotion rates might be that WFH employees lack opportunities to develop the interpersonal skills to succeed in managerial jobs. 
  </p>
  <p>
  If you’re not taking the opportunity to communicate <a href="https://www.careerfair.io/reviews/howtobragatwork">your progress</a>, then people may equate your lack of presence with a lack of skill. 
  </p>
  <p>
  A substantial amount of the remote workers in the study returned to the office once given the choice. This was done to avoid what they perceived as a WFH promotion ‘discrimination’ penalty. 
  </p>
  <h2>Out Of Sight, Out Of Mind</h2>
  
  
  <p>
  The above highlights the important difference between <em>remote first </em>companies and <em>remote friendly </em>companies. 
  </p>
  <p>
  At remote first companies like Gitlab and Buffer, everyone works remotely. These companies have specific communication protocols in place and the appropriate documentation needed to succeed in such an environment. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The promotion worries, though, tend to arise when you work at a remote friendly company. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Remote friendly companies treat remote as a <em>perk</em>. It’s not the status quo and is still treated as a privilege. 
  </p>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_promotionremote/friendly_first.png" alt="">
  </center>
  <p>
  Sure, moving home to Florida to be closer to your aging parents sounds wonderful, but what happens when your coworkers don’t decide to relocate and continue going into the office?
  </p>
  <p>
  Turns out there’s some more research that looks at exactly this. 
  </p>
  <h2>Passive Face Time</h2>
  
  
  <p>
  A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0018726709353139">study</a> by researchers at UC Davis from 10 years ago coins the term <em>passive face time</em>. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The term doesn’t refer to active interactions with coworkers, but rather to just being seen in the workplace.
  </p>
  <p>
  As long as you’re observed at work, you accumulate passive face time. No one actually needs to know what you’re working on or how well of a job you’re doing. It’s entirely independent of actual performance.
  </p>
  <p>
  The study notes that even when onsite and remote employees are equally productive, supervisors might evaluate them differently because of differences in their passive face time.
  </p>
  <p>
  One of the more interesting findings of the study is that managers seem to interpret passive face time as an indicator of specific traits. So individuals that are credited with more passive face time may be viewed as more responsible, dependable, and committed. Traits that you’d directly correlate with promotion. 
  </p>
  <center>
    <img src="https://www.careerfair.io/assets_promotionremote/graph.png" alt="">
  </center>
  <p>
  The context of passive face time (i.e during regular hours versus outside-of-normal work hours) also appears important to the particular traits that managers assigned to those displaying passive face time. 
  </p>
  <p>
  For example, coming in early to work and leaving 30min before most people leave may help you beat traffic, but from your manager’s perspective that passive face time may be discounted. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Finally, these trait inferences appear to be made subconsciously, without intent or knowledge of the process by the managers. 
  </p>
  <p>
  In an ideal world, yes, you’d be judged purely on performance. But the real world is messy and subject to biases like the above. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The ongoing transition to remote work is still in the honeymoon stage. It’s easy to only look at the tremendous freedom it offers. And also most likely a mistake.  
  </p>
  <h2>Credit</h2>

<p>Hawaiian Airlines has announced that it will adopt a stricter mask policy to curb the spread of novel coronavirus pandemic. </p>



<p>Hawaiian no longer allows guests wearing mesh or sheer face coverings or valve masks, including <a aria-label="exhaust vents (opens in a new tab)" href="https://kokpitherald.com/american-airlines-new-masks-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exhaust vents</a> of any kind to board flights. Last week, <a href="https://kokpitherald.com/american-airlines-new-masks-policy/" target="_blank" aria-label="American Airlines (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Airlines</a>&nbsp;also announced that masks&nbsp;with exhaust valves or vents would no longer be allowed.</p>
 <!-- A generated by theme --> 



 <!-- end A --> 





<p>The airline has updated it mask policy following a <a aria-label="determination by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">determination by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> that they donʻt effectively block respiratory droplets. A plastic face shield may be worn in addition to a mask, but not in lieu of one.</p>



<p>The CDC notes that face coverings with one-way valves or vents allow exhaled air to be expelled through holes in the material. These can allow exhaled respiratory droplets to reach others and potentially spread the coronavirus.</p>



<p>The airline, whose face mask requirement has been in place since May 8, enhanced its face covering policy for both passengers and employees, requiring all travelers 2 years of age and older to wear a face mask or covering at the airport and during the flight.</p>



<p>The airline will no longer allow masks made with mesh or sheer material or equipped with valves, and initiatiate a new health screening for those unable to wear a face mask or covering due to a medical condition or disability.</p>

<p>Passengers who are unable to wear a face mask or covering due to a medical condition or disability must now undergo a personal medical assessment at the airport to be cleared to board​. Travellers requesting an exemption should arrive at the airport early as the assessment may take up to one hour.</p>



<p>“We are adjusting and reinforcing our layered safety protocols to ensure we’re providing the highest level of comfort and protection for our employees and guests,” said Jeff Helfrick, vice president of airport operations at Hawaiian Airlines. “We appreciate everyone’s understanding and cooperation in keeping Hawaii a safe destination.”</p>

<p>As part of its “Keeping You Safe” program, Hawaiian last month added a new step to its check-in process requiring guests to complete a health acknowledgment form indicating they are free of COVID-19 symptoms and will wear a face mask or covering for the entirety of their journey.</p>



<p>The health and safety program for guests and employees also features enhanced cleaning measures, including frequent disinfecting of lobby areas, kiosks, and ticket counters, electrostatic aircraft cabin spraying, plexiglass barriers at staffed airport counters, and sanitizer wipe distribution to all guests.</p>



<p>The carrier, which has been operating a reduced schedule since March due to the pandemic and travel restrictions, will continue to cap cabin capacity at 70 percent through September to allow for onboard distancing.</p>



<h2>About Hawaiian Airlines</h2>



<p>Hawaiian has led all U.S. carriers in on-time performance for each of the past 16 years (2004-2019) as reported by the U.S. Department of Transportation. Consumer surveys by Condé Nast Traveler, Travel + Leisure and TripAdvisor have placed Hawaiian among the top of all domestic airlines serving Hawaii.</p>



<p>Now in its 91st year of continuous service, Hawaiian is Hawaii’s biggest and longest-serving airline. In 2019, Hawaiian offered nonstop flights between Hawaii and more U.S. gateway cities (13) than any other airline, along with service connecting the islands with Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, American Samoa and Tahiti. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hawaiian is operating an adjusted schedule of daily flights within the Hawaiian Islands and between Hawai‘i and the U.S. west coast to support essential travel and critical cargo services.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my Coronavirus Genome Walkthrough.</p>

<p>(Hoping someone comes out with that Vaccine Speedrun soon. This boss battle is really shaping up to be an intense one and we’ll need all the artifacts we can get.)</p>

<p>Here, I aim to provide a <em>mechanistic explanation</em> of the SARS-CoV-2 genome’s syntax and semantics. Let’s investigate what the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome actually does as if reading through code like a compiler, from nucleotides to amino acids all the way to proteins. From the four base pairs all the way up to the completed protein-coated virus, what is a virus like this is actually made of on the concrete, physical level?</p>

<h3 id="understanding-a-full-system">Understanding a Full System</h3>

<p>The underlying purpose of this essay is less about the coronavirus <em>per se</em> and more about how having a small—but functionally complete—piece of viral RNA to analyze gives me a unique opportunity to try to understand a complete self-replicating machine from scratch. This is not a feat that I would have the fortitude to manually replicate with the full human genome, for example—but the coronavirus genome, like the <a href="http://openworm.org/">nematode genome</a>, is small enough that we stand a chance at building a complete understanding. The task is perhaps akin to <a href="https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/">interpretability</a>, but for biological systems instead of artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>As a consequence, this essay is not intended to produce epidemiological conclusions; there are plenty of other sources for that! This essay is about fully understanding a biological system at the chemical and physical level.</p>

<h3 id="play-curiosity-and-mechanical-understanding">Play, Curiosity, and Mechanical Understanding</h3>

<p>Throughout this essay, I follow my curiosity in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_play">serious play</a>: if I <a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Noticing-Confusion-Sequence">notice I’m confused</a> about something, I look into it and explore it until I’m satisfied that I now understand, and that my understanding is <em>a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/#ConMec">mechanical</a> understanding</em>. Things are made of stuff! It turns out that we can understand that stuff!</p>

<p>I may skip over some details that were not confusing to me during my own research, but your journey need not be the same as mine. If you’re confused about something while reading this essay, I encourage you to go and look it up! <a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-art-of-noticing.html">Notice</a> when your curiosity arises; that’s the meditation. Together, we can <a href="http://samoburja.com/how-to-find-the-frontier-of-knowledge/">learn new things</a>.</p>

<p>This all, at least, has been my intention as I set out to create this piece! As Ken Liu said of his philosophy while translating The Three-Body Problem, “I may not have succeeded, but these were the standards I had in mind as I set about my task.”</p>

<p>Part 1, here, covers just the genome and its translation to proteins. I hope to also write a Part 2 which would cover the structure and function of those proteins, their protein-protein interactions, and the full viral life cycle.</p>

<!--Finally, as you may already be able to tell, this essay also serves as a philosophical manifesto-by-example of how to think concretely about problems in biology. Along the way, I give some of my thoughts about the role of thermodynamics in molecular biology, legibility in complex systems, pedagogy, and the future of computational modeling.-->

<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<p>As a reminder, SARS-CoV-2 is a <em>positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus</em>.</p>



<p>What does this mean we can expect?</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Single-stranded</em>: Its genome is a single strand of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA">RNA</a> (ssRNA).</li>
  <li><em>Positive-sense</em>: That single strand of RNA can be immediately translated into protein by the ribosomes of the cell it infects.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this we can also infer that one of the proteins the virus encodes for must be <em>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</em> (RdRP), a protein which synthesizes new RNA given an RNA template. That’s right: RNA → RNA. However, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a>, isn’t RNA → RNA an unconscionable heresy? Correspondingly, RdRP is not naturally found in cells! All known positive-sense ssRNA viruses therefore <em>must encode</em> RdRP in order to successfully commit this heresy.</p>



<p>…Wait a minute, the phrase “positive-sense ssRNA virus” implies the existence of <em>negative-sense</em> viruses. If those don’t encode their proteins directly, how can they possibly work?</p>

<h2 id="positive-sense-and-negative-sense">Positive sense and negative sense</h2>

<p>Negative-sense ssRNA viruses also exist! Influenza, Ebola, and measles are examples.</p>



<p>The inner contents of <em>negative-sense</em> ssRNA viruses consist not of an RNA genome but of a <em>ribonucleoprotein</em>, which incorporates both an RNA genome as well as a cohort of viral proteins capable of replicating RNA. Unlike positive-sense ssRNA viruses, negative-sense ssRNA viruses must travel with a working copy of their RNA-replicating proteins. This ribonucleoprotein has enzymatic activity!</p>

<h2 id="rdrp-as-drug-target">RdRP as drug target</h2>

<p>Since RdRP has (as far as I know) no legitimate purpose in human cells and is not naturally coded by them, might it offer a potential target for novel antiviral drugs?</p>

<p>There must be some reason that developing antivirals against this protein is technically (or socially) complicated, or I’d have expected us to do it by now – there are a lot of RNA viruses that this drug target could theoretically hit. Flagging this discrepancy for further research.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>



<p>Back to SARS-CoV-2! First, let’s get us a genome. Obviously this virus has seen some mutations as it’s spread around, as you can explore at <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global">NextStrain</a>, so we’ve technically got choices as to which one to analyze. For this thread I’ll just stick to analyzing <em>one</em> version of the genome: Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>

<p>As a reminder, each <code>A</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>T</code> in a genome is one of the four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">nucleotides</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine">adenine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine">guanine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine">cytosine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine">thymine</a>. There are actually <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/romesberg/publications.html">plenty of ways to engineer</a> different <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22850726/">unnatural base pair systems</a> by adding <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/884">artificial nucleotides</a>, and these can even be integrated into <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/98/9/4922">transcription</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24659">translation</a>, but <a href="https://carlbrannen.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/why-does-dna-only-use-4-nucleotides/">for</a> <a href="https://dreamerbiologist.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/why-did-nature-settle-on-just-four-nucleotides/">whatever</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/E6476">reason</a>, these four <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07389-2">and not others</a> are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331698/">what life ultimately ended up with</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/nucleotides.png"></p>
<p><small>The four nucleotides in DNA.</small></p>

<p>The genome of Wuhan-Hu-1 is available from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, each <code>T</code> in this string technically represents a <code>U</code>, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil">uracil</a>, RNA’s information-equivalent of thymine. The genome sequence is therefore:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1     AUUAAAGGUU UAUACCUUCC CAGGUAACAA ACCAACCAAC UUUCGAUCUC UUGUAGAUCU
61    GUUCUCUAAA CGAACUUUAA AAUCUGUGUG GCUGUCACUC GGCUGCAUGC UUAGUGCACU
121   CACGCAGUAU AAUUAAUAAC UAAUUACUGU CGUUGACAGG ACACGAGUAA CUCGUCUAUC

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>That’s 29,903 nucleotides. Since there are only four possible nucleotides, we can estimate the information compression value of each nucleotide at approximately 2 bits; the virus’s genome therefore requires only 7.5 kilobytes to store. That’s roughly as much data, byte for byte, as there are characters in this essay up to this point!</p>

<p>Lay out those 29,903 nucleobases along a ribose-phosphate backbone, reading them left to right <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directionality_(molecular_biology)">from the 5’ end to the 3’ end</a>, and bam – if that single molecule* were teleported into a cell, that’s 100% chemically sufficient** to infect a person with the plague du jour.</p>

<p>*plus the 5’ cap, discussed below</p>

<p><small>How to interpret the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome as a complete molecule.</small></p>

<h2 id="poly-a-tail">Poly-A tail</h2>

<p>First question, and perhaps the most obvious one to the naked eye – what’s with all the <code>AAAAA</code> at the end of the viral genome?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>29821 ...                                                ... AAAAAAAAAA

<p>It’s… yelling at us? Is it… suffering? Should we <a href="https://reducing-suffering.org/is-there-suffering-in-fundamental-physics/">help</a>?</p>

<p>Simple: It’s a <a href="https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/11227/why-does-the-sars-cov2-coronavirus-genome-end-in-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa">3’ poly-A tail</a>! This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">long tail of adenosine monomers</a> is extremely common in both our own cells and in RNA viruses.</p>

<p>Our own messenger RNA (mRNA) has a poly-A tail when it’s freshly produced in the nucleus so as to slow its degradation by the cell, allowing it to last long enough to be transcribed into protein. Naturally, if you’re a positive-strand RNA virus, you’re also going to want to last long enough to be transcribed into protein – so, you need the same feature, yourself.</p>

<p>Genome 0.11% explained. So far so good!</p>

<h2 id="5-cap">5’ cap</h2>

<p>While we’re discussing chemical features of mRNA, note that the viral genome presumably must also have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> – an extra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Methylguanosine">7-methylguanosine</a> at the 5’ end of its RNA strand – just like mRNAs do.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/5primecap.png"></p>
<p><small>A 5' cap, consisting of a 7-methylguanosine as well as methylation of the first two ribose sugars.</small></p>

<p>The cap is not directly shown in the viral genome sequence or mentioned in NCBI GenBank, but it is referenced in multiple papers discussing coronaviral genomes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn increased attention and stimulated numerous studies on the molecular virology of coronaviruses. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by coronaviruses to produce the 5′-cap structure and methylation modification of viral genomic RNAs.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Coronaviruses possess a cap structure at the 5′ ends of viral genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs, which is generated through consecutive methylations by virally encoded guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) and 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase). The coronaviral N7-MTase is unique for its physical linkage with an exoribonuclease (ExoN) harbored in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of coronaviruses.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Here, we have reconstituted complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation <em>in vitro</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like the poly-A tail, the 5’ cap helps the genome to be recognized and translated by ribosomes rather than destroyed by the cell’s immune response.</p>

<p>How does the virus even ensure that it receives a 5’ cap and a poly-A tail, not to mention its outer coat? Hopefully these questions will be resolved by our review of its genes and proteins… let’s move on to look at those!</p>



<p>Per the “Features” section of the genome, again from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>, here are the identifiable genes in this genome, in order:</p>

<p><strong>AWS KMS</strong> is a <strong>K</strong>ey <strong>M</strong>anagement <strong>S</strong>ervice that let you create Cryptographic keys that you can use to encrypt and decrypt data and also other keys. You can read more about it <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/overview.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="important-points-about-keys">Important points about Keys</h3>
<p>Please note that the CMK generated can only be used to encrypt small amount of data like passwords, RSA key. You can use AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) to generate, encrypt, and decrypt data keys. However, AWS KMS does not store, manage, or track your data keys, or perform cryptographic operations with data keys. You must use and manage data keys outside of AWS KMS. KMS API uses AWS KMS customer master key (CMK) in the encryption operations and they cannot accept more than 4 KB (4096 bytes) of data. To encrypt application data, use the server-side encryption features of an AWS service, or a client-side encryption library, such as the AWS Encryption SDK or the Amazon S3 encryption client.</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>

<p>The important thing in above snippet is the KeyPolicy. KMS requires a Key Administrator and Key User. As a best practice your Key Administrator and Key User should be 2 separate user in your Organisation. We are allowing all permissions to the root users.  So if your key Administrator leaves the organisation, the root user will be able to delete this key. As you can see KeyAdmin can manage the key but not use it and KeyUser can only use the key. <em>${KeyAdmin}</em> and <em>${KeyUser}</em> are parameters in the SAM template. You would be asked to provide values for these parameters during SAM Deploy. </p>
<pre><code>Parameters:
  KeyAdmin:
    Type: String
  KeyUser:
    Type: String
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-images-rajanpanchal.net/kms/parameters.jpg" alt="SAM parameters">
Next, we will create DynamoDB table. The partition key will be user id. This is enough. You can additional attributes as required.</p>
<pre><code>myDynamoDBTable: 
    Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
    Properties: 
      BillingMode: PAY_PER_REQUEST 
      AttributeDefinitions: 
        - 
          AttributeName: "userid"
          AttributeType: "S"

      KeySchema: 
        - 
          AttributeName: "userid"
          KeyType: "HASH"
</code></pre>
<p>Now, lets create the API and Lamdba handler that will process the Signup and Login requests.</p>
<pre><code>ApiGatewaySignupApi:

</code></pre>
<p>Here, we are creating 2 Lamdba handlers, one that handles singup and other handles the login. We are limiting the usage of API under <em>Auth</em> property. This is to prevent abuse of our API. We are setting two environment variables, one for database table name and another for KMS key name. We are not hard-coding the table/key names instead we let cloud formation to name it and we set it as environment variables with auto generated values. This will prevent name conflicts of resources and you can run multiple versions of your whole cloud environment. Then we set policy that allow Lamdba to access dynamoDB and the key.  You can find 'out of box' SAM policy templates <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-policy-templates.html">here</a>.With <em>Events</em>, we create the API Gateway resources.
The final part of SAM template is Output section.</p>
<pre><code>Outputs:

    Value: !Sub "https://${ApiGatewaySignupApi}.execute-api.${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/Prod/signup/"

<p>We output 2 important urls in above section, <em>ApiGatewayLoginApi</em> and <em>ApiGatewaySignupApi</em>,  We use these Urls in the frontend HTML form's <em>action</em> attribute. See below:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
						
<p>It is more than 16 years since <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a> wrote <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/06/13/how-microsoft-lost-the-api-war/">How Microsoft Lost the API War</a>. The bonds of the win32 API lock-in is broken and the free web is here to take over.</p>



<p>The web has come a long way in the past 16 years. Richer APIs, dramatic performance improvements, and an ubiquity that surpasses anything else that we as a human race have experienced. Easy of deployment is king and the easiest deployment of all is to simply browse to a web page.</p>



<p>Creating web apps has always been riddled by browser compatibility caveats. Various services have been around to test rendering across browsers and versions, and frameworks to address common scenarios have evolved to create a write-once, deploy-everywhere story.</p>



<p>The modern web browser has become our universal runtime environment. It is what Java and .net aspired to on a crazy scale. However, it is not only a runtime environment. It is the perfect client server setup to provide everything as a service.</p>



<p>With the focus shifting from the browser to the actual contents, the value of controlling your own browser engine has become less and less attractive, and last week, Mozilla begun what I think is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363424/mozilla-layoffs-quarter-staff-250-people-new-revenue-focus">the final downward spiral</a> of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">the last alternative</a> to the Google led Chrome family of browsers. </p>



<p>(There are so many things I’d like to say about this. For instance, you should know about <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">the Mozilla manifesto</a>, as well <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/15/21370020/mozilla-google-firefox-search-engine-browser">as their funding being secured for the next three years</a>. But I digress).</p>



<p>A browser engine is a hugely complex beast these days. An incredible number of backwards compatibility hacks, while ensuring high performance on both rendering and Javascript execution. Add a broad range of APIs for integration into the native host platform. Combine that with privacy and security concerns, and the code base is starting to turn into a beast.</p>



<p>Now, it seems that Google controls the leading browser engine and thus, holds the direction of the web as we know it in their hands. Google has not only won the search, contents, and personal data collection wars. They also won the API war.</p>



<p>Having a single, almost monopolistic entity controlling all these aspects of life makes me feel very uncomfortable.</p>



<p>I’ve started my own personal de-googling journey, and I know that there are many others doing the same. Taking back ownership over their email, shifting from Google Drive and Google Apps to alternatives such as Nextcloud. But also moving from platforms such as Twitter to federated alternatives such as Mastodon.</p>



<p>A lot of this is probably seen as nostalgia from an earlier generation growing old. The web has moved on and many parts of what I love about the internet are no longer in broad use. For instance, small forums are migrated to Facebook groups, IRC is taken over by freemium alternatives such as Slack, RSS feeds become less and less common, and so on. The web is being centralized and has been so over the past decades.</p>



<p>However, I believe that the tide can be turned.</p>



<p>On the contents side, early adopters are moving to federated and self-hosted services where data lock-in is impossible. Privacy concerns become more common outside of the technology sector. What is needed is great alternatives that are easy to deploy. Examples that I use are <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>, <a href="https://tt-rss.org/">ttrss</a>, <a href="https://fripost.org/">fripost</a>, and <a href="https://www.signal.org/">Signal</a>.</p>



<p>But what can be done about the API war?</p>



<p>An attractive possibility, in my view, is the raise of WebAssembly. It enables the deployment of complex applications into the browser, really turning the browser into the universal run-time environment. It does so for compiled languages and at great performance.</p>



<p>What about deploying a bare bones wasm run-time environment, and then deploy the browser into it. That way, the complex beast that is the browser of today, turns into a much more manageable animal that is the wasm run-time.</p>



<p>What would this change? Short-term, very little. Even if the Chrome engine is compiled to wasm and executed inside an outer shell, the experience and value is still delivered through a very complex code base controlled by one of the most dominant companies in human history.</p>



<p>Long-term, it would mean that the ease of deployment would apply to not only the web, but to the wasm run-time. We would  shift from the HTML/CSS/JS world to a wasm world. </p>



<p>Not only would this mean that the universal run-time becomes smaller and more manageable to maintain by multiple parties, it also opens the opportunity to shift to a optimized way to run software (the hardware requirements of the modern browser isn’t really environmentally friendly – it drives energy usage, as well as hardware obsolesce).</p>



<p>Now, all that is needed is time. An idea without execution, is merely a dream. I might be a dreamer, but I think that this is the way forward.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's way easier to build an app than you think. Using a few no-code tools online, I was able to whip up a small prototype in under 5 minutes.</p><p>The tool I used is called Glide (glideapps.com) and it pulls data from a google sheet to fill a few different templates. All I wanted to make was a simple app that lists all my previous live streams in one place, and I already had the past episodes listed on a google sheet, so I changed the formatting a little, plugged it in, and it worked.</p><p>You can add chat functionality and more to the app, but as a simple database app it worked like magic. Plus, it's free to use and experiment with.</p><p>There is one catch though, you can't then submit that app to the app store. The app functions like a basic website when you pull it up in a browser, but Glide will immediately prompt the user to add the app to your home screen. If the user does that, it functions just like you downloaded it off the app store. It's no longer in a browser, and you can even get notifications from it.</p><p>That's great because it's a free way for your potential users to download your app. But that's also bad because it's atypical. It's not the normal way you download apps, so there may be a lack of professionalism there.</p><p>Beyond that, just imagine the possibilities? You could host parties and make an app just for that one party if you wanted to create a certain vibe. It could list attendees, and information about them so everyone can network easier. You could create a scavenger hunt using different password limitations within an app. All of these are simple ideas, yes, but you don't need to be wildly unique to make something valuable.</p><p>Now, of course, there are ways to build apps with significantly more customization in design, functionality, and be able to actually publish them to the app store.</p><p>A few tools you should look at are Adalo (adalo.com) and Bubble (Bubble.io) - Adalo seems more design oriented and has almost all the functionality you need, but Bubble takes it a step further, and allows for an insane amount of integrations and action calls from different tools.</p><p>But, the point is, for 99% of your app ideas, you can build them very quickly without coding a single thing. You'll have to take the time to learn a few tools, but you won't have to worry about development or design.</p><p>Adalo, for instance, is capable of creating and hosting a two-sided platform like UpWork, including payment, etc. Anything that's been built in some way before is likely going to be super easy to build on a no-code tool. There's a lot of power in that.</p><p>If this was helpful at all, a retweet would be awesome - it really helps me, but no pressure of course!</p></div></div>]]>

<p>No self-confident, intelligent or handsome person will ever nitpick anyone else ever.
Nitpicking is for soyboys and women only.
Nitpicking ultimately includes any "correction," real or imagined of non-essential nature.
</p>

<p>I'm not just saying "You're a soyboy if you do this," I'm saying: "Only soyboys even have the desire to do this."
If you ever even feel tempted to nitpick someone about anything, you need to immediately go take a natural nude sunbath or stop drinking from plastic bottles because <strong>you need to increase your testosterone levels ASAP.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Here's Gigachad.</h2>

<img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/gifs/giga.png" alt="Gigachad" title="Gigachad">

<p>
Look at that man.
</p>

<p>
Can you imagine a man with that physiognomy saying, "AKSHUALLY, you shouldn't say 'to boldly go,' but say 'to go boldly.' It's not grammatical to split infinitives!"
</p>

<p>No millionaire with a supermodel girlfriend is ever going to feel the need to evoke some imaginary grammar rule invented by middle-school English teachers to show someone off.
<em>This</em> is the kind of person who would though:
</p>

<img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/gifs/butts.png" alt="Eric Butts" title="Eric Butts">

<p>Nitpicking is social anklebiting.
The people who do it don't do it because they are honestly attempting to exchange actually important information.
They do it because in their tourtured psyche, it somehow sticks it to someone they don't like.
</p>

<p>One immutable thing about people with a chip on their shoulder is that they are constantly looking for some technicality that proves to themselves that they are <em>actually</em> smarter than people obviously superior to them.
This is what nitpicking is.
Revenge of the Nerds.
</p>

<h3>A political aside</h3>

<p>This is also why even apart from any political issue, bugmen/journalists/middle managers hate Trump.
Trump has been a mere cringe conservaboomer, but he has a chad personality type that is devoid of pretense.
The media is used to stumping other politicians on details, asking "gotcha" questions and "fact-checking" their responses.
All nitpicking.
Trump has never cared and bullied them in return.
</p>

<p>Mediocre people lose it when someone doesn't rise to their disingenuious taunts.
Look how self-deluded the media is nowadays, how deep they follow their own lies.
That's what you look like when you nitpick.
You're fundamentally making an issue that no-one cares about because they all implicitly know it doesn't matter even if they don't have the vocabulary to call your out directly on it.</p>

<h2>Speaking about soyboys...</h2>

<p>I remember when we starting bullying effete "men" calling them soyboys on the internet.
All of the sudden, every soyboy news outlet started publishing articles defending soy consumption or trying to say that "Um ACHHUALLY, soy doesn't necessarily increase your estrogen levels!"
</p>

<p>Sheer retardation.
These responses were cherrypicking data anyway, but imagine responding to being bullied with some alledgedly factual nitpick.
It's like a kid in middle school says, "Your mom's gay," and you respond saying, "Well ACKUALLY I am living proof that my mother isn't gay!"
</p>

<p>I shouldn't need to explain that the insult could've just as well been açaiboys or something else they consoooomed.</p>

<h2>Reading groups</h2>

<p>I first realized this eternal truth about nitpicking at graduate school.
I'm ashamed to admit it's a story that involves <em>me</em> nitpicking.</p>

<p>In grad school, aside from classes you might often volunteer to participate in reading groups, which is basically you and a group of people meet once a week to discuss a recent or historical paper or book of import.*
</p>

<img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/pix/gifs/write.gif" alt="Writing" title="">


<p>One week, I was too lazy to read our article for discussion, so 30 minutes before our meeting I started skimming it, then read the first page or so in depth.
Normally I would be a productive participant, so I felt expected to give my input, but when the time came in the group, I found myself relentlessly nitpicking some (ultimately unimportant) experimental design on the first page.
After hammering it for several minutes, one of my friends reminded me, "Yeah, I don't think that's really the point..."
I shut up. He was right.
</p>

<p>I was nitpicking because I had nothing important to say, but had to prove myself in some way.
Especially as my time in grad school of all places went on, I found that other people ended up doing the same kind of thing all the time.
<strong>People focus on unimportant details only when unimportant details are the only things they understand.</strong>
A lot of bad papers, bad ideas and the like started to make sense (at least in terms of motivation) to me then.
</p>

<hr>
<blockquote>*Yes, nitpicking forgeiners who don't actually know English but like to constantly email or PR me "corrections." The phrase "<em>of import</em>" is not a mistake for "<em>of importance</em>".
</blockquote>
<hr>

<h2>When women nitpick.</h2>

<p>
Nitpicking is more excusable for women to do.
That's ultimately because men talk to others exchange important information, while women only talk to others for social negotiation and to test the social standing of others.
</p>

<p>Women will nitpick men to access their self-value.
I'll give you a grade-A "Red-Pill"®️ "lifehack": no woman will respect a man that takes a woman's taunt or nitpick as anything other than a taunt or nitpick.
If you ever respond to something like that with, "Oh Jeez... sorry honey, you're right," you might as well be walking around "DOPE" written on your forehead.
</p>

<p>Hopefully in any affair you can distinguish "nitpicks" from "things that actually matter."
Maybe not, if you have the 'tism and you're high on your own supply.
</p>

<h2>The dishonesty of nitpicking</h2>

<p>Nitpicking is so cringe because it is social striving that masquerades as important information.
It never deceives anyone but the one who does it.
It's mostly just awkward to be around when someone nitpicks someone else because you're just wondering, "Does this guy realize how much of a presumptious dweeb he is?"
</p>

<p>Again, I won't tell you not to do this, just recognize that if you are tempted to, you have other underlying feelings of inferiority to deal with.
Go increase your testosterone by living a natural life.
</p>

We are going to update this piece as new details emerge over the talk. <span id="more-46268"></span></p>
<h2>IBM Z15 Mainframe Overview</h2>
<p>A mainframe is designed differently than we see typical commodity x86 servers in many aspects. One of them is simply the way the processor complexes are constructed and delivered. A great example of this is how there is a system control chip shared between processors with a massive L4 cache. Abstracting this a bit, it is somewhat analogous to how AMD EPYC 7002 “Rome” is constructed with a chip that has a shared last-level cache. Then again, IBM z15 is bigger.</p>

<p>One of the cooler features here is that the processor chip runs at 5.2GHz on 14nm process. These are not like mainstream processors so IBM has a lot more leeway in terms of higher TDP levels and cooling methodology. The IBM z15 is the company’s second 14nm part like the z14. As one can see, IBM is following Intel in sticking on 14nm longer than other nodes.</p>

<p>We are going to note, that we covered <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ibm-power10-searching-for-the-holy-grail-of-compute/">IBM POWER10</a> earlier today.</p>
<h2>IBM z15 Drawer Level Design Overview</h2>
<p>Within the IBM Z15, processors are not designed to operate alone. Instead, there are up to four processor chips per drawer. Each drawer also has a system control chip with the L4 last level cache and to handle an interconnect. One can get up to five drawers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46271"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ibm-z15-mainframe-processor-design/hot-chips-32-ibm-z15-drawer-and-system-topology/" rel="attachment wp-att-46271"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology.jpg" alt="Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Drawer And System Topology" width="940" height="591" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology.jpg 940w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology-400x251.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology-800x503.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology-696x438.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Drawer-and-System-Topology-668x420.jpg 668w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46271">Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Drawer And System Topology</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a view of what the chipset and drawer look like:</p>

<p>On the top we have I/O above that system controller chip. Overall, this allows for up to 240 cores, 40TB of memory, and 60x PCIe x16 cards in the complete system.</p>
<h2>IBM z15 Processor Design Overview</h2>
<p>Each IBM z15 processor chip can have up to 12 cores. These cores have 4MB L2 cache and 256MB of shared L3 cache. IBM increasing a lot of the microarchitectural features versus the previous 14nm z14 design.</p>

<p>As one may imagine, IBM has a deep pipeline that is designed to operate at very high frequencies. Compared to Intel that is using much lower frequencies on its <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/intel-ice-lake-sp-next-gen-xeon-architecture-at-hc32/">Intel Ice Lake-SP Next-Gen Xeon Architecture</a>, IBM is using fewer cores that run at higher frequencies yet that still do a lot of work per core.</p>

<p>Another feature of the design is the new accelerators. One is the integrated deflate accelerator:</p>
<figure id="attachment_46275" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46275"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ibm-z15-mainframe-processor-design/hot-chips-32-ibm-z15-integrated-deflate-accelerator/" rel="attachment wp-att-46275"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator.jpg" alt="Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Integrated Deflate Accelerator" width="1487" height="902" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator.jpg 1487w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-400x243.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-800x485.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-696x422.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-1068x648.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Integrated-Deflate-Accelerator-692x420.jpg 692w" sizes="(max-width: 1487px) 100vw, 1487px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46275">Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Integrated Deflate Accelerator</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a hybrid LZ encoder and compressor. Compressing data helps the systems various memory and storage hierarchies be used more efficiently. With hardware-acceleration, these features can be added with less overhead. That hardware accelerator was previously a FPGA. That means the clock speed has gone from a few hundred megahertz to 5GHz+.</p>

<p>IBM z15 has modulo arithmetic (ECC) acceleration built-in. This increases performance which means that this encryption can be used with minimal overhead.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46277" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46277"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ibm-z15-mainframe-processor-design/hot-chips-32-ibm-z15-processor-modulo-arithmetic-ecc-acceleration-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-46277"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2.jpg" alt="Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Processor Modulo Arithmetic ECC Acceleration 2" width="1498" height="956" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2.jpg 1498w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-400x255.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-800x511.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-696x444.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-1068x682.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Hot-Chips-32-IBM-Z15-Processor-Modulo-Arithmetic-ECC-Acceleration-2-658x420.jpg 658w" sizes="(max-width: 1498px) 100vw, 1498px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46277">Hot Chips 32 IBM Z15 Processor Modulo Arithmetic ECC Acceleration 2</figcaption></figure>
<p>Something we wanted to highlight on this slide is that the 11.4x-21.8x speedup is for the on-chip z15 accelerator versus the “z14 using a Crypto Express6 PCI accelerator.” That frees up expansion slots for other uses while also increasing performance.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>We are unlikely to review a z15 at STH. Still, seeing this awesome hardware is always interesting. Hopefully, our readers will enjoy the quick look at the IBM z15.</p>

                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>In a modern data-centric business, one of the main challenges is collecting heterogenous data from different sources and converting them into a unified schema so that the data can be easily analyzed. dv01 is a market leader in data management and aggregation in the debt capital markets. Messy, disparate data is a critical issue for dv01 and in practice, a large amount of domain knowledge, manual effort, and time are required to integrate these different data sources. Data science and machine learning have a huge potential in helping automate repetitive tasks such as schema matching and data standardization, which will help streamline the workflows for data engineers and analysts.</p><p>Modern machine learning algorithms, however, require a sizable amount of structured and labelled data. Domain experts at dv01 have manually cleaned hundreds of different datasets in order to build out the data pipeline that exists today. Due to the diverse and segmented nature of the business, most of this information is embedded in individual processes, often in the form of code. It would be a daunting task to have the domain experts revisit the process or to have the data engineers refactor the code.</p><p>In this article, we will show that because we use Apache Spark as the main computing engine for data pipeline processing, we are able to extract information from key steps in the data pipeline in a systematic way without altering the existing data pipeline processes. We will also show that the extracted knowledge, in turn, can be used to improve internal processes.</p><h2 id="data-ingestion-and-integration">Data Ingestion and Integration</h2><p>In the last decade or so, data has become an essential and integral part of most businesses. As most parts of business processes become digitized, more and more data is available. However, one of the main challenges faced by many companies is in finding coherent ways to analyze vast amounts of data from many different sources.</p><p>One strategy for achieving the goal for data integration is to transform the data into a single data schema. The common schema is constructed with a lot of domain knowledge to make sure it captures a majority of the information in the original data. A single unified schema allows users to easily analyze, compare, and aggregate the data from all sources together.</p><p>Because data sources are generated by several organizations, they can have different schemas (i.e. column names, column types, values) and column definitions. In order to fit the data from these sources into a common schema, a significant number of transformations are needed in the process: mapping columns from one name to another, converting the values of a column into another set of values, combining several fields into one field in the common data schema, and calculating missing columns from existing columns. The process that transforms dataset(s) from one data source to a dataset represented in the common data schema is called a data pipeline. Domain knowledge and deep understanding of the source and unified schemas are embedded into the pipeline code by data analysts and engineers.</p><p>Data pipelines need to balance two competing factors. The first is to ensure that the design of the standardizing and normalizing process is a clean and unified one. The other factor is that data pipelines need to accommodate the complexities that exist between different data sources, the urgent timeline for business needs, and the evolving requirements the data pipelines need to satisfy over time. dv01 constructs its data pipelines by grouping data from similar sources while giving the flexibility to data analysts and data engineers to create separate pipelines for different classes of data sources and workflows. One undesirable consequence of this design to data scientists is that the domain knowledge that is embedded into the pipeline code is extremely non-uniform and unstructured.</p><h2 id="the-need-for-structured-data-for-data-pipeline-automation">The Need for Structured Data for Data Pipeline Automation</h2><p>In order to automate data cleansing and transformation, we need a structured representation of the previous work performed by domain experts. There are many steps to transform and convert raw data to a common data schema, and they require human intervention and expertise. Analysts and engineers need to thoroughly understand external file specs and our schema, as well as financial terms and formulas in order to properly standardize the data.</p><p>On the other hand, most steps of the tasks described above can be fairly mechanical once one has become familiar with the processes. In many cases, the difference between equivalent column names could be a simple permutation, a synonym, some shorthand spelling, or even misspelling of a column in another data source. If these relatively simple tasks could be handled by a computer automatically, a lot of repetitive work would be eliminated.</p><p>With the development of modern data science and machine learning algorithms, problems with non-numerical fields or high ordinance variables such as natural language contents can be handled. However, machine learning algorithms do not have any knowledge of the problem to begin with. In order for machine learning algorithms to be applied to a specific problem, we first need to have a sizable amount of data that has already been processed and mapped by human experts, called labeled data. The labeled data is then used to “train” the algorithm, so that it can “learn” how to solve the problem going forward. Large amounts of labeled data is an essential building block for useful data science and machine learning algorithms.</p><p>dv01 has been processing financial data for years. A lot of human intelligence and intellectual capital has been built into the data pipeline processes and code. As mentioned previously, the pipeline structures and code are built in a heterogenous way, &nbsp;which means the labeled data exists in our codebase in a highly unstructured way. In order to use the labeled data for machine learning, it needs to be in a structured format. Many data pipeline designs make it difficult to extract labeled data without a significant or complete rewrite of the codebase. However, dv01 has designed an innovative methodology that allows for the extraction of labeled data from a data pipeline framework built on Apache Spark platform, without the need to modify the existing data pipeline code base.</p><h2 id="spark-as-a-data-pipeline-engine">Spark as a Data Pipeline Engine</h2><p>The dv01 data pipeline runs on Apache Spark, an open-source, in-memory computing framework that is built with distributed cloud computing and parallelism architecture from the ground up. It is a cutting-edge and ideal platform for a data-driven business to build data pipelines on. There are other advantages that Spark has over other choices: a wide range of cloud ecosystems, rich functional programming models, and extensive libraries for many data related tasks.</p><h2 id="extracting-spark-query-plan-as-a-source-of-labeled-and-structured-data-for-data-science">Extracting Spark Query Plan as a Source of Labeled and Structured Data for Data Science</h2><p>Spark utilizes lazy evaluation, meaning no operation is actually performed to the data until required or explicitly instructed. Spark compiles all of the lazily evaluated actions into a query plan which is then optimized. Query plans are a great way to understand how your code is actually being executed by Spark, in case of any bottlenecks. As we discovered at dv01, it can also be a great source of data about your pipeline. Since our entire pipeline is lazily evaluated (aside from a few exceptions), all of the data transformations performed in the pipeline &nbsp;have to exist in a semi-structured way in the Spark query plan.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/62HxXnCba9WmhbvlfsSgc1YBrwIDTztqn347pfR1PMeRF-ydLLzyHbTJg-N3l3mwknQdjnmn4Yu1yfYI68bRrY3d8qDTm_GdDaWiw--ZEhX-aFtmphIVqvdpvC3pr7UsO5wfG1Yv" alt=""></figure><p>Under the hood, Spark optimizes the operations in three phases: a logical plan, an optimized plan, and a physical plan. Since the logical plan is the closest to the raw operations being written out in code and is produced in a deterministic way, this step made the most sense to extract for our purposes of understanding the pipeline.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5Jw0c1_NqNbfBVuI9OpP5JLj10Qo6e-18nZ-LWXdyzV4APrOEWHJ0wyjZ6EDl1QCvdek2PUnjZRhVitV4U6iMp5B4NLsdo9JZdiuS7dCs6X53s3qW0UDbbIOkvbQ2zZcjhjvpySs" alt=""></figure><p>All of the plans are available via the <em>queryExecution</em> attribute of a Spark DataFrame. Each plan exists in a nested structure of operations and each operation is an array of expressions that represent the actions being performed to a series of columns. Traversing this structure, one can pull out all of the operations performed on the data in a structured format. From this data, we can extract the raw columns used to calculate each field in the unified schema and the calculations applied to each of the raw columns. In essence, we are able to see all of our data pipelines - how all of our schemas map to our unified schema - simply by digging into Spark. This treasure trove of information about our pipeline allows us to pursue a variety of projects, such as automated schema mapping, value standardization, code refactoring, and improved testing.</p><h3 id="automated-schema-mapping">Automated Schema Mapping</h3><p>From the Spark query plan, we have collected thousands of mapped field name pairs from our pipelines, cleaning and storing them in a structured table. Now, with our labeled data, we have built a machine learning algorithm that scores the likelihood of a column being mapped to a dv01 schema field given the name of the column and other information. Different teams within the company have used this algorithm as part of their workflow with great success. Additionally, we have been able to utilize this capability to improve our new Tape Cracker application, so that clients can leverage the information from our pipeline to automate much of their data cleaning.</p><h3 id="automated-value-mapping-or-value-standardization">Automated Value Mapping or Value Standardization</h3><p>Another challenge that we often face in data ingestion and integration is to convert one set of enumerated values for a field into another set of values for the same field. For example, let us assume that we have a field that represents the state where an asset (i.e. house or condo) is located. In our data sources, the field can be represented by the full name of the state (New York), can be …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

And there are only two types of innovative technologies.  Those for technologists and those for everyone else.</p><p><strong>That’s it.</strong></p><p>The best magicians master methods, know their audience and are guided by effect.  The same is true for the best technologists, start-ups and innovators.</p><h2>Know your audience</h2><p>Tricks for magicians focus on <em>method</em>.  Tricks for audiences obsess over <em>effect</em>; how an <em>audience</em> experiences the illusion and how well the trick meets or exceeds their need to be entertained and mystified.</p><h4>Magician to magician tricks</h4><p>The audience are other experts in a technical subject matter, i.e. sleights of hand, gimmicks and so on.</p><p>This does two things.</p><ol><li>It raises the bar in terms of what is necessary to fool the audience.  The information asymmetry between performer and audience is minimal, unlike a lay audience who typically know very little / zero magical technique.</li><br><li>It changes the quality of enjoyment.  Although lay audiences like to <em>guess</em> at methods (more on that later), magicians <em>analyse</em> tricks to reverse engineer them, and this is part of the fun magicians experience.</li></ol><p>A magician to magician trick therefore succeeds best when it is a “magician fooler”.  It does so in two ways.</p><p>First, the audience magicians enjoy exhausting their magical knowledge.  They feel smart, but challenged applying their expertise to reverse engineer another’s efforts at creating something new and cutting edge.  The fact they failed, can be invigorating, affirming that there is more to learn!</p><p>Second, because the audience magicians understand method they are no longer able to experience <em>effect</em>; doing something that allows them to be fooled again creates a very rare experience, and huge value.  It satiates a need.</p><p>Tech is no different.  Engineer to engineer presentations / applications of technology are designed to wow on the basis of their technical complexity and ingenuity’ to create a FOMO that one engineer has mastered or discovered something another has not, and sometimes push debate and enquiry.</p><h4>Magician to muggle tricks</h4><p>For lay audience tricks, everything is effect. But wait, don’t audiences love guessing the methods of a magician’s tricks?</p><p>Of course they do, but don’t confuse audience enjoyment <em>guessing</em> secrets vs. having them revealed.</p><blockquote><p>Audiences <em>want</em> the secret, but <em>need</em> the effect.  <br></p><p>If you give them the secret, there is <em>no</em> effect.</p></blockquote><figure><img loading="lazy" width="720" height="603" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prestige-secret.jpg" alt="The Prestige - They'll beg you and they'll flatter you for the secret - Alfred Borden

Great magicians execute on needs, not wants.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="378" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prestige-want-to-be-fooled.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prestige-want-to-be-fooled.jpg 700w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prestige-want-to-be-fooled-300x162.jpg 300w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prestige-want-to-be-fooled-585x316.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prestige-want-to-be-fooled.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>Alfred Borden – <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/">The Prestige</a></figcaption></figure><p>And so with tech. Although a knowing focus on the method – AI, blockchain, search, rules etc – might grab attention, especially if said tech is flavour of the month in hyped up media coverage, it also distracts from what the user needs, the problems they have and the best solution for the job.</p><p>In the end, this serves neither user nor technologist.  So how can technologists learn from magicians?</p><h2>The (Successful) Magician’s Secret</h2><p>Successful magicians perform for lay audiences. After all, it’s an art form intended primarily to fool non-magician audiences. Likewise, business and consumer-facing technology is designed for end-users who aren’t computer scientists.</p><p>Assuming you are a technologist designing, building, marketing, pitching, implementing or driving adoption of, some new product or service – what is it you can learn from the likes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Blaine">David Blaine,</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield">David Copperfield</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_(magician)">Dynamo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_%26_Teller">Penn &amp; Teller</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derren_Brown">Derren Brown</a> to wow your business and consumer audience?</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="565" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/magic_cabinet.jpg" alt="Kellar Magician with Magic Cabinet" srcset="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/magic_cabinet.jpg 800w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/magic_cabinet-300x212.jpg 300w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/magic_cabinet-768x542.jpg 768w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/magic_cabinet-585x413.jpg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/magic_cabinet.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure><h4>Master your methods, prioritise by effect</h4><p>Mastery of method enables excellence at effect.  The greatest magicians seek out, voraciously study and obsessively practice methods.  They also test, test, test them on audiences, improving them or changing them over time.</p><p>But they do so, guided by effect.</p><p>They are seeking the best method, or combination of methods, that produce the best effect.  In many cases, this will be the method or methods that allow most room for <em>presentation</em> and <em>execution</em>.</p><p>These two factors – presentation and execution – are what separate dull from good and good from incredible, even if the underlying trick, plot or method is identical between two magicians.</p><p>In other words, attention on the audience’s needs and experience.  Great technology does the same.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="608" height="511" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/prestige-trick-impresses-no-one.jpg" alt="The Prestige - The secret impresses no one - Alfred Borden\

But not easy</h4><p>In the 2006 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a> film, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/">The Prestige</a>, chronicling two rival magicians there is a central magic trick.  Not only is this a real trick, but it also doubles up as the central plot twist.</p><p>Without spoiling the film, this conceit is – as the magician Borden puts it – incredibly simple, but not easy.</p><p>Indeed, a central plot point is the failure of the rival magician to comprehend that the first magician’s effect (i.e. product) could be achieved so simply, instead obsessing over unnecesary, dangerous and overly complex technological innovations to achieve the same effect.</p><p>And this is a key lesson.</p><p>Too often, magicians and technologists obsess over the complex, and disregard simpler alternatives.  The allure of the complex is also a risk for users and innovators in their organisations.  If you’ve ever heard someone say “we should get an AI” or “can we use some AI” when what they need is a simple Word macro you know what we mean.</p><p>But this isn’t to say simple is easy.</p><p>Often simple done well is just as hard as clever, but for different reasons.</p><p>Simple enables thinking space to focus on execution against needs.</p><p>In magic this is mostly presentation. In technology this is the product-market fit, UX, whether or not your solution solves a real and significant problem for your users and so on.</p><h4>Check your geek</h4><p>As a result, the best technologists and start-ups keep abreast of new ideas, experiment with them but importantly <strong>check their geek</strong>.  They weigh up, often with others (product specialists, users and so on), what <em>best</em> solves the user’s problem.</p><p>In most cases, best isn’t cleverest or the most cutting edge shiny new thing.  It might be, but it often isn’t or if it is, it is one variable in a much larger equation that must not distract from solving the problem.</p><p>Which leads nicely into…</p><h4>Don’t forget what you have / know</h4><p>Magicians are famously greedy, gobbling up new tricks as they launch.  The best magicians keep this in check, often preferring to perfect existing techniques rather than chase the latest shiny object.</p><p>Technology is no different.</p><p>During the Space Race, Nasa invested millions designing an over engineered pen that could write in zero gravity where, it was assumed, ink would not flow toward the nib.  Russia simply gave its Cosmonauts standard pencils, which work on earth as they do in zero G.  Same result: hugely different costs.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="863" height="1024" src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-863x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-863x1024.jpg 863w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-253x300.jpg 253w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-768x911.jpg 768w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-585x694.jpg 585w, https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen.jpg 910w" sizes="(max-width: 863px) 100vw, 863px" data-src="https://lawtomated.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/spacepen-863x1024.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>© <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/saga-writing-space">Smithsonian National Air &amp; Space Museum</a></figcaption></figure><p>It’s a great story, but it’s <strong>not</strong> true (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_in_space">here</a> for the real story, or the link under the above photo).</p><p>Nevertheless, it’s an instructive parable.</p><p>Don’t rush to the most cutting edge solution if all the user needs is something simple, and in the above example, something you might already have but not think to use.</p><h4>Shiny objects are often sharp</h4><p>Not all magic tricks are harmless card tricks.  For instance, the infamous Russian Roulette trick.</p><p>The plot goes something like this:</p><blockquote><p>The magician presents a sharp nail on a wooden base, which is placed point up under a polystyrene cup.</p><p>Next, the magician introduces additional upside down polystyrene cups and then asks a spectator to shuffle the cups until it is no longer possible for anyone to identify which cup conceals the nail.</p><p>Afterwards, the magician then has the spectator eliminate cups one by one, often reshuffling the cups after each selection to increase the “randomness” and make it even harder to identify the dangerous cup from the safe one(s).</p><p>Eventually, two cups remain. The magician asks the spectator to choose one of the remaining cups.</p><p>This time the magician does not remove the chosen cup.</p><p>Instead, the magician slams either their palm, or the spectator’s, onto the final remaining cup.</p></blockquote><p>There is either a shared outtake of breath from the audience followed by a cheer… or gasps of horror.</p><p>The former is when this trick goes well… the magician magically avoids the nail, knowing all along via “psychic” skills where the dangerous nail hid.</p><p>The latter is what happens when the trick goes wrong, i.e. nail through hand = hospital visit.  No more show bookings.  Potential lawsuits.  And so on!</p><p>This trick has, and continues, to go wrong from time to time, injuring magicians and spectators, including on live TV.   See below if you aren’t squeamish.  The UK”s most famous magician, Derren Brown, has even gotten this badly wrong during rehearsals (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIqzfsfpMv0">here</a>).</p><figure><div><div data-mode="normal" data-provider="youtube" id="arve-RIqzfsfpMv0" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/VideoObject"><p><meta itemprop="embedURL" content="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RIqzfsfpMv0?iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;autoplay=0"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" name="" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-presentation allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox" scrolling="no" width="480" height="270" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RIqzfsfpMv0?iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;autohide=1&amp;playsinline=1&amp;autoplay=0" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p></div></div></figure><p>So what’s this got to do with technology?</p><p>Well this is a reminder of why mastery of method is critical, even if the focus is on its relationship to effect.</p><p>If the method isn’t clear, safe, and bug-free, for end-users to rely upon in different settings it can harm.</p><p>The same is true of technology.</p><p>It is often more true for new and “high tech” solutions that aren’t yet well understood by end-users… and sometimes by the technologists themselves, who’ve simply copied and pasted some code, or installed a code library.</p><p>AI is a good example.</p><p>Today’s AI relies heavily on data, statistics, probability, linear algebra and calculus.  Most of these components are poorly understood by users in isolation, let alone in combination when used to deliver AI solutions.  Some software engineers building such systems don’t really understand the underlying math, and in some scenarios this doesn’t matter in order to build good products, but in others it absolutely does.</p><p>For instance, simple misunderstandings regarding the <a href="https://lawtomated.com/accuracy-precision-recall-and-f1-scores-for-lawyers/">accuracy …</a></p></div></div>

<p>Natural language processing is a very exciting field right now. In recent years, the community has begun to figure out some pretty effective methods of learning from the enormous amounts of unlabeled data available on the internet. The success of transfer learning from unsupervised models has allowed us to surpass virtually all existing benchmarks on downstream supervised learning tasks. As we continue to develop new model architectures and unsupervised learning objectives, "state of the art" continues to be a rapidly moving target for many tasks where large amounts of labeled data are available.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>One major advantage as models continue to grow is that we see a very slow decrease in the reliance on large amounts of annotated data for downstream tasks. This week the team at Open AI released a preprint describing their largest model yet, GPT-3, with 175 billion parameters. The paper is entitled, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165">"Language Models are Few-Shot Learners"</a>, and shows that extremely large language models can perform competitively on downstream tasks with far less task-specific data than would be required by smaller models.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>However, models of this size remain impractical for real-world use. For instance, the largest version of GPT-3 must be partitioned across dozens of GPUs to even fit in memory. In many real-world settings, annotated data is either scarse or unavailable entirely. Models much smaller than GPT-3 such as BERT have still been shown to encode a tremendous amount of information in their weights (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01066">Petroni et al. 2019</a>). It seems like if we were smart about it, we would be able to figure out some techniques for applying these models to downstream tasks in a way that takes advantage of this latent information without the need for so much task-specific annotated data.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>Of course, <em>some</em> research has in fact been done in this area. <strong>In this post, I will present a few techniques, both from published research and our own experiments at Hugging Face, for using state-of-the-art NLP models for sequence classification without large annotated training sets.</strong></p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="What-is-zero-shot-learning?">What is zero-shot learning?<a href="#What-is-zero-shot-learning?"> </a></h2><p>Traditionally, zero-shot learning (ZSL) most often referred to a fairly specific type of task: learn a classifier on one set of labels and then evaluate on a different set of labels that the classifier has never seen before. Recently, especially in NLP, it's been used much more broadly to mean <em>get a model to do something that it wasn't explicitly trained to do.</em> A well-known example of this is in the <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9405/cc0d6169988371b2755e573cc28650d14dfe.pdf">GPT-2 paper</a> where the authors evaluate a language model on downstream tasks like machine translation without fine-tuning on these tasks directly.</p>
<p>The definition is not all that important, but it is useful to understand that the term is used in various ways and that we should therefore take care to understand the experimental setting when comparing different methods. For example, traditional zero-shot learning requires providing some kind of descriptor (<a href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/romera-paredes15.pdf">Romera-Paredes et al. 2015</a>) for an unseen class (such as a set of visual attributes or simply the class name) in order for a model to be able to predict that class without training data. Understanding that different zero-shot methods may adopt different rules for what kind of class descriptors are allowed provides relevant context when communicating about these techniques.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<h2 id="A-latent-embedding-approach">A latent embedding approach<a href="#A-latent-embedding-approach"> </a></h2><p>A common approach to zero shot learning in the computer vision setting is to use an existing featurizer to embed an image and any possible class names into their corresponding latent representations (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3666">Socher et al. 2013</a>). They can then take some training set and use only a subset of the available labels to learn a linear projection to align the image and label embeddings. At test time, this framework allows one to embed any label (seen or unseen) and any image into the same latent space and measure their distance.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>In the text domain, we have the advantage that we can trivially use a single model to embed both the data and the class names into the same space, eliminating the need for the data-hungry alignment step. This is not a new technique – researchers and practitioners have used pooled word vectors in similar ways for some time (such as <a href="https://www.elen.ucl.ac.be/Proceedings/esann/esannpdf/es2016-174.pdf">Veeranna et al. 2016</a>). But recently we have seen a dramatic increase in the quality of sentence embedding models. We therefore decided to run some experiments with Sentence-BERT, a recent technique which fine-tunes the pooled BERT sequence representations for increased semantic richness, as a method for obtaining sequence and label embeddings.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>To formalize this, suppose we have a sequence embedding model $\Phi_\text{sent}$ and set of possible class names $C$. We classify a given sequence $x$ according to,</p><p>
$$
\hat{c} = \arg\max_{c \in C} \cos(\Phi_\text{sent}(x), \Phi_\text{sent}(c))
$$</p><p>where $\cos$ is the cosine similarity. Here's an example code snippet showing how this can be done using Sentence-BERT as our embedding model $\Phi_\text{sent}$:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>One problem with this method is that Sentence-BERT is designed to learn effective sentence-level, not single- or multi-word representations like our class names. It is therefore reasonable to suppose that our label embeddings may not be as semantically salient as popular word-level embedding methods (i.e. word2vec). This is seen in the t-SNE visualization below where the data seems to cluster together by class (color) reasonably well, but the labels are poorly aligned. If we were to use word vectors as our label representations, however, we would need annotated data to learn an alignment between the S-BERT sequence representations and the word2vec label representations.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>In some of our own internal experiments, we addressed this issue with the following procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the top $K$ most frequent words $V$ in the vocabulary of a word2vec model</li>
<li>Obtain embeddings for each word using word2vec, $\Phi_{\text{word}}(V)$</li>
<li>Obtain embeddings for each word using S-BERT, $\Phi_{\text{sent}}(V)$</li>
<li>Learn a least-squares linear projection matrix $Z$ with L2 regularization from $\Phi_{\text{sent}}(V)$ to $\Phi_{\text{word}}(V)$</li>
</ol>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>Since we have only learned this projection for embeddings of single words, we cannot expect it to learn an effective mapping between S-BERT sequence representations and labels embedded with word2vec. Instead, we use $Z$ in our classification only as an additional transformation to S-BERT embeddings for both sequences and labels:</p><p>
$$
\hat{c} = \arg\max_{c \in C} \cos(\Phi_{\text{sent}}(x)Z, \Phi_{\text{sent}}(c)Z)
$$</p><p>This procedure can be thought of as a kind of dimensionality reduction. As seen in the t-SNE visual below, this projection makes the label embeddings much better aligned with their corresponding data clusters while maintining the superior performance of S-BERT compared to pooled word vectors. Importantly, this procedure does not require any additional data beyond a word2vec dictionary sorted by word frequency.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>On the Yahoo Answers topic classification task, we find an F1 of $46.9$ and $31.2$ with and without this projection step, respectively. For context, Yahoo Answers has 10 classes and <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/sota/text-classification-on-yahoo-answers">supervised models</a> get an accuracy in the mid 70s.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<div>
<p>This technique is flexible and easily adapted to the case where a limited amount of labeled data is available (few-shot learning) or where we have annotated data for only a subset of the classes we're interested in (traditional zero-shot learning).</p>
<p>To do so, we can simply learn an additional least-squares projection matrix to the embeddings of any available labels from their corresponding data embeddings. However, it is important that we do so in a way that does not overfit to our limited data. Our embeddings perform well on their own, so we need to find a projection between them that learns from what training data we have while still utilizing the semantic richness of these representations.</p>
<p>To this end, we add a variant of L2 regularization which pushes the weights towards the identity matrix rather than decreasing their norm. If we define $X_{Tr}, Y_{Tr}$ to be our training data and labels and $\Phi(X) = \Phi_\text{sent}(X)Z$ to be our embedding function as described above, our regularized objective is,</p><p>
$$
W^\ast = \arg\min || \Phi(X)^\top W - \Phi(Y) ||^2 + \lambda ||W - \mathbb{I}_d||^2
$$</p><p>This is equivalent to Bayesian linear regression with a Gaussian prior on the weights centered at the identity matrix and variance controlled by $\lambda$. By pushing $W$ towards the identity matrix, we're effectively pushing the resulting projected embeddings $\Phi(X)W^\ast$ towards $\Phi(X)$, which is exactly what we want to do. Informally, we have a prior belief that the best representation for our data is our embedding function $\Phi(X)\mathbb{I}_d=\Phi(X)$ and we update that belief only as we encounter more training data.</p>

<h2 id="Classification-as-Natural-Language-Inference">Classification as Natural Language Inference<a href="#Classification-as-Natural-Language-Inference"> </a></h2><p>We will now explore an alternative method which not only embeds sequences and labels into the same latent space where their distance can be measured, but that can actually tell us something about the compatibility of two distinct sequences out of the box.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>As a quick review, <a href="http://nlpprogress.com/english/natural_language_inference.html">natural language inference (NLI)</a> considers two sentences: a "premise" and a "hypothesis". The task is to determine whether the hypothesis is true (entailment) or false (contradiction) given the premise.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>When using transformer architectures like BERT, NLI datasets are typically modeled via <em>sequence-pair classification</em>. That is, we feed both the premise and the hypothesis through the model together as distinct segments and learn a classification head predicting one of <code>[contradiction, neutral, entailment]</code>.</p>
</div>
</div><div><div>
<p>The approach, proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00161">Yin et al. (2019)</a>, uses a pre-trained MNLI sequence-pair classifier as an out-of-the-box zero-shot text classifier that actually works pretty well. The idea is to take the sequence we're interested in labeling as the "premise" and to turn each candidate …</p></div></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html">jsonb</a> is, undeniably, <em>king</em>. It is a very flexible data
type, that allows for unstructured/schema-less storage. It has very powerful
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html#JSON-INDEXING">indexing mechanisms</a>, and its internal
representation is reasonably compact and efficient. It comes with advanced operators and expressions to query/extract
parts of it, and has
<a href="http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/postgres/talks/jsonb-roadmap-pgcon-2020.pdf">recently seen the addition of SQL/JSON path</a>
functionality to extend that to comply with the SQL Standard.</p>
<p>There are countless posts and resources explaining the virtues of this data type and what you can accomplish with it. So
nothing else to add, except to reiterate my appreciation for all those who have worked on creating and contributing to
it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But there’s a catch. <code>jsonb</code> supports… just JSON! That’s great, but is it enough?</p>
<h2 id="json-data-types">JSON data types</h2>
<p>JSON is a container data type, which means it can store other data types contained within. And which data types it does
support? From the <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON Spec</a>, it supports the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number, which is a quite flexible “numeric” data type.</li>
<li>String.</li>
<li>Boolean.</li>
<li>Null.</li>
<li>Array, or probably better called a “bag” or “container”, a sequence of elements of, possibly, mixed types.</li>
<li>Object, a collection of key-value pairs, where the value may be any other JSON data type.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>jsonb</code> maps these JSON data types, internally, to Postgres types. It is easy to see the resolved (JSON) data types:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>select</span> <span>key</span>, value, jsonb_typeof(value) <span>from</span> jsonb_each(
<span>'{"a": 42, "b": true, "c": "hi", "d": null, "e": [42, "hi"], "f": {"a": 1}}'</span>
);
<span>┌─────┬────────────┬──────────────┐</span>
<span>│</span> <span>key</span> <span>│</span>   value    <span>│</span> jsonb_typeof <span>│</span>
<span>├─────┼────────────┼──────────────┤</span>
<span>│</span> a   <span>│</span> <span>42</span>         <span>│</span> <span>number</span>       <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> b   <span>│</span> <span>true</span>       <span>│</span> <span>boolean</span>      <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> <span>c</span>   <span>│</span> <span>"hi"</span>       <span>│</span> string       <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> d   <span>│</span> <span>null</span>       <span>│</span> <span>null</span>         <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> e   <span>│</span> [<span>42</span>, <span>"hi"</span>] <span>│</span> <span>array</span>        <span>│</span>
<span>│</span> f   <span>│</span> <span>{</span><span>"a"</span>: <span>1</span><span>}</span>   <span>│</span> <span>object</span>       <span>│</span>
<span>└─────┴────────────┴──────────────┘</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Scalar types are mapped to boolean, text and numeric. Essentially, three different data types. Now check
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html">all the data types available in Postgres</a>. There are dozens. And
obviously you can extend with your own. Isn’t it a bit limiting that, in essence, you need to conflate any existing data
type to either a <code>numeric</code> or a <code>text</code>? What if you want to represent a timestamp? Convert it to text (well, Postgres
<a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/3ed2005ff595d349276e5b2edeca1a8100b08c87/src/backend/utils/adt/jsonb.c#L45">does it for
you</a>,
but you get the point). What about a <code>inet</code>, or a <code>point</code>? What about my <code>custom-amazing-data-type</code>?</p>
<p>According to the JSON spec, this is correct and there’s nothing else to do. So the question is not about whether <code>jsonb</code>
has any implementation flaws, but if Postgres users are enough with “just JSON”.</p>
<p>I find it particularly frustrating having to store binary data (<code>bytea</code>) in a JSON. Since there’s no <code>bytea</code> data type in
JSON (nor <code>jsonb</code>, consequently) you need to convert it to a text representation. There are several solutions, none of
them a good enough one:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Convert it to a string, byte by byte. Probably a very bad option, as it suffers two main problems: one is that
Postgres strings, not being strictly UTF-8 comformant (and this is a topic for another blog post…), cannot store the
UTF-8 null (<code>\0</code>) character. As such, if one of those bytes had the 0 value (likely), it could not be stored. Second,
a sequence of bytes interpreted as a string does not have the same ordering as the original byte sequence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encode in <code>base64</code>. Other than the extra space, ordering is not preserved (i.e., an index on the original byte
sequence would yield a different order than an index on the base64-encoded text). The solution is to use expression
indexes on the decoded value, if order needs to be preserved. This adds overhead anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encode in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32#base32hex">base32hex</a>, an even more verbose encoding but that
preserves order. There are no functions in Postgres for this encoding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="looking-beyond-json">Looking beyond JSON</h2>
<p>So how would you store other specific, more compact, or benefit from existing functions from additional datatypes, with
current JSON and <code>jsonb</code>? The only option to avoid data type information erasure is to encode the data type as part of
the JSON string. Something like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">{
	<span>"key1"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"inet"</span>, <span>"value"</span>: <span>"10.0.0.0/8"</span>},
	<span>"array"</span>: [<span>3</span>, {<span>"key2"</span>: {<span>"type"</span>: <span>"point"</span>, <span>"value"</span>: <span>"(42, -42)"</span>}<span>]</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>It is easy to see the several drawbacks of this approach: much more verbose and storage needs; need to continuously
cast; and need to do conditional casts depending on the data type.</p>
<p>I’m not alone in the pursue of a more generic, supporting more data type JSON-like language, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/bson-types/">MongoDB’s BSON</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_(serialization_format)">Amazon’s ION</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBJSON">Universal Binary JSON</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Programming.LowLevelAPI.html">DynamoDB’s Item HTTP
API</a>.
This is a very interesting case, as it is a JSON-compliant input/output interface, with type definition following an
approach similar to the one outlined above (where the value is an object which includes both the type and the value
itself), but which is claimed to be stored internally in an optimized form (not as-is). It has interesting composite
types like “homogeneus arrays”, where are elements must be of the same time or sets, which forbid duplicated values.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.ongres.com/img/blog/post_jsonb.jpg" alt="Beyond jsonb: a generalized jsonb supertype for Postgres?"></p>
<p>So how would such a generalized unstructured data type work in Postgres? I’d say it could leverage all the existing
jsonb infrastructure. After all, jsonb already knows each element’s data type, so this just needs to be extended to
many, potentially arbitrary data types (to support custom data types too). As such, new data types should be easy to
add. Other features (like ensuring homogeneus-ness across array elements for supporting sets; or ensuring uniqueness
within an element) may require some differentiation. Being a superset, I’d expect the same codebase could accommodate
well both data types (a similar retrofit was performed in the past from <code>hstore</code> to use <code>jsonb</code>'s codebase).</p>
<p>One of the main requisites is that this generalized unstructured data type would be a super set of the actual JSON, so
that any JSON string (and consequently <code>json</code> and <code>jsonb</code> values) can be converted to it implicitly. I envision the
hardest parts, or at least the ones that may trigger more discussion, to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze existing JSON-superset data types and deciding on the set of features to implement.</li>
<li>Selecting the data types to support, if not <em>all</em>.</li>
<li>Input syntax? Some ideas:
<ul>
<li>Use different value enclosing depending on the data type. E.g. <code>key: {{ dmFsdWU= }}</code> (Amazon Ion).</li>
<li>Wrap the value in constructor-like syntax, like MongoDB shell: <code>key: NumberLong(42)</code>.</li>
<li>Turn values into a nested JSON object with type (document’s key) and value, similar to DynamoDB’s HTTP API:
<code>"key": { "N": "42" }</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And the hardest one: pick the name of the new datatype!</li>
</ul>
<p>So what do you think? <strong>Should Postgres get a JSON-superset data type, a generalized unstructured data type</strong>?  Leave
your comments and/or <a href="https://twitter.com/ongresinc">tweet your responses to @ongresinc</a> to start the conversation.</p>

              <p>Navigating in the ocean of Haskell possibilities is challenging even though Haskell is a powerful language that helps to implement robust and maintainable programs. The language supplies you with tons of awesome approaches, but it is not always trivial to see how and where to use them properly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, like any other mainstream programming language, Haskell also has its best-practices and recommended ways for producing high-quality code. Knowing Haskell programming patterns helps you create better libraries and applications and make their users more pleased. And, yes, Haskell actually has FP-oriented programming patterns in addition to the best-practices shared with other languages.</p>
<p>If you are aware of the best ways to solve common problems, you can become a better Haskell developer by using more efficient programming techniques specific to the language. Likewise, you can apply Haskell-specific patterns successfully outside of Haskell.</p>
<p>This blog post contains a structured collection of some programming mini-patterns in Haskell with the detailed description and examples, some small “quality of life” improvements that would help everyone on their developer journey.</p>
<p>📚 In this article, each pattern contains at least one task with the hidden solution, so you can test your understanding of a pattern by solving the proposed task.</p>

<p>Newtype</p>

<p>Lightweight data wrapper.</p>

<li>Additional wrapping and unwrapping.</li>

</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>One of the most common and useful Haskell features is <code>newtype</code>. <code>newtype</code> is an ordinary data type with the name and a constructor. However, you can define a data type as <code>newtype</code> instead of <code>data</code> only if it has <strong>exactly</strong> one constructor with <strong>exactly</strong> one field.</p>
<p>It is extremely easy to define a <code>newtype</code> in Haskell as no extra effort is required from the user compared to the data type declaration. For example, the following are the valid <code>newtype</code> definitions:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>-- + Valid definition of a wrapper around Double</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span>newtype</span> <span>Volume</span> <span>=</span> <span>Volume</span> <span>Double</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span>-- + Also valid newtype definition with the record field</span></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><span>newtype</span> <span>Size</span> <span>=</span> <span>Size</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">    {<span> unSize ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But you can’t declare the following data types as a <code>newtype</code>:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>-- - Invalid newtype definition: more than 1 field</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>newtype</span> <span>Point</span> <span>=</span> <span>Point</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">    {<span> pointX ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">    ,<span> pointY ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5">    }</span>
<span id="cb2-6"></span>
<span id="cb2-7"><span>-- - Ivalid newtype definition: more than 1 constructor</span></span>
<span id="cb2-8"><span>newtype</span> <span>Shape</span></span>
<span id="cb2-9">    <span>=</span> <span>Circle</span> <span>Double</span></span>
<span id="cb2-10">    <span>|</span> <span>Square</span> <span>Double</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>newtype</code>s have a lot of great benefits but I’m going to focus only on the <em>code maintainability</em> in this section.</p>
<p>You can think of a <code>newtype</code> as a lightweight data type. Newtype has the same representation in memory as the wrapped type. Wrapping and unwrapping are also free operations in runtime. So, <code>newtype</code> is a <strong>zero-cost</strong> abstraction.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding from the compiler point of view, different <code>newtype</code>s are different data types. And since they don’t have any runtime overhead compared to the ordinary data types, you can provide a safer interface to your API without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>Shall we look at the example now. Consider, that you have a function which takes a password, a hash and verifies whether the given hash is the hash of the given password. Since both password and hash are merely textual data, we could write the following function:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>validateHash ::</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The problem with this function is that you can easily pass arguments in a different order and get faulty results. And you need to think about proper order of arguments each time you are calling this function. Should it be <code>validateHash password hash</code> or <code>validateHash hash password</code>? This approach is error-prone.</p>
<p>But if you define the following <code>newtype</code>s instead:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>newtype</span> <span>Password</span> <span>=</span> <span>Password</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">    {<span> unPassword ::</span> <span>ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3">    }</span>
<span id="cb4-4"></span>
<span id="cb4-5"><span>newtype</span> <span>PasswordHash</span> <span>=</span> <span>PasswordHash</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6">    {<span> unPasswordHash ::</span> <span>ByteString</span></span>
<span id="cb4-7">    }</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can implement a more type-safe version of the <code>validateHash</code> function, and additionally this improves the code readability:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>validateHash ::</span> <span>Password</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>PasswordHash</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, <code>validateHash hash password</code> is a compile-time error, and it makes it impossible to confuse the order of arguments.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another popular way of increasing code readability without sacrificing performance is introducing a new alias (which is simply another name for a data type) by using the <code>type</code> keyword. Unfortunately, this approach is only a partial solution since it helps only a developer, not the compiler as the compiler doesn’t see the difference between type alias and type itself. And if you don’t help your compiler, the compiler won’t be there for you when you need it.</p>
<p>For example, the following code is flawed:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>type</span> <span>Attack</span>  <span>=</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span>type</span> <span>Defense</span> <span>=</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3"></span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span>calculateDamage ::</span> <span>Attack</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Defense</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Attack</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, the above type signature is better than <code>Int -&gt; Int -&gt; Int</code>, but the compiler sees it exactly like this. So, you still can write <code>calculateDamage monsterDefense playerAttack</code> and get a runtime bug.</p>
<p>The approach of using <code>type</code>s instead of <code>newtype</code> can bring even more damage when you have a lot of similar data types. The more types you have the harder to maintain them without external help. Below you can see a code sample from one of the Haskell libraries:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>type</span> <span>WorkerId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span>type</span> <span>SupervisorId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><span>type</span> <span>ProcessId</span> <span>=</span> <span>UUID</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><span>type</span> <span>ProcessName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb7-5"><span>type</span> <span>SupervisorName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><span>type</span> <span>WorkerName</span> <span>=</span> <span>Text</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The library safety can be improved by replacing all these type aliases with <code>newtype</code>s, and it can even help to discover some bugs that happen due to passing arguments in the wrong order.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <code>newtype</code> approach is more flexible since you can provide your custom instances or restrict some instances allowing you to create values in an unsafe way.</p>
<p>The cost of using <code>newtype</code> is small — you only need to wrap and unwrap it when necessary. But the benefits hugely outweigh this small price.</p>

<p>Smart constructor</p>

<p>Providing idiomatic ways for constructing values.</p>

<div>
<ol type="1">
<li>When a data type restricts some values (e.g.&nbsp;not every <code>ByteString</code> is a valid <code>Password</code>).</li>

<li>To avoid runtime errors.</li>
<li>To make illegal states unrepresentable.</li>

<li>Some extra code.</li>
<li>Decide on the approach details.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once you have a <code>newtype</code>, first you need to create its value to work with it. And sometimes you want to validate a value before proceeding with it. Usually you would create a value of a data type by using its constructor. However, when programming in a modular way, you want to have boundaries in your interface and avoid providing unsafe ways of constructing values without validation.</p>
<p>This programming pattern in Haskell is called <strong>smart constructor</strong>. It can be understood better by looking at the implementation of such approach based on the <code>Password</code> data type:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>module</span> <span>Password</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">    ( <span>Password</span> (unPassword)</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-d65c32827edfb50d5559"><div><p>In most engineering organizations, if you want to ship anything, you’ll need to get your changes reviewed first. There’s been a lot written about why code reviews are important, and how to give and receive them effectively (a few that I’ve found helpful can be found <a href="https://medium.com/@9len/on-code-review-16ea85f7c585" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/how-to-give-and-get-better-code-reviews-e011c3cda55e" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/@greenberg/writing-pull-requests-your-coworkers-might-enjoy-reading-9d0307e93da3" target="_blank">here</a>). But there’s been comparatively less written about how you, as a programmer, can structure your changes to make the reviewer’s job easier, enabling them to get back to you faster, with higher quality feedback. Nearly everyone agrees that small changes tend to be easier to review than large ones, and there’s even <a href="https://static1.smartbear.co/support/media/resources/cc/episode_4_thelargestcasestudyofcodereviewever.pdf" target="_blank">some data</a> to back this up. But breaking up your change into smaller revisions can be difficult: even the simplest refactors can necessitate huge diffs if the abstraction you’re changing is widely used. Moreover, breaking your change up into smaller pieces alone may not be sufficient. While this is too deep of a topic to try to cover comprehensively, here are some techniques that I’ve found helpful as both as a code author and code reviewer.</p><p>At a high level, there are two reasons you might want to make changes to an existing codebase:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>to change the semantics of the program (e.g. new features, bug fixes, etc.)</p></li><li><p>to change the organization of the program (i.e. refactors)</p></li></ul><p><em>The best way to reduce cognitive overhead for your reviewer is to decide whether to alter the program’s semantics or its organization, and to ensure every line you change is consistent with that decision.</em> Reviewing new and/or changing business logic requires a different kind of scrutiny than reviewing changes to the expression of existing, battle-hardened business logic. You would rather your reviewer spend their limited time and energy on more valuable things than trying to infer the intention behind each line of your diff and context switching.</p><p>Consider an example based on a file with the following contents. This is just a text file with a set of palindromes in it and not real code, but for the sake of keeping this example simple, let’s suspend disbelief and pretend that it is.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596733395232_4516"><p>There are two kinds of palindromes here: words (which have no whitespace or punctuation, and are identical when read forwards and backwards), and phrases (which read the same forwards an backwards if you ignore whitespace, punctuation, and capitalization). We want to add a new feature to this file: adding appropriate punctuation to each phrase by capitalizing, adding periods to the end of complete sentences, etc. Along the way, we realize that this would be easier if the file were better organized: words and phrases should be grouped together separately, and each group should be sorted alphabetically. Here’s what it might look like if we attempt to make all of these changes at once.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596733395232_6982"><div><p>This change is unnecessarily hard to review, even though it’s pretty small in terms of lines of code modified. The reviewer needs to verify:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>that the results have the same palindromes as before, but not <em>exactly</em> the same because some of them were modified on purpose</p></li><li><p>the correctness of those modifications</p></li><li><p>that every palindrome is correctly grouped</p></li><li><p>that the groups are alphabetized</p></li></ul><p>This will likely take multiple passes, and the overhead keeping track of where the reviewer is in each pass leaves them with fewer cognitive resources available for the review work itself. This is all assuming that they find the changes desirable. Ideally the high-level approach is something that’s been discussed with the reviewer well before code review, but miscommunications sometimes happen, and it’s always reasonable to expect constructive criticism about particulars. Coming to an agreement around any one change can hold up the entire review, delaying everyone from benefiting from the hard work that’s gone into everything else.</p><p>Let’s break this change up into two reviews: one for a refactor, and the other for a new feature. We’ll look at the refactor first.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596733395232_9896"><div><p>Although this diff isn’t any smaller than the combined diff, it is considerably easier to review, especially if the review is accompanied by a note along the lines of “I grouped and alphabetized the palindromes using cut-and-paste.” Cutting-and-pasting is unlikely to result in typos, but it can result in accidentally deleting or duplicating existing lines. So all the reviewer needs to do here is:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>verify that the total number of palindromes hasn’t changed</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>subtracting line numbers makes this easy</p></li></ul></li><li><p>check that each group is alphabetized without any consecutive duplicates</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>just a quick visual scan</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>In this case, the misalphabetization of “radar” and “racecar” is easy to catch and to fix.</p><p>Let’s look at the new feature.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596733395232_14816"><div><p>The diff is small, but the changes are substantive. The reviewer needs to carefully read every modified line to verify that the capitalization and punctuation are correct. But, because this is the only thing they are asked to do, it’s <em>far</em> easier for them to find the serious bug (which results in one of the phrases no longer being a palindrome) in this diff than in the original.</p><p>In principle, the original change could be broken down even more by decomposing the refactor into two smaller pieces: one to alphabetize, one to group. Because these are both semantics-preserving changes, it’s a matter of taste whether this would result in an easier sequence of reviews; when it doubt, defer to the reviewer’s preference. That said, combining either of these smaller refactors with the new feature would have resulted in nearly as gnarly of a review as the original.</p><p>We’ve seen that combining semantics-altering changes with semantics-preserving changes is best avoided, no matter how tempting it can be to “fix things up along the way” while doing something else. If that fix-up really is worth doing, then it’s worth its own stand-alone review.</p><p>The code reviewer should never waste time asking themselves "How does this even make sense at all?" when the answer is "it doesn't." It should always be clear whether the code builds, passes tests (both old and new), passes linting rules, etc. Hopefully, the code review environment is integrated with a CI system that performs these "quality checks" automatically, rendering this a non-issue. If not, investing in this tooling will pay for itself quickly.</p><p>Ideally, any change submitted for review should be small, so that it’s easy to reason about, and self-contained, so that the motivation for making it is clear. Unfortunately, these two ideals are sometimes in tension, especially in large, complex projects. While it might be clear to the code author that a series of refactors and new abstractions will make it easier to build a nontrivial new feature, we’ve already seen that combining them into one self-contained change can result in an unmanageable review. But merely breaking up this work into a series of small changes can also end up leaving the reviewer feeling lost. “What’s this new abstraction for, and how do I know that it’s the right one?” is sometimes hard to answer without seeing it used in context. But where should that context live, if not in the code review itself? One tactic for managing this complexity is to use the following workflow.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Create a self-contained “spike” branch. You should be confident that the resulting code is correct, and that it has the most important functionality of the eventual finished product. It should be no larger than necessary, but does not need to be small, and can combine refactors with new features. The spike branch doesn’t need to quite live up to the standards of production-quality of shippable code because it will never be merged. Eventually, you will throw it away.</p></li><li><p>Split off one or more small changes from the spike branch that are independently reviewable in parallel. If the motivation for these changes isn’t self-evident, link to examples of how they will be used in the spike branch in the code review.</p></li><li><p>(Optional) Once the changes from step #2 are reviewed and shipped, you may want to rebase the spike branch to pick up any changes made during code review before repeating step 2. This shrinks the size of the spike’s diff from the main branch. However, if the spike drifts far enough the main branch that merge conflicts become an issue, this may not be worth the effort.</p></li><li><p>Go back to step 2, until all of the spike branch’s functionality has been merged.</p></li></ol><p>We’ve already seen a small example of this workflow in the previous section. The original combined diff was the spike branch. The refactor was the first independently reviewable change, which is motivated by the subsequent new feature. The new feature could have been prepared either from scratch, or by rebasing the spike branch off of the final, bug-fixed version of the refactor branch.</p><p>Building a working prototype quickly de-risks the project and provides context for a series of small reviews. Those reviews may not be fully self-contained, but they will be understandable. And while spike branch is likely to be long-lived, and long-lived branches can be expensive to maintain, the spike branch’s disposability makes that maintenance largely optional.</p><h2>Reviewing By Commit</h2><p>The spike branch process can feel heavyweight, especially in environments where the process of merging approved code is slow. One alternative is to submit one branch for review with self-contained, independently reviewable commits. Beyond reducing the number of merge-and-rebase cycles, the benefit of this approach is that the reviewer may be able to keep more context in short-term memory than if each change were reviewed independently. However, most CI systems don't automatically perform quality checks on every commit, which sacrifices some self-containedness. The reviewer may have nontrivial feedback, and keeping track of the approval state for each commit and its revisions quickly becomes a burden. Back-and-forths about any one commit delays merging all of them, preventing everyone from benefiting from changes that are otherwise ready to ship. This technique is safe to avoid, and best reserved for those niche situations …</p></div></div></div>

August 17, 2020 | https://charliegerard.dev/blog/github-action-toxic-comments/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://charliegerard.dev/blog/github-action-toxic-comments/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, I spent a few hours building a Github action to automatically detect potentially toxic comments and PR reviews.</p>
<p><img src="https://charliegerard.dev/github-action.png"></p>
<p>It uses TensorFlow.js and its <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/toxicity">toxicity pre-trained model</a> to assess the level of toxicity, based on the following 7 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identity attack</li>
<li>Insult</li>
<li>Obscene</li>
<li>Severe toxicity</li>
<li>Sexual explicit</li>
<li>Threat</li>
<li>Toxicity</li>
</ul>
<p>When a user posts a new comment or reviews a PR, the action is triggered. If there is a high probability that the content would be classified as toxic, the bot creates a comment tagging the author and advising to update the content.</p>
<p>Here's a quick demo:</p>
<p><img src="https://charliegerard.dev/demo.gif"></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/charliegerard/safe-space">repo</a></p>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the code, it is probably important to note that this is a <strong>JavaScript action</strong>. I read that actions could also be in Docker containers but for simplicity, I stuck with JS.</p>
<p>First, I created a action.yml file at the root of my project folder.</p>
<p>Inside this file, I wrote the following code:</p>
<pre><code>name: "Safe space"
description: "Detect the potential toxicity of PR comments"
inputs:
  GITHUB_TOKEN:
    required: true
  message:
    required: false
  toxicity_threshold:
    required: false
runs:
  using: "node12"
  main: "dist/index.js"
</code></pre>
<p>The first couple of lines are self-explanatory. Then, the <code>inputs</code> property contains 3 different elements.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> is a secret token required to authenticate in your workflow run and is automatically generated.</li>
<li>The <code>message</code> property is optional and can be used by people if they want to customise the content of the comment posted by the bot if the action detects toxic comments.</li>
<li>The <code>toxicity_threshold</code> property is also optional and allows people to set a custom threshold that will be used by the machine learning model when making predictions about a comment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the settings under <code>runs</code> indicate the version of Node.js we want our action to run with, as well as the file the action code lives in.</p>
<h2>Action code</h2>
<p>To create a JavaScript action, you need to install and require at least 2 Node.js modules: <code>@actions/core</code> and <code>@actions/github</code>. As this particular action uses a TensorFlow.js model, I also installed and required <code>@tensorflow-models/toxicity</code> and <code>@tensorflow/tfjs</code>.</p>
<p>Then, in my <code>dist/index.js</code> file, I started writing my action code.</p>
<p>The core setup could look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>async function run() {
  const tf = require("@tensorflow/tfjs");
  const toxicity = require("@tensorflow-models/toxicity");
  await tf.setBackend("cpu");

  try {
    const githubToken = core.getInput("GITHUB_TOKEN");
    const customMessage = core.getInput("message");
    const toxicityThreshold = core.getInput("toxicity_threshold");
    const { context } = github;
  } catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run();
</code></pre>
<p>There is a main <code>run</code> function that requires the packages needed and sets the backend for TensorFlow.js. Then in a <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> statement, the code gets the 3 parameters mentioned a bit earlier that we'll be using soon.
Finally, we get the context of the event when the action is triggered.</p>
<h3>Creating a bot comment when a user posts a comment on an issue or PR</h3>
<p>A few different events can trigger a Github action. As this action is interested in getting the comments posted on an issue or PR, we need to start by looking at the payload of the event and see if the property <code>comment</code> is defined. Then we can also look at the type of action (here <code>created</code> and <code>edited</code>), to run the predictions only when a new comment is added or one is edited, but not deleted for example.</p>
<p>More details are available on the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">official Github documentation</a>.</p>
<p>I then access a few parameters needed to request the comments for the right issue or PR, load the machine learning model, and if the property <code>match</code> is true on one of the results coming back from the predictions, it means the comment has been classified as toxic and I generate a new comment with the warning message.</p>
<pre><code>if (context.payload.comment) {
  if (
    context.payload.action === "created" ||
    context.payoad.action === "edited"
  ) {
    const issueNumber = context.payload.issue.number;
    const repository = context.payload.repository;
    const octokit = new github.GitHub(githubToken);
    const threshold = toxicityThreshold ? toxicityThreshold : 0.9;
    const model = await toxicity.load(threshold);
    const comments = [];
    const commentsObjects = [];
    const latestComment = [context.payload.comment.body];
    const latestCommentObject = context.payload.comment;
    let toxicComment = undefined;

    model.classify(latestComment).then((predictions) =&gt; {
      predictions.forEach((prediction) =&gt; {
        if (toxicComment) {
          return;
        }
        prediction.results.forEach((result, index) =&gt; {
          if (toxicComment) {
            return;
          }
          if (result.match) {
            const commentAuthor = latestCommentObject.user.login;
            toxicComment = latestComment;
            const message = customMessage
              ? customMessage
              : `&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdQ1IynzclJldUQ/giphy.gif" width="400"/&gt; &lt;/br&gt;
                                      Hey @${commentAuthor}! 👋 &lt;br/&gt; PRs and issues should be safe environments but your comment: &lt;strong&gt;"${toxicComment}"&lt;/strong&gt; was classified as potentially toxic! 😔&lt;/br&gt;
                                      Please consider spending a few seconds editing it and feel free to delete me afterwards! 🙂`;

            return octokit.issues.createComment({
              owner: repository.owner.login,
              repo: repository.name,
              issue_number: issueNumber,
              body: message,
            });
          }
        });
      });
    });
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Creating a bot comment when a user submits a PR review</h3>
<p>The code to run checks on PR reviews is very similar, the main difference is in the first couple of lines. Instead of looking for the <code>comment</code> property on the payload, we look for <code>review</code>, and the action I am interested in is <code>submitted</code>.</p>
<pre><code>if (context.payload.review) {
  if (context.payload.action === "submitted") {
    const issueNumber = context.payload.pull_request.number;
    const repository = context.payload.repository;
    const octokit = new github.GitHub(githubToken);
    const threshold = toxicityThreshold ? toxicityThreshold : 0.9;
    const model = await toxicity.load(threshold);
    const reviewComment = [context.payload.review.body];
    const reviewObject = context.payload.review;
    let toxicComment = undefined;
    model.classify(reviewComment).then((predictions) =&gt; {
      predictions.forEach((prediction) =&gt; {
        if (toxicComment) {
          return;
        }
        prediction.results.forEach((result, index) =&gt; {
          if (toxicComment) {
            return;
          }
          if (result.match) {
            const commentAuthor = reviewObject.user.login;
            toxicComment = reviewComment[0];
            const message = customMessage
              ? customMessage
              : `&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdQ1IynzclJldUQ/giphy.gif" width="400"/&gt; &lt;/br&gt;
                                      Hey @${commentAuthor}! 👋 &lt;br/&gt; PRs and issues should be safe environments but your comment: &lt;strong&gt;"${toxicComment}"&lt;/strong&gt; was classified as potentially toxic! 😔&lt;/br&gt;
                                      Please consider spending a few seconds editing it and feel free to delete me afterwards! 🙂`;

            return octokit.issues.createComment({
              owner: repository.owner.login,
              repo: repository.name,
              issue_number: issueNumber,
              body: message,
            });
          }
        });
      });
    });
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Using the action</h2>
<p>To use an action in a repository, we need to create a workflow file.</p>
<p>First, the repository needs to have a <code>.github</code> folder with a <code>workflows</code> folder inside. Then, we can add a new <code>.yml</code> file with the details for the action we want to run.</p>
<pre><code>on: [issue_comment, pull_request_review]

jobs:
  toxic_check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Safe space
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Safe space - action step
        uses: charliegerard/safe-space@master
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
</code></pre>
<p>In this code sample, we indicate that we want to trigger this action when events happen around comments in an issue and when a pull request review event happens.
Then, we add that we need to start by using the default <code>actions/checkout@v2</code> action and finally, add this toxicity classification action, with some additional parameters, including the required <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> one.</p>
<p>If you wanted to use the optional properties <code>message</code> and <code>toxicity_threshold</code>, you could do so like this:</p>
<pre><code>on: [issue_comment, pull_request_review]

jobs:
  toxic_check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Safe space
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Safe space - action step
        uses: charliegerard/safe-space@master
        with:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          message: "Hello"
          toxicity_threshold: 0.7
</code></pre>
<p>If you are developing your own action, you can test it by changing the line</p>
<pre><code>uses: charliegerard/safe-space@master
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>uses: ./
</code></pre>
<p>One important thing to note, if you want to build your own Github action, is that when using the action type <code>issue_comment</code> and <code>pull_request_review</code>, you need to push your code to your main (often called "master") branch before being able to test that your code is working in another branch. If you develop everything in a separate branch, the action will not be triggered when writing a comment or reviewing a PR.</p>
<p>And that's it! 🎉</p>
<h2>Potential improvements</h2>
<p>At the moment, I invite the user to delete manually the note from the bot once they've updated the content of their toxic comment, however, I think this could be done automatically on edit. When the user edits a comment, I could run the check again and if it is predicted as safe, remove automatically the bot comment so users don't have to do it.</p></div></div>]]>

		<p>by Jonathan Latham, PhD and Allison Wilson, PhD</p>
<p>In all the discussions of the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, enormous scientific attention has been paid to the molecular character of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including its novel genome sequence in comparison with its near relatives. In stark contrast, virtually no attention has been paid to the physical provenance of those nearest genetic relatives, its presumptive ancestors, which are two viral sequences named BtCoV/4991 and RaTG13.<span id="more-4485"></span></p>
<p>This neglect is surprising because their provenance is more than interesting. BtCoV/4991 and RaTG13 were collected from a mineshaft in Yunnan province, China, in 2012/2013 by researchers from the lab of Zheng-li Shi at the <a href="http://english.whiov.cas.cn/">Wuhan Institute of Virology</a> (WIV). Very shortly before, in the spring of 2012, six miners working in the mine had contracted a mysterious illness and three of them had died (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4036791/">Wu et al., 2014</a>). The specifics of this mystery disease have been virtually forgotten; however, they are described in a Chinese Master’s thesis written in 2013 by a doctor who supervised their treatment.</p>
<p>We arranged to have this Master’s thesis translated into English. The evidence it contains has led us to reconsider everything we thought we knew about the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has also led us to theorise a plausible route by which an apparently isolated disease outbreak in a mine in 2012 led to a global pandemic in 2019.</p>
<p>The origin of SARS-CoV-2 that we propose below is based on the case histories of these miners and their hospital treatment. This simple theory accounts for all the key features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, including ones that have puzzled virologists since the outbreak began.</p>
<p>The theory can account for the origin of the polybasic furin cleavage site, which is a region of the viral spike protein that makes it susceptible to cleavage by the host enzyme furin and which greatly enhances viral spread in the body. This furin site is novel to SARS-CoV-2 compared to its near relatives (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114094/">Coutard, et al., 2020</a>). The theory also explains the exceptional affinity of the virus spike protein for human receptors, which has also surprised virologists (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0688-y?report=reader">Letko et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06199.pdf">Piplani et al, 2020</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abb2507">Wrapp et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.19.956581">Walls et al., 2020</a>). The theory further explains why the virus has barely evolved since the pandemic began, which is also a deeply puzzling aspect of a virus supposedly new to humans (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262v1">Zhan et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/06/22/2020.05.21.108506.full.pdf">van Dorp et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12929-020-00665-8">Chaw et al., 2020</a>). Lastly, the theory neatly explains why SARS-CoV-2 targets the lungs, which is unusual for a coronavirus (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159299/">Huang et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>We do not propose a specifically genetically engineered or biowarfare origin for the virus but the theory does propose an essential causative role in the pandemic for scientific research carried out by the laboratory of Zheng-li Shi at the WIV; thus also explaining Wuhan as the location of the epicentre.</p>
<h4>Why has the provenance of RaTG13 and BtCoV/4991 been ignored?</h4>
<p>The apparent origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China. Wuhan is also home to the world’s leading research centre for bat coronaviruses. There are two virology labs in the city, <a href="https://project-evidence.github.io/">both have either collected bat coronaviruses or researched them</a> in the recent past. The Shi lab, which collected BtCoV/4991 and RaTG13, <a href="https://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-AI110964-06">recently received grants</a> to evaluate <em>by experiment</em> the potential for pandemic pathogenicity of the novel bat coronaviruses they collected from the wild.</p>
<p>To add to these suggestive data points, there is a long history of accidents, disease outbreaks, and even pandemics resulting from lab accidents with viruses (<a href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Escaped-Viruses-final-2-17-14-copy.pdf">Furmanski, 2014</a>; <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/26137650">Weiss et al., 2015</a>). For these and other reasons, summarised in our article <a href="https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-case-is-building-that-covid-19-had-a-lab-origin/"><em>The Case is Building that COVID-19 Had a Lab Origin</em></a>, we (a virologist and a geneticist) <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2020/06/did-the-sars-cov-2-virus-arise-from-a-bat-coronavirus-research-program-in-a-chinese-laboratory-very-possibly/">and others</a> have concluded that a lab outbreak is a credible thesis. Certainly, a lab origin has at least as much circumstantial evidence to support it as does any natural zoonotic origin theory (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06199.pdf">Piplani et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rossana_Segreto/publication/340924249_Is_considering_a_genetic-manipulation_origin_for_SARS-CoV-2_a_conspiracy_theory_that_must_be_censored/links/5ed7c17992851c9c5e74f7dc/Is-considering-a-genetic-manipulation-origin-for-SARS-CoV-2-a-conspiracy-theory-that-must-be-censored.pdf">Segreto and Deigin, 2020</a>; <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.073262v1">Zhan et al., 2020</a>).</p>
<p>The media, normally so enamoured of controversy, has largely declined even to debate the possibility of a laboratory escape. Many news sites have simply labelled it a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>The principal reason for media dismissals of the lab origin possibility is a review paper in <em>Nature Medicine</em> (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/S41591-020-0820-9">Andersen et al., 2020</a>). Although by Jun 29 2020 this review had almost 700 citations it also has major scientific shortcomings. These flaws are worth understanding in their own right but they are also useful background for understanding the implications of the Master’s thesis.</p>
<h4>Andersen et al., a critique</h4>
<p>The question of the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is, in outline, simple. There are two incontrovertible facts. One, the disease is caused by a human viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, first identified in Wuhan in December 2019 and whose RNA genome sequence is known. Second, all of its nearest known relatives come from bats. Beyond any reasonable doubt SARS-CoV-2 evolved from an ancestral bat virus. The task the <em>Nature Medicine</em> authors set for themselves was to establish the relative merits of each of the various possible routes (lab vs natural) by which a bat coronavirus might have jumped to humans and in the same process have acquired an unusual furin site and a spike protein having very high affinity for the human ACE2 receptor.</p>
<p>When Andersen et al. outline a natural zoonotic pathway they speculate extensively about how the leap might have occurred. In particular they elaborate on a proposed residence in intermediate animals, likely pangolins. For example, “The presence in pangolins of an RBD [Receptor Binding Domain] very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 means that we can infer that this was probably in the virus that jumped to humans. This leaves the insertion of [a] polybasic cleavage site to occur during human-to-human transmission.” This viral evolution occurred in “Malayan pangolins illegally imported into Guangdong province”. Even with these speculations there are major gaps in this theory. For example, why is the virus so well adapted to humans? Why Wuhan, which is 1,000 Km from Guangdong? (See map).</p>
<figure id="attachment_3105" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3105"><img src="https://www.independentsciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/china-province-guide-600x503.jpg" alt="china province guide" width="600" height="503"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3105">china province guide</figcaption></figure>
<p>The authors provide no such speculations in favour of the lab accident thesis, only speculation <em>against</em> it:</p>
<p>“Finally, the generation of the <em>predicted</em> O-linked glycans is also <em>unlikely</em> to have occurred due to cell-culture passage, as such features suggest the involvement of an immune system.” (italics added).</p>
<p>[Passaging is the deliberate placing of live viruses into cells or organisms to which they are NOT adapted for the purpose of making them adapted, i.e. speeding up their evolution.]</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that the Andersen authors set a higher hurdle for the lab thesis than the zoonotic thesis. In their account, the lab thesis is required to explain <em>all </em>of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 from its presumed bat viral ancestor, whereas under their telling of the zoonotic thesis the key step of the addition of the furin site is allowed to happen in humans and is thus effectively unexplained.</p>
<p>A further imbalance is that key information needed to judge the merits of a lab origin theory is missing from their account. As we detailed in our previous article, in their search for SARS-like viruses with zoonotic spillover potential, researchers at the WIV have passaged live bat viruses in monkey and human cells (<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/11/4/379/htm">Wang et al., 2019</a>). They have also performed many recombinant experiments with diverse bat coronaviruses (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12711">Ge et al., 2013</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4797993/">Menachery et al., 2015</a>; <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006698">Hu et al., 2017</a>). Such experiments have generated international concern over the possible creation of potential pandemic viruses (<a href="https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-8678-1_29">Lipsitch, 2018</a>). As we showed too, the Shi lab had also won a grant to extend that work to whole live animals. They planned “virus infection experiments across a range of cell cultures from different species and humanized mice” with recombinant bat coronaviruses. Yet Andersen et al did not discuss this research at all, except to say:</p>
<p>“Basic research involving passage of bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses in cell culture and/or animal models has been ongoing for many years in biosafety level 2 laboratories across the world”</p>
<p>This statement is fundamentally misleading about the kind of research performed at the Shi lab.</p>
<p>A further important oversight by the Andersen authors concerns the history of lab outbreaks of viral pathogens. They write: “there are documented instances of laboratory escapes of SARS-CoV”. This is a rather matter-of-fact allusion to the fact that since 2003 there have been six documented outbreaks of SARS from labs, not all in China, with some leading to fatalities (<a href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Escaped-Viruses-final-2-17-14-copy.pdf">Furmanski, 2014</a>).</p>
<p>Andersen et al might have also have noted that two major human pandemics are widely accepted to have been caused by lab outbreaks of viral pathogens, H1N1 in 1977 and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (summarised in <a href="https://armscontrolcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Escaped-Viruses-final-2-17-14-copy.pdf">Furmanski, 2014</a>). Andersen could even have noted that literally hundreds of lab accidents with viruses have resulted in near-misses or very localised outbreaks (<a href="https://thebulletin.org/2019/02/human-error-in-high-biocontainment-labs-a-likely-pandemic-threat/">summarised by Lynn Klotz</a> and <a href="https://www.independentsciencenews.org/health/the-long-history-of-accidental-laboratory-releases-of-potential-pandemic-pathogens/">Sam Husseini</a> and also <a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/26137650">Weiss et al., 2015</a>).</p>
<p>Also unmentioned were instances where a lab outbreak of an experimental or engineered virus has been plausibly theorised but remains uninvestigated. For example, the most coherent explanation for the H1N1 variant ‘swine flu’ pandemic of 2009/10 that resulted in a death toll estimated by some as high as 200,000 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4865181/">Duggal et al., 2016</a>; <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001558">Simonsen et al. 2013</a>), is that a vaccine was improperly inactivated by its maker (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1743-422X-6-207">Gibbs et al., 2009</a>). If so, H1N1 emerged from a lab not once but twice.</p>
<p>Given that human and livestock viral outbreaks have frequently come from laboratories and that many scientists have warned of probable lab escapes (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4028196/">Lipsitch and Galvani, 2014</a>), and that <a href="https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/chinese-lab-checkered-safety-record-draws-scrutiny-over-covid-19">the WIV itself has a questionable biosafety record</a>, the Andersen paper is not an even-handed treatment of the possible …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SIMple Physics is a set of educational physics simulators. It is made to help students and teachers conduct labs and experiments for high school level physics without sophisticated and expensive equipment.</p><p>Find cool gifs at <a href="https://mkhan45.github.io/SIMple-Physics/posts/Gifs/">https://mkhan45.github.io/SIMple-Physics/posts/Gifs/</a></p><p>Important goals include:</p><ul><li>Performance even on lower spec’d machines</li><li>Cross platform</li><li>Ease of use</li><li>Free and <a href="https://github.com/mkhan45/SIMple-Physics">Open Source</a></li><li>Extensibility</li></ul><p>SIMple Physics aims to include a separate simulator for each section of high school physics, including:</p><ul><li>✔️ Kinematics, Projectile Motion, and basic Mechanics (SIMple Mechanics) <a href="https://github.com/mkhan45/SIMple-Mechanics">Github</a></li><li>✔️ Universal Gravitation (SIMple Gravity) <a href="https://github.com/mkhan45/SIMple-Gravity">Github</a></li><li>❌Electromagnetics and Magnetism</li><li>❌Waves and Optics</li></ul><p>Each simulator has a few core features to help learn and teach physics. For example,</p><ul><li>Save and load preset scenes</li><li>Graph object properties and export graphs to CSV</li><li>Extensive documentation and example labs</li></ul><p>SIMple Physics was started as my high school senior research project. Unfortunately, because of COVID, I didn’t finish it during the school year. After it became clear that the 2020-2021 school year would also be primarily online, I decided to finish the project and make it useable for real world classes.</p><hr><h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2><p>To get started, try some <a href="https://mkhan45.github.io/SIMple-Physics/tags/tutorials/">tutorials</a>, or <a href="https://mkha45.github.io/SIMple-Physics/tags/labs/">complete a lab</a>.</p><p>Currently SIMple Mechanics is much more up to date than SIMple Gravity.</p><hr><h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2><p>Contributions are welcome. Get started with the issue tracker for each repository on Github. For now the focus is on SIMple Mechanics because that’s the first unit of physics, but soon the improvements to SIMple Mechancs will need to be backported to SIMple Gravity. If you have the time, motivation, and knowledge to make a Electronics and Magnetism or Wave/Optics simulator, contact me at mikail.khan@protonmail.com.</p><hr><h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details:</h2><p>Currently SIMple Gravity and SIMple Physics are written in Rust using <a href="https://github.com/ggez/ggez"><code>ggez</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/specs"><code>specs</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/Gekkio/imgui-rs"><code>imgui-rs</code></a>, and <a href="https://nphysics.org/"><code>nphysics</code></a>. Rust was chosen for its performance, easy cross-platform compilation, and for its potential to compile for the web through WebAssembly.</p><p>WebAssembly compilation is a high priority goal. Initially the (naive) expectation was that <code>ggez</code> would work on the web by the end of the year, but because that hasn’t happened yet, I am exploring a rewrite using a different Rust libraries such as <code>wgpu-rs</code> and <code>egui</code> or even using Godot. Such a rewrite will not happen for the forseeable future, but <code>ggez</code> is seeing some work on WASM compilation so it might not be all that necessary in a few months.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>I'm a science fiction writer, so I quite enjoy thinking about self-driving cars. They make for really interesting analogies about data, liability, self-determination, information security and openness.</p>
<p>Sometimes I write fiction about this! Deakin University commissioned "Car Wars," a short story about the sociotechnological issues raised by autonomous vehicle thought-experiments.</p>
<p><a href="https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars">https://this.deakin.edu.au/self-improvement/car-wars</a></p>
<p>(they also got a faculty member to write a quiz for it whose correct answers take a 180' different view to my own!)</p>
<p>And without any spoilers here, I'll say that subverted, lethal autonomous vehicles are a key plot point in Attack Surface, the third Little Brother book, coming out in Oct.</p>

<p>But I'm a science fiction writer and that means I can tell the difference between "thought experiments" and "real things." Alas, the same cannot be said of corporate America.</p>
<p>For example, according to its own IPO filings, Uber can only be profitable if it invents fully autonomous vehicles and replaces every public transit ride in the world with them.</p>
<p>Elon Musk – a man whose "green electric car company" is only profitable thanks to the carbon credits it sells to manufacturers of the dirtiest SUVs in America, without which those planet-killing SUVs would not exist – makes the same mistake.</p>
<p>Musk wants to abolish public transit and replace it with EVs (he says that public transit makes you sit next to strangers who might be serial killers, which tells you a lot about his view of humanity).</p>
<p>Now, both Uber and Musk are both wrong as a matter of simple geometry. Multiply the space occupied by all those AVs by the journeys people in cities need to make by the additional distances of those journeys if we need road for all those cars, and you run out of space.</p>
<p>It's a trivially modelable Red Queen's Race, in which the more cars you add, the more road you need, the more spaced out everything gets, the more cars you need, the more road you need, the more spaced out everything gets, the more cars you need…</p>
<p>Indeed, these fairy tales require so much credulity to be taken seriously that they strain even the car-addled imaginations of American automotive culture, and also rely on the irrational exuberance inspired by imaginary self-driving cars to propagate and persist.</p>
<p>But that exuberance is sorely misplaced. Machine learning systems have brittle and unpredictable failure modes that can be triggered by accident or deliberately. The unconstrained problem of navigating busy cities with unquantifiable human activities is insoluble with ML.</p>
<p>Or, at least, it's insoluble if you care about whether cars kill even more people in even less predictable ways than they do now.</p>
<p>This is a lesson that Ford CEO Jim Hackett just learned the hard way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-ford-ceo-says-the-company-overestimated-self-driving-cars.html">https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-ford-ceo-says-the-company-overestimated-self-driving-cars.html</a></p>
<p>After investing heavily in the technology and boasting about how Ford's future was a bet on the imminent arrival of AVs, Hackett has had to admit that "We overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles."</p>
<p>The company has sunk $4b into the technology. But there's gotta be a pony under there somewhere:</p>
<p>"When we bring this thing to market, it's going to be really powerful." -Hackett</p>

<p>Genomist Adam Rutherford is a gifted science communicator; the podcast he co-hosts, "The Curious Cases of Rutherford and Fry" is one of the best popular science programs I've ever heard: charming and informative at the same time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g/episodes/downloads">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dx75g/episodes/downloads</a></p>
<p>His 2017 book "A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived" used a survey of the state of the art in genomics to present an account of what we knew about human relatedness.</p>
<p><a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/07/03/the-human-race-without-races.html">https://boingboing.net/2017/07/03/the-human-race-without-races.html</a></p>
<p>The most compelling part of "Brief History" was Rutherford's skewering of junk DNA sciecne, especially the home ancestry/genetic testing industry, with its claims of being able to tell you if you're 32% viking and if so, which red wine you're genetically programmed to enjoy.</p>
<p>These sections are written with Rutherford's characteristic empathy – as someone who'd dedicated his life to genomics, he understands the impulse to connect your DNA with your life story – but they also warn about the harms arising from these false beliefs.</p>
<p>These harms are the subject of his new book, HOW TO ARGUE WITH A RACIST, a bestseller in the UK, just published in the US with new forematter updated in light of both the pandemic and the BLM uprising.</p>
<p><a href="https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/spring-2020/how-to-argue-with-a-racist/">https://theexperimentpublishing.com/catalogs/spring-2020/how-to-argue-with-a-racist/</a></p>
<p>Superficially, the "race science" promulgated by white supremacists – often repeated by people who should know better, sometimes internalized by racialized people who are harmed by this pseudoscience – has the ring of plausibility.</p>
<p>Whether that's the fairy tales about "race" and ability ("Jews are smart because of medieval money-lending laws" or "Black people perform well in sports because of the slave trade's selective breeding") or the studies grouping humanity into races based on genetic divergence.</p>
<p>Chances are you've encountered this stuff and not known what to make of it but thought it benign or at least neutral. But sociologists have scraped white nationalist message-boards to document the centrality of this stuff to the rise of a new movement of would-be genociders.</p>
<p>"How to Argue" is a point-by-point rebuttal to these race realists. Despite the title, Rutherford doesn't really expect that you'll convince someone who's obsessed with whether they have "Jewish genes" or who worships their ability to break down lactose with his arguments.</p>
<p>Those people, after all, are motivated reasoners. They've started from the end-point – "appearances and life circumstances notwithstanding, I am superior and deserve better" – and worked their way backwards to justify that story to themselves.</p>
<p>As Jonathan Swift wrote (and as Rutherford quotes): "It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into."</p>
<p>But it's not just motivated reasoners who absorb this garbage. There's a whole business model built on selling people junk DNA science that makes "race science" regrettably spreadable.</p>
<p>That's where Rutherford is aiming: people who've assumed that 23andme and its rivals wouldn't be able to make millions selling you diagnoses of the precise quantity of viking DNA in your blood if there wasn't something to it.</p>
<p>And here Rutherford shines. He is, after all, a gifted science communicator. This is one seriously <em>charming</em> book, funny and witty and just flat-out fascinating.</p>
<p>Rutherford doesn't merely want to disabuse you of the fantastical claims of Junk DNA Science – he wants to excite you about the incredible NEW things we're learning thanks to the rapid advances in genomics.</p>
<p>Like the fact that Africa is the most genetically diverse place on Earth, with two members of the Sen tribe from different regions being more genetically divergent than a Swede and an Australian Aboriginal person.</p>
<p>And the fact that you only need to go back 11 generations before you reach an ancestor whose DNA is likely completely missing from your own genome. Or the small number of centuries you have to look back before you find the first common ancestor of every European.</p>
<p>And the amount of genetic outflow and backflow between seemingly isolated places – Bronze Age Africa and Europe, say – and the waves of migration we can trace through genomes that eliminate any claim to national genetic commonality in any land.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered what role genomics plays in the dominance of people from east Africa in footraces, or the number of Jewish Nobelists, Rutherford's here for you, unpicking what we know about the role of genes in these attainments (spoiler: they're not that important).</p>
<p>All leavened with gentle and devastating dunks on "race science" believers and the wit of Douglas Adams in his prime.</p>
<p>It may not help you win arguments with racists – they cannot be reasoned out of what they weren't reasoned into.</p>
<p>But it a powerful innoculant against the ideas drifting out of their foetid pits and into the rest of the world.</p>

<p>The Heroes Without Limits project was created by disability advocate Sara Thompson, "producing and streaming real play tabletop games with an all-disabled/chronically ill/neurodivergent cast and crew."</p>
<p>Thompson's work also includes creating homebrew RPG add-ons "roleplay and address disability" in your own games.</p>
<p>A recent addition is the Combat Wheelchair, rules for integrating wheelchair using adventurers into your Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition games:</p>

<p>The chair comes with its own attacks and added capabilities – like being able to fix a weapon in place on it and ramming/tyre striking your adversaries, or high-speed descents on sloped terrain.</p>
<p>The docs also come with a new character class, "The Paralympian."</p>

<p>Combat Wheelchairs' obvious, manifest coolness has not prevented gatekeeping yum-yukkers from raising spurious objections to them, and these are addressed in the homebrew rules.</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/1593927412.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/craphound.com/images/1593927412.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>But far more interesting than Combat Wheelchairs' detractors are its boosters, who have unleashed a torrent of delightful and creative new media building on Thompson's work.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                
                
<p>full source code is available <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/tree/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c">here</a>.</p>
<p>performance is important, and yet our intuition about it is often wrong. <a href="https://nathants.com/posts/refactoring-common-distributed-data-patterns-into-s4">previously</a> we deployed optimized python across a cluster of machines to analyze the <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records-pds/" rel="nofollow">nyc taxi</a> dataset. how was its performance?</p>
<p>let's try to discover a reasonable baseline for data processing performance and build intuition that can guide our decisions. we'll do this by experimenting with simple transformations of generated data using various formats, techniques, and languages on a single cpu core.</p>
<p>whether we are configuring and using off the shelf software or building bespoke systems, we need the ability to intuit problems and detect low hanging fruit.</p>
<p>we'll say that our data is a sequence of rows, that a row is made of 8 columns, and that a column is a random dictionary word.</p>
<p>we'll generate our dataset as csv with the following <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/gen_csv.py">script</a>.</p>
<div><pre><span># gen_csv.py</span>
<span>import</span> <span>sys</span>
<span>import</span> <span>random</span>

<span>words</span> <span>=</span> [
    ...
]

<span>num_rows</span> <span>=</span> <span>int</span>(<span>sys</span>.<span>argv</span>[<span>1</span>])

<span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>num_rows</span>):
    <span>row</span> <span>=</span> [<span>random</span>.<span>choice</span>(<span>words</span>) <span>for</span> <span>_</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(<span>8</span>)]
    <span>print</span>(<span>','</span>.<span>join</span>(<span>row</span>))</pre></div>
<p>our first transformation will be selecting a subset of columns.</p>
<p>let's try python.</p>
<div><pre><span># select.py</span>
<span>import</span> <span>sys</span>

<span>for</span> <span>line</span> <span>in</span> <span>sys</span>.<span>stdin</span>:
    <span>columns</span> <span>=</span> <span>line</span>.<span>split</span>(<span>','</span>)
    <span>print</span>(<span>f'<span><span>{</span><span>columns</span>[<span>2</span>]<span>}</span></span>,<span><span>{</span><span>columns</span>[<span>6</span>]<span>}</span></span>'</span>)</pre></div>
<p>first we need some data.</p>
<div><pre><span>&gt;&gt;</span> pypy3 gen_csv.py 1000000 <span>&gt;</span> /tmp/data.csv

<span>&gt;&gt;</span> ls -lh /tmp/data.csv <span>|</span> awk <span><span>'</span>{print $5}<span>'</span></span>

72M</pre></div>
<p>we're gonna need more data.</p>
<div><pre><span>&gt;&gt;</span> pypy3 gen_csv.py 15000000 <span>&gt;</span> /tmp/data.csv

<span>&gt;&gt;</span> ls -lh /tmp/data.csv <span>|</span> awk <span><span>'</span>{print $5}<span>'</span></span>

1.1G</pre></div>
<p>that'll do. now let's try our selection. we'll make sure a subset of the result is sane, then we'll check the hash of the entire result using <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/xxhash/" rel="nofollow">xxhsum</a>. all other runs we'll discard the output and time execution.</p>
<div><pre><span>&gt;&gt;</span> python select.py <span>&lt;</span>/tmp/data.csv <span>|</span> head -n3

12927f314ca6e9eb</pre></div>
<p>seems sane. let's time it.</p>

<p>faster. we may need to look at compiled languages for a reasonable baseline.</p>
<p>let's optimize by avoiding allocations and doing as little work as possible. we'll pull rows off a buffered reader, setup columns as offsets into that buffer, and access columns by slicing the row data.</p>
<p>let's try <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/select.go">go</a>.</p>

<p>pretty much the same. let's try <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/select.c">c</a>. we'll grab a few header only dependencies for <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/utils/csv.h">csv parsing</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/utils/write_simple.h">buffered writing</a>.</p>

<p>so <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/select.rs">rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/select.go">go</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/select.c">c</a> are very similar. we may have established a baseline when working with csv.</p>
<p>let's try a similar optimization with <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/select_inlined.py">pypy</a>.</p>

<p>interesting. slower than naive python and csv.</p>
<p>is reading and writing data to some format a majority of the work?</p>
<p>let's think about our optimized code from before. our representation of a row is 3 pieces of data. a byte array of content, an array of column start positions, and an array of column sizes. writing a row as csv was easy, but <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/utils/csv.h">reading</a> was hard.</p>
<p>what if we made it easier? all we want is an array of bytes and two int arrays.</p>
<p>let's let a row written as bytes be:</p>
<ul>
<li>the max zero based index</li>
<li>the column sizes</li>
<li>the column data</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><span>|</span> u16:max <span>|</span> u16:size <span>|</span> ... <span>|</span> u8[]:column <span>|</span> ... <span>|</span></pre></div>
<p>this should be easy to write, and more importantly easy to read. we can read max, which tells us how many sizes to read. from the sizes we can reconstruct the offsets and the size of the row data. we can then read the row data, and access the columns by offset and size.</p>
<p>our optimized code also buffered reads and writes into large chunks.</p>
<p>let's let a chunk of rows written as bytes be:</p>
<ul>
<li>size</li>
<li>data</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><span>|</span> i32:size <span>|</span> u8[]:row <span>|</span> ... <span>|</span></pre></div>
<p>let's constrain a chunk to only contain complete rows and be smaller than some maximum size.</p>
<p>we'll call this format bsv. we'll implement buffered <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/utils/read.h">reading</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/utils/write.h">writing</a> of chunks, as well as <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/utils/load.h">loading</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/utils/dump.h">dumping</a> of <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/utils/row.h">rows</a>.</p>
<p>let's implement our transformation using bsv in <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/bsv/select.c">c</a>.</p>

<p>we've processed the same data, and system time has been fairly consistent, but user time has varied significantly.</p>
<p>let's try a second transformation where we reverse the columns of every row.</p>

<p>in transformations 2 and 3 we again see significant variance in user time.</p>

<p>now this is interesting. when dealing with csv, the ratio of inputs to outputs has almost no impact on performance. when dealing with bsv the impact is x3 at each step. this suggests that for csv, parsing the input dominates, while for bsv, writing the output dominates. this asks an interesting question, how can we optimize output? for simplicity, the bsv code is outputting csv. it may be worth experimenting with other output formats, but we'll skip that for now.</p>
<p>do we have enough information to establish a baseline? perhaps.</p>
<p>we've seen <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/select.py">python</a> process csv and <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/psv/select.go">go</a> process protobuf at 100 megabytes / second.</p>
<p>we've seen <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/select.c">c</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/select.go">go</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/blob/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/select.rs">rust</a> process csv at 400 megabytes / second.</p>
<p>we've seen <a href="https://github.com/nathants/posts/tree/004/004_data_processing_performance_with_python_go_rust_and_c/bsv">c</a> process bsv at 1-10 gigabytes / second.</p>
<p>why don't we start with the following baseline. we'll think of it as napkin math.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>category</th>
<th>rate</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>slow</td>
<td>&nbsp; &lt;=100 megabytes / second / cpu core</td>

</table>
<p>as we do data processing, either by configuring and using off the shelf software, or by building bespoke systems, we can keep these rates in mind.</p>

IBM <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-08-17-IBM-Reveals-Next-Generation-IBM-POWER10-Processor">took the wraps off POWER10 officially today</a>, a (Samsung-manufactured) 7nm monster in 18 layers with up to 15 SMT-8 cores (120 threads) with 2MB of L2 per core, up to 120MB of L3, 1 TB/s memory access, OpenCAPI and PCIe 5. New on-board is an embedded matrix math accelerator for specialized AI performance, multipetabyte memory clusters and transparent memory encryption with four times the number of AES engines than POWER9. Overall, IBM is touting that the processor is three times more energy efficient than POWER9 while being up to twice as fast at scalar and four times as fast at vector operations. General availability is announced for Q3 or Q4 of 2021.
</p><p>
First of all: damn. This sounds sweet. The dual-8 POWER9 Talos II under the desk with "just" 64 threads and PCIe 4 is already giving me sorrowful Eeyore eyes even though there's no guarantee what, if any, lower-end systems suitable as being workstations will be available when the processor is. But right now, what we <em>do</em> know is that right now <a href="https://www.talospace.com/2020/07/condor-cancelled.html#comments">Raptor has said there won't be POWER10 systems</a>, and as it stands presently nobody else is making workstation-class OpenPOWER machines. Raptor, probably for reasons of NDAs, is playing this close to the vest, so what follows is merely my variably informed personal conjecture and may be completely inaccurate.
</p><p>
One of the truly incredible things about OpenPOWER — or at least POWER8 and POWER9 — is how far down you can see what the hardware is doing. In previous articles, we looked at <a href="https://www.talospace.com/2020/06/its-talos-all-way-down.html">emulating OpenPOWER at the bare metal level</a>, and then even <a href="https://www.talospace.com/2020/07/the-littlest-power9-booter.html">writing your own firmware bootkernel</a>. But the bootloader and high-level firmware are really only the beginning: the build image <a href="https://github.com/open-power/op-build">created by op-build</a> not only contains the Petitboot bootloader, but its Skiroot filesystem, Skiboot (containing OPAL, the OpenPOWER Abstraction Layer, which handles PCIe, interrupt and operating system services), Hostboot (which initializes and trains RAM, buffers and the bus), and the Self-Boot Engine which initializes the CPUs. Even the fused-in first instructions the POWER9 executes from its OTPROM to run the Self-Boot Engine <a href="https://github.com/open-power/sbe/blob/master/src/boot/otprom_init.S">are open source</a>, and other than the OTPROM itself (it <em>is</em> a One-Time Programmable ROM, after all), everything is inspectable and changeable. And before the POWER9 executes those very first instructions, the Baseboard Management Controller that powers the system on has <a href="https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc">its own open firmware</a> too. You <em>know</em> what your computer is doing, and you don't have to trust anyone's firmware build if you don't want to because you can always build and flash the system yourself.
</p><p>
Contrast this against the gyrations that x86 "open" systems have to struggle with. Do not interpret this as a slam against vendors like System76 or Purism because they're doing the best they can to deliver the most frequently used architecture in workstations and servers, in as unlocked a fashion as possible from processor manufacturers who are going in exactly the opposite direction. And there have been <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/deep-dive-into-intel-me-disablement/">great improvements</a> in untangling the tendrils of the Intel Management Engine from the processor, primarily through <a href="https://www.coreboot.org/">Coreboot's steady evolution</a>. But even with these improvements where significant portions of the Intel ME are disabled, secret sauce is still needed to bring up the CPU and you have to trust that the sauce is only and specifically doing what it says it is, in addition to the other partitions of the ME which activated or not are still not fully understood. The situation is even worse for AMD Ryzen processors with the Platform Security Processor, which (at least the 3000 and 4000 variants) aren't presently supported by Coreboot at all, though System76 is apparently working on a port.

Don't just take my word for it: as of this writing <a href="https://ryf.fsf.org/categories/mainboards">no recent x86 system appears on the FSF Respects Your Freedom list</a>, but <a href="https://www.talospace.com/2019/11/talos-ii-and-talos-ii-lite-officially.html">the Talos II and T2 Lite both do</a> (and I imagine the Blackbird is soon to follow). The Vikings D8 is <a href="https://store.vikings.net/libre-friendly-hardware/d8ryf">indisputably libre</a>, and <a href="https://www.fsf.org/news/vikings-d8-mainboard-and-d8-workstation-now-fsf-certified-to-respect-your-freedom">has an FSF RYF certification</a>, but is an AMD Opteron 4200, which is about eight or nine years old. As it stands I believe this is the most powerful x86 system still available on the FSF RYF list now that the D16 is out of production (Opteron 6200).
</p><p>
I think there's a reasonable argument to be had about how "open" something needs to be to be considered "libre" and at what point you could be considered to have meaningful control of your machine, but there's no denying there are aspects of modern x86 machines which you are prohibited by policy from getting into, and that means putting more faith in the processor vendor than they may truly deserve. (Don't get me started on GPUs, either. Or, for that matter, ARM.) Again, Raptor won't say, but their public disenchantment with POWER10 suggests that some aspects of the processor firmware stack are not open. This is a situation which is no better than x86, and I'm hoping this is merely an oversight on IBM's part and not a future policy.
</p><p>
To be effective, OpenPOWER needs to be more open than just the ISA being royalty-free, <a href="https://www.talospace.com/2019/08/day-2-keynote-and-openpower-blows-doors.html">even though that's huge</a>. To be sure, I think there has to be room for processor manufacturers to distinguish themselves in the market or you run the risk of a race to the bottom where people simply rip off designs (this is, I think, a real concern for RISC-V). I think sharing reference designs is necessary to get systems bootstrapped but I can't deny there's money in high performance applications, and high performance microarchitecture demands a return on investment to justify development costs. Similarly, to the extent that any pack-in hardware (like POWER9's Nest Accelerators) isn't part of the open ISA and are separately managed devices that simply share a die, to me it seems logical to also make it part of how a processor manufacturer can stand out to potential customers.
</p><p>
But the firmware absolutely needs to be as clean and available as the ISA. If the ISA is open and the instructions the CPU is running are part of that open standard, then any firmware components, which (ought to) entirely consist of those instructions, must be open too. If the CPU has pack-in hardware on the die that isn't part of the open ISA, then you should be able to bring up the chip without it. The standard that was set for current OpenPOWER should be the same standard for POWER10 or it doesn't really deserve the OpenPOWER name, and I'm worried that Raptor's insinuations imply IBM's standard isn't the same. Similarly, arguing that the currently incomplete situation with x86 is functionally equivalent to OpenPOWER (or, for that matter, RISC-V) may be well-intentioned but is disingenuous. The FSF may be ideologues on binary blobs, but that doesn't make their position wrong, and the entire OpenPOWER ecosystem from IBM on down should recognize how much goodwill and prominence the openness of POWER8 and POWER9 has generated for the community.
</p><p>
I hope I'm wrong, but I'm concerned I'm not. Let's make sure we get POWER10 right or we won't be practicing what we preach, and that's going to kill us in the crib.

<p><span>February 23, 2014</span>
</p>
<p><em> <strong>Content warning:</strong> Discussion of social justice, discussion of violence, spoilers for Jacqueline Carey books.</em>
</p>
<hr>
<p><em> <strong>Edit 10/25:</strong> This post was inspired by a debate with a friend of a friend on Facebook who has since become somewhat famous. I’ve renamed him here to “Andrew Cord” to protect his identity.</em>
</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>Andrew Cord <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hallq/2014/02/on-some-criticism-of-lesswrong/" rel="nofollow">criticizes me</a> for my bold and controversial suggestion that maybe people should try to tell slightly fewer blatant hurtful lies:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just find it kind of darkly amusing and sad that the “rationalist community” loves “rationality is winning” so much as a tagline and yet are clearly not winning. And then complain about losing rather than changing their tactics to match those of people who are winning.
</p>
<p>Which is probably because if you *really* want to be the kind of person who wins you have to actually care about winning something, which means you have to have politics, which means you have to embrace “politics the mindkiller” and “politics is war and arguments are soldiers”, and Scott would clearly rather spend the rest of his life losing than do this.
</p>
<p>That post [ <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/17/lies-damned-lies-and-social-media-part-5-of-%e2%88%9e/" rel="nofollow">the one debunking false rape statistics</a> ] is exactly my problem with Scott. He seems to honestly think that it’s a worthwhile use of his time, energy and mental effort to download evil people’s evil worldviews into his mind and try to analytically debate them with statistics and cost-benefit analyses.
</p>
<p>He gets *mad* at people whom he detachedly intellectually agrees with but who are willing to back up their beliefs with war and fire rather than pussyfooting around with debate-team nonsense.
</p>
<p>It honestly makes me kind of sick. It is exactly the kind of thing that “social justice” activists like me *intend* to attack and “trigger” when we use “triggery” catchphrases about the mewling pusillanimity of privileged white allies.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, if a fight is important to you, fight nasty. If that means lying, lie. If that means insults, insult. If that means silencing people, silence.
</p>
<p>It always makes me happy when my ideological opponents come out and say eloquently and openly what I’ve always secretly suspected them of believing.
</p>
<p>My natural instinct is to give some of the reasons why I think Andrew is wrong, starting with the history of the “noble lie” concept and moving on to some examples of why it didn’t work very well, and why it might not be expected to work so well in the future.
</p>
<p>But in a way, that would be assuming the conclusion. I wouldn’t be showing respect for Andrew’s arguments. I wouldn’t be going halfway to meet them on their own terms.
</p>
<p>The respectful way to rebut Andrew’s argument would be to spread malicious lies about Andrew to a couple of media outlets, fan the flames, and wait for them to destroy his reputation. Then if the stress ends up bursting an aneurysm in his brain, I can dance on his grave, singing:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>♪ ♬ I won this debate in a very effective manner. Now you can’t argue in favor of nasty debate tactics any more ♬ ♪
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not going to do that, but if I <em>did</em> it’s unclear to me how Andrew could object. I mean, he thinks that sexism is detrimental to society, so spreading lies and destroying people is justified in order to stop it. I think that discourse based on mud-slinging and falsehoods is detrimental to society. Therefore…
</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>But really, all this talk of lying and spreading rumors about people is – what was Andrew’s terminology – “pussyfooting around with debate-team nonsense”. You know who got things done? The IRA. They didn’t agree with the British occupation of Northern Ireland and they weren’t afraid to let people know in that very special way only a nail-bomb shoved through your window at night can.
</p>
<p>Why not assassinate prominent racist and sexist politicians and intellectuals? I won’t name names since that would be crossing a line, but I’m sure you can generate several of them who are sufficiently successful and charismatic that, if knocked off, there would not be an equally competent racist or sexist immediately available to replace them, and it would thus be a serious setback for the racism/sexism movement.
</p>
<p>Other people can appeal to “the social contract” or “the general civilizational rule not to use violence”, but not Andrew:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think that whether or not I use certain weapons has zero impact on whether or not those weapons are used against me, and people who think they do are either appealing to a kind of vague Kantian morality that I think is invalid or a specific kind of “honor among foes” that I think does not exist.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And don’t give me that nonsense about the police. I’m sure a smart person like you can think of clever exciting new ways to commit the perfect murder. Unless you do not believe there will <em>ever</em> be an opportunity to defect unpunished, you need this sort of social contract to take you at least some of the way.
</p>
<p>He continues:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Scott calls rhetorical tactics he dislikes “bullets” and denigrates them it actually hilariously plays right into this point…to be “pro-bullet” or “anti-bullet” is ridiculous. Bullets, as you say, are neutral. I am in favor of my side using bullets as best they can to destroy the enemy’s ability to use bullets.
</p>
<p>In a war, a real war, a war for survival, you use all the weapons in your arsenal because you assume the enemy will use all the weapons in theirs. Because you understand that it IS a war.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of things I am tempted to say to this.
</p>
<p>Like “And that is why the United States immediately nukes every country it goes to war with.”
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why the Geneva Convention was so obviously impossible that no one even bothered to attend the conference”.
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why, <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/22/apart-from-better-sanitation-and-medicine-and-education-and-irrigation-and-public-health-and-roads-and-public-order-what-has-modernity-done-for-us/" rel="nofollow">to this very day</a>, we solve every international disagreement through total war.”
</p>
<p>Or “And that is why Martin Luther King was immediately reduced to a nonentity, and we remember the Weathermen as the sole people responsible for the success of the civil rights movement”
</p>
<p>But I think what I am <em>actually</em> going to say is that, for the love of God, if you like bullets so much, stop using them as a metaphor for ‘spreading false statistics’ and go buy a gun.
</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>So let’s derive why violence is not in fact The One True Best Way To Solve All Our Problems. You can get most of this from <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1619491702/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1619491702&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=slastacod-20&amp;linkId=AYGYZKSORVSJ52VW" rel="nofollow">Hobbes</a>, but this blog post will be shorter.
</p>
<p>Suppose I am a radical Catholic who believes all Protestants deserve to die, and therefore go around killing Protestants. So far, so good.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there might be some radical Protestants around who believe all Catholics deserve to die. If there weren’t before, there probably are now. So they go around killing Catholics, we’re both unhappy and/or dead, our economy tanks, hundreds of innocent people end up as collateral damage, and our country goes down the toilet.
</p>
<p>So we make an agreement: I won’t kill any more Catholics, you don’t kill any more Protestants. The specific Irish example was called the Good Friday Agreement and the general case is called “civilization”.
</p>
<p>So then I try to destroy the hated Protestants using the government. I go around trying to pass laws banning Protestant worship and preventing people from condemning Catholicism.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, maybe the next government in power is a Protestant government, and they pass laws banning Catholic worship and preventing people from condemning Protestantism. No one can securely practice their own religion, no one can learn about other religions, people are constantly plotting civil war, academic freedom is severely curtailed, and once again the country goes down the toilet.
</p>
<p>So again we make an agreement. I won’t use the apparatus of government against Protestantism, you don’t use the apparatus of government against Catholicism. The specific American example is the First Amendment and the general case is called “liberalism”, or to be dramatic about it, “civilization 2.0”.
</p>
<p>Every case in which both sides agree to lay down their weapons and be nice to each other has corresponded to spectacular gains by both sides and a new era of human flourishing.
</p>
<p>“Wait a second, no!” someone yells. “I see where you’re going with this. You’re going to say that agreeing not to spread malicious lies about each other would also be a civilized and beneficial system. Like maybe the Protestants could stop saying that the Catholics worshipped the Devil, and the Catholics could stop saying the Protestants hate the Virgin Mary, and they could both relax the whole thing about the Jews baking the blood of Christian children into their matzah.
</p>
<p>“But your two examples were about contracts written on paper and enforced by the government. So maybe a ‘no malicious lies’ amendment to the Constitution would work if it were enforceable, <em>which it isn’t</em>, but just <em>asking</em> people to stop spreading malicious lies is doomed from the start. The Jews will no doubt spread lies against <em>us</em>, so if we stop spreading lies about them, all we’re doing is abandoning an effective weapon against a religion I personally know to be heathenish! Rationalists should win, so put the blood libel on the front page of every newspaper!”
</p>
<p>Or, as Andrew puts it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether or not I use certain weapons has zero impact on whether or not those weapons are used against me, and people who think they do are either appealing to a kind of vague Kantian morality that I think is invalid or a specific kind of “honor among foes” that I think does not exist.
</p></blockquote>
<p>So let’s talk about how beneficial game-theoretic equilibria can come to exist even in the absence of centralized enforcers. I know of two main ways: reciprocal communitarianism, and divine grace.
</p>
<p>Reciprocal communitarianism is probably how altruism evolved. Some mammal started running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tit_for_tat" rel="nofollow">TIT-FOR-TAT</a>, the program where you cooperate with anyone whom you expect to cooperate with you. Gradually you form a successful community of cooperators. The defectors either join your community and agree to play by your rules or get outcompeted.
</p>
<p>Divine grace is more complicated. I was tempted to call it “spontaneous …</p></div></div>

      <div>
        <p>In this post we'll write a Python to C compiler in Python. This is
especially easy to do since Python has a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html">builtin parser
library</a> and because a
number of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/">CPython internals are exposed for extension
writers</a>.</p>
<p>By the end of this post, in a few hundred lines of Python, we'll be able to
compile and run the following program:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat tests/recursive_fib.py
def fib(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n

    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)


def main():
    print(fib(40))
$ python3 pyc tests/recursive_fib.py
$ ./bin/a.out
102334155
</code></pre>
<p>This post implements an extremely small subset of Python and
<strong>completely gives up on even trying to manage memory</strong> because I
cannot fathom manual reference counting. Maybe some day I'll find a
way to swap in an easy GC like Boehm.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/eatonphil/pyc">Source code for this project is available on Github.</a></p>
<h3 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3><p>We'll need Python3, GCC, libpython3, and clang-format.</p>
<p>On Fedora-based systems:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo dnf install gcc python3-devel clang-format python3
</code></pre>
<p>And on Debian-based systems:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo apt install gcc python3-dev clang-format python3
</code></pre>
<p>
  This program will likely work as well on Windows, Mac, FreeBSD,
  etc. but I haven't gone through the trouble of testing this (or
  providing custom compiler directives). Pull requests welcome!
</p><h3 id="a-hand-written-first-pass">A hand-written first-pass</h3><p>Before we get into the compiler, let's write the fibonacci program by
hand in C using libpython.</p>
<p>As described in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html#very-high-level-embedding">Python embedding
guide</a>
we'll need to include libpython and initialize it in
our <code>main.c</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  Py_Initialize();

  return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To compile against libpython, we'll use
<a href="https://helpmanual.io/man1/python3-config/">python3-config</a> installed
as part of <code>python3-devel</code> to tell us what should be linked
at each step during compilation.</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc -c -o main.o $(python3-config --cflags) main.c
$ gcc $(python3-config --ldflags) main.o
$ ./a.out; echo $?
0
</code></pre>
<p>Cool! Now as we think about translating the fibonacci implementation,
we want to keep everything as Python objects for as long as
possible. This means passing and receiving
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html">PyObject*</a> to and from
all functions, and converting all C integers to
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html">PyLong</a>, a "subtype" of
<code>PyObject*</code>. You can imagine that everything in Python is
an <code>object</code> until you operate on it.</p>
<p>
  For more information on objects in Python, check out
  the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html">Data
  model</a> page in Python docs.
</p><p>To map a C integer to a <code>PyLong*</code> we use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_FromLong">PyLong_FromLong</a>. To
map in reverse, we use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_AsLong">PyLong_AsLong</a>.</p>
<p>To compare two <code>PyObject*</code>s we can use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/object.html#c.PyObject_RichCompareBool">PyObject_RichCompareBool</a>
which will handle the comparison regardless of the type of the two
parameters. Without this helper we'd have to write complex checks to
make sure that the two sides are the same and if they are, unwrap them
into their underlying C value and compare the C value.</p>
<p>We can use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Add">PyNumber_Add</a>
and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/number.html#c.PyNumber_Subtract">PyNumber_Subtract</a>
for basic arithmetic, and there are many similar helpers available to
us for operations down the line.</p>
<p>Now we can write a translation:</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

PyObject* fib(PyObject* n) {
  PyObject* zero = PyLong_FromLong(0);
  PyObject* one = PyLong_FromLong(1);
  if (PyObject_RichCompareBool(n, zero, Py_EQ) || PyObject_RichCompareBool(n, one, Py_EQ)) {
    return n;
  }

  PyObject* left = fib(PyNumber_Subtract(n, one));

  PyObject* two = PyLong_FromLong(2);
  PyObject* right = fib(PyNumber_Subtract(n, two));

  return PyNumber_Add(left, right);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  Py_Initialize();

  PyObject* res = fib(PyLong_FromLong(7)); // Should be 13

  return PyLong_AsLong(res);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Compile and run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc -c -o main.o $(python3-config --cflags) main.c
$ gcc $(python3-config --ldflags) main.o
$ ./a.out; echo $?
13
</code></pre>
<p>That's great! But we cheated in one place. We assumed that the input
to the <code>fib</code> function was an integer, and we propagated
that assumption everywhere we wrote <code>PyNumber_*</code>
operations. When we write the compiler, we'll need to check that both
arguments are an integer before we call a numeric helper, otherwise we
may need to call a string concatenation helper or something else
entirely.</p>
<h3 id="compiler-architecture">Compiler Architecture</h3><p>We'll break the code into four major parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>libpyc.c</code>: helper functions for generated code</li>
<li><code>pyc/context.py</code>: utilities for scope and writing code in memory</li>
<li><code>pyc/codegen.py</code>: for generating C code from a Python AST</li>
<li><code>pyc/__main__.py</code>: the entrypoint</li>
</ol>
<p>
  When I'm writing a new compiler using an existing parser I almost
  always start with the entrypoint and code generator so I can explore
  the AST. However, it's easiest to explain the code if we start with
  the utilities first.
</p><p>We'll also want an empty <code>pyc/__init__.py</code>.</p>
<h3 id="libpyc.c">libpyc.c</h3><p>This C file will contain three helper functions for safely adding,
subtracting, and printing. It will be concatenated to the top of the
generated C file. We'll only support integers for now but this
structure sets us up for supporting more types later on.</p>
<p>We'll use
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html#c.PyLong_Check">PyLong_Check</a>
before calling number-specific methods.</p>
<pre><code>#define PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN
#include &lt;Python.h&gt;

inline PyObject* PYC_Add(PyObject* l, PyObject* r) {
  // TODO: allow __add__ override

  // Includes ints and bools
  if (PyLong_Check(l) &amp;&amp; PyLong_Check(r)) {
    return PyNumber_Add(l, r);
  }

  // TODO: handle str, etc.

  // TODO: throw exception
  return NULL;
}

inline PyObject* PYC_Sub(PyObject* l, PyObject* r) {
  // TODO: allow __add__ override

  // Includes ints and bools
  if (PyLong_Check(l) &amp;&amp; PyLong_Check(r)) {
    return PyNumber_Subtract(l, r);
  }

  // TODO: handle str, etc.

  // TODO: throw exception
  return NULL;
}

inline PyObject* PYC_Print(PyObject* o) {
  PyObject_Print(o, stdout, Py_PRINT_RAW);
  printf("\n");
  return Py_None;
}
</code></pre>
<p>That's it! We could generate these as strings in Python but it gets
hairy to do so. By using a dedicated C file, we can take advantage of
syntax highlighting since this file is only C code. And since we've
marked all functions as <code>inline</code>, there's no runtime cost
to using not embedding these as strings in Python.</p>
<h3 id="pyc/context.py">pyc/context.py</h3><p>This file will contain a <code>Context</code> class for managing
identifiers in scope and for proxying to a <code>Writer</code> class
that contains helpers for writing lines of C code.</p>
<p>We'll have two instances of the <code>Writer</code> class in
<code>Context</code> so that we can write to a body (or
current/primary) region and an initialization region.</p>
<p>The initialization region is necessary in case there are any variables
declared at the top-level. We can't initialize these variables in C
outside of a function since every <code>PyObject*</code> must be
created after calling <code>Py_Initialize</code>. This section will be
written into our C <code>main</code> function before we enter a
compiled Python <code>main</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>import copy


class Writer():
    content = ""

    def write(self, exp: str, indent: int = 0):
        self.content += ("  " * indent) + exp

    def writeln(self, stmt: str, indent: int = 0):
        self.write(stmt + "\n", indent)

    def write_statement(self, stmt: str, indent: int = 0):
        self.writeln(stmt + ";", indent)


class Context():
    initializations = Writer()
    body = Writer()
    indentation = 0

    scope = 0
    ret = None
    namings = {}
    counter = -1

    def __getattr__(self, name: str) -&gt; object:
        # Helpers to avoid passing in self.indentation every time
        outputs = [initializations", "body"]
        for output in outputs:

</code></pre>
<p>This is all pretty boring boilerplate. Let's move on.</p>
<h3 id="pyc/<strong>main</strong>.py">pyc/<strong>main</strong>.py</h3><p>The entrypoint is responsible for reading source code, parsing it,
calling the code generator, writing the source code to a C file, and
compiling it.</p>
<p>First, we read and parse the source code:</p>
<pre><code>import ast
import os
import subprocess
import shutil
import sys

from context import Context
from codegen import generate

BUILTINS = {
    "print": "PYC_Print",
}


def main():
    target = sys.argv[1]
    with open(target) as f:
        source = f.read()
    tree = ast.parse(source, target)
</code></pre>
<p>Then we write <code>libpyc.c</code> into the body, register builtins,
and run code generation:</p>
<pre><code>
...

def main()
    ...

    ctx = Context()
    with open("libpyc.c") as f:
        ctx.body_write(f.read() + "\n")

    for builtin, fn in BUILTINS.items():
        ctx.register_global(builtin, fn)

    generate(ctx, tree)
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we create a clean output directory and write
<code>main.c</code> with the generated code and a <code>main</code>
function to initialization Python and any global variables:</p>
<pre><code>...

def main():
   ...

    # Create and move to working directory
    outdir = "bin"
    shutil.rmtree(outdir, ignore_errors=True)
    os.mkdir(outdir)
    os.chdir(outdir)

    with open("main.c", "w") as f:
        f.write(ctx.body.content)

        main = ctx.namings.get("main")["name"]
        f.write(f"""int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {{
  Py_Initialize();

  // Initialize globals, if any.
{ctx.initializations.content}
  PyObject* r = {main}();
  return PyLong_AsLong(r);
}}""")
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we run <code>clang-format</code> and <code>gcc</code> against
the generated C code:</p>
<pre><code>...

def main():
    ...

    subprocess.run(["clang-format", "-i", "main.c"])

    cflags_raw = …</code></pre></div></div></div>

            <p>We are happy to announce that <a href="https://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> has chosen Kiwi TCMS
for the basis of their <em>Quality Assurance methodology and infrastructure</em>
improvement program!
Kiwi TCMS will play a central role in storing test case definitions,
organizing test cycles, and assigning and tracking test executions by testers
from the QGIS community.</p>
<div>
    <p><img src="https://kiwitcms.org/images/customers/qgis-color.png"></p><p>
        QGIS is a free and open source geographic information system which contains
        desktop, server, web and mobile applications for various operating systems.
        It is an established project with very large and diverse community and also
        one of the very well known open source GIS systems.
    </p>
</div>

<p>The proposal
<a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/180">QEP#180</a> is the
highest voted proposal in the
<a href="http://blog.qgis.org/2020/07/10/qgis-grant-programme-2020-results/">2020 QGIS Grant Program</a>
and has been awarded a budget of 5000€!
This grant will allow the proponents to spend significantly more time setting up the
infrastructure and planning a methodology for manual testing.</p>
<h2>Scope of proposal</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/180">QEP#180</a>
aims to create the necessary infrastructure and methodology to organize and
encourage systematic testing before each QGIS release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup a test management system to organize test cycles, assign and track tests execution;</li>
<li>Elaborate and document a methodology to execute testing to help testers;</li>
<li>Resurrect and move the tester plugin to QGIS repositories. Publish it in the QGIS official repository</li>
<li>Create an initial set of relevant test cases;</li>
<li>Organize and execute the initial test cases for the next releases.</li>
</ul>
<p>This effort will steer members &amp; volunteers of the QGIS community towards a more systematic
and organized testing during a feature freeze period before a release. The focus here
is on integration testing, manual &amp; semi-automated workflows for important functionality
that should never regress and is hard or impossible to cover via unit tests.</p>
<p>The proposal is lead by Alexandre Neto, Giovanni Manghi and Alexander Bruy!</p>
<p><br>
On behalf of the Kiwi TCMS community welcome aboard and happy testing!</p>

August 17, 2020 | https://www.embly.run/star/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.embly.run/star/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><em><strong>tl:dr</strong> <a href="https://github.com/embly/star"><strong>star</strong></a> is a python(ish) programming environment that lets you call Go library functions. <a href="https://www.embly.run/star/#repl">click down to the repl</a> if you'd just like to play around</em></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark">Starlark</a> is Google's custom subset of Python that it uses as a configuration language with Bazel. I started looking into it a little because it has some interesting characteristics. It's not turing complete (no unbounded loops), it doesn't have classes or higher level abstractions, it's also deterministic and is somewhat safe to run untrusted user input.</p>
<p>Although somewhat limited it felt like it might make a good candidate for a serverless function runtime that could be added to <a href="https://embly.run/">embly</a>. Easier to sandbox, could mock out pieces of the python standard library, maybe provide just enough functionality for it to be useful. I also thought you might be able to identify the deterministic blocks of code and replace them with the static result on subsequent runs. Potentially exciting stuff!</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/google/starlark-go">starlark-go</a> to get started and pretty quickly had this demo up and running:</p>
<pre><span>def </span><span>hello</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>, </span><span>req</span><span>):
    w.</span><span>write</span><span>(req.content_type)
    w.</span><span>write</span><span>(req.path)
    w.</span><span>write</span><span>("</span><span>\n</span><span>Hello World</span><span>\n</span><span>" + </span><span>str</span><span>([x </span><span>for </span><span>x </span><span>in </span><span>range</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>)]) + "</span><span>\n</span><span>")

    </span><span>return
</span></pre>
<p>The server parses the file, starts a web server, takes the <code>hello</code> function and passes the <code>http.ResponseWriter</code> and <code>http.Request</code> over to the <strike>python</strike> starlark side of things on every http request. From there I could add attributes to pass over things like the <code>path</code> and <code>content_type</code>.</p>
<p>Starlark doesn't have exception handling, so I add a Go error type and passed that over as well. This ends up being almost as verbose as Go, but without typed functions it does allow for a little more flexibility:</p>
<pre><span>def </span><span>handle_err</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>):
    </span><span>for </span><span>a </span><span>in </span><span>args:
        </span><span>if </span><span>type</span><span>(a) == "</span><span>error</span><span>" and a:
            </span><span>print</span><span>(a, a.</span><span>stacktrace</span><span>())
    </span><span>return </span><span>args

foo, err = </span><span>handle_err</span><span>(</span><span>function_call</span><span>())
</span></pre>
<p>At this point I got a little more interested in continuing to cram Go functionality into this scripting language. The <a href="https://github.com/google/starlark-go">starlark-go</a> implementation is really wonderful and it was quite easy to extend.</p>
<p>In talking to my coworker I wondered if you could pull in lots of Go functionality, we sketched up something like this:</p>
<pre><span>import </span><span>time
</span><span>from </span><span>net </span><span>import </span><span>http
</span><span>from </span><span>star </span><span>import </span><span>chan, go

</span><span>def </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>):
    time.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)
    c.</span><span>push</span><span>("</span><span>hello</span><span>")

</span><span>def </span><span>main</span><span>():
    resp, err = http.</span><span>get</span><span>("</span><span>https://www.embly.run/hello/</span><span>")
    </span><span>if </span><span>err:
        </span><span>return </span><span>print</span><span>(err)

    c = </span><span>chan</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)
    </span><span>go</span><span>(foo, c)
    c.</span><span>next</span><span>()
</span></pre>
<p>From a syntax standpoint it seems like this would be possible. Starlark also has first-class support for running separate chunks of code in parallel (globals are immutable, which helps), so leveraging Go's concurrency model didn't seem too difficult either.</p>
<p>After a little more messing around, most of that sketch has been implemented: <a href="https://github.com/embly/star">https://github.com/embly/star</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/embly/star"><strong>star</strong></a> is a python(ish) programming environment that lets you call Go library functions. It is very fragile and shouldn't be taken seriously, but it's very fun to play with.</p>
<p>Here's what that sketch ended up looking like:</p>
<pre><span>http = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>net/http</span><span>")
ioutil = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>io/ioutil</span><span>")
sync = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>sync</span><span>")
star = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>star</span><span>")
time = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>time</span><span>")

</span><span>def </span><span>get_url</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>, </span><span>wg</span><span>):
    resp, err = http.</span><span>Get</span><span>(url)
    </span><span>if </span><span>err:
        </span><span>return </span><span>print</span><span>(err)
    b, err = ioutil.</span><span>ReadAll</span><span>(resp.Body)
    </span><span>if </span><span>err:
        </span><span>return </span><span>print</span><span>(err)
    body, err = star.</span><span>bytes_to_string</span><span>(b)
    </span><span>if </span><span>err:
        </span><span>return </span><span>print</span><span>(err)
    time.</span><span>Sleep</span><span>(time.Second * </span><span>2</span><span>)
    wg.</span><span>Done</span><span>()


</span><span>def </span><span>main</span><span>():
    wg = sync.</span><span>WaitGroup</span><span>()
    wg.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)
    urls = [
        "</span><span>https://www.embly.run/hello/</span><span>",
        "</span><span>https://www.embly.run/hello/</span><span>",
        "</span><span>https://www.embly.run/hello/</span><span>",
    ]
    </span><span>for </span><span>url </span><span>in </span><span>urls:
        star.</span><span>go</span><span>(get_url, url, wg)
    wg.</span><span>Wait</span><span>()
</span></pre>
<p>Really trippy to look at if you've written python and Go. A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>starlark doesn't support python's import syntax, so I went with a <code>require</code> function</li>
<li><code>star.go</code> spawns a goroutine and it works! adding channels wouldn't be too hard either</li>
<li><code>star.bytes_to_string</code> shows some of the cracks, I wasn't too sure how to add type conversion</li>
</ul>
<p>I've only converted a small subset of the Go stdlib, you can see the list of available components here: <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/blob/master/src/packages.go">https://github.com/embly/star/blob/master/src/packages.go</a></p>
<p>I also got a callback function working so that go/python servers work as well:</p>
<pre><span>http = </span><span>require</span><span>("</span><span>net/http</span><span>")

</span><span>def </span><span>hello</span><span>(</span><span>w</span><span>, </span><span>req</span><span>):
    w.</span><span>WriteHeader</span><span>(</span><span>201</span><span>)
    w.</span><span>Write</span><span>("</span><span>hello world</span><span>\n</span><span>")

http.</span><span>HandleFunc</span><span>("</span><span>/hello</span><span>", hello)

http.</span><span>ListenAndServe</span><span>("</span><span>:8080</span><span>", http.Handler)
</span></pre>
<p>The coolest part is that this is all pure Go, so we can also run all of it in webassembly. Here's <a href="https://embly.github.io/star/">a repl</a>, script away:</p>

<p>Or install with <code>go get github.com/embly/star/cmd/star</code></p>
<h4 id="closing-notes">Closing notes</h4>
<p>I originally though I could generate wrappers for the entire standard library. There has been a <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/tree/master/cmd/nebula">very small amount of work</a> made toward this effort and the wrapper functions have been written with generation in mind. In an <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/blob/3fe42d285d804cd90c97758a9b616b95c8ce25a6/src/io/lib.go">optimistic case</a> you can see how you could crawl the stdlib AST and generate the necessary code. From there you just populate <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/blob/3fe42d285d804cd90c97758a9b616b95c8ce25a6/src/packages.go">the mappings</a> and you're off. I thought it would be cool if you could chose what libraries and functions to include with star and generate your own binary so that you don't have to compile things you don't need.</p>
<p>Sadly, the current implementation is <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/blob/3fe42d285d804cd90c97758a9b616b95c8ce25a6/src/net/http/lib.go#L85-L105">full of edge cases</a>, so either the wrappers need a rewrite (probably true), or the generation code would need to be quite complex (maybe also true).</p>
<p>I've also left out a lot of important things, the idea of a pointer isn't really tracked, some values are pointers and some are not, this would need to be surfaced in star on some level.</p>
<p>No work has been done to soften the edge cases of passing things into Go, but conceivably this could be very nice. Star could make the best effort to convert any starlark/python type into the correct input type for a function. For the moment it will just crash.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts, please open an issue: <a href="https://github.com/embly/star/issues">https://github.com/embly/star/issues</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div><p>When you look across cultures with long recorded histories, one thing that you'll almost always see is a timeless, dualistic conflict between certain strands of thought.</p>
<h3 id="section-0">Material-Immaterial Dualities</h3>
<p>In China, there's Daoism which emphasizes the natural Way things proceed, competing with Confucianism which is a human attempt to organize socioeconomic and political structures. In India, there's Sramana which manifests as Buddhism, Jainism, and other heavily metaphysical doctrines, competing with Brahmana which descends from the materialist Vedic school of thought. And in the West, we can also broadly say that the Greco-Roman tradition with its heavy emphasis on logic and empiricism, competes with the Judeo-Christian tradition which more values faith in the supernatural.</p>
<p>On a surface level, these conflicts seem to me to be about the material vs the immaterial. This duality is put forth explicitly by many Western philosophers, most notably Plato in his theory of forms (immaterial) and objects (material); later on Descartes with his work on the Mind-Body problem. It can also be found in a slightly different form in the Sankhya school of Indian philosophy which centers on the duality of Purusa "spirit" (immaterial) and Prakrti "nature" (material).</p>
<p>One thing to be noted here is that most often in the Western tradition, the immaterial is characterized by the intellect, which through the process of logic is able to discern the Forms. The Indian tradition on the other hand, sees the immaterial as characterized by the soul, or consciousness, which through its seemingly eternal existence is concluded to be more "real" than the material.</p>
<h3 id="section-1">What "Truly" Exists</h3>
<p>In what way though is the soul eternal? There is another interesting duality here, that shows the irony of trying to determine what is true and what isn't with respect to the material and immaterial. On the one hand, consciousness (the "I" in "I think therefore I am") is all that we can ever be sure to truly exist. Yet simultaneously, it seems that the material is all that exists that we can agree on with other consciousnesses.</p>
<p>So the question ultimately seems to be axiomatic. Ironically, if one takes direct empirical perception as the supreme means to knowledge, the Self is all that exists. A dream, for example, would be as empirical of an observation as that of the "real" world, if this were the only axiom. And also ironically, if one takes logical inference as the supreme means to knowledge, one of the most salient conclusions would be that this material world, in which causal and logical relations fully obtain, is all that exists.</p>
<p>This, I think, is quite different from what most assume about the relationship between perception, logic, the immaterial, and the material. I'm sure there could be arguments for the other way around as well though. As an aside, one thing that consistently bugs me is an often assumed equivalence or similarity between logic and perception. Science has tied these two epistemological means quite closely together and to successful results, but they're astoundingly different upon closer inspection. If one were to rely exclusively on perception, they would end up with a worldview that is completely momentary, consisting of disconnected frames of existence. If one were to rely exclusively on logic, they would constantly arrive at the conclusion that the only eternal is that entity which is constructing the logic. These conclusions appear to refute those of the previous paragraph, and may be the irony that I was originally referring to, suggesting that logic vs perception isn't the basis for disagreements over the real.</p>
<h3 id="section-2">Immaterial Intellect or Immaterial Consciousness</h3>
<p>But does one construct logic or simply perceive it? The disagreement here might be fundamental to the split between those that see perceptive consciousness as the immaterial of dualism and those that instead see it as logical intellect. One way to look at the nature of self that is growing in popularity in cognitive science circles, is essentially an artifact that arises at the interaction between logic and perception. The theory goes that your mind is constantly in a loop, whereby it constructs a logical relation or theory, perceives the environment, and then updates the logical theory such that it is better in agreement with perception. The self arises at the border between these, perhaps primarily in the update rule.</p>
<p>So with this framework in mind, does the self construct logic or perceive it? Well the self certainly isn't the entity constructing the logic, in fact, the self isn't an entity at all. It seems to be a complete illusion, resulting from the interface between internal logic and external perception. Where the immaterial and material mingle, the self is born.</p>
<h3 id="section-3">Learning is Self</h3>
<p>Now, I don't know nearly enough about Deep Reinforcement Learning architectures to be able to say anything for sure, but the aforementioned endless loop that generates self seems to be quite akin to the training mechanism of a Reinforcement Learning agent. Without getting too deep into the technical details, RL is an approach to teaching computer programs (Machine Learning) through interaction with a simulated environment. The fundamental idea is that an agent has an innate need to maximize a reward signal supplied to it based on the environment's state, and can do so by improving its policy: a mechanism to decide an action based on its environment.</p>
<p>Already, you may be beginning to see similarities. The environment, is well, the material environment that we make perceptions of. The policy is more or less the logic that allows us to create immaterial abstractions and make decisions based on their results. So where does the self fit in then? We're clearly not simply a reward signal, but it might be the case that we're the direct result of that reward signal—i.e. the policy update step, where an agent changes its policy in order to better fit the environment.</p>
<p>If there's a hint of dissatisfaction with this answer, I think it is due to the assumed simplicity of the reward signal. A solution to this could be a mechanism that takes the simple reward and learns to adjusts it with relation to the environment and internal state, which would provide an even more information-dense signal. This would be an adversarial architecture, and completely speculatively might be a reason for the two-hemisphered nature of the brain.</p>
<h3 id="section-4">Exploitation and Exploration in Human Culture</h3>
<p>It's quite nice that we arrived at Reinforcement Learning through this discussion of the self, but my original intention to include RL in this piece was primarily in relation to culture, not philosophy. One of the core problems in RL is that of exploitation vs exploration. When an agent discovers a method to receive a high reward signal, to what extent should it exploit that method, thereby guaranteeing at least some success, instead of exploring and taking the risk to possibly find an even higher reward?</p>
<p>I would argue that human culture itself is a solution mechanism to this problem. In traditionally conservative cultures, the entire attitude towards life is that "we already know what works" and to take that path in order to minimize risk, i.e. exploitation. In progressive cultures, risk-taking is praised, often regardless of the results, i.e. exploration. I should also note that my usage of "conservative" and "progressive" here are partially in a vacuum but also partially hold interesting parallels to modern politics.</p>
<h3 id="section-5">The Exploit-Explore Cycle</h3>
<p>One interesting observation here is that progressive cultures, by their very nature, tend not to exist for that long. When they develop and succeed, they produce grand civilizations, eventually become concretized, and inevitably stabilize into a conservative culture focused on protecting the tradition developed by their forebearers. This can be seen in the early Vedic period (~1500 BC) of India, for example, which displays tremendous social mobility and a culture of expansion that led to the settlement of the entire Gangetic plain. Once it was completely settled, a stable agrarian culture flourished for many centuries and produced the Upanishadic literature which built metaphysical ideas around the ritualistic core of the Vedas (I personally think this period actually found a great balance of explore-exploit).</p>
<p>By ~400 BC though, society was ripe for a revolution in thought, which resulted in the spread of Buddhism across the subcontinent. The subsequent few centuries were again a period of stasis within Indian culture with constant invasion by Central Asian tribes (who themselves eventually converted to Buddhism and partly settled in modern Punjab). Then in the 400s AD we get a revival of Hindu discourse in the Gupta period, a few more centuries of stasis, and I could keep going on analyzing every civilization's history in such a manner.</p>
<p>So all history really seems to be is a bursting forth, every now and then, of an explorational culture that due to selection bias produces wide-reaching civilizational effects. The explorational cultures that take too many risks or fail to protect themselves from collapse often just end up being forgotten. Looking back through history, we primarily see long-lasting exploitational cultures which must find their beginning in an explorational culture at some point or another.</p>
<p>With respect to specifically Eurasia, one might also notice that the nomadic Central Asian cultures seem to act sort of adversarially to the agrarian Peripheral Eurasian cultures (of Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia) but to the betterment of both. The nomadic cultures which tend to be quite explorational, regularly attack peripheral agricultural settlements, consequently encouraging the peripheries to explore further and develop defenses. The peripheral cultures that fail to explore will become subsumed by the explorational nomads, further developing civilization and eventually …</p></div></div></div>

    <article><p><img src="https://bekirdag.com/img/robotics_agencies_quadruped.png" alt="Opensource modular robotics"></p>
<p>The robotics revolution is about to happen as we are all expecting. But how will it take place, and what will change in our lives?</p>

<h2 id="open-source-is-the-only-way">Open-source is the only way</h2>
<p>Like everything else in life, the development will be gradual so that it won’t happen overnight. It is essential for the giant companies to get involved in the robotics development. Still, I don’t think that it will be them who will take the initiative, it will be crowdfunded open-source communities, because there won’t be big wins for early starting commercial organizations.</p>
<p>Robotics is in its infancy at the moment; investing in it is still commercially not viable. A company’s primary focus is profit. Robotics will not be a compelling investment for a company, considering the end product will be a robot that can not do much other than specific tasks. A reasonable CEO, understandably, will not be interested in such a project. They will only be interested after seeing some real-life achievements and when they can foresee the profit.</p>
<p>The problem of robotics is the fundamental complexity of it. A team of engineers should cover the disciplines</p>
<ul>
<li>Software
<ul>
<li>Microprocessor programming: C, C++, Arduino IDE</li>
<li>Artificial intelligence: Tensorflow, Python, OpenCV</li>
<li>Programming for the interfaces: HTML, CSS, Javascript</li>
<li>Simulation: The robot should simulate it’s movements before it does in the real world.</li>
<li>CAD Design: Designing the parts, converting them to 3D printable STL files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hardware
<ul>
<li>Electrics: Batteries, voltage converting, cabling.</li>
<li>Electronics: Motor drivers, servos, raspberry pi, Arduino, all sorts of sensors, and IMU knowledge.</li>
<li>Edge products: ASICs like google coral.</li>
<li>Mechanics: Moving parts, legs, arms.</li>
<li>Production: 3D printing, experience on several tools to put things together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Building a team with the expertise of all the disciplines would cost a small fortune. That is why the only way to create a robot is to start an opensource project. Also, even though there will be a massive demand for robotics, they will be very customized requests which can not be handled by a single type robot. Since companies do narrow their product areas, it still won’t be viable for them to mass-produce a particular type of robot.</p>
<p>So, how to start it, and what should the end product look like?</p>
<h2 id="the-modular-framework---core-and-modules">The modular framework - Core and modules</h2>
<p>First of all, the project must start with a small team focusing on building a “framework” and a “platform.” The framework should offer a simple, functionally expandible box containing main functionalities that every robot needs, such as enough processing power, a battery, an AI edge product for object recognition, a camera, a motor driver, proximity, temperature, IMU, pressure sensors, etc. The box should have proper ports to connect various devices/modules such as motors to turn wheels, servos to actuate the arms and the legs. The extensibility of functionality is essential. Every project will have different requirements, and a simple box can not provide every single function. One project may need legs to make the robot walk, whereas another one will need propellers to fly.</p>
<p><img src="https://bekirdag.com/img/problem_solving.png" alt="modular framework"></p>
<p>The modules must be easily implemented and discharged with ease as well. There will be enormous benefits of this structure for building various projects.</p>
<p>Secondly, once a module is completed (like a robotic arm), developers should share their work and contribute to the community so everyone can benefit from the collective work.</p>

<p>A platform is necessary for the builders to download other modules and also contribute their modules. Like any other open-source platform, there will be certain QAs to complete while a module application keeps the community safe and tidy.</p>
<p><img src="https://bekirdag.com/img/brainstorming_.png" alt="modular framework"></p>
<h2 id="extending-the-functionality---a-simple-dashboard">Extending the functionality - A simple dashboard</h2>
<p><img src="https://bekirdag.com/img/user_interface_monochromatic.png" alt="modular framework"></p>
<p>The modules should be easily downloadable via the robot dashboard, and the system automatically installs necessary software when a library is chosen. A good example would be to add wheels to the core. Once the hardware is installed, the end-user should simply visit the robot dashboard via their phones/computers and install the necessary libraries without having to deal with the software from a simple UI. Having an interface will extensively help developers focus on their tasks rather than spend hours, even days completing simple tasks.</p>

<p>The cost of a simple robot will be around 300 - 1000 USD, depending on its extensions. After it becomes affordable, people will consider building their robots for tasks that can be automated. Imagine a farmer trying to catalog the insect species in their farm, a simple robot with object recognition capabilities can be implemented on the land, programmed simply to visit a “square” in every t minutes, stand by to take pictures for a given n minutes, activate the camera when there is movement in front of it, take photos of the action, search for an insect in it, recognize it with it’s trained library, catalog it and move to the next square. Even though this will be a simple task for a robotics expert to handle, it will still be too complicated for a non-developer who is unfamiliar with the framework. That is why people will choose to hire experts instead of trying to build one by themselves. Hiring people for specific tasks will be the beginning of the robotics agencies. Just like hiring someone to build their websites, they will do the same for the robotics.</p>
<p><img src="https://bekirdag.com/img/artificial_intelligence.png" alt="modular framework"></p>
<p>I highly recommend all the young developers to start learning about robotics. They will witness people will be asking for simple task robots from the freelancers, and those freelancers will start their own business to catch up with the demand. I believe those companies will be the biggest ones in the future.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned-from-the-history-of-web-development">Lessons learned from the history of web development</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the century, the web development business was booming. Developers have started to learn about this highly profitable new business and taught themselves since there were not many resources around, nor institutions to help them. This caused developers to code every single site from scratch each time. After a while, they have started to build their frameworks. In the year 2003, nearly all developers have had their frameworks. It was horrifying. Once the developer lost interest or stopped working on the project, the new developer had to understand this (most of the time hideous) framework first and then comply with the requests of the client after. This mechanism’s efficiency was horrible and, most of the time, catastrophic because the same websites were coded repeatedly without any good reason.</p>
<p><img src="https://bekirdag.com/img/web_development_ecosystem.jpg" alt="web development framework evolution"></p>
<p>Luckily people gathered around particular frameworks and started to share their works with others. Being familiar with the framework saved considerable time and made it possible for developers to focus on the actual job rather than wasting time to build simple tasks like user log in, sessions, permissions, roles and other basic functionalities.</p>
<p>I believe the robotics business will revolve around the same idea, and specific frameworks will rise.</p>
<h2 id="mass-production-vs-customized-products">Mass production vs. customized products</h2>
<p>Even though the core boxes and certain modules can be mass-produced, since each request will be unique (just like a website), it won’t make sense to mass produce the parts. It will also be a speedy evolution on the parts. Mass-produced parts will not be compatible with the new parts, so building a billion plastic parts will not be viable since they will be obsolete in a couple of moths. This is where 3D printers get up on stage. There will be a custom solution for every custom need that can only be manufactured by a 3D printer.</p>
<p><img src="https://bekirdag.com/img/3d_model.png" alt="web development framework evolution"></p>
<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
<p><img src="https://bekirdag.com/img/school.png" alt="web development framework evolution"></p>
<p>Having an extendable structure will make it very easy for students to learn about the basics of robotics. I imagine every stem lab will have a few cores with several modules; students will be able to test by themselves and achieve certain functionality quickly.</p>
<p>For the undergrad and grad students, it will be another story. They will use the core to focus on their assignment so they won’t lose time to build basic functionalities. For example, a CS student will not have to deal with the hardware and focus only on their AI training application.</p>
<h2 id="possible-use-cases-and-examples">Possible use cases and examples</h2>
<ul>
<li>Surveying</li>
<li>Search and rescue</li>
<li>Farming: Instead of using pesticides, small robots can search and destroy unwanted plants on the land.</li>
<li>Forestation: A swarm of robots will handle this automated job much better than any human.</li>
<li>Environmental management: A swarm of robots around the world would be programmed to help cleaning the oceans, forests, and cities.</li>
<li>Security: Both for households and commercial usages, this will be a powerful way of monitoring specific areas. Imagine leaving a security robot at your home when you are on holiday, and it can monitor your whole house and notify you when there is movement.</li>
<li>Companionship</li>
<li>Industrial: The amount of jobs waiting to be automated is highly significant, simple small robots can be handy for repeating tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-to-begin-with">Where to begin with?</h2>
<p>I have been working on a modular opensource project for around four years now. I have finished most of the work and will start a crowdfunding project very soon. The hardware is almost finished. We are also working on the platform and the dashboard at the same time. Stay tuned.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It will be a fascinating ten years to watch it happen and be a part of it. Getting involved in robotics is essential. Coding will not be as valuable as it is today since coding is becoming a part of everyday life. If you have just started your career as a tech person, I would recommend getting involved in the robotics and even encouraging you to start your own business in the field. It will take some time for both you and the sector to evolve, but eventually, it will be gratifying.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Just because your state or city allows you to bring staff back to the office doesn’t mean that the facilities are ready for them to work safely. Here’s what you need to consider before employees return – assuming you can convince them to do so. Don’t count on that.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a now-common tale: The developers and the rest of the company staff have been working at home since March. For the most part, things have gone well enough. After <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/software-qa-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/">some initial glitches</a>, the team is productive, reasonably happy (given the additional stress), and their goals are met.</p>
<p>However, the day is coming when you no longer have to keep everyone out of the office. You can bring them back. Or can you?</p>
<h3>Decorating the petri dish</h3>
<p>Before you bring staff back to a shared space, you have to comply with a new bunch of rules about office work to meet post-covid-19 guidelines. While the specific details may differ where you are, all of the new workplace rules include social distancing requirements. Almost certainly, your pre-covid-19 workplace doesn’t allow for six feet of space between workers.</p>
<p>The changes aren’t trivial. You need <a href="https://theconversation.com/goodbye-to-the-crowded-office-how-coronavirus-will-change-the-way-we-work-together-137382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">physical reconfiguration of work areas</a>. Desks need to be farther apart, possibly with barriers between work stations. (So much for <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/sgc-research-when-moving-to-an-open-office-plan-pay-attention-to-how-your-employees-feel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the alleged benefits of collaboration</a> in an open office.) Because you probably don’t have space to move everyone apart, you need to decide whether you need everyone in the office at the same time – which means cultural impacts that are as important to think about as building airflow.</p>
<p>Let’s assume for the moment that you <em>do</em> want to bring people back into the corporate headquarters – or that you need to, for reasons of security. Here are the adjustments to make now, before people return to their commutes.</p>
<h3>Beyond office space</h3>
<p>According to Marina Vaamonde, CEO of real estate investment firm <a href="https://propertycashin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PropertyCashin.com</a>, companies have to arrange for more parking than they had pre-Covid. The reason, she explains, is that <a href="https://time.com/5869375/public-transit-coronavirus-covid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fewer workers are willing to share space on public transportation</a>. “People want to drive their own cars into work, so you need more parking,” she points out.</p>
<p>The office itself needs <a href="https://vicuspartners.com/articles/6-office-design-trends-post-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a significant redesign</a>. “You need to have airflow and outdoor space,” Vaamonde explains. “Now that all of the communal indoor spaces are closed or used for offices, people want to have an outdoor area where they can meet and breathe fresh air.”</p>
<p>In fact, says Giridhara Raam M, product evangelist at <a href="https://www.zohocorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoho Corporation</a>, protecting employees requires a complete rethinking of the office itself. “Considering most of the work spaces operate with a centralized air conditioning system, it is better to avoid it. Work spaces need to be redefined; cubicle systems and socially distanced seating spots with free air flow should be adopted at least for a year. Open offices are even more satisfying than closed spaces, due to droplets.”</p>
<p>The physical configuration of the office has to change. “Cubicles are coming to an end,” Vaamonde says, because they don’t allow for social distancing.</p>
<p>But while barriers can be built around the cubicles, Vaamonde believes they won’t be necessary. The employees won’t be there to use them.</p>
<p>Expect big central offices, such as the ones in downtown Houston where Vaamonde works, to remain mostly empty. Employers may move to smaller offices in the suburbs, she predicts. “They will be more like coworking spaces where you have spaces for a day.” The newly-envisioned office will have more open space, providing larger areas where social distancing can be maintained.</p>
<p>All that assumes your employees are ready to come into the office, however. Don’t count on that.</p>
<h3>You might <em>want</em> employees to return to the office. Good luck with that plan</h3>
<p>Your staff has been <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-human-backup-establishing-the-teams-unlikely-successors/">working at home for nearly six months</a>. Many of those people are disinterested in coming back to an office for work. Others may feel that they only need to come into the physical plant occasionally, when they need access to services that are only available in the office, such as a specific test platform that can’t be reached via a cloud connection. And with so many cloud services nowadays, those are rare.</p>
<p>Sarah Riegelhuth, CEO and founder of <a href="https://www.growmyteam.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grow My Team</a>, which specializes in hiring and engaging remote professionals, thinks that the ultimate resolution is for workforces to be mostly remote. “This allows people to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/5/15/21258793/bay-area-exodus-silicon-valley-san-francisco-facebook-google-apple-twitter-housing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live where they want to be</a>,” she says. It also permits flexible schedules, and other practices that enable staff to be more productive. (One reason: less time lost in social interactions.)</p>
<h3>Still: Some jobs do require on-site participation</h3>
<p>Businesses were forced to accept telework due to the pandemic. But that doesn’t mean everyone in every company can work from home in the long term. Manufacturing jobs, field support, and many service jobs must be done where the work actually is. Employees who deal with intellectual property and personally identifiable information may need to schedule their work so they address sensitive data on their few days in the office.</p>
<p>And there are other factors. This includes choosing which job functions should return to work first.</p>
<p>“Only the data critical roles should return back to corporate premises first, due to security concerns,” says Raam. “Others can stay back and facilitate remote work.” The critical resources can work in shifts assuring there are limited people inside a defined area.</p>
<p>In many cases, the end result is likely to be a mix of in-office workers and people continuing to work from their couches.</p>
<p>Ready or not, you have to change operations to deal with employees who will work at home permanently. Your management, HR, and IT systems need to adjust to a higher percentage of full-time telecommuters, for whom working from home is a better option. It’s your job to find a way to make that work.</p>
<p>That has a significant impact on office IT systems. For example, redefined work spaces mean that workstation locations will change, which affects how office computers connect to the network even if everything is wireless.</p>
<p>Likewise, the business needs to bring communication and security requirements for remote workers up to corporate standards. This may mean providing dedicated lines for employees who don’t have home internet service. Or the company may need to pay for a level of service beyond what the employee might otherwise need. Or a better chair.</p>
<p>Once you admit that the work-at-home phase isn’t temporary, the company may need to provide computers and software if employees are currently using personal computers or laptops. One reason is physical security. When employees use their own computers for work, it’s hard to prevent them from using the same devices for everything from their family’s homework to grocery shopping. The business computer needs client security and communications security products, such as corporate-grade VPNs, firewalls, or network security equipment.</p>
<h3>Split culture</h3>
<p>Finally, there’s the question about how corporate culture affects workers when they’re at home. Office politics will change, if only because it’s hard to get people involved in back-stabbing when their backs are back at home. “The reality is that there’s still a culture,” Riegelhuth says. “In my experience, the culture evolves.”</p>
<p>In many cases, some parts of the corporate culture, notably office politics, are diminished, which helps productivity. In others, such as the informal back channels that help decision making, the impact on the culture may be problematic. But Riegelhuth notes that there are ways to keep back channels and brain storming alive.</p>
<p>“We have a vision, we have a purpose and we have our values. We have a weekly team meeting where everybody comes on to Zoom,” Riegelhuth says. “We get an hour of face time every week.”</p>
<p>“One of the advantages that we’ve seen is looking at our health and wellbeing,” Riegelhuth adds. “Taking sick days used to be frowned on. It used to be a badge of honor not to take sick days.” Now, she says, the company culture has changed to make health and wellbeing important parts of her company’s culture.</p>
<p>There’s a general agreement among both managers and experts that remote working is here to stay. While some employees will always need to be in the building, most won’t. And in many cases, the company will organize itself so that it functions solely online. Some employees need to come to the office occasionally, some on a regular basis and a few most of the time.</p>
<p>But for office workers, the daily 9 – 5 in the building is a thing of the past. It may take some organizations a while to figure that out, but home will be where the heart, and the job, is.</p>
<blockquote><p>While you’re making changes, contemplate the who-does-what questions. For example, have you considered creating a Chief Quality Officer? <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/why-your-enterprise-needs-a-cqo-chief-quality-officer/">Our white paper</a> goes into the details.</p></blockquote>

Welcome to the first article of an exciting new series called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://hashnode.com/series/lets-build-a-nodejs-rest-api-ckcov1aob00dcfms19o5g2x42">Let's Build a Node.js REST API</a>. In this series, I will be going through a step-by-step tutorial on how you can plan, design and build your very own REST API using Node.js!</p>
<h3 id="before-we-start-">Before we start...</h3>
<p>Some prerequisites you need to follow along:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginner to intermediate knowledge in JavaScript</li>
<li>Basic understanding of what REST APIs are</li>
<li>Basic understanding of back-end programming and Node.js</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="heads-up-some-tools-we-will-use-">Heads up! Some tools we will use:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Code or any text editor</li>
<li>POSTman</li>
<li>Node.js and express</li>
<li>MongoDB Atlas</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, you<strong> just need to have a text editor installed</strong> in your computer. I'll explain how to install the rest in this series.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-planning-our-t-api">Step 1: Planning our T-API</h2>
<p>For this tutorial, we will be making a simple API for tea (so random I know). I call it <strong>T-API</strong> because it sounds like "Tea API".</p>
<p>To plan an API, we must first understand what we want it to do. We can write down <strong>user stories</strong> to help us determine what we need in our API design.</p>
<h3 id="our-t-api-user-stories">Our T-API User Stories</h3>
<ol>
<li>I can create a new tea object and add it to the database</li>
<li>I can get all the tea from the database</li>
<li>I can delete all the tea in the database</li>
<li>I can get a single tea by querying its name</li>
<li>I can post a comment to a single tea</li>
<li>I can delete a single tea from the database</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="our-tea-object">Our Tea Object</h3>
<p>Based on our user stories and how we want to use the API, we can draft a sample tea object that the API can return. This helps us to decide what properties to include in the object early in the stage of making this API. So, for T-API, a tea object might look like:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "<span>name</span>": <span>"Jasmine Tea"</span>,
    "<span>image</span>": <span>"an image file url"</span>,
    "<span>description</span>": <span>"Jasmine tea (茉莉花茶) is tea scented with the aroma of jasmine blossoms."</span>,
    "<span>keywords</span>": <span>"aromatic, china, sweet"</span>,
    "<span>origin</span>":<span>"China"</span>,
    "<span>brew time</span>": <span>2</span>,
    "<span>temperature</span>": <span>80</span>,
    "<span>comments</span>": []
}
</code></pre><h2 id="step-2-designing-structure-for-t-api">Step 2: Designing Structure for T-API</h2>
<p>The way to design an API is to visualize its <strong>routes</strong> and <strong>request methods</strong>.</p>
<p>Now that we have understood what we want T-API to do for us, we can come up with a design like so:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Routes</td><td>HTTP Methods</td><td>Description</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>/tea</td><td>GET</td><td>Displays all tea</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea</td><td>POST</td><td>Creates a new tea</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea</td><td>DELETE</td><td>Deletes all tea</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea/:name</td><td>GET</td><td>Displays a specific tea, given its name</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea/:name</td><td>POST</td><td>Adds a comment to a specific tea, given its name</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>/tea/:name</td><td>DELETE</td><td>Deletes a specific tea, given its name</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Okay, we have planned and designed our T-API, let's get started with setting up the project!</p>
<h2 id="step-3-install-node-js-and-npm">Step 3: Install Node.js and npm</h2>
<p>Download Node.js (with npm) at: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">nodejs.org/en/download</a></p>
<p>After it is installed, to check if it is there, go to your command prompt:</p>
<pre><code>node -v
<span>npm</span> -v
</code></pre><h2 id="step-4-initialize-project">Step 4: Initialize project</h2>
<p>Create a new project file and in the root directory, initialize npm by running the following code in the command line:</p>
<pre><code>npm <span>init</span>
</code></pre><p>Answer the questions that follow and a <code>package.json</code> file will be created.</p>
<h2 id="step-5-install-express">Step 5: Install express</h2>
<p>Let's install <strong>express</strong> and save it to our <code>package.json</code> by running:</p>
<pre><code>npm <span>install</span> 
</code></pre><h2 id="step-6-create-server">Step 6: Create server</h2>
<p>Now, we create a <code>server.js</code> file in our project's root directory to take care of the back-end. First, we have to create an Express app with:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> express = <span>require</span>(<span>"express"</span>);
<span>const</span> app = express();
</code></pre><p>Now we can add the code after:</p>
<pre><code>app.<span>use</span>(express.json()); 
</code></pre><p>Then, below it, our listener to ask our server to listen for a request. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> listener = app.listen(process.env.PORT || <span>3000</span>, <span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> {
    <span>console</span>.log(<span>'App is listening on port '</span> + listener.address().port)
})
</code></pre><p>By default, we want to listen on port 3000. However, in cases where the port number is designated from an environment variable, the app will listen on <code>process.env.PORT</code>.</p>
<h2 id="try-a-test-run-">Try a test run!</h2>
<p>So now that we have our server.js set up, let's try running the server by entering </p>
<pre><code><span>node</span> <span>server</span><span>.js</span>
</code></pre><p>into the command line. If it works, you should see the console outputs a message telling you which port it is listening to.</p>

<h3 id="before-we-wrap-up-i-have-a-question-">Before we wrap up, I have a question...</h3>
<p>In order to make this series as beginner-friendly as possible, I added a "Glossary" right below a potentially unfamiliar word to explain it (i.e. express, middleware, etc). Do you like this structure or do you prefer all Glossary terms to be at the end of an article? Please let me know in the comments. Thanks!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edit: A kind reader told me to put all the glossary at the end, so please find it at the end of this article.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="that-s-all-for-now-">That's all for now!</h2>
<p>Thanks for reading the first article of the series. Technically, I can write about building a REST API into 1 article but it will be too long and I will have to leave out a lot of important details which may confuse code newbies. </p>
<p>I hope this has been a helpful read for you. Be sure to <strong>like, share this article and stay tuned</strong> for the next part where we will start creating our routes and setting up our database in Mongo Atlas! In the meantime, please <strong>ask any questions</strong> in the comments below and read up on the frameworks/concepts/technologies in this article to accelerate your learning. Till next time, cheers!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="glossary">Glossary</h2>
<p>Here are some potentially unfamiliar words I have used in this article. Feel free to read slowly and read the suggested articles for further details.</p>
<h3 id="user-stories">user stories</h3>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story">Wikipedia</a>, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system.</p>
<h3 id="routes">routes</h3>
<p>Routes are represented as URIs in REST APIs. For example, the index route for an API is '/'. Other routes will be built on it such as '/names' for a route that returns all names or '/pages' for one that returns all pages. 
Read up on basic routing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="request-methods">request methods</h3>
<p>Request methods refer to the HTTP methods which specifies the desired action the browser wants to do with the server. Read my article on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lo-victoria.com/the-basics-of-http-request-methods-ckb1noib903iel6s1582lccg9">Basics of HTTP Requests</a> for more details. </p>
<h3 id="express">express</h3>
<p>Express is web framework for Node.js to allow easy and robust routing for back-end development. It will be used to create our routes and handle our HTTP requests and any <strong>middleware</strong> for our API. You can read more in its documentation <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://expressjs.com/">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="middleware">middleware</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1594942772687/f1tkx-LGQ.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="middleware.png"></p>
<p>A middleware essentially refers to the software that sits between the client-side requests and the server-side resource. It handles data, provide API management, messaging services as well as authentication. For more information, read up <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware">here</a>.</p>

              <article>

<p>Have you ever wondered why an increasing number of programs are configured by placing small files in <code>.d</code> directories instead of by just editing a single file?</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered why these <code>.d</code> directories seem to proliferate in <del>Unix</del>Linux installations? Because a pretty bare-bones Debian installation (WSL) shows… a ton of them:</p>

<p>… while a fresh installation of the more traditional NetBSD barely shows any:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">netbsd:/etc&gt; ls -ld *.d */*.d

netbsd:/etc&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>What’s up with that? The reason is simple:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Supporting configuration updates as part of first-class package management.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But why do <code>.d</code> directories help? Let’s first look at a couple of examples to understand how these directories work and then we’ll get into the why.</p>



<p>To understand how configuration directories work, let’s look at a particular example that exists across the two systems we are looking at. That is the mechanism to apply <code>sysctl</code> configuration changes.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with it, <code>sysctl</code> is a tool <em>and</em> an interface to tune kernel-level settings. On Linux, the <a href="https://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?sysctl+8"><code>sysctl(8)</code> tool</a> is a simple wrapper over the contents of <code>/proc/sys/</code>, but on NetBSD it’s a direct client to the kernel’s <a href="https://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?sysctl+3"><code>sysctl(3)</code> API</a>. For a sneak peek of what these kernel settings involve, type <code>sysctl -a</code> to get a list of all available knobs and their current values.</p>

<p>Because <code>sysctl</code> offers access to tuning kernel-level knobs for the whole system, it seems natural to have a mechanism to configure those at system boot time. After all, if you want to modify how e.g. the virtual memory subsystem works, you will want do that during the early stages of the system’s boot process.</p>

<p>Looking at a NetBSD system, here is what we have:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">netbsd:/etc&gt; ls -l sysctl*
-rw-r--r--  <span>1</span> root  wheel  <span>797</span> Oct <span>12</span>  <span>2018</span> sysctl.conf
netbsd:/etc&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>In this scenario, all kernel settings must be put in the single <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> text file, which is then trivially read at boot time by the <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/etc/rc.d/sysctl?rev=1.13&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&amp;only_with_tag=MAIN"><code>/etc/rc.d/sysctl</code> script</a>. Both human administrators and automated processes have to update this single file if they want to effect change on <code>sysctl</code> settings at boot time.</p>

<p>Let’s compare this to a what Debian system has:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">debian:/etc&gt; ls -l sysctl*
-rw-r--r-- <span>1</span> root root <span>2351</span> May <span>31</span>  <span>2018</span> sysctl.conf

sysctl.d:
total 4K
lrwxrwxrwx <span>1</span> root root  <span>14</span> Apr <span>27</span> <span>13</span>:02 <span>99</span>-sysctl.conf -&gt; ../sysctl.conf
-rw-r--r-- <span>1</span> root root <span>639</span> May <span>31</span>  <span>2018</span> README.sysctl
-rw-r--r-- <span>1</span> root root <span>324</span> May <span>31</span>  <span>2018</span> protect-links.conf
debian:/etc&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>We still have the traditional <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> file but we <em>also</em> have an <code>/etc/sysctl.d/</code> subdirectory. In this case, the <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-sysctl.service.html"><code>systemd-sysctl</code> boot service</a>—because it <em>had</em> to be systemd, of course—iterates over all files under <code>/etc/sysctl.d/</code> <em>in lexicographical order</em> and applies their settings.</p>

<p>Note that I did <em>not</em> mention <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> and that’s because <code>systemd-sysctl</code> couldn’t care less about it. That file location exists for the administrator’s convenience as the traditional place to perform manual edits. But the way <code>systemd-sysctl</code> finds this file is thanks to its <code>/etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf</code> symlink. The <code>99</code> prefix is important, as this causes the administrator-controlled file to sort after all others. In this way, its contents override any other settings that might have been put under the <code>sysctl.d</code> directory by automated tools.</p>

<p>But that’s not the only way configuration directories interact with their corresponding legacy file.</p>



<p>In our previous example, we saw that the <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> file on a Debian system exists purely for the convenience of the administrator. The system does not care about this file directly so its existence in this specific location might as well be removed.</p>

<p>The alternative is to go the complete opposite route: keep the configuration file as the primary location for the configuration, but then make this file explicitly include all contents of a subdirectory.</p>

<p>An obvious example of this behavior is the configuration for the dynamic linker: the <code>ldconfig</code> tool reads the <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> file to discover which directories contain dynamic libraries, but is otherwise unaware of the existence of the <code>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/</code> directory. So how is the latter read then? Easy:</p>

<pre><code>debian:/etc&gt; cat ld.so.conf
include /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf
debian:/etc&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As we can see, <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> continues to be the primary file, but it then includes all individual files from the configuration directory. This requires native support in the tool to allow file inclusions and also makes the semantics of glob expansion tool-specific (are they in lexicographic order?).</p>

<p>Note that, in this case, the administrator has the freedom to append custom configuration directly to <code>/etc/ld.so.conf</code> or to create a new <em>unmanaged</em> file under <code>/etc/ld.so.conf.d/</code> (say, <code>99-zzz.conf</code>).</p>



<p>Once you start looking, as we did in the first listing, you’ll notice that this pattern repeats everywhere: for any given configuration that <em>needs edits from multiple independent sources</em>, you will likely find a traditional configuration file accompanied by a configuration subdirectory.</p>

<p>So now that we have all necessary knowledge, we are ready to tackle the questions: What are configuration directories for? Why have these configuration directories proliferated? What benefit do they bring? And the answer to them all is the same: <strong>they make automated edits straightforward</strong>, which is important when you want a package manager to perform and <em>own</em> such edits.</p>

<p>You see: if you have a plain text file and you want to edit it programmatically, you have two options. You can have a parser that understands the format of the file and is able to modify it, but then preserving comments and formatting (both of which are important for configuration!) is difficult. Or you can add comment-like markers to the file and perform unstructured edits, but then those edits break if the user happens to modify the file in an unexpected manner.</p>

<p>Contrariwise, if you have a directory where you can put individual files in, and the whole configuration is determined to be the logical concatenation of all these files, all of a sudden automated edits become trivial. A package wanting to add new settings to the system will only need to add a new file in that directory, and the package manager will be able to track the provenance of that file. And if you uninstall the package, the package manager will be able to remove its configuration without issues (possibly leaving behind the files if they were manually modified).</p>



<p>So, are configuration directories better than files?</p>

<p>Well… they are <em>different</em>. With directories, we trade the ability to read and modify a single plain text file <em>by hand</em> with a scheme that is maybe-trickier to hand-tune but that is amenable to …</p></article></div></div></div>

<blockquote>
<p>The group was noisy, and nobody was listening. Someone looked into their phone, others split into groups and discussed the latest events happening in the world.</p>
<p>— Who can tell me what do I have here?—she finally asked, as though holding a pinch of salt, but with her fingers looking upward.</p>
<p>— A hair?—said someone.</p>
<p>— Air—said someone else.</p>
<p>— Fingers?—answered the third person.</p>
<p>— I have your attention—said she.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are used to money as a medium of exchange because that is what we do most frequently—buy and sell goods and services. But we do not purchase stuff randomly (although sometimes it might look like that). We buy what we either need or <em>think</em> we need. Hence, in some instances, buying is nothing but a secondary action after we become aware of something. Therefore, if someone has our <strong>attention,</strong> they have our money.</p>
<p>It is no wonder that the global advertising market size is US$ 532.5 Billion, and it is expected to grow by 44% in the next four years.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Companies are paying big money to get your attention and use a broad range of mediums: billboards, TV and radio ads, internet ads, magazine ads, in-mail flyers, etc.</p>
<p>But it is not only companies who fight for your attention. Literally, every person whose outcomes/results/wealth depend on you acting in a specific way (politicians, activists, singers, writers, media portals, etc.) all fight for your attention.</p>
<p>And the situation is aggravated by the fact that our attention is very narrow, with very limited throughput. As described in <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/how-people-learn-human-senses/">How People Learn — Human Senses</a>, our conscious attention throughput varies between different senses, ranging from 1 to 40 bit/sec. Comparing with the unconscious attention throughput of 10,000,000 bit/sec for vision, 40 is infinitesimally small.</p>
<p>Each day we have 86400 seconds—time in which we can exchange our attention for anything. But there are some operational costs to run the brain and body: we need to eat, exercise, sleep, etc. If to take out ~10 hours (a wild guess, for the sake of argument), we are left with 50000 seconds. It may sound like a lot, but how many times did you wonder why the day ended so fast?</p>
<p>That’s why it is essential to be aware of what we spend our attention on. It is the ultimate medium of exchange—you give your attention to other people in return for something you find valuable (or, to be honest, sometimes on trash as well, but that is another story). For anything, even for free stuff, you always pay a price with your attention.</p>
<p>And once someone has your attention, they will fight for your money, time, effort, and other things you have.</p>
<p>Stay aware!</p>

    <h3>Impersonating web browsers with fake error pages</h3>
    <p>December 22, 2019</p>
    <p>If you’ve read my last post on <a href="https://zainamro.com/hacks/analytics-injection-phishing/">client-side injection</a> via an analytics javascript snippet, you probably already know that lately I’ve been thinking about simple methods of deception via unique and unexpected framing. After all, social engineering and other forms of deception usually begin by carefully staging a convincing scene. The perfect scene leaves the potential victim with very little doubt about its authenticity (or at least curious). It’s for this reason that attackers are constantly trying to come up with unique ideas for email phishing. If an attacker can impersonate a credible entity when the person least expects it, they can profit greatly.</p>

    <p>About 9 months ago, I came up with an idea — impersonating a web browser by posing as a fake “native” browser error page (<a href="https://zainamro.com/fake-browser-errors/1/">see example</a>). I created a simple prototype that looks at your user agent and displays the right error page for your browser. For demonstration purposes, only the top 3 desktop browsers are supported: Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. While the idea is quite simple in practice, I believe it has some interesting qualities, namely that there is no obvious way to distinguish it from a real browser error page. With phishing emails, for example, there are often rudimentary methods which can expose an attacker like looking closely at the email address, domain, or language of the email itself. With a fake browser error page, there is nothing that is visibly obvious — the url address bar and the contents of the page are as you’d expect.</p>

    <p>Once you’ve established an anchor of authenticity via a browser error, you’ve now opened up the door to more interesting possibilities. One idea would be to show a popup upon leaving the page and ask for the person’s information as a means of browser error reporting in the same way that operating systems sometimes ask you to report an unexpected crash (<a href="https://zainamro.com/fake-browser-errors/2/">see example</a>). Using a prompt with the native browser GUI, this could potentially trick less sophisticated users. An even scarier and less obvious strategy would be to subtly notify the person that their browser is outdated and prompt them to download a newer version, thereby tricking them to install your malware (<a href="https://zainamro.com/fake-browser-errors/3/">see example</a>). Because browsers don’t show any indication of error in their native GUI when a website error occurs, this gives fake browser error pages the ability to speak on the behalf of the browser to some extent. I believe with the right audience, these types of attacks can be frighteningly effective.</p>

				<p>When we interviewed <a href="https://iamchuka.com/">Chuka Ofili</a> — Google Developer Expert, Certified Cloud Architect, and Full Stack Gigster Engineer — for The Ops Show recently, I was more than impressed. It wasn’t just his incredible video call setup (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdPOI09polo">see it here</a>) and animated, positive outlook on life, but the way he designed his DevOps workflows into their purest forms.</p><p>Chuka takes steps to make sure his developer workflows were simple yet robust, powerful yet cloud-centric, and easily automated. “If I do something one, two, or three times, I will automate,” Chuka explained on <a href="https://w.cto.ai/theopsshow">The Ops Show</a>.</p><p>He found the right <a href="https://cto.ai/blog/build-a-culture-of-delivery-with-lean-devops/">Lean DevOps</a> tools and tricks to do just that out of the broad landscape of possibilities. And it is big. The Cloud Native Foundation tracks around <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">1,425 technologies alone</a> and the microservices landscape is even larger.</p><p>So, in order to bring some simplicity and clarity to the DevOps world, here are a few of Chuka’s DevOps workflow hacks ranging from Slack to Kubernetes to GitOps to open source cloud configurations.</p><h3 id="first-let-s-start-with-his-remote-work-collaboration-stack-">First, let’s start with his remote work collaboration stack:</h3><ol><li><a href="https://slack.com/"><strong>Slack</strong></a> — for communication and collaboration.</li><li><a href="https://meet.google.com/"><strong>Google Meet</strong></a> — for video calls and screen sharing.</li><li><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira"><strong>Jira by Atlassian</strong></a> — for engineering project management tracking and reporting. <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/features/automation">Jira automations</a> are also clutch.</li></ol><h3 id="next-let-s-jump-into-his-devops-workflows-stack-and-his-fully-cloud-integrated-pipeline-">Next, let’s jump into his DevOps workflows stack and his fully cloud-integrated pipeline:</h3><ol><li><a href="https://skaffold.dev/"><strong>Skaffold</strong></a> — helps developers do everything locally even if your laptop doesn’t have the processing power. “Skaffold is powerful.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine the worst cafe rush-hour line you’ve ever had to wade through to get your latte. Now, instead of coffee, imagine that at the end of this hellish line was the data you needed about your products, pipeline, or customer behavior. Each time you need your data fix, you have to get up from your desk, walk down the hall, out of your house or office, and then wait in a queue behind hundreds of other people.</p><p>At the end of that line, instead of baristas, sit your data analysts, handing out the data that each individual person asks for. If anyone ends up needing more context, they have to get back in line and wait all over again.</p><p>If this sounds like a nightmare, that’s because it is. But it reflects a real constraint for many companies who haven’t democratized their data.</p><p>The future isn’t a data dictatorship—it’s self-service data democracy. One where, instead of waiting in line at a cafe for coffee, you can walk up to your own kitted-out setup in your office and get exactly what you need yourself.</p><p>Amplitude is the perfect example of this data-like-home-cafe approach to modern business. So I sat down with Justin Bauer, Amplitude executive vice president of product, to get some insight into how the company created a self-service data democracy that bridges the art and science of product development.</p><p><em>“Just like anything, [building a self-service data democracy is about] people, processes, and tools—in that order.” — Amplitude Executive Vice President of Product Justin Bauer</em></p><p>Sounds simple enough. But, below, we’ll take a closer look at what went into building the self-service data democracy that underpins one of the best data products around.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>1. Amplitude’s culture is built around a North Star.</strong></h2><p>A<a href="https://amplitude.com/blog/2018/03/21/product-north-star-metric"> North Star metric</a> is a single bar that everyone on every team at your company can use to measure whether or not your product is living up to the hype. It's the main support pillar that holds up your self-service data democracy.</p><p>The idea isn’t new, but it’s one that Amplitude has taken to heart and made their own.</p><p>For Bauer and the Amplitude team, their North Star is<a href="https://amplitude.com/blog/2018/03/21/product-north-star-metric"> weekly learning users</a> (WLUs). A WLU is an active Amplitude user who shares a resource they created with at least two other people within a week. Basically, it measures both initial user engagement, and whether or not users find the product worth sharing.</p><p>“It really ended up being the perfect metric for us to really reflect on what we were working on,” Bauer said.</p><p>But setting their sights on this guiding light wasn’t enough to align with it. Amplitude needed to create a culture and a system of habits that chased WLUs at every level of the company. To do this, Bauer and his team did three things:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Put into words the most basic promise of their product</strong> to understand what all other work should be in service to.</li><li><strong>Identified what <em>one </em>metric most signifies whether or not their product is useful to users.</strong> The performance of this metric was a binary tell of whether or not they’re following through on their promise to customers.</li><li><strong>Created a constellation of metrics that surrounded their North Star</strong> to build out the net of a self-service data democracy and give each team a way to make progress toward their North Star.</li></ol><p>Anyone who has heard of Amplitude knows that their main promise is to make it easier to build good products through data and collaboration. This mission clearly pointed in the direction of the company’s North Star, but the Amplitude team needed to come up with a constellation of metrics that would align work at every level with this guiding goal.</p><p>These supporting metrics were in direct service to boosting WLUs and gave each contributor a way to measure their performance and impact, without the need for data analysts or engineers. No more waiting in a long line to find out how products and features were performing.</p><p>“We really think of it not just as necessarily a single metric but also a constellation of metrics that all help guide you towards your product strategy,” Bauer said.</p><p>By filling their proverbial skies with metrics that all supported the one common goal of driving up WLUs—and, therefore, improving how worthwhile users found the platform—they built a culture that was wholly aligned with their main promise.</p><p>As a result, each team’s daily work furthers their progress toward their North Star metric and fits the transparent data-driven product strategy that supports it.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>2. They make sure everyone understands the data.</strong></h2><p>It’s all well and good if your employees have access to the data they—and others—produce, but they can’t make strong business decisions if they don’t understand what that data means. Without informed citizens, your self-service data democracy will shrivel up.</p><p>Back before the days of companies like Amplitude, the only people who understood data were the ones who created it, mainly the aforementioned engineers and data analysts. This created our nightmarish cafe scenario from the beginning.</p><p>Thankfully, Bauer and his team, like many industry leaders, took the secondhand gold of why data dictatorships suck and did the opposite. They intentionally and consistently educated their teams to ensure that they knew where to go for data, how to read its insights, and how to integrate those insights into practice.</p><p>The way that Amplitude began to foster this understanding is the same process for how they maintain the knowledge today:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Give each team and contributor a micro metric</strong> <strong>to focus on</strong> that lines up with daily work and supports the overall North Star metric.</li><li><strong>Educate team members on the tools</strong> available to them to pull and read data insights.</li><li><strong>Encourage team members to look closely at data</strong> to answer everyday tasks and experiment with new ideas.</li><li><strong>Anchor all product decisions to data</strong>, and clearly communicate how the work of each team affects higher-level goals.</li></ul><p>By making sure everyone from sales to engineering understands the data they’re creating—and knows how to create high-quality data through data governance (as we’ll discuss below)—Bauer and the Amplitude team empowered their democratic citizens to make the best decisions possible.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>3. Amplitude empowers engineers to use data themselves.</strong></h2><p>The truth is, while engineers are an integral part of building a great product, they’re traditionally seen as the last part of the implementation waterfall. This cuts off at the knees the decision-making power and insights of developers, and it’s time that changed.</p><p>In a self-service data democracy, Bauer said, engineers need to be empowered to use data themselves. Doing so lets them see the direct impact of their work and helps them make better cases for features they think would make the product stronger.</p><p>“Engineers can actually even use metrics to try to fight for the areas they want to invest behind,” Bauer said. “It's a great way to actually democratize who's even making product decisions.”</p><p>So, to make both engineers better and the product stronger, Amplitude handed engineers the key to their data democracy. This not only made their engineers happier but also helped them be more engaged in the work they were doing, Bauer said.</p><p><em>“Now they are highly incentivized to actually do the instrumentation because they want to see if the work they're doing is actually helping improve those metrics and helping the business grow.”</em></p><p>But this wasn’t simply a matter of granting engineers access to data tools. The process, like that of educating the company as a whole about data, had to be done intentionally through the following steps:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Bring engineers into the strategy and goal setting</strong> early on so everyone is on the same page.</li><li><strong>Educate engineers on how Amplitude measured success</strong> so they can measure their work in relation to the North Star metric.</li><li><strong>Develop a</strong><a href="https://www.avo.app/blog/our-definitive-guide-to-tracking-plans"><strong> well-thought-out tracking plan</strong></a> to ensure analytics implementation is done consistently from the beginning.</li><li><strong>Empower engineers to use data tools</strong> to see how their product decisions affect performance and experiment with new features.</li></ul><p>When Amplitude’s engineers were given a seat at the table and empowered to make the case for new features and improvements through data, the whole organization was able better fulfill its promise to customers.</p><p>‍</p><h2><strong>4. They focus on creating great governance.</strong></h2><p>Good governance is at the heart of all successful democracies and ensures that people have access to high-quality data and that processes are in place to continue this in the future.</p><p>“Leading companies are starting to realize that, in a world of data democracy, governance is important,” Bauer said. “If you invest behind that, then you get the dividends of self-service data democracy ... [But] it actually takes a lot of work to govern data well, to ensure that the people have the right levels of access and what they’re accessing is high quality.”</p><p>Rather than restrict contributors and only give them access to the data directly related to their jobs via analysts, Amplitude created a detailed governance strategy that ensured the free flow of consistent, correct information.</p><p>But this didn’t happen overnight. Good data takes hard work and<a href="https://www.avo.app/blog/data-governance-maturity-model-how-mature-is-your-approach-to-data"> mature governance</a>.</p><p><em>“You can’t just get democracy for free.”</em></p><p>Amplitude “paid” for good governance by investing in and enforcing data best practices, standardization documents, and tracking plans. These efforts helped them create a clean, single source of data truth that evolves with the company as time goes on.</p><p>“There’s a lot more focus on data quality, and people are starting to really treat it the same way you might treat something like code quality,” Bauer said. “You actually have to have even higher data quality to ensure that people make the right decisions.”</p><p>To create governance to guide every team within the company, while granting access to data at every level, Amplitude worked through the following steps:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Audited the current state of tracking and governance</strong> to understand what was already in place.</li><li><strong>Created a map of their customer life cycle and the metrics that support it</strong> to ensure that their customer life cycle complemented their North Star metric.</li><li><strong>Assigned a point person</strong>…</li></ul></div></div>

I'm talking about <strong>researching analogous problems in other fields</strong> that have already been solved (or have failed to be solved) by companies in those markets.</p><p>In my experience, these analogies are hugely beneficial for two primary purposes: storytelling and solution design.</p><h2>Storytelling</h2><p>Analogies should always take a back seat to a clear, compelling, empathy-inducing problem statement, but as a product manager pitching or explaining the problem you're solving, analogies can be powerful frames of reference for others. This can be true in a wide variety of situations such as:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Pitching your work to executives, investors, managers.</p></li><li><p>Getting buy-in from non-product groups who may be necessary to fully solve your problem statement or are impacted by the solution.</p></li><li><p>Building excitement in the product, engineering, design teams who will be working on this problem. </p></li></ul><h2>Solution Design</h2><p>Analogies have the potential to be either beneficial or detrimental to solution design. It’s important to make it clear to your product team that the analogy is not the solution but a jump-start for the solution design process. Without calling that out up front, analogies can stifle creativity and put the team in a copying mindset. When used correctly, analogies will provide the product team with a launching point for conversation and permission to think outside the box.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<div>
<p>Today I will argue why <em>silent rules</em> are a useful feature of good build systems.</p>

<hr>

<p>Build systems <em>build stuff</em>, mainly by invoking other tools, like compilers, linkers, code generators and file system manipulation tools. Build tools were traditionally printing some indication of progress. Make displays the commands as they are executed. CMake displays a quasi progress bar, including the name of the compiled file and a counter. </p>

<p>Interestingly, it seems the more <em>vertically</em> oriented, the <em>less</em> output shows up by default. If you need to hand-craft a solution out of parts, like with make, debugging the parts is important to the program you are building. Compare the verbosity of a autotools build system with a <code>go build ./...</code> invocation, that can build many thousands of programs and libraries. The former prints walls of text, the latter prints, nothing, unless there's an error.</p>

<p>As an extreme case, this is taken from the build log of Firefox 79. This is the command used to compile a single file. Note that the command is not really verbatim, as the <code>&lt;&lt;PKGBUILDDIR&gt;&gt;</code> parts hide long directory names used internally in the real log (this part is coming from the Debian build system). Also note that despite the length, this is a single line.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>/usr/bin/gcc -std=gnu99 -o mpi.o -c  -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector-strong -DNDEBUG=1 -DTRIMMED=1 -DNSS_PKCS11_2_0_COMPAT -DMOZ_HAS_MOZGLUE -DMOZILLA_INTERNAL_API -DIMPL_LIBXUL -DSTATIC_EXPORTABLE_JS_API -I/&lt;&lt;PKGBUILDDIR&gt;&gt;/third_party/prio -I/&lt;&lt;PKGBUILDDIR&gt;&gt;/build-browser/third_party/prio -I/&lt;&lt;PKGBUILDDIR&gt;&gt;/security/nss/lib/freebl/mpi -I/&lt;&lt;PKGBUILDDIR&gt;&gt;/third_party/msgpack/include -I/&lt;&lt;PKGBUILDDIR&gt;&gt;/third_party/prio/include -I/&lt;&lt;PKGBUILDDIR&gt;&gt;/build-browser/dist/include -I/usr/include/nspr -I/usr/include/nss -I/usr/include/nspr -I/&lt;&lt;PKGBUILDDIR&gt;&gt;/build-browser/dist/include/nss -fPIC -include /&lt;&lt;PKGBUILDDIR&gt;&gt;/build-browser/mozilla-config.h -DMOZILLA_CLIENT -Wdate-time -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -O2 -fdebug-prefix-map=/&lt;&lt;PKGBUILDDIR&gt;&gt;=. -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security -fno-strict-aliasing -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -fno-math-errno -pthread -pipe -g -freorder-blocks -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -funwind-tables -Wall -Wempty-body -Wignored-qualifiers -Wpointer-arith -Wsign-compare -Wtype-limits -Wunreachable-code -Wduplicated-cond -Wno-error=maybe-uninitialized -Wno-error=deprecated-declarations -Wno-error=array-bounds -Wno-error=coverage-mismatch -Wno-error=free-nonheap-object -Wno-multistatement-macros -Wno-error=class-memaccess -Wno-error=deprecated-copy -Wformat -Wformat-overflow=2  -MD -MP -MF .deps/mpi.o.pp   /&lt;&lt;PKGBUILDDIR&gt;&gt;/security/nss/lib/freebl/mpi/mpi.c</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This particular build log is 299738 lines long. That's about 40MB of text output, for a <em>single build</em>.</p>

<p>Obvously, not all builds are alike. There is value in an overly verbose log, like this one, because when something fails the log may be all you get. It is useful to be able to repeat the exact steps taken to see the failure in order to fix it.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum you can look at incremental builds, performed locally while editing the source. There some things are notable:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The initial build is much like the one quoted above, except that the log file will not be looked at by hand. An IDE may parse it to pick up warnings or errors. Many developers don't use IDEs and just run the build and ignore the wall of text it produces, as long as it doesn't fail entirely.</p></li>
<li><p>As code is changed, the build system will re-compile the parts that became invalidated by the changes. This can be as little as one .c file or as many as all the .c files, that include a common header that was changed. Interestingly computing the number of files that need changes may take a while and it may be faster to fire start compiling even before the whole set is known. Having a precise progress bar may be detrimental to the performance.</p></li>
<li><p>The output of the compiler may be more important than the invocation of the compiler. After all, it's very easy to invoke the build system again. Reading a page-long argument list to <code>gcc</code> is less relevant than the printed error or warning.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That last point is what I want to focus on. The whole idea is to <em>hide or simplify</em> some information, in order to present other kind of information <em>more prominently</em>. We <em>attenunate</em> the build command to <em>amplify</em> the compiler output.</p>

<p>Compare those two <code>make check</code> output logs from my toy library. I'm working on a few new manual pages and I have a rule which uses <code>man</code> to verify syntax. Note that I specifically used markup that wraps long lines, as this is also something you'd see in a terminal window.</p>

<p>This is what you get out of the box:</p>

<p>Advancement in computer vision technology can not only empower self-driving cars but also assist developers in building unbiased facial recognition solutions. However, the dearth of 3D images is impeding the development of computer vision technology. Today, most of the existing image data are in 2D, but 3D data are equally essential for researchers as well as developers to understand the real-world effectively. 3D images of varied objects can allow them to create superior computer vision solutions that can revolutionize the way we live. But, gathering 3D images is not as straightforward as collecting 2D images. It is near impossible to manually collect 3D images of every object in the world. Consequently, to mitigate one of the longest standing predicaments around 3D images, researchers from the University of Oxford proposed a novel approach of creating 3D images from 2D raw single-view images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The effectiveness of the approach was recognized by one of the largest computer vision conferences —&nbsp;<a href="http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</a>&nbsp;— as the&nbsp;<a href="http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/node/817#best-paper-award" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best paper</a>&nbsp;of the year award.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let us understand how researchers blazed a trail to accomplish this strenuous task of generating 3D images using single-view 2D images.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Creating 3D Images&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The researchers of the Visual Geometry Group, University of Oxford —&nbsp;Shangzhe&nbsp;Wu, Christian Rupprecht, and Andrea&nbsp;Vedaldi&nbsp;— introduced unsupervised learning of probably symmetric deformable 3D objects from images in the wild. The idea behind the technique is to create 3D images of symmetric objects from single-view 2D images without supervising the process. The method is based on an autoencoder — a machine learning technique to encode input images and then provide output by reconstructing it with decoders. In this work, an autoencoder factors each input image into depth, albedo, viewpoint, and illumination. While the depth is to identify the information related to the distance of surfaces of objects from a viewpoint, albedo is the reflectivity of a surface. Along with depth and albedo, viewpoint and illumination are crucial for creating 3D images as well; the variation in light and shadow is obtained from the illumination with the changing angle/viewpoint of the observer. All the aforementioned concepts play an important role in image processing to obtain 3D images. These factors will be used to generate 3D images by further processing and clubbing it back together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To create 3D images with depth, albedo, viewpoint, and illumination, the researchers leveraged the fact that numerous objects in the world have a symmetric structure. Therefore, the research was mostly limited to symmetric objects such as human faces, cat faces, and cars from single-view images.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Challenges&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Motivated to understand images more naturally for 3D image modelling, the researchers worked under two challenging conditions. Firstly, they ensured that no 2D or 3D ground truth information such as key points, segmentation, depth maps, or prior knowledge of a 3D model was utilized while training the model. Being unaware of every detail of images while generating 3D images is essential as this would eliminate the bottleneck of gathering image annotations for computer vision solutions. Secondly, the researchers had to create 3D images using only single-view images. In other words, it eliminates the need to collect multiple views of the same object. Considering these two problems was vital for the researchers because it would expedite working with fewer images while making computer vision-based applications.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Approach&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In this work, the internal decomposition of images into albedo, depth, viewpoint, and illumination was carried out without supervision. Following this, the researchers used symmetry as a geometric cue to construct 3D images with the generated four factors of input images. Although objects might never be completely symmetric, neither in shape nor appearance, the researchers compensated for their consideration later in their work. For instance, one cannot always take the left part of a face to construct the other half of the face considering symmetry, as hairstyle or expression of humans may vary. Similarly, albedo can be non-symmetric since the texture of a cat’s both sides of the face may differ. And to make the matter worse, even if both shape and albedo are symmetric, the appearance may still be different due to illumination. To mitigate these challenges, the researchers devised two approaches. They explicitly modelled illumination to recover the shape of the input objects’ images. In addition, they augmented the model to reason the absence of symmetry in objects while generating 3D images.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By combining the two methods, the researchers built an end-to-end learning formulation that delivered exceptional results compared to previous research that used an unsupervised approach for morphing 3D images. Besides, the researchers were able to outperform a recent state-of-the-art<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">method</a>&nbsp;that leveraged supervision for creating 3D images from 2D images.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Techniques Of Creating 3D Images from 2D Images</h3>



<p>The four factors — albedo, depth, viewpoint, and illumination — that are decomposed from the input images are supposed to regenerate the image on their combination. But, due to the asymmetric nature of objects, even for the faces of humans and cats, clubbing the albedo, depth, viewpoint, and illumination, might not be able to replicate the input image in 3D. To compensate<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for their earlier consideration of symmetricity of objects, even though objects were not really symmetric, the researchers devised two measures. According to researchers, asymmetries arise from shape deformation, asymmetric albedo, and illumination. Therefore, they explicitly&nbsp;modelled&nbsp;asymmetric illumination. They then ensured that the model estimates a confidence score for each pixel in the input image that explains the probability of the pixel having a symmetric counterpart in the image.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The technique can be explained broadly in two different steps as follows: –&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Photo-geometric autoencoder for image formation&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. How symmetries are modelled&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="419" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?resize=640%2C419&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?w=722&amp;ssl=1 722w, https://i1.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2.png?resize=300%2C197&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Creating 3D images from 2D images</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Photo-geometric&nbsp;autonecoder:&nbsp;</strong>After deforming the input images into albedo, depth, viewpoint, and illumination, the reconstruction takes place in two steps: lighting and reprojection. While the lightning function creates<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a version of the object based on the depth map, light direction, albedo, as seen from a canonical viewpoint, the reprojection function simulates the effect of a viewpoint change and generates images given the canonical depth and shaded canonical image.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Probably symmetric objects:&nbsp;</strong>Creating 3D image from 2D images requires determining the object points in images that are symmetric. By combining depth and albedo, the researchers were able to get a canonical frame.&nbsp;But,&nbsp;this process was also carried out by flipping the depth and albedo along a horizontal axis. This was embraced to get another image that was reconstructed with the flipped depth and albedo. Following this, they used the reconstruction losses of both the images that were leveraged for reasoning the symmetry probabilistically while generating the 3D images. The imperfections in created images caused blurry reconstruction. However, it was addressed by adding perceptual loss — a function to compare discrepancies among images.</p>



<h3>Benchmarking&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The model created by the researchers was put to the test on three human face datasets —&nbsp;CelebA, 3DFAW, and BFM. While&nbsp;CelebA&nbsp;consists of images of real human faces in the wild annotated with bounding boxes, the 3DFAW contains 23k images with 66 3D&nbsp;keypoint&nbsp;annotations, which was used for assessing the resulting 3D images. The BFM (Basel Face Model) is a synthetic face model considered for evaluating the quality of 3D reconstructions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers implemented the protocol&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of this paper</a>&nbsp;to obtain a dataset, sampling shapes, poses, textures, and illumination randomly. They also used SUN Database for background and saved ground truth depth maps to evaluate their generated 3D images.</p>



<p>“Since the scale of 3D reconstruction from projective cameras is inherently ambiguous, we discount it in the evaluation. Specifically, given the depth map predicted by our model in the canonical view, we wrap it to a depth map in the actual view using the predicted viewpoint and compare the latter to the ground-truth depth map using the scale-invariant depth error (SIDE),” noted the authors in the preprint paper.</p>



<p>Besides, the researchers reported the mean angle deviation (MAD), which can estimate how well the surface of generated images are captured.</p>



<p>This comparison is carried out by a function that evaluates the depth, albedo, viewpoint, lighting, and confidence maps using individual neural networks. While encoder-decoder networks generate the depth and albedo, viewpoint and lighting are regressed using simple encoder networks.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="229" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?resize=640%2C229&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1 723w, https://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?resize=300%2C107&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.analyticsdrift.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png?resize=720%2C259&amp;ssl=1 720w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>



<p>The above table compares the depth reconstruction quality achieved by leveraging photo-geometric autoencoders with other baselines: fully-supervised baseline, const. null depth, and average g.t depth (BFM dataset was used to create all the models). The unsupervised model outperforms the other models by a wider margin; a lower MAD means the deviation of generated and original images were bare minimal.</p>



<p>To understand how significant every step of the model construction was, the researchers evaluated the individual parts of the model by making several modifications.</p>



<p>Following approaches were tweaked:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Assessment by avoiding the albedo flip</p>



<p>2. Evaluation by ignoring the depth flip</p>



<p>3. Predicting shading map instead of computing it from depth and light direction</p>



<p>4. Avoiding the implementation of …</p></div></div></div>

			<p><span>Infrastructure, ops, devops, systems engineering, sysadmin, infraops, SRE, platform engineering. As long as I’ve been doing computers, these terms have been effectively synonymous. If I wanted to tell someone what my job was, I could throw out any one of them and expect to be understood.</span></p>
<p><span>Every tech company had a software engineering team that built software and an operations team that built infrastructure for running that software. At some point in the past decade they would have renamed this operations team to “devops” or “SRE”, but whatever the name, that was my team and those were my people.</span></p>
<p><span>But unless you’re an infrastructure company, infrastructure is not your mission. Which means that every second you devote to infrastructure work — and every engineer you devote to infrastructure problems — is a distraction from your core goals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s more, it’s a distraction that builds on itself. The more time and energy you spend on infrastructure, the more your focus gets scattered, and the more you deprive yourself of the time and energy that ought to be devoted to the problems your business exists to solve.</span></p>
<p><span>This isn’t exactly new. Infrastructure and operations have always been a distraction from your core business problems. It used to be the case that every company had to grow internal expertise in hardware, datacenters, networking, operating systems, config management, and so on up the tech stack until reaching their core business problems. Infrastructure and ops have always been a distraction, but until recently, a necessary one. A means to an end.</span></p>
<p><span>So what’s changed? These days, you increasingly have a choice. Sure, you </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> build all that internal expertise, but every day more and more of it is being served up via API on a silver platter.</span></p>
<p><span>Does this mean that operations is no longer important, no longer necessary? Far from it. Operations and operability are more important than ever. Let’s take a look at what’s happening to the ops profession at a high level, the emerging challenges we face, and the impact this’ll all have on our careers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Changes afoot</b></h3>
<p><span>Beyond the broader move into to cloud services, here are some of the major shifts on our horizon.</span></p>
<h5><b>From monolith to microservices</b></h5>
<p><span>Much has been written about the operational demands of a microservices architecture. Now that functions calling other functions involves a network hop, operational concerns are an unavoidable part of debugging even the most trivial problems. Microservices change the game from “building code” to “building systems”, which pushes more and more code writing into the realm of operations.</span></p>
<h5><b>From monitoring to observability</b></h5>
<p><span>Metric-based tools like Prometheus and DataDog are infrastructure monitoring tools, and quite good ones at that. When you’re responsible for infrastructure, the questions you care about are of aggregates and trends, thresholds and capacity. Monitoring tools are the right tool for the job, because that’s how you understand whether your infrastructure is healthy, and what actions to take to make it or keep it healthy.</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>Observability tools*, on the other hand, are for the people writing and shipping code to users every day, and trying to inspect and understand behavior at the nexus of users, production, and code. Observability tools preserve the full context of the request. This allows you to slice and dice and tease out new correlations, as well as view events in a waterfall by time (“tracing”). Observability is how you connect the dots between software and real business impact, and between your engineers’ experience and your users’ experience. </span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><i><span>*Caution: many monitoring tools are trying to rebrand themselves as observability tools without first building the necessary functionality. To tell the difference, </span></i><a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/so-you-want-to-build-an-observability-tool/"><i><span>see here</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p>
<h5><b>From magic autoinstrumentation to instrumenting with intent</b></h5>
<p><span>Instrumentation is just another form of commenting and documenting your code. There are tools that promise to do it automatically for you, but they aren’t great at capturing intent.. Auto-instrumentation can tell you loads of ancillary details, but they will </span><i><span>never</span></i><span> let you divine the business value intended by the engineer who built it. So suck it up and instrument your code.</span></p>
<h3><b>Ops is dead. Long live ops.</b></h3>
<p><span>Ops teams are going the way of the dodo bird, yet operability, resiliency, and reliability have never been more important. The role of operations engineers is changing fast, and the role is bifurcating along the question of infrastructure. In the future, people who would formerly have called themselves “operations engineers” (or devops engineers) will get to choose between a role that emphasizes </span><i><span>building infrastructure software as a service </span></i><span>and a role that uses their infrastructure expertise to help teams of engineers ship software more effectively and efficiently…generally by building as little infrastructure as possible.</span></p>
<p><span>If your heart truly beats for working on infrastructure problems, you’re in luck! — there are more of those than ever. Go join an infrastructure company. Try one of the many companies — AWS, Azure, all the many developer tooling companies — whose mission consists of building infrastructure software, of being the best in the world at infrastructure, and selling that expertise to other companies. There are roles for software engineers who enjoy building infrastructure solutions as a service, and there are even specialist ops roles for running and operating that infrastructure at scale, or administering those data services at scale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Otherwise, embrace the fact that your job consists of </span><i><span>building systems to enable teams of engineers to ship software that creates core business value</span></i><span>, which means home brewing as little infrastructure as possible. And what’s left?</span></p>
<h5><b>Vendor engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>Effectively outsourcing components of your infrastructure and weaving them together into a seamless whole involves a great deal of architectural skill and domain expertise. This skill set is both rare and incredibly undervalued, especially considering how pervasive the need for it is. Think about it. If you work at a large company, dealing with other internal teams should feel like dealing with vendors. And if you work at a small company, dealing with other vendors should feel like dealing with other teams.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone who wants a long and vibrant career in SRE leadership would do well to invest some energy into areas like these:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Learn to evaluate vendors and their products effectively. Ask piercing, probing questions to gauge compatibility and fit. Determine which areas of friction you can live with and which are dealbreakers.</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to calculate and quantify the cost of your and your team’s time and labor. Be ruthless about shedding as much labor as possible in order to focus on your core business.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Learn to manage the true cost of ownership, and to advocate and educate internally for the right solution, particularly by managing up to execs and finance folks.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Product engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>One of the great tragedies of infrastructure is how thoroughly most of us managed to evade the past 20+ years of lessons in managing products and learning how to work with designers. It’s no wonder most infrastructure tools require endless laborious trainings and certifications. They simply weren’t built like modern products for humans.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I recommend a crash course. Embed yourself within a B2B or B2C feature delivery team for a spell. Learn their rhythms, learn their language, soak up some of their instincts. You’ll need them to balance and blend your instincts for architectural correctness, scaling patterns, and firefighting.</span></li>
<li><span>You don’t have to become an expert in shipping features. But you should learn the elements of relationship-building the way a good product manager does. And you must learn enough about the product lifecycle that you can help debug and divert teams whose roadmaps are hopelessly intertwined and whose roadmaps are grinding to a halt.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Sociotechnical systems engineering</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h5>
<p><span>The irreducible core of the SRE/devops skill set increasingly revolves around crafting and curating efficient, effective sociotechnical feedback loops that enable and empower engineers to ship code — to move swiftly, with confidence. Your job is not to say “no” or throw up roadblocks, it’s to figure out how to help them get to yes.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Start with embracing releases. Lean hard into the deploy pipeline. The safest diff is the smallest diff, and you should ship automatically and compulsively. Optimize tests, CI/CD, etc so that deploys happen automatically upon merge to main, so that a single mergeset gets deployed at a time, there are no human gates, and everything goes live automatically within a few minutes of a developer committing their code. This is your holy grail, and most teams are nowhere near there.</span></li>
<li><span>Design and optimize on-call rotations that load balance the effort fairly and sustainably, and won’t burn people out. Apply the appropriate amount of pressure on management to devote enough time to reliability and fixing things versus just shipping new features. Hook up the feedback loops so that the people who are getting alerted are the ones empowered and motivated to fix the problems that are paging them. Ideally, you should page the person who made the change, every time.</span></li>
<li><span>Foster a culture of ownership and accountability while promulgating blamelessness throughout the org. Welcome engineers into production, and help them navigate production waters happily and successfully.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Managing the portfolio of technical investments.</b></h5>
<ul>
<li><span>Operability is the longest term investment / primary source of technical debt, so no one is better positioned to help evaluate and amortize those risks than ops engineers. It is effectively free to write code, compared to the gargantuan resources it takes to run that code and tend to it over the years.</span></li>
<li><span>Get excellent at migrations. Leave no trailing, stale remnants of systems behind to support — those are a terrible drain on the team. Surface this energy drain to decision-makers instead of …</span></li></ul></div></div></div>

	                <!-- .entry-header -->
   
		<div>
        <p>Yesterday <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/simcup/status/115186326776717312" target="_blank">@simcup</a> wrote on twitter about that he is currently downloading the whole Jamendo catalog of Creative Commons music. <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/simcup/status/115186326776717312" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" title="Capture" src="https://www.schrankmonster.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Capture.png" alt="Capture" width="404" height="165"></a></p>
<p>Although I already knew Jamendo it never occurred to be to download their whole catalog. Since I am a fan of choice I immediately thought about how I could download the catalog too. Since the only clue was a cryptic uri-like text how to achieve that it suddenly sounded like a great idea to write a universal tool and release it as open-source. This tool should allow users to download the whole catalog and keep their local jamendo mirror in sync with the server. So anytime new artists, albums or tracks are added the user does not need to download them all again.</p>
<p>So the only thing I had as a starting point was that cryptic uri pointing me to something I’ve never heard of called Rythmbox. Turns out that this is a GNOME music player application which has Jamendo integration. After some clueless poking around I decided to take a look at the source of Rythmbox, especially the Jamendo module.</p>
<p><a href="http://git.gnome.org/browse/rhythmbox/plain/plugins/jamendo/jamendo/JamendoSource.py?h=v0.13.x" target="_blank">This module</a> is written in python and quite clean to read. And just by looking at the first lines I came across the interesting fact that there is a almost daily updated XML dump of the Jamendo catalog available from Jamendo. Hurray! Since Jamendo wants developers to interact with the platform they decided to put a documentation online which allows anyone to write tools and stream and download tracks. After all the clues I found <a href="http://developer.jamendo.com/en/wiki/NewDatabaseDumps" target="_blank">I finally ended up on this page</a>.</p>
<p>So there are the catalog download, track stream and torrent uris necessary to download the catalog. Now the only thing that is needed is a tool which parses the XML and creates a nice folder structure for us.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" title="folderstructure" src="https://www.schrankmonster.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/folderstructure.png" alt="folderstructure" width="183" height="128"></p>
<p>Parsing XML in C# (my prefered programming language) is easy. Basically you can use a tool called <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x6c1kb0s%28v=vs.80%29.aspx" target="_blank">XSD.exe</a> and let it generate first the XSD from the XML and then ready-to-use C# classes from that XSD.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.schrankmonster.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/generating_xsd_and_csharp.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" title="generating_xsd_and_csharp" src="https://www.schrankmonster.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/generating_xsd_and_csharp_thumb.png" alt="generating_xsd_and_csharp" width="400" height="258"></a></p>
<p>After doing all that actually reading the whole catalog into a useable form breaks down to just three lines of code:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.schrankmonster.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/parsingxml.png"><img loading="lazy" title="parsingxml" src="https://www.schrankmonster.de/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/parsingxml_thumb.png" alt="parsingxml" width="404" height="57"></a></p>
<p>Isn’t it great how modern frameworks take away the complexity of such tasks. At this point I’ve already parsed the whole catalog into my tool and only wrote three lines of code. The rest was generated automatically for me. The best of all – this also works on non-windows operating systems when you use <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page" target="_blank">mono</a>.</p>
<p>When the XML data is parsed and available in a nice data structure it’s easy to iterate through all artists, all albums and all tracks and then download the actual mp3 or ogg. And that’s basically what my tool does. It takes the XML, parses it, and downloads. It will check before downloading if the track already exists and will only download those added since the last run.</p>
<p>Additionally since I am deeply involved into the development of the <a href="http://github.com/sones/sones" target="_blank">GraphDB graph database at sones</a> I want to make use of the Jamendo data and the graph structure it poses. Since the directory structure my tool is generating is only one aspect how you could possibly look at the data it’s quite interesting to demonstrate the capabilities of GraphDB based on that data.</p>
<p>The idea behind the graph representation of the data is that you could start from almost any starting point imaginable. No matter if you you start from a single track and drill up into genre and artists, or if you start at a location and drill down to tracks.</p>
<p>So what the Downloader does in matters of GraphDB integration is that it outputs a GraphQL script which can be imported into an instance of GraphDB.</p>
<p>The sourcecode of my tool is available on github and released unter the BSD license – feel free to play with it and to contribute.</p>

<p>Every cloud platform provider has their own CLI tool they want you to install, all with different dependencies and install methods. <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli" target="_blank">Some</a> <a href="https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl/blob/master/README.md#snap-supported-os" target="_blank">want</a> you to <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/825005/" target="_blank">install</a> their tools <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17055401" target="_blank">using</a> <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2019/02/13/cve-2019-7304/" target="_blank">Snap</a>; <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">some</a> want you to run install scripts as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html#cliv2-linux-install" target="_blank"><samp>root</samp></a> that add files not managed by your OS’s package management system;<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/8a8f17f5fd334fb583438edbd831d506.html#loio8a8f17f5fd334fb583438edbd831d506" target="_blank">some</a> want you to click through <a href="https://www.phlummox.dev/images/azure-in-docker--germany.png" target="_blank">a license</a> where you agree to be bound by the laws of Germany. Occasionally, you might find one who actually packages their tool for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install#installation_options" target="_blank">at least a few</a> different OS distributions, or even provides a <a href="https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/121541.htm" target="_blank">statically-linked binary</a> plus the <a href="https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-cli" target="_blank">source code</a> it was built from. Really though, the best CLI is one you <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/azure-cloud-shell/" target="_blank">don’t have to install at all</a>.</p>
<p>I’m surprised (and annoyed, of course) that more cloud providers don’t provide web-based shell access to their tools. But when they don’t, the next best option might be to install the tool in a Docker container. (In any case, working in a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/webssh2">webssh</a> session gets a bit wearisome after a while, somewhere around the tenth time you accidentally hit <code>ctrl-r</code> and refresh the page instead of searching your command history. Installing a tool on your own machine does have <em>some</em> benefits.)</p>
<p>Rather than having your development environment cluttered with dozens or even hundreds of dependencies you neither want nor need, why not confine each provider’s tools to a single Docker container? Then you will have to clutter your development environment with potentially only <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank"><em>one</em></a> <a href="https://coreos.com/rkt/docs/latest/rkt-vs-other-projects.html#process-model" target="_blank">baroque</a>, <a href="https://media.rubegoldberg.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/hachathon-1200x674.jpg" target="_blank">Rube</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9963242" target="_blank">Goldberg</a><a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-docker-authentication-works-by-documentation-mitm-and-implementation-e62cd7a31178#9bf4" target="_blank">–esque</a>, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/true-story-kudzu-vine-ate-south-180956325/" target="_blank">Kudzu-</a>pervasive framework.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Taking Azure’s <code>az</code> tool as an example, you can do it like so:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Pull the Docker image (based on Alpine Linux) for the <code>az</code> CLI tool:<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>docker</span> pull mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli</span></code></pre></div></li>
<li><p>Create a docker volume which will hold the contents of the <code>/root</code> directory, which is where our credentials are stored:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>docker</span> -D run -v /root --name azconfig mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli</span></code></pre></div></li>
</ol>
<p>We now have a stopped Docker container called <code>azconfig</code>, containing an anonymous volume<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> which contains the contents of the <code>/root</code> directory. We can use the volume by supplying <code>--volumes-from azconfig</code> as an argument to the <code>docker run</code> command.</p>
<p>(Note that we don’t supply <code>--rm</code> as an argument this first time round, since we want to actually <em>keep</em> the container and its attached volume.)</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Spin up a new container which mounts the volume from our <code>azconfig</code> one:</p>

<p>This time we <em>do</em> use the <code>--rm</code> argument: we don’t care if this container disappears, the credentials will be stored in the volume.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>Inside the container, we can run</p>

<p>to log on. The tool displays a message like</p>

<p>where the “<sample>XXXXXXXXX</sample>” is some 9-character code Microsoft uses to identify the device you’re logging in from. Follow the instructions, and voilà – we’re in.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now we can run whatever commands we like inside the running container – try typing <code>az account list</code>, just to check that the tool is working:</p>
<pre><code>$ az account list
[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "&lt;REDACTED&gt;",
    "id": "&lt;REDACTED&gt;",
    "isDefault": true,
    "managedByTenants": [],
    "name": "Free Trial",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "&lt;REDACTED&gt;",
    "user": {
      "name": "phlummox@phlummox.dev",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]</code></pre>
<p>And regardless of what we do with the new containers – keep them running, stop them, throw them away – we can just run up a new one to access our existing credentials and avoid having to log in again.</p>
<p>There. Don’t you feel better about life already? If only I’d done something like this earlier, I could’ve avoided writing <a href="https://www.phlummox.dev/post/installing-travis-cli/">this</a> post.</p>
<p>The same sort of method should work perfectly well for other command-line tools like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">Amazon’s</a>, <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli" target="_blank">Heroku’s</a>, <a href="https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/2055" target="_blank">Travis CI’s</a>, and so on. Google <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk" target="_blank">Cloud SDK</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-docker.html#cliv2-docker-share-files" target="_blank">Amazon’s</a> command-line tools are the only ones I’ve noticed where the provider actually <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/google/cloud-sdk/" target="_blank">tells users</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-docker.html#cliv2-docker-share-files" target="_blank">about the method</a> described here as an alternative to installing a godawful bunch of packages just to manage something in the cloud. But I like to think that if enough of us join together, in a spirit of good-will and positivity, and yell at cloud providers to fix their shit up, then maybe someday the others will too.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-webassembly">What is WebAssembly?</h2>
<p>In all current browsers, there is a JavaScript engine that interprets and executes the code. This has allowed us to implement very rich web applications because JavaScript is getting better and more complete every day. However, it's a high-level language but still not ideal for some tasks because it has <strong>not been developed to be a fast language</strong> with a lot of performance.</p>
<p>WebAssembly (<strong>WASM</strong>) is a new portable <strong>binary-code format</strong> that can be executed in modern browsers. It is complemented with a <strong>text format</strong> (<strong>WAT</strong>) to make it more <strong>readable/debuggable</strong> for us, in addition, to allow us to code directly in a kind of "assembly" code. It's an open <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wasm-core-1/">W3C standard</a> still in progress that allows us to write <strong>fast and efficient</strong> code for the web in other languages than JavaScript and it runs with a <strong>similar performance to the native language</strong>. It's not here to replace JavaScript, but to complement it.</p>

  <figcaption><small>JavaScript and WASM engine</small></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another purpose of WebAssembly is to keep the web <strong>secure</strong>, light and fast, keeping a <strong>small</strong> <code>.wasm</code> <strong>file size</strong> and always maintaining <strong>backwards-compatibility</strong> in new WASM features, so the web doesn't break.</p>
<p>There are more than <a href="https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs">40 supported languages</a> for WebAssembly, the most common are C, C++, and Rust for their performance and maturity, although you also can write code for WASM with high-level languages like Python, PHP or even JavaScript!</p>
<p>Some <strong>practical uses</strong> of WebAssembly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encryption</li>
<li>Games that require a lot of assets</li>
<li>Image and video editing</li>
<li>P2P</li>
<li>High-performance algorithms</li>
<li>VR, AR</li>
<li>Visualizations and simulations</li>
<li>A big etc...</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-in-rust">Why in Rust?</h2>
<p>Perhaps you wonder why choose <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, when we have so many languages available with WebAssembly. There are several reasons for that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Rust is free from the non-deterministic garbage collection and it gives to programmers the control over indirection, monomorphization, and memory layout.</li>
<li><strong>Small <code>.wasm</code> sizes</strong>: Rust lacks a runtime, enabling small <code>.wasm</code> size because there is no extra bloat included like a garbage collector. Hence you only pay in code size, for these functions that you're using.</li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong>: Rust and Webassembly integrates with existing JavaScript tooling (npm, Webpack...).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="execute-rust-code-from-javascript">Execute Rust code from JavaScript</h2>
<p>Assuming you have both <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a> (for JS) and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">Cargo</a> (for Rust), another prerequisite we need to install it is <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack">wasm-pack</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cargo install wasm-pack</code></pre>
<h3 id="rust-code">Rust code</h3>
<p>Let's create a new Rust project for the "Hello world":</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cargo new helloworld --lib</code></pre>
<p>On <code>Cargo.toml</code> we are going to add the next:</p>
<pre><code><span>[package]</span>
<span>name</span> = <span>"helloworld"</span>
<span>version</span> = <span>"0.1.0"</span>
<span>authors</span> = [<span>"Aral Roca Gomez &lt;contact@aralroca.com&gt;"</span>]
<span>edition</span> = <span>"2018"</span>


<span>[lib]</span>
<span>crate-type</span> = [<span>"cdylib"</span>]

<span>[dependencies]</span>
<span>wasm-bindgen</span> = <span>"0.2.67"</span>

<span>[package.metadata.wasm-pack.profile.release]</span>
<span>wasm-opt</span> = [<span>"-Oz"</span>, <span>"--enable-mutable-globals"</span>]</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>cdylib</code> lib for <code>wasm</code> final artifacts.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen">wasm-bindgen</a> dependency to facilitate high-level interactions between Wasm modules and JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The latest part about <code>--enable-mutable-globals</code> in principle, in upcoming <code>wasm-bindgen</code> releases, should not be needed but for this tutorial it's necessary. Otherwise <a href="https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/issues/886#issuecomment-667669802">we can not work with Strings</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>WebAssembly only supports the i32, u32, i64, and u64 types. If you want to work with other types, such as String or Objects, you normally must first encode them. However, <strong>wasm-bindgen</strong> does these bindings for us. There's no need to worry about it anymore. That said, let's create our <code>helloworld</code> function to return a String in <code>src/lib.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

<span>#[wasm_bindgen]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>helloworld</span></span>() -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    <span>String</span>::from(<span>"Hello world from Rust!"</span>)
}</code></pre>
<h3 id="compilation">Compilation</h3>
<p>Let's compile Rust's code with:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; wasm-pack build --target web</code></pre>
<p>We are using the web target, however, there are different targets we can use depending on how we want to use that <code>wasm</code> file:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>--target bundler</strong> - for bundlers like Webpack, Parcel, or Rollup.</li>
<li><strong>--target web</strong> - for the web as ECMAScript module.</li>
<li><strong>--target no-modules</strong> - for the web without ECMAScript module.</li>
<li><strong>--target nodejs</strong> - for Node.js</li>
</ul>
<p>After executing the above command, a <code>pkg</code> directory will have been created with our JavaScript library containing the code we have made in Rust! It even generates the "types" files of TypeScript.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ls -l pkg
total 72
-rw-r--r--  1 aralroca  staff    929 Aug 15 13:38 helloworld.d.ts
-rw-r--r--  1 aralroca  staff   3210 Aug 15 13:38 helloworld.js
-rw-r--r--  1 aralroca  staff    313 Aug 15 13:38 helloworld.wasm
-rw-r--r--  1 aralroca  staff    268 Aug 15 13:38 helloworld_bg.d.ts
-rw-r--r--  1 aralroca  staff  15160 Aug 15 13:38 helloworld_bg.wasm
-rw-r--r--  1 aralroca  staff    289 Aug 15 13:38 package.json</code></pre>
<p>Now it's ready as a JavaScript package so we can use it in our project or even upload the package to NPM as we can see later.</p>
<p>The <code>.js</code> file contains the necessary "glue" code to not have to worry about working outside the <code>pkg</code> with buffers, text decoders, etc.</p>
<h3 id="use-the-compiled-code-on-our-js-project">Use the compiled code on our JS project</h3>
<p>In order to use the <code>wasm</code> file in our JavaScript, we can import the generated <code>pkg</code> module to our project. To test it, we can create an <code>index.html</code> on the root of the Rust project with this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE <span>html</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>head</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>charset</span>=<span>"UTF-8"</span> /&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>title</span>&gt;</span>"Hello world" in Rust + Webassembly<span>&lt;/<span>title</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>script</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"module"</span>&gt;</span><span>
      <span>import</span> init, { helloworld } <span>from</span> <span>'./pkg/helloworld.js'</span>

      <span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>run</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
        <span>await</span> init()
        <span>document</span>.body.textContent = helloworld()
      }

      run()
    </span><span>&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>head</span>&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;<span>body</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>body</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>html</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, before using the <code>helloworld</code> function it's important to call the asynchronous <code>init</code> function in order to load the <code>wasm</code> file. Then, we can use the public Rust functions more easily!</p>
<p>To test it, you can do <code>npx serve .</code> and open <code>http://localhost:5000</code>.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="execute-javascript-code-from-rust">Execute JavaScript code from Rust</h2>
<p>It is possible to use JavaScript code within Rust, for example, to use <code>window</code> variables, write in the DOM or call internal functions such as <code>console.log</code>. All we have to do is to declare the JavaScript bindings we want to use inside <code>extern "C"</code>.</p>
<p>As an example we are going to use the function <code>console.log</code> inside Rust:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

<span>#[wasm_bindgen]</span>
<span>extern</span> <span>"C"</span> {
    <span>#[wasm_bindgen(js_namespace = console)]</span>
    <span><span>fn</span> <span>log</span></span>(s: &amp;<span>str</span>);
}

<span>#[wasm_bindgen]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>example</span></span>() {
    log(<span>"Log from rust"</span>);
}</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, inside the <code>extern "C"</code> we have to indicate the <code>js_namespace</code> (console) declaring the function that we'll use inside the namespace (log). In this case, we've put only one string as a parameter but if we wanted to execute a <code>console.log</code> with multiple parameters they would have to be declared.</p>
<p>And in our JS:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> init, { example } <span>from</span> <span>'./pkg/helloworld.js'</span>

<span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>run</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>await</span> init()
  example() 
}

run()</code></pre>
<h2 id="performance---javascript-vs-rust">Performance - JavaScript vs Rust</h2>
<p>Let's do a comparison of a slightly more expensive function, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence">fibonacci</a> function, to see how it performs in both Rust and JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span> wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

<span>#[wasm_bindgen]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>fibonacci</span></span>(n: <span>u32</span>) -&gt; <span>u32</span> {
    <span>match</span> n {
        <span>0</span> | <span>1</span> =&gt; n,
        _ =&gt; fibonacci(n - <span>1</span>) + fibonacci(n - <span>2</span>),
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Using the <code>console.time</code> function we can measure the performance of each one:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> init, { fibonacci } <span>from</span> <span>'./pkg/helloworld.js'</span>

<span><span>function</span> <span>fibonacciInJs</span>(<span>n</span>) </span>{
  <span>if</span> (n &lt;= <span>1</span>) <span>return</span> n
  <span>return</span> fibonacciInJs(n - <span>1</span>) + fibonacciInJs(n - <span>2</span>)
}

<span>async</span> <span><span>function</span> <span>run</span>(<span></span>) </span>{
  <span>await</span> init()
  <span>const</span> num = <span>20</span>

  <span>console</span>.time(<span>'Fibonnaci in rust'</span>)
  <span>const</span> fibRust = fibonacci(num)
  <span>console</span>.timeEnd(<span>'Fibonnaci in rust'</span>)

  <span>console</span>.time(<span>'Fibonnaci in JS'</span>)
  <span>const</span> fibJS = fibonacciInJs(num)
  <span>console</span>.timeEnd(<span>'Fibonnaci in JS'</span>)

  <span>document</span>.body.textContent = <span>`Fib <span>${num}</span>:  Rust <span>${fibRust}</span> - JS <span>${fibJS}</span>`</span>
}

run()</code></pre>
<p>And the result:</p>
<figure>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://aralroca.com/images/blog-images/fibonacci-rust-vs-js.png" alt="Performance of fibonnaci function Rust vs JavaScript">
  <figcaption><small>Performance of fibonnaci function Rust vs JavaScript</small></figcaption>
</figure>

<ul>
<li>In Rust: 0.13ms</li>
<li>In JS: 1.28ms</li>
</ul>
<p>Around <strong>x10 times faster</strong> in Rust than in JS!</p>
<p>However, it's important to note that not all functions we implement in Rust will be faster than in JavaScript. But there will be a considerable improvement in many of them that require recursion or loops.</p>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>If in <code>devtools -&gt; source</code> we look inside our files for our <code>.wasm</code> file, we'll see that instead of binary it shows us the WAT file being more readable and debuggable.</p>
<figure>
  <img loading="lazy" src="https://aralroca.com/images/blog-images/debug-wasm.jpg" alt="Debug WASM in Chrome dev tools">
  <figcaption><small>Debug WASM in Chrome dev tools</small></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For a better debugging experience, you can use the <code>--debug</code> flag to display the names of the functions you have used in Rust.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; wasm-pack build --target web --debug</code></pre>
<p>For now, with <code>wasm-bindgen</code> it's not possible to use source-maps to display the code in Rust on devtools. But I suppose in the future it will be available.</p>
<h2 id="publishing-to-npm">Publishing to NPM</h2>
<p>Once we have our pkg directory generated, we can package it with:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;  wasm-pack pack myproject/pkg</code></pre>
<p>And publish it at npm with:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; wasm-pack publish</code></pre>
<p>They work the same way as with <code>npm pack</code> and <code>npm publish</code>, so we could use the same flags as <code>wasm-pack publish --tag next</code>.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>In this article, we've seen a bit of what WebAssembly is and what is necessary to start creating web applications with Rust.</p>
<p>We have used Rust because is one of the best integrated but it's possible to use many other languages. This way, we can bring back to life old applications made with languages like C or C++, and implement more futuristic and portable applications for VR or AR. All this thanks to the browser!</p>

                What's flying above us?
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm working to make it easy to find out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's how:
            </p>

            
            <p>
                My <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1294002338215034880">Advisory Circular network of
                    twitter bots</a> post in real-time whenever they detect aircraft
                flying in circles over cities around the world, including Los Angeles, Baltimore, Portland, Minneapolis,
                and London. The bots often tweet about news and fire aircraft, and because they use an uncensored source
                of data they also tweet police, FBI, DHS, DEA, CBP, and military
                aircraft. They look for circles because it means an aircraft is <i>doing something</i> instead of
                <i>going somewhere</i>. If you've ever asked “what is that helicopter/plane?” there’s a good chance my
                bots can answer your question—even if it's an advanced military surveillance plane:
            </p>

            <blockquote>

            </blockquote>
            

            
            <p>
                A few years ago I <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sowJrQQfgxnLCErb-CvUV8VGXdtca6SWYWWLRPZgaHI/edit?usp=sharing">discovered
                    a secret FBI aerial surveillance program</a>, involving more than 100 aircraft
                registered to front companies. I was one of the first people to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9508812">post online</a> about the program.
            </p>
            <p>From a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150605064602/http://fusion.net/story/143739/how-you-can-track-the-fbis-spy-planes/">Fusion
                    Media
                    article</a>:</p>
            <blockquote>
                This week, the Associated Press reported that the FBI is regularly flying “spy planes” over American
                cities.

                The report, which revealed the front companies the FBI uses to fly the planes, wasn’t a surprise to John
                Wiseman, a technologist in Los Angeles. Based on public records, he had already figured out some of the
                planes the FBI was flying and, using a
                device he programmed to intercept airplane transmissions, had identified over the last month the ones
                flying overhead in L.A. in real time.
                Wiseman wrote in a Hacker News comment in May about his findings, revealing a month ago what the AP
                reported today.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                I continue to help journalists with stories related to government aerial surveillance.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I created a <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1238149529469202433">Siri shortcut</a> that
                lets you ask what's overhead at any time, and it will tell you what
                the nearest aircraft is and who it's registered to. It uses the same uncensored data source as
                the Advisory Circular bots.
            </p>

            
            <p>
                I've always funded this work myself, but now I'm in the situation of having been furloughed without pay
                since April.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve spent hundreds of hours in development work trying to bring the public this essential
                information for free. I'd like to continue this work, both supporting existing projects and implementing
                new ideas (I'd also like to replace my broken laptop).
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>Oddly, I don't remember when or how I got my hands on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.toshiba-memory.com/products/toshiba-wireless-sd-cards-flashair-w-04/">Toshiba <em>FlashAir</em></a> card. These WiFi-enabled SD cards are made to transfer photos from a digital camera to a computer.</p>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/flashair.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <div>
              <p>Imaginging that someone would use a 4MBps wireless connection to transfer photos when the hardware transfer is closer to 70MBps seems ridiculous.</p>
              <p>However, it could come in handy if you're in a situation where you don't have access to an SD card reader, or want to easily preview photos on a phone or tablet.</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              <h3>Digging into the <em>FlashAir</em></h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>What's far more interesting about these Toshiba cards is the fact that they are essentially programmed to act as a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point">wireless access point (WAP)</a>. You can setup a custom SSID and password— connecting directly to the card over 2.4GHz.</p>
              <p>After peeking at the filesystem, I realized that the main photo gallery application hosted on the card is essentially a static website— served as basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/flashair-filesystem.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>My excitement with this bit of tech was the possibility of building a totally discrete microserver that would be capable of hosting a few pages and services.</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Project Inspiration</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>My fourth-year undergraduate architecture studio, entitled <em>Dark Rooms</em>, was taught by <a target="_blank" href="https://m-a-u-s-e-r.net/">Mona Mahall</a>. The studio was split into three exhibitions: <em>Pyramid, Server and Backstage</em>. These exhibitions were meant to explore the "spaces between visibility and invisibility".</p>
              <p>In the second exhibition, <em>Server</em>, we were asked to consider the design of an anti-human space— a dark, cold, electronic archive built exclusively for machines. In my preliminary research, I was particularly interested in artists like <a target="_target" href="https://arambartholl.com/dead-drops/">Adam Bartholl</a>.</p>
              <p>His project, a USB "<a target="_blank" href="http://deaddrops.com/">dead drop</a>", drew inspiration from an information-sharing tactic used by spies. A predetermined secret location— such as a hollowed-out rock, brick, log or other object— would be used to discreetly stash an important item.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/USB-dead-drop.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>Once the item— perhaps a slip of paper or a key— is "dropped", a second party could then retrieve it without interacting directly with the other person or being detected in the exchange.</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Wireless Anonymous Repository</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>While a USB is already a much more "invisible" way of storing and exchanging information, I wanted to take this concept a step further. Using the <em>FlashAir</em> cards, I proposed a new wireless dead drop that could be just as affordable and simple as the USB, but with a myriad of superior qualities.</p>
              <p>Writing directly to the card requires an SD card slot; however, the wireless functionality can be powered without a desktop or laptop. A typical SD card takes 2.4-3.6V at about 30mA. I found that by using an SD-to-USB adapter, one could power the wireless module from a standard 5V USB outlet.</p>
            </div>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-AC.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>Depending on the location of the dead drop, this could be concealed within a false junction box that would be plugged in over the top of a standard 2-outlet 120V AC. If— in the spirit of the original USB dead drop— you wanted to embed the card in a brick wall, then the device could be powered from a USB powerbank.</p>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png">
              <p><img data-src="assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png" src="https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/assets/img/wartor/wartor-outlet.png">
              </p>
            </a>

            <p>I named the project <em>warTOR</em> for "wireless anonymous repo" + <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)">TOR</a>. Though it's not connected to the Tor network in any way, I thought this title captured the spirit of anonymity (plus I wanted to use some Pokémon sprites). If someone would like to try it, the Toshiba cards <em>can</em> be setup as a wireless bridge... from a Tor gateway?</p>

            <p>
              <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            </p>
            <div>
              <p>Something else that I'd like to try is powering the card via a small solar cell, but I haven't gotten there yet... The greatest benefit of the wireless dead drop is that one could log into the WAP from their cellphone, upload or download a file, and no one could discern that any sort of exchange was happening. However, I'm also working on a clientside chat application that could be hosted on the cards.</p>
              <p>With this implemented, then two people could sit down in a café and send messages back and forth over the private network; or, someone could login to the network and type out a message for the other person to see at a later date.</p>
            </div>

              </p>
            </a>

            <div>
              <p>Here are some screenshots from the application 👆. I'll be doing a follow-up post with a GitHub link to the <em>FlashAir</em> CONFIG file that I'm using on my card. I'll also upload the source code for the original <em>warTOR</em> server with instructions on how you can deploy your own <em>warTOR</em> in the wild!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>
        <b>TLDR:</b> Create a super simple minimalist blog with little to no coding
        experience. Get <a href="https://bear.app/" target="_blank">Bear</a> (only available on
        Apple devices), export notes as HTML files, upload to GitHub, then link
        to host/domain. Profit!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I love things that are stripped down to the bare essentials, but still
        do their job well. I try to replicate this in both my personal and work
        life. Here’s why:
      </p>
      
      <p>Big chunky things = Scary</p>
      <p>Scary = Never gets done</p>
      <p>Small and super simple = Gets done</p>
      
      <p>
        To get stuff done, I break down and simplify tasks to a degree that some
        might consider excessive. This forcing function also helps me consider
        and address core issues versus symptoms. This post is about how I used
        this approach to quickly create a blog.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Having used Bear for years to keep a daily journal, I decided to start writing online. With Bear as the inspiration, I listed what I needed
        <b>now</b>, ignoring what I might one day use. The first approach leads to a simple but finished project, the momentum of a win, and the option for future
        improvements. The latter invites indecision, complexity, delays, and usually doesn’t get me very far.
      </p>
      
      <p>My ideal blog needed to be:</p>
      <ol start="1">
        <li>Self hosted on a custom domain.</li>
        <li>Exceedingly easy to set up and update.</li>
        <li>Text based. Images were not an immediate priority.</li>
        <li>Styled for readability.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        By listing problems <b>before</b> looking for solutions, I can quickly
        filter results that don’t match. I’m then less likely to fall prey to
        premature optimisation, marketing or <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/aesthetic-usability-effect/" target="_blank">aesthetic usability bias</a>.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Most solutions (including Wordpress) simply did too much. Paradox of
        choice was another issue. Having so many off-the-shelf options, each
        with a microcosm of near infinite themes and widgets, was just too overwhemling. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I took a step back and considered if my time would instead be better spent building a blog from scratch. A quick Google once again
        presented a paradox of choice; an endless number of ways or frameworks to choose from. I’m not a programmer and didn’t know where to start, so
        I took another step back. I drew up a simple plan, filled in some blanks, and decided to ask a friend about the rest.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I realised that Bear could export notes in HTML, including all the CSS styling at the bottom. This was a huge win as I could use Bear to create a simple home               
        page with a title, a paragraph, and an unordered list of links to individual posts. As for the posts themselves, I just needed to write them up in Bear 
        and export them.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Enter <a href="https://kasun.io/" target="_blank">Kasun</a>, a friend, indie-hacker and
        freelance programmer (who’s currently working remotely while travelling
        across Sri Lanka). He was kind enough to teach me some basics about
        HTML, hosting, and linking domains. Here’s what we did:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ol start="1">
        <li>Create and export notes from Bear.</li>
        <li>Create a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account and paste the
          exported code into a project.
        </li>
        <li>Use <a href="https://vercel.com/" target="_blank">Vercel’s</a> free tier for hosting
          and link to Github.
        </li>
        <li>Link domain to Vercel.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        That’s pretty much it really. For someone familiar with the basics, it
        would have taken under 15 mins to have a minimalist, well styled, and
        self-hosted blog, all without writing a single line of code.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In the end, not only did I get my blog, but I also learned some basic
        web development! It’s a big win in my book and I wanted to share this
        post in case others (especially other Bear fans) want to do something
        similar.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3 id="Postscript notes:">Postscript notes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Considering the number of available options, it’s likely that I missed something that would have been a good fit. If so, feel free to tweet me a link.
        </li>
        <li>This blog is the first website I’ve built and has helped me realise that code isn’t as “scary” as I once thought 😊.
        </li>
        <li>Images aren’t included by default in Bear HTML exports. To include them, you have to manually upload the picture to your GitHub project and then include a link in the relevant HTML file as part of an image tag.
        </li>
        <li>Developer friends have mentioned that the formatting of the exported html file isn’t great. While not a huge problem for me, I will use it as a way to learn more about formatting best practices.
        </li>
        <li>Big thanks to the talented <a href="https://kasun.io/" target="_blank">Kasun</a> for
          the help! I can’t recommend him enough if you’re on the lookout for a
          freelance developer. If you’re a designer, be sure to check out
          <a href="https://whatthehex.app/" target="_blank">What the Hex?!</a>, one of his
          projects that lets you quickly assign names to your design system
          colour palette.
        </li>
        <li>If you’d like to build something similar and have questions, I’d love
          to hear from you!
        </li>

    <p>Over the past few years, Python has exploded in popularity for data science,
machine learning, deep learning and numerical computing. New frameworks
pushing forward the state of the art in these fields are appearing every
year. One unintended consequence of all this activity and creativity has been
fragmentation in the fundamental building blocks - multidimensional array
(tensor) and dataframe libraries - that underpin the whole Python data
ecosystem. For example, arrays are fragmented between Tensorflow, PyTorch,
NumPy, CuPy, MXNet, Xarray, Dask, and others. Dataframes are fragmented
between Pandas, PySpark, cuDF, Vaex, Modin, Dask, Ibis, Apache Arrow, and
more. This fragmentation comes with significant costs, from whole libraries
being reimplemented for a different array or dataframe library to end users
having to re-learn APIs and best practices when they move from one framework
to another.</p>
<p><img src="https://data-apis.org/images/ecosystem_fragmentation.png" alt="Ecosystem growing up in silos"></p>
<p>Today, we are announcing the Consortium for Python Data API Standards, which
aims to tackle this fragmentation by developing API standards for arrays
(a.k.a. tensors) and dataframes. We aim to grow this Consortium into an
organization where cross-project and cross-ecosystem alignment on APIs, data
exchange mechanisms and other such topics happens. These topics require
coordination and communication to a much larger extent than they require
technical innovation. We aim to facilitate the former, while leaving the
innovating to current and future individual libraries.</p>
<p><em>Want to get started right away? Collect data on your own API usage with</em>
<em><a href="https://github.com/data-apis/python-record-api">python-record-api</a>.</em>
<em>And for array or dataframe maintainers: we want to</em>
<em>hear what you think – see the end of this post.</em></p>
<h2 id="bootstrapping-an-organization-and-involving-the-wider-community">Bootstrapping an organization and involving the wider community</h2>
<p>The goal is ambitious, and there are obvious hurdles, such as answering
questions like “what is the impact of a technical decision on each library?”.
There’s a significant amount of engineering and technical writing to do to
create overviews and data that can be used to answer such questions. This
requires dedicated time, and hence funding, in addition to bringing
maintainers of libraries together to provide input and assess those overviews
and data. These factors motivated the following approach to bootstrapping the
Consortium:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assemble a consortium of people from interested companies (who help fund
the required engineering and technical writing time) and key community
contributors.</li>
<li>Form a working group which meets weekly for an hour, sets the high-level
goals, requirements, and user stories, and makes initial decisions.</li>
<li>Several engineers with enough bandwidth will do the heavy lifting on
building the required tooling, and preparing the data and draft docs
needed by the working group. Iterate as needed based on feedback from the
working group.</li>
<li>Once drafts of an API standard have a concrete outline, request input from
a broader group of array and dataframe library maintainers.
<em><span>This is where we are today.</span></em></li>
<li>Once tooling or drafts of the API standards get mature enough for wider review,
release them as Request for Comments (RFC) and have a public review
process. Iterate again as needed.</li>
<li>Once there’s enough buy-in for the RFCs, and it’s clear projects are able
and willing to adopt the proposed APIs, publish a 1.0 version of the
standard.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such a gradual RFC process is a bit of an experiment. Community projects
like NumPy and Pandas aren’t used to this; however, it’s similar to successful
models in other communities (e.g. the Open Geospatial Consortium, or C++
standardization) and we think the breadth of projects involved and complexity
of the challenge makes this the most promising and likely to succeed approach.
The approach will certainly evolve over time though, based on experience and
feedback from the many stakeholders.</p>
<p><img src="https://data-apis.org/images/API_standard_RFC_review_diagram.png" alt="API standard RFC development and community review"></p>
<p>There are other, synergistic activities happening in the ecosystem that are
relevant for this Consortium, that individual members are contributing to,
such as the work on
<a href="https://github.com/numpy/archive/blob/master/other_meetings/2020-04-21-array-protocols_discussion_and_notes.md">developing NumPy array protocols</a>,
and the  <code>__dataframe__</code>
<a href="https://github.com/wesm/dataframe-protocol">data interchange protocol design</a>.
The section in the <code>__array_module__</code> NEP on <a href="https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0037-array-module.html#requesting-restricted-subsets-of-numpy-s-api">“restricted subsets of NumPy’s API”</a>
gives an outline for how the API standard we’re developing can be adopted.
The <code>__dataframe__</code> protocol attempts to solve a small, well-defined problem
that is a sub-problem of the one a full dataframe API standard would solve.</p>
<h2 id="an-api-standard---what-do-we-mean-by-that">An API standard - what do we mean by that?</h2>
<p>When we start talking about an “API standard” or a formal specification, it’s
important to start by explaining both why we need it and what “API standard”
means. “Standard” is a loaded word, and “standardization” is a process that,
when done right, can have a large impact but may also evoke past experiences
that weren’t always productive.</p>
<p>We can look at an API in multiple levels of detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which functions, classes, class methods and other objects are in it.</li>
<li>What is the signature of each object.</li>
<li>What are the semantics of each object.</li>
</ol>
<p>When talking about <em>compatibility</em> between libraries, e.g. “the Pandas, Dask
and Vaex <code>groupby</code> methods are compatible”, we imply that the respective
dataframe objects all have a <code>groupby</code> method with the same signature and the
same semantics, so they can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>Currently, array and dataframe libraries all have similar APIs, but with
enough differences that using them interchangeably isn’t really possible.
Here is a concrete example for a relatively simple function, <code>mean</code>, for
arrays:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>We see that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All libraries provide this functionality in a function called <code>mean</code>,
except (1) Tensorflow calls it <code>reduce_mean</code> and (2) PyData Sparse has a
<code>mean</code> method instead of a function (it does work with <code>np.mean</code> though via
<a href="https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/arrays.classes.html#special-attributes-and-methods">array protocols</a>).</li>
<li>NumPy, Dask, CuPy, JAX and MXNet have compatible signatures (except the
<code>&lt;no_value&gt;</code> default for <code>keepdims</code>, which really means <code>False</code> but with
different behavior for array subclasses).</li>
<li>The semantics are harder to inspect, but will also have differences. For
example, MXNet documents: <em>This function differs from the original <code>numpy.mean</code>
in the following way(s): - only ndarray is accepted as valid input, python
iterables or scalar is not supported - default data type for integer input is
<code>float32</code></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An API standard will specify function presence with signature, and semantics, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=False)</code></li>
<li>Computes the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.</li>
<li>Meaning and detailed behavior of each keyword is explained.</li>
<li>Semantics, including for corner cases (e.g. <code>nan</code>, <code>inf</code>, empty arrays, and
more) are given by a reference test suite.</li>
</ul>
<p>The semantics of a function is a large topic, so the <em>scope</em> of what is
specified must be very clear. For example (this may be specified separately,
as it will be common between many functions):</p>
<ul>
<li>Only array input is in scope, functions may or may not accept lists, tuples
or other object.</li>
<li>Dtypes covered are <code>int32</code>, <code>int64</code>, <code>float16</code>, <code>float32</code>, <code>float64</code>;
extended precision floating point and complex dtypes, datetime and custom
dtypes are out of scope.</li>
<li>Default dtype may be either <code>float32</code> or <code>float64</code>; this is a consistent
library-wide choice (rationale: for deep learning <code>float32</code> is the typical
default, for general numerical computing <code>float64</code> is the default).</li>
<li>Expected results when the input contains <code>nan</code> or <code>inf</code> is in scope,
behavior may vary slightly (e.g. warnings are produced) depending on
implementation details.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Please note: all the above is meant to sketch what an “API standard” means, the concrete signatures, semantics and scope may and likely will change</em>.</p>
<h2 id="approach-to-building-up-the-api-standards">Approach to building up the API standards</h2>
<p>The approach we’re taking includes a combination of design discussions,
requirements engineering and data-driven decision making.</p>
<h3 id="start-from-use-cases-and-requirements">Start from use cases and requirements</h3>
<p>Something that’s often missing when an API of a library grows organically
when many people add features and solve their own issues over a time span of
years is <em>requirements engineering</em>. Meaning: start with a well-defined scope
and use cases, derive requirements from those use cases, and then refer to
those use cases and requirements when making individual technical design
decisions. We aim to take such an approach, to end up with a consistent
design and with good, documented rationales for decisions.</p>
<p>We need to carefully define scope, including both goals and non-goals. For
example, while we aim to make array and dataframe libraries compatible so
consumers of those data structures will be able to support multiple of those
libraries, <em>runtime switching</em> without testing or any changes in the
consuming library is not a goal. A concrete example: we aim to make it
possible for scikit-learn to consume CuPy arrays and JAX and PyTorch tensors
from pure Python code (as a first goal; C/C++/Cython is a harder nut to crack),
but we expect that to require some amount of changes and possibly
special-casing in scikit-learn - because specifying every last implementation
detail scikit-learn may be relying on isn’t feasible.</p>
<h3 id="be-conservative-in-choices-made">Be conservative in choices made</h3>
<p>A standard only has value if it’s adhered to widely. So it has to be both
easy to adopt a standard and sensible/uncontroversial to do so.
This implies that we should only attempt to standardize functionality with which
there is already wide experience, and that all libraries either already have
in some form or can implement with a reasonable amount of effort. Therefore,
there …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
        <p>Yubikeys are great for security, but their benefits decrease somewhat when you leave them in your computer unattended.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I unfortunately have a habit of forgetting my key when I walk away from the computer. I also have login passwords that are way too long and easy to typo.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there’s a way to solve both of these problems: use a Yubikey to unlock your computer when you put it in and lock your computer when you remove it!</p>
<h2 id="prior-art">Prior art<a href="#prior-art" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>The first example I remember seeing of this concept years ago was <a href="https://www.predator-usb.com/predator/en/index.php">Predator</a>, Windows software (with a delightfully retro website) that locks your computer when you remove a special USB drive. Similar examples for Linux include <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/pamusb">pamusb</a>, which allows you to login using Linux’s PAM by inserting a specially-formatted USB stick.</p>
<p>Of course, nowadays most people use Yubikeys to accomplish this, and Yubico has <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-pam/Authentication_Using_Challenge-Response.html">convenient guides</a> on how to accomplish this very task. However, I wanted to make it <em>touchless</em> – that is, I wanted to be able to plug in my Yubikey and instantly unlock my laptop, without clicking through logins or touching the Yubikey button. Upon removal, I wanted to instantly lock my computer.</p>

<p>There are some guides on how to do this online (unlock when you plug in, lock when you remove), but unfortunately most of them fall prey to the problem described in <a href="https://medium.com/@d0znpp/how-to-sacrifice-security-using-a-public-yubikey-linux-guides-c823c4c6e2">this article</a>. A lot of them use udev to detect when the Yubikey is plugged in, but they don’t actually authenticate the key beyond checking its vendor ID, model ID, and sometimes serial number, which all can <a href="https://forums.anandtech.com/threads/changing-creating-a-custom-serial-id-on-a-flash-drive-low-level-blocks.2099116/">easily be faked</a>.</p>
<p>To provide actual security, most official guides use either <code>pam_u2f</code> (which authenticates a Yubikey through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor">U2F protocol</a>) or <code>pam_yubico</code> (which uses either online validation through YubiCloud or offline validation through a challenge-response protocol). The U2F method requires a tap on the Yubikey, while the challenge-response process can be done without user interaction, so I went with the latter. I set up traditional Yubikey authentication using <a href="https://support.system76.com/articles/yubikey-login/">this great guide from System76</a>.</p>
<p>However, I still needed some way to test the challenge-response for success when I plugged in the key. Usually, <code>pam_yubico</code> is run when you login or unlock your computer (i.e. when pressing the enter key on the lockscreen). But I didn’t want <em>any</em> clicks, so I needed a way to run it without interaction.</p>
<p>Enter <code>udev</code> (again) and <code>pamtester</code>!</p>
<p>Here’s the udev rules I included:</p>
<pre><code>kevin@you:~ » cat /etc/udev/rules.d/yubikey.rules
ACTION=="remove", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ENV{PRODUCT}=="1050/407*", RUN+="/usr/local/sbin/ykunlock.sh lock"
ACTION=="add", ENV{DEVTYPE}=="usb_device", ENV{ID_BUS}=="usb", ENV{PRODUCT}=="1050/407*", RUN+="/usr/local/sbin/ykunlock.sh unlock"
</code></pre><p>These rules effectively call a script when inserting and removing the key, so I can trigger any action from the script. Note that the script <strong>should not immediately unlock the computer</strong>, to avoid the security issues mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>To actually test the challenge-response from the Yubikey on inserting, I decided to use <a href="http://pamtester.sourceforge.net/">pamtester</a>, a simple utility that pretends to trigger a PAM authentication from the command line. Since <code>pam_yubico</code> is installed, this will naturally test the challenge-response if a Yubikey is plugged in.</p>
<p>Here’s the final script:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span>exec 1&gt; &gt;<span>(</span>logger -s -t <span>"</span><span>$(</span>basename <span>"</span>$0<span>"</span><span>)</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> 2&gt;&amp;<span>1</span>
echo <span>"RUN"</span>
<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>"</span>$1<span>"</span> <span>=</span> <span>"lock"</span> <span>]</span>; <span>then</span>
        pkill -USR1 swayidle
<span>else</span>
        <span># unlock</span>
        <span>if</span> echo <span>""</span> | pamtester login kevin authenticate; <span>then</span>
                <span># PAM login successful</span>
                <span># kill locker</span>
                kill -KILL <span>$(</span>pgrep swaylock<span>)</span>
                ps aux | grep swaylock
                <span># turn on displays</span>
                SWAYSOCK<span>=</span><span>$(</span>ls /run/user/1000/sway-ipc.*.sock<span>)</span> swaymsg <span>"output * dpms on"</span>
        <span>fi</span>
<span>fi</span>
exit <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>On lock, it immediately locks my desktop (by sending a SIGUSR1 to swayidle, the program that manages locking on the Sway window manager)</li>
<li>On unlock, it first sees if it can authenticate using pamtester without interaction (when no Yubikey is inserted or if the key is invalid, pamtester asks for a password). If it can, it kills the lockscreen and turns on all displays using Sway WM protocols.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final result is amazingly convenient, and has successfully made me remember to pull out my Yubikey when leaving my computer unattended more than once<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>! Mission success.</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I’ve significantly downgraded this statement in severity after some excellent comments on Hacker News have pointed out that (1) <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24192390">stealing a Yubikey is incredibly unlikely unless you’re a person of interest</a>; (2) <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24192138">even if you have the Yubikey, you still can’t directly extract e.g. a private key</a>; and (3) a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24190313">Yubikey protects against SSH/GPG fraud because it can require a PIN and lock out over time</a>. Case in point, Yubikeys are good. I’d argue that it’s still not good to have your key stolen (e.g. perhaps if you’re targeted by a government/<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24194081">industrial espionage</a>, or the malicious significant other attack, where they know your password and can steal your key for 2FA if unattended), but I see that it’s not as much of a risk as I originally thought. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>You might call it Yubikey: Coronavirus Edition. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Yes, yes, I know there’s not too much of a danger because we’re all stuck at home right now. But who knows – maybe this will be helpful when we <em>eventually</em> get back on campus. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

Most notably, the utility section consists of two new features — Model Encryption and Model Deployment.</p><h2 id="1dfe">Core ML Model Deployment</h2><p id="02a3">Until now, updating models in production apps has been a headache. Developers would have to either push new app updates or use on-device training, which is limited to a few neural network layer types only.</p><p id="b985">Luckily, Apple has introduced a new Deployment API that lets us update Core ML models on the fly, independent of app updates. To enable Model Deployment, we need to opt-in to Core ML model archiving (from the utility pane shown above) and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/evolving-your-apps-intelligence-with-core-ml-model-deployment-165579ba0546">perform a few steps in Apple’s model deployment dashboard.</a></p><p id="fc1f">There’s also a new class <code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml/mlmodelcollection?changes=latest_minor&amp;language=objc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLModelCollection</a></code> that lets you access a group of models from Core ML Model Deployment.

To help address this issue, Apple has introduced an optional model encryption feature that lets you secure the model. It works in pretty much the same way as you’d sign applications (using your particular Apple Team ID).</p><p id="fe85">Now you can safely encrypt and bundle your model files, and Core ML will automatically decrypt and load them in your app’s memory.</p><p id="a6b8">The first time you load the model in-app, the decryption key is automatically fetched from the Apple server.</p><h2 id="bf93">A new async load function for Core ML models</h2><p id="6dd3">iOS 14 now brings a new asynchronous <code>load</code> function for initializing Core ML models.

At the same time, Apple also provides MPS (Metal Performance Shaders), designed to run on the GPU. Core ML is simply an abstraction built on top of these frameworks to run inference with an easier-to-use API.</p><p id="3ca7">Alongside the introduction of Core ML in iOS 11, a new MPS graph API (which is used underneath Core ML) was also released. The MPS graph API offered more precision during model training by letting us specify the exact layers and inputs.</p><p id="5142">Now, with iOS 14, we have another new machine learning framework: ML Compute. This one is specifically used for accelerating the training and validation of neural networks by using high-performance BNNs for the <code>Accelerate</code> framework on the CPU, and Metal Performance Shader for the GPU.</p><p id="13f1">It’s important to note that the ML Compute framework’s API isn’t used for building Core ML models and is only introduced for boosting low-level machine learning frameworks.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="5699">The Natural Language and Vision frameworks are built on top of Core ML. The Natural Language framework helps, broadly speaking, in the semantic meaning and understanding of texts.</p><p id="9217">Last year, the framework received a host of new features, such as sentiment analysis, word tagging and embedding, language identification, tokenization, and entity recognition.</p><p id="e452">iOS 14 now introduces sentence embedding. Building accurate on-device FAQs and chatbots would get a whole lot easier with this new technology.</p><p id="b0ee">Analyzing sentences through word embeddings had its own limitations. Simply put, taking the average of vectors of every word could easily lead to loss of the compositional information of the sentence. Also, word embeddings work with only a finite vocabulary set and cannot accurately process semantic meaning when the word in a sentence isn’t present in the lookup table.</p><p id="1cfb">The new Sentence Embedding API helps overcome these shortcomings by letting you analyze an entire sentence. You can encode a complete sentence’s information into a finite-dimensional vector, which can then be compared with other sentences in the vector space to determine similarities and differences.</p><p id="e980">The Natural Language framework is also closely linked with the Create ML framework. This year, Apple has introduced transfer learning for word tagging models by using dynamic embedding. You can specify model parameters in the following way:</p><pre><span id="13fd">let modelParameters = MLWordTagger.ModelParameters(algorithm: .transferLearning(.dynamicEmbedding, revision: 1))</span></pre><p id="d8cc">iOS 14 also provides a new <code>tagHypotheses</code> function that lets you find multiple possible tags for a given word or substring in the text. In doing so, you can now find the confidence threshold of each of the predicted tags.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="c4a4">Apple once again showed its computer vision ambitions during WWDC2020. The Core Image framework was greeted with the addition of a few more built-in filters. <code>CIColorThreshold</code> lets us quickly convert an image to black and white. The new <code>CIColorAbsoluteDifference</code> filter lets us compare color across two images.</p><p id="06fd"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/whats-new-in-the-vision-framework-in-ios-14-73d22a942ba5">Apple’s Vision framework</a>, on the other hand, stole the show from the other AI-based frameworks this year. It received about half a dozen new updates, including support for:</p><ul><li id="c825">Hand and Body Pose Estimation</li><li id="2c7a"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/new-in-ios-14-vision-contour-detection-68fd5849816e">Contour Detection</a></li><li id="6fb6">Optical Flow</li><li id="74a2">Trajectory Detection</li><li id="78ed">Offline Video Processing</li></ul><p id="27de">There’s also a new stateful vision request, which takes into account the previous <code>VNObservation</code> results and is useful in trajectory detection and optical flow requests.</p><p id="976d">For a detailed look at what’s new in Vision framework with iOS 14, check out the article below:</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="c0fb">PencilKit made its debut in iOS 13 and was perceived as a mere drawing framework.</p><p id="8b55">This year, Apple has introduced Scribble for iPadOS — a new built-in, machine learning-powered text field. It automatically detects text written using Apple Pencil and can transcribe it as a string on the fly.</p><p id="ccf9">To enable or disable transcription of handwritten text, we can toggle the <code>UIScribbleInteraction.isHandlingWriting</code> boolean property.</p><p id="e317">With iOS 14, the PencilKit framework does a lot more than just set up the canvas for drawing and painting.</p><p id="22e2">It now provides us with access to the stroke properties of the <code>PKDrawing</code> object. This means we can inspect the current point, path, and speed of a user’s drawing.</p><p id="d24a">In doing so, we can analyze attributes such as force and the time it takes the PencilKit framework to perform gesture recognition and pattern matching from the user’s touch input.</p><p id="44f7">Signature verification, anomaly detection, and shape auto-correction are a few things that you can do in iOS 14 to build AI-powered drawing applications. Additionally, the PencilKit framework can be used in conjunction with ARKit to move objects around in an augmented reality scene.</p><p id="68fc">It’s worth noting that the <code>allowsFingerDrawing</code> property has been deprecated in favor of <code>PKCanvasViewDrawingPolicy</code> — which is an enum of types <code>anyInput</code> and <code>pencilInput</code>.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="3a41">We explored the enhancements introduced across the different AI-based frameworks this year.

<p>In my review of <a href="https://jonathanliu.me/modern-romance-by-aziz-ansari/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Romance</a>, I shared a graph from the Economist that depicts how couples met from 1940 to 2010:</p>



<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/f541ae54c02633b2415f8291a4e6f233df9c2901c0e306ac.png?w=560&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/71022.cdn.cke-cs.com/RructTCFEHceQFc13ldy/images/f541ae54c02633b2415f8291a4e6f233df9c2901c0e306ac.png?w=560&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>A quick glance tells us that the online category ascended sharply throughout the 1990’s and into the 2000’s. Online seemingly stole market share from every other method of meeting potential romantic partners, <em>except the bar/restaurant category</em>. What gives?</p>



<p>A prima facie observation would say that bars and restaurants experienced a resurgence at the turn of the century, causing the online category (in the heterosexual market) to level off. Instead, I suggested:</p>



<blockquote><p>I suspect the uptick in the “Bar/restaurant” category can be explained by couples too embarrassed to admit that they met online.</p></blockquote>



<p>How did I arrive at that conclusion? Through <strong>curiosity</strong>, <strong>imagination</strong>, and <strong>domain-specific experience</strong>.</p>



<h3>Curiosity</h3>



<p>When analyzing data, the first question should be <em>why</em>. Why was meeting online virtually nonexistent until the 1990’s? Why did it become so popular? Why did other categories decline in popularity? Why was the bar/restaurant category an exception?</p>



<p>Begin with the mindset of a child. Children are naturally curious because everything is new. Their minds haven’t calcified with preconceptions yet.</p>



<p>Ask why even when the answer appears obvious. Yes, the obvious answer is usually correct. Meeting online was virtually nonexistent before the 90’s because “online” didn’t exist before then.<sup data-mfn="1">1</sup><span data-mfn="1">Perhaps the 1980’s blip was DoD employees hooking up through ARPANET.</span> It also makes sense that less couples met through other channels if more couples met online.</p>



<p>However, the obvious answer is not always correct. That’s where imagination comes into play.</p>



<h3>Imagination</h3>



<p>Wikipedia defines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagination" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imagination</a> as the “ability to produce and simulate novel objects, peoples and ideas in the mind without any immediate input of the senses”.</p>



<p>We use imagination to run through various “what if” exercises. The first “what if” you should ask is regarding data quality. What if the data is inaccurate? What if there’s no resurgence in the bar dating scene?</p>



<p>Imagination helps you “think outside the box”. A coin that comes up heads a thousand times in a row didn’t invalidate probability theory; it’s likely a loaded or two-headed coin. Don’t be Vizzini:</p>



<blockquote><p>Westley seemingly poisons one of two wine goblets with iocane, and challenges Vizzini to figure out which one is poisoned. Vizzini dies after they both drink, and Westley reveals to Buttercup that Vizzini would have died no matter which goblet he drank from: Westley had successfully built up an immunity to iocane over the last 5 years, so he poisoned both goblets.</p><cite>Princess Bride</cite></blockquote>



<p>Your imagination grows as a function of your general life experience. After all, popular conceptions of alien lifeforms are merely adjustments to known forms, such as additional eyeballs or adding tentacles. The more varied your experiences, the more powerful your imagination.</p>



<p>Your imagination can be exercised. You can <a href="https://jamesaltucher.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-for-becoming-an-idea-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">become an idea machine</a> by coming up with ten new ideas per day. Similarly, you can improve your imagination by using it more often.</p>



<p>Keep improving your imagination and next time you’re an industry analyst pondering why regional sales of Belle &amp; Sebastian’s “The Boy With The Arab Strap” have skyrocketed, you’ll correctly guess that a cute girl used one of the lyrics as her yearbook quote.<sup data-mfn="2">2</sup><span data-mfn="2">Okay, that’s unreasonable.</span></p>

<h3>Domain-Specific Experience</h3>



<p>When it comes to understanding data, nothing beats domain-specific experience. In fact, it’s hard to understand data without it.</p>



<p>But it’s not possible to have sufficient experience in every domain. You would need many lifetimes for that. If you lack the necessary experience in the relevant domain, enlist the help of someone who has it.</p>



<p>In the case of how couples meet, firsthand experience tells me that there hasn’t been a revival in the heterosexual bar dating scene. Someone who’s been married for 20 years might not know that though. They’d have to ask people who are still actively dating. And I’d have to ask gay friends whether such a revival took place in the homosexual dating market.</p>



<p>Knowing that there was no bar scene revival, I thought about why the data might suggest otherwise. It didn’t take long to reach a hypothesis. The data resulted from a survey. People lie on surveys, especially when an incentive exists. Until very recently, online dating carried a social stigma. Thus, the bar/restaurant “uptick” was likely due to embarrassed couples creatively interpreting the definition of “meet”.</p>



<h4>On Compensation</h4>



<p>Let’s look at another chart:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="1674" data-permalink="https://jonathanliu.me/on-how-couples-meet-and-legal-salaries/salariessanslawyers/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/jonathanliu.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/salariessanslawyers.png?fit=575%2C421&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="575,421" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="salariessanslawyers" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/jonathanliu.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/salariessanslawyers.png?fit=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/jonathanliu.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/salariessanslawyers.png?fit=560%2C410&amp;ssl=1" loading="lazy" width="560" height="410" src="https://i2.wp.com/jonathanliu.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/salariessanslawyers.png?resize=560%2C410&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/jonathanliu.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/salariessanslawyers.png?w=575&amp;ssl=1 575w, https://i2.wp.com/jonathanliu.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/salariessanslawyers.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/jonathanliu.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/salariessanslawyers.png?w=575&amp;ssl=1 575w, https://i2.wp.com/jonathanliu.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/salariessanslawyers.png?resize=300%2C220&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/jonathanliu.me/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/salariessanslawyers.png?resize=560%2C410&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>Seems like a positively-skewed distribution with a glaring data error. Why else would there be a large spike at 160K a year? Perhaps a lot of respondents lied, like they might have lied about how they met their significant other. Note the word “reported”. If Family Feud asked “Name something people commonly exaggerate”, salary would be a good guess.</p>



<p>But you might (astutely) observe that more than 18% of respondents could not have independently arrived at 160K a year if they were exaggerating. You’d see variance in the exaggerations.</p>



<p>What if I then told you that the salaries were reported by newly-minted lawyers in 2010? Anyone with domain-specific experience would immediately have a light bulb moment. White shoe law firms all started their entry-level employees at the same 160K salary.<sup data-mfn="3">3</sup><span data-mfn="3">I’m told that the number is 190K in 2020.</span></p>



<p>Sometimes the data is inaccurate, but not always. Stay curious, imaginative, and acquire (a wide network of people with) domain-specific experience.</p>

August 17, 2020 | https://nohq.co/blog/the-best-examples-of-employee-handbooks-for-remote/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nohq.co/blog/the-best-examples-of-employee-handbooks-for-remote/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Employee handbooks are a crucial part of human resources. They show new hires the information they need, can be the go-to place to store new policies in and when made public, are an excellent way to give people a glimpse into your culture. These are our top picks of public employee handbooks.</p>

<h2>GitLab's Collaborative All-Remote Handbook</h2>
<p>Obviously, we have to mention the incredible work that GitLab has been doing on making their <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/">employee handbook</a> open and collaborative. With over <a href="https://nohq.co/sid-sijbrandij-people-dont-want-to-commute-they-ju/">3,000</a> pages and growing, it's the most extensive remote work handbook in the world. The investment into the handbook didn't only pay off in terms of transparency in the human resources department – it's also a marketing feat that promotes GitLab and its work ethic on millions of Google search terms related to remote working. The handbook alone nets the GitLab domain <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/backlinks">millions of backlinks</a>, impressive!</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/Screenshot_2020-08-17_at_12.05.58.png" alt="GitLab Employee Handbook" width="800" height="398"></p>

<p>Marketing aside, the All-Remote Handbook by GitLab has become a remote work encyclopedia. Be it in interviews about GitLab or in any kind of coverage about the remote work movement, there's probably an article or quote in the handbook that can be used as a reference. As a prospective applicant or employee, it's calming to know that all information is stored somewhere in that big compendium.</p>
<p>Not only that, but GitLab's handbook runs on Git through GitLab. That means that any collaborator can take a page out of the handbook, edit it or add a section, open a <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html">Merge Request</a> and get it approved. A big issue with handbooks is that they fall out of date often. If you give moderated access to your over 1,000 employees and keep the handbook as the primary record for information, it's much less likely for that to happen.</p>

<h2>Basecamp's straight-to-the-point handbook on GitHub</h2>
<p>Basecamp's strategy for their <a href="https://basecamp.com/handbook">employee handbook</a> is much more straight to the point. As part of their refreshed handbook experience, they have created a small slideshow that goes over 15 main chapters from their history to their travel guides and moonlighting policy.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/Screenshot_2020-08-17_at_12.58.16.png" alt="Basecamp Employee Handbook" width="800" height="415"></p>

<p>Until a few months ago, this information has also lived primarily on a <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/handbook">Git-powered medium through GitHub</a>. As you can see on the repository, Basecamp's handbook isn't quite as informative and extensive as GitLab's, which also leads to a lot less collaboration. That's fine though – pull requests on Basecamp's handbook usually reflect over-arching changes to a certain policy, such as changes to the profit-sharing program or a change in the requirements for a certain position.</p>
<p>Even if there is a little less content, it makes the utility of Basecamp's handbook no less. It captures the main policies and internal quirks of their culture without filling the handbook up with unnecessary clutter. Also: Basecamp's team is around 20x smaller than GitLab's, so it's no surprise that the handbook is a little lighter too.</p>

<h2>Clef's handbook for inclusion and value-driven culture</h2>
<p>Clef may not exist in its current form anymore, but their universally useful and available <a href="https://github.com/clef/handbook">handbook</a> has sparked interest either way. It reads like a blueprint for future value-driven and people-first companies and therefore is a great starting point for remote companies as well.</p>
<p>The handbook repository of Clef is fully packed with goodies. From their bias-aware compensation structure to and end-to-end onboarding example, it includes countless files that have lived through hundreds of iterations by over 30 contributors, amazing!</p>
<p>Today, almost 3,000 people have marked this repository with a Github star and as companies realize that being "value-driven" is more than just smart marketing, it's probably growing to grow a lot further.</p>
<p>Especially for small companies that may not have too much power to stand out from the crowd, a handbook like this can be your number one funnel to receive interesting and diverse applications.</p>

<h2>Glitch's interactive handbook</h2>
<p>Glitch has a long history and has built their own little nook on the internet since they started in 2000. It's very on-brand therefore that <a href="https://handbook.glitch.me/">their handbook</a> is built entirely on Glitch as well. With that, they are the only handbook in this list that does not rely on the Git protocol. Instead, changes are done through the Glitch editor directly. The handbook can be "remixed" in order to be used for your own company and just like we've seen before, there are multiple chapters that make up the handbook.</p>

<p><img src="https://nohq.co/media/Screenshot_2020-08-17_at_14.27.02.png" alt="Glitch Employee Handbook" width="800" height="418"></p>
<p>Content-wise, the Glitch handbook is similar to the Basecamp one. Policies are strict and to the point and there is not much content to be read about the ins-and-outs of their working structure. That's not a bad thing. A new hire could get through the handbook on their first onboarding day or during a few off-hours throughout their first week.</p>

<h2>Creating a public handbook can help you</h2>
<p>We already mentioned it, but a public employee handbook can be a great window for prospective applicants to get an initial view of how you work. It's clearer what benefits applicants can expect and whether a company will suit them.</p>
<p>With the large pool of hiring companies and the small differences that divide them, making those things available publicly can make you stand out a lot. If you require a specialized expert team, that can be a life-saver, especially if you can't compete on the budgets of FAANG &amp; co.</p>
<p>A public handbook is also a lot of work. Things become inherently easier if the public handbook is the go-to source of your information. That means being more transparent than what you would have hoped for, but also comes with a wide range of amazing benefits, as discussed.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Another week, another SciML release! Yes, this has been a crazy productive summer so thanks to everyone who has been involved. Let's dive in.</p> <h2 id="neuralpdejl_physics-informed_neural_networks_for_automated_pde_solving_and_high_dimensional_pdes"><a href="#neuralpdejl_physics-informed_neural_networks_for_automated_pde_solving_and_high_dimensional_pdes">NeuralPDE.jl: Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Automated PDE Solving and High Dimensional PDEs</a></h2> <p>We have officially released <a href="https://neuralpde.sciml.ai/dev/">NeuralPDE.jl</a>. This is a domain-specific library for gathering all of the neural network based PDE solver methods. Its main focus are on the two big branches of scientific machine learning:</p> <ol> <li><p>Physics-informed neural networsk (PINNs)</p> </li><li><p>Forward-Backwards Stochastic Differential Equations for high dimensional PDEs</p> </li></ol> <p>On the PINN front, the library is all about <strong>automated solution of PDEs</strong> we want users who have no experience in partial differential equations to be able to slap down a symbolic description of the partial differential equation and get a reasonable result without having to know about details like discretization. To see this in action, let's look at solving the 2-dimensional Poisson equation with this library. We start by describing the PDE:</p> <pre><code><span>@parameters</span> x y θ
<span>@variables</span> u(..)
<span>@derivatives</span> Dxx''~x
<span>@derivatives</span> Dyy''~y


eq  = Dxx(u(x,y,θ)) + Dyy(u(x,y,θ)) ~ -sin(<span>pi</span>*x)*sin(<span>pi</span>*y)


bcs = [u(<span>0</span>,y,θ) ~ <span>0.f0</span>, u(<span>1</span>,y,θ) ~ -sin(<span>pi</span>*<span>1</span>)*sin(<span>pi</span>*y),
       u(x,<span>0</span>,θ) ~ <span>0.f0</span>, u(x,<span>1</span>,θ) ~ -sin(<span>pi</span>*x)*sin(<span>pi</span>*<span>1</span>)]

domains = [x ∈ IntervalDomain(<span>0.0</span>,<span>1.0</span>),
           y ∈ IntervalDomain(<span>0.0</span>,<span>1.0</span>)]</code></pre> <p>Here we described the PDE by its Julia code because, why not: it's as informative and refined as mathematical notation itself! Now let's tell the system to discretize and solve this PDE with a neural network:</p> <pre><code>dx = <span>0.1</span> 
discretization = PhysicsInformedNN(dx)


opt = Flux.ADAM(<span>0.02</span>)
dim = <span>2</span> 
chain = FastChain(FastDense(dim,<span>16</span>,Flux.σ),FastDense(<span>16</span>,<span>16</span>,Flux.σ),FastDense(<span>16</span>,<span>1</span>))

pde_system = PDESystem(eq,bcs,domains,[x,y],[u])
prob = discretize(pde_system,discretization)
alg = NNDE(chain,opt,autodiff=<span>false</span>)</code></pre> <p>and then we solve it:</p> <pre><code>phi,res  = solve(prob,alg,verbose=<span>true</span>, maxiters=<span>5000</span>)</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12683885/88482882-cbc00c80-cf6c-11ea-91bb-47a477f38af6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And boom, that's the solution to the PDE. We are continuing to improve this framework, and refactor some of the pieces so that it better connects to more ML and scientific computing library ecosystems, but it's achieving its general goal today so we've decided to release it. Major thanks to @KirillZubov for these developments.</p>
<p>Along with this symbolic form, there are FBSDE methods specifically written for parabolic equations and Kolmogorov backwards equations. This means that high dimensional PDEs that show up in finance, biology, and beyond can now quickly be solved with a neural network. Here's the code to solve a 100 dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for LQG optimal control:</p>

<p>Boom: that's all there is to it. <a href="https://neuralpde.sciml.ai/dev/">Check out the documentation for more details</a>. There's still a lot of active development here so if you're a student who's interested in this topic, please get in touch.</p>
<h2 id="lie_group_integrators_magnus_rungekuttamunthe-kaas_and_crouchgrossman_methods"><a href="#lie_group_integrators_magnus_rungekuttamunthe-kaas_and_crouchgrossman_methods">Lie Group Integrators: Magnus, Runge–Kutta–Munthe-Kaas, and Crouch–Grossman Methods</a></h2>
<p>There are many differential equations which specifically fall under the form of <code>u' = A(t)u</code>, or <code>u' = A(u)u</code>. In these cases, you have geometric properties, like Lie groups, that you can exploit in the solution of the ODE. These Lie group methods are commonly embedded in domain-specific software, usually in robotics, so they are not generally seen except by practitioners of specific scientific areas trying to get the most robust and performant methods in these cases.</p>
<p>Well, SciML wants the most robust and performant methods, so we have now included these methods as part of the standard DifferentialEquations.jl suite thanks to Biswajit Ghosh (@Biswajitghosh98) and <a href="https://mlh.io/">Major League Hacking (MLH)</a>. To use these methods, you have to define your ODE via a DiffEqOperator. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> update_func(A,u,p,t)
    A[<span>1</span>,<span>1</span>] = cos(t)
    A[<span>2</span>,<span>1</span>] = sin(t)
    A[<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>] = -sin(t)
    A[<span>2</span>,<span>2</span>] = cos(t)
<span>end</span>
A = DiffEqArrayOperator(ones(<span>2</span>,<span>2</span>),update_func=update_func)
prob = ODEProblem(A, ones(<span>2</span>), (<span>1.0</span>, <span>6.0</span>))
sol = solve(prob,MagnusGL6(),dt=<span>1</span>/<span>10</span>)</code></pre>
<p>that is a quick and easy way to utilize a 6th order Magnus integrator for the <code>u' = A(t)u</code> equation. We have high order methods and adaptive methods, and these all utilize as much mutation as possible to try and be efficient. There's still some optimization that can be done, but the methods are well-tested for correctness and ready to be used where you see fit!</p>
<h2 id="stochastic_delay_differential_equations_and_stochastic_differential-algebraic_equations"><a href="#stochastic_delay_differential_equations_and_stochastic_differential-algebraic_equations">Stochastic Delay Differential Equations and Stochastic Differential-Algebraic Equations</a></h2>
<p>It's finally here! A lot of people had found <a href="http://real.mtak.hu/106039/1/ENOC_StochasticDelayDIffEq.pdf">our ENOC 2020 paper on StochasticDelayDiffEq.jl</a>, but we had to spend some time getting the library to our continuous integration testing and documentation standard before releasing. Well, now it's finally here. StochasticDelayDiffEq.jl allows for solving stochastic differential equations with delayed components and includes higher order and adaptive integrators. It's built on StochasticDiffEq.jl so the methods that you know and love have been transferred to this new domain. It uses all of the development from DelayDiffEq.jl to give robust SDDE solving. SDDEs are very difficult equations to solve, but we try to make it as efficient as possible. Thanks to everyone who was involved, including Henrik Sykora (@HTSykora), for making this possible. For the reveal, here's an SDDE solved with a Milstein method with adaptive time stepping:</p>

<span>end</span>

prob = SDDEProblem(hayes_modelf, hayes_modelg, [<span>1.</span>], h, tspan, pmul; constant_lags = (pmul[<span>1</span>],));
sol = solve(prob,RKMil())</code></pre>
<p>In this same vein, SDAEs are possible via singular mass matrices. These have proper testing and now have the official release along with documentation in the latest docs.</p>
<p>With these two announcements, note that because the SciML software composes, you can solve SDDAEs. And yes, these are compatible with neural networks and DiffEqFlux. Go have fun.</p>
<h2 id="automated_ensemble_parallelism_and_multiple_gpus_in_diffeqflux"><a href="#automated_ensemble_parallelism_and_multiple_gpus_in_diffeqflux">Automated Ensemble Parallelism and Multiple GPUs in DiffEqFlux</a></h2>
<p>You can now mix ensemble parallelism, and thus multi-GPU computation, with DiffEqFlux and reverse-mode automatic differentiation. An example of the multithreaded computation of an ensemble which is then trained is as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>using</span> OrdinaryDiffEq, DiffEqSensitivity, Flux, Test
pa = [<span>1.0</span>]
u0 = [<span>3.0</span>]

<span>function</span> model2()
  prob = ODEProblem((u, p, t) -&gt; <span>1.01</span>u .* p, u0, (<span>0.0</span>, <span>1.0</span>), pa)

  <span>function</span> prob_func(prob, i, repeat)
    remake(prob, u0 = <span>0.5</span> .+ i/<span>100</span> .* prob.u0)
  <span>end</span>

  ensemble_prob = EnsembleProblem(prob, prob_func = prob_func)
  sim = solve(ensemble_prob, Tsit5(), EnsembleThreads(), saveat = <span>0.1</span>, trajectories = <span>100</span>).u
<span>end</span>
loss() = sum(abs2,[sum(abs2,<span>1.0</span>.-u) <span>for</span> u <span>in</span> model2()])

pa = [<span>1.0</span>]
u0 = [<span>3.0</span>]
opt = ADAM(<span>0.1</span>)
println(<span>"Starting to train"</span>)
l1 = loss()
Flux.<span>@epochs</span> <span>10</span> Flux.train!(loss, params([pa,u0]), data, opt; cb = cb)
l2 = loss()
<span>@test</span> <span>10</span>l2 &lt; l1</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to Utkarsh (@utkarsh530), we now have fast parallelized implicit extrapolation in OrdinaryDiffEq.jl. You'll find these <a href="https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/solvers/ode_solve/#Parallelized-Implicit-Extrapolation-Methods">in the documentation</a> as <code>ImplicitEulerExtrapolation</code>, <code>ImplicitDeuflhardExtrapolation</code>, and <code>ImplicitHairerWannerExtrapolation</code>. For those ODE-inclined, these are pure Julia implementations of SEULEX and SODEX which include automated multithreaded parallelization of the <code>f</code> calls.</p>
<h2 id="new_surrogates_gradient-enhanced_kriging"><a href="#new_surrogates_gradient-enhanced_kriging">New surrogates: Gradient-Enhanced Kriging</a></h2>
<p>Surrogates.jl continues to march forward. If you have not seen the documentation recently, do <a href="https://surrogates.sciml.ai/latest">check it out</a> as it has undergone many major improvements, including showing differences between surrogates on many benchmark problems. One of the latest enhancements is Gradient-Enhanced Kriging, which is an extension to Kriging that can utilize derivative information (from automatic differentiation) to improve the convergence of the surrogate with less samples. Thank Ludovico Bessi (@ludoro) for driving this surrogate project.</p>

<p>The next directions are going to be highly tied to the directions that we are going with the latest Google Summer of Code, so here are a few things to look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Higher efficiency low-storage Runge-Kutta methods with a demonstration of optimality in a large-scale climate model (!!!).</p>

</li><li><p>Continued improvements to parallel and sparse automatic differentiation.</p>

</li><li><p>More SDE solvers and adjoints</p>

</li><li><p>More performance</p>

</li></ul>

<blockquote><p>“He’s perhaps one of two dozen people who knows the name of Iron.”</p><cite>Kvothe, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2Y6Te0T" target="_blank">Name of the Wind</a>, The Kingkiller Chronicles</cite></blockquote>



<p>Names have power. Patrick Rothfuss adeptly harnesses this truth in his excellent novel series The Kingkiller Chronicles. In the word of Temerant, knowing the true name of an element such an Iron or Wind gives someone supernatural control of it.</p>



<p>The power of names is demonstrated through a simple photograph of place signs. Each of the words on the wall above conjures a feeling of excitement, or curiosity, or perhaps a distant memory, fleeting and poignant.</p>



<p>What we choose to call events, concepts and people measurably changes our view of them. The names we given ourselves quietly in our hearts have enormous influence over our mental state.</p>



<p>Astonishingly, recent research has discovered that we even <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-pspa0000076.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look like our given names</a>. Researchers have shown that people and computers can infer our name by looking at our face, an effect demonstrable beyond socioeconomic cues. Therefore, our facial appearance represents social expectations of how a person with a specific name should look.</p>



<h2>The importance of naming for clean code</h2>



<p>This a significant realisation for our mental health and well-being, but how does it fit with delivering clean code faster?</p>



<p>Names communicate. They have the power to tell others what a thing is and does. That reduces friction in our development teams, and allows us to understand code faster and deliver more quickly.</p>



<p>Why should we expend so much effort to get them right? Because the name of a concept gives us insight into how it fits into the system we are designing. Conversely, if we’re not careful with naming, we’ll be producing <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/W/write-only-code.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write-only code</a> which drifts apart from the whole, lost and destined for eventual deletion.</p>



<p>Here are some principles you can use to help you choose the best names and produce clean code with less effort. We’ll start with the nuts and bolt of naming code, then move to how to determine meaningful names in conjunction with our customers.</p>



<h2>Intentionally move through the four stages of naming</h2>



<blockquote><p><em>There are two hard problems in computer science: Cache invalidation, naming things, and off by one errors.”</em></p><cite><a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Fowler</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>How should we pay attention to names as we get started with coding something new? J.B. Rainsberger&nbsp;<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.jbrains.ca/permalink/the-four-elements-of-simple-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talks about</a>&nbsp;names of classes, methods and variables going through four stages towards clean code:</p>



<ul><li><em>Nonsense:</em>&nbsp;For example, we might extract a method from a larger one and quickly rename it&nbsp;<code>somethingWhatever()</code>&nbsp;to get the refactor done and the tests passing.</li><li><em>Accurate:</em>&nbsp;We rename the nonsense method to what it actually does, such as&nbsp;<code>processPayroll()</code>.</li><li><em>Precise:</em>&nbsp;Once we realise what the method really does, we might refine the accurate name and give it more precision, such as&nbsp;<code>loopThroughEmployeesAndPayThem()</code>.</li><li><em>Meaningful:</em>&nbsp;At this point, we’ve revealed the complexity of the method, and can look to split it up into two methods:&nbsp;<code>forEachEmployee()</code>&nbsp;and perhaps a&nbsp;<code>payWages()</code>&nbsp;method on a separate interface.</li></ul>



<h2>Don’t be afraid of nonsense or longer names</h2>



<p>We shouldn’t shy away from the early stages of naming. If we’re not sure what something is yet, give it a nonsense name. The name&nbsp;<code>foo()</code>&nbsp;is fine, as long as it’s only going to last fifteen minutes.</p>



<p>It doesn’t belong in a commit, and it’s not clean code, but it’s a start. It gets our code moving so we can begin to see how our concepts fit together.</p>



<p>As you progress, some concepts or ideas will outgrow your abstractions. They become ripe for future refactoring. If in doubt as to what or where something fits, use a long name: the longer and more precise the better. I will call a variable something like <code>computed_unsorted_project_task_matrix</code>&nbsp;if I don’t like it and want to refactor it at some point.</p>



<p>This is much more intention revealing than&nbsp;<code>result</code>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<code>res</code>,&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>r</code>). I reveal the complexity of the object through the name, which helps reveal complexity in the code.</p>



<h2>Characters are cheap</h2>



<p>Let’s not make things harder for the programmers who come after us. Remember, this is just as likely to be ourselves in a few months. Let’s avoid using a name like&nbsp;<code>p</code>&nbsp;when&nbsp;<code>project</code>&nbsp;is only a few characters more.</p>



<p>Anything that reduces reading friction in our code is a good thing.</p>



<p>This isn’t fashionable amongst developers in certain languages communities like Clojure or Haskell. They prefer brevity in variable names, relying on convention for understanding. For example, <code>k</code> and <code>v</code> often refer to <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> in a Clojure Map.</p>



<p>The important thing is to reduce friction in the team. If your team are used to these variables, it’ll be quick to understand: for them, it’ll be clean code. However, this will increase the barrier to other team members. In general I prefer longer more meaningful names to this. I don’t think it’s worth sacrificing the team’s understanding for the sake of a few characters. If names are becoming so cumbersome their length is reducing clarity, this shows the need for a refactor.</p>



<h2>Name concepts for your customer, not yourself</h2>



<p>Along the steps we take through to making names more precise and meaningful, how do we choose what words to use for the concepts we’re dealing with? We name these concepts through continual conversations with customers.</p>



<p>Ubiquitous language is an excellent concept and tool that Eric Evans introduced years ago in the book <a href="https://amzn.to/3ftKZBF">Domain Driven Design</a>. Every coder would do well to read at least the first half of this book. The idea is often taught within a Behaviour Driven Development context, but it is logically independent. Any agile team can work towards a Ubiquitous Language.</p>



<p>The central idea is that there are two languages that we can use to talk about a concept: the “problem” language or the “solution” language. The problem language is the language of the customer. For example, a payroll system might use concepts like <em>wages, salary, PAYE, tax, paying.</em> The solution language is the language of developmers. For example we might use the following names for the code that runs the payroll system: <em>button, element, value, collection, style, parent-child, container, object.</em></p>



<p>The solution language is where many programmers naturally live, think and speak. It’s easy for us to operate with these kinds of concepts. The trouble is, they’re often alien for our customer. Instead of lazily reaching for <code>parent</code>–<code>child</code> (or the more problematic <code>master</code>–<code>slave</code> vernacular) when describing a concept, let’s instead collaborate with our customers on a shared language that works well for everyone. Perhaps we <em>add an employee to a tax band</em> rather than <em>insert a user into a collection</em>, both <a href="https://deliverydoubled.com/deliver-faster-boost-teamwork-a-simple-guide-to-development-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when discussing the next feature</a>, and when we’re writing the code itself.</p>



<h2>Intentional conversations reduce confusion and produce clean code</h2>



<p>It’s common for teams to have to deal with concepts and words that overlap and interact with each other. Single concepts are called different things by different people on the team. Different groups of people within an organisation use the same word for wholly different ideas.</p>



<p>It’s such a universal problem people often don’t pay attention to it. However confusion and cognitive load will build up and cause communication problems over time.</p>



<p>It’s also fairly easy to solve this problem through having quick, regular, intentional conversations.</p>



<p>Next time you’re discussing a concept with your team that’s poorly named, speak up. Ask whether there’s another name for the concept that could reduce confusion. Try a few different words or phrases out with the team until you settle on the right thing. This might mean inventing entirely new words or concepts that fit well with everyone in the team. That’s ok, as long as it makes our language more precise.</p>



<p>Once a word has been decided on, commit to using it everywhere from now on. Deliberately take the time to update the names in the code to match.</p>



<p>Perhaps you could volunteer to maintain a glossary of words so that everyone feels the benefit. Newer team members are often great people to keep an eye on these documents, and update them whenever they encounter errors.</p>



<p>There’s always going to be a barrier for incoming team members new to our code and our concepts. If we’re having these intentional conversations, we’re helping newer people by creating a smaller set of names for them to learn.</p>



<hr>



<p>Names have power. They can drive insight and influence communication. Let’s intentionally practice our naming as a team, so that everyone has a say about the language and terminology we use. Let’s build those names right into our codebases, moving through the stages towards the team’s language as the code becomes clearer. This will harmonise the team’s work, make for cleaner code, and puts the team on the right track to improving their delivery times.</p>

<p>Be honest with yourself: after your last standup ended, if you were asked to repeat back what each person did in the last 24 hours and was planning to do in the next 24 hours, how would you do? I think most people would be lucky to get a 25% on that test.</p>



<p>Standup meetings are supposed to be for the team to move the sprint forward, but they’re often just a status update for the PM or Scrum Master, because everyone else recites their status and then zones out the rest of the time. </p>



<p>If that sounds painfully familiar, then I have a suggestion. Walk the board. Instead of going person by person, go ticket by ticket. Make sure to start on the right side of the board, because the work that is closest to done should be the focus in order to limit work in progress. For each ticket, ask the current assignee what’s next, and if there are any blockers.</p>



<p>It’s that simple, but it works like magic for creating engaged, valuable standups. Here’s why:</p>



<ol><li><em>Walking the board</em> <em>makes it impossible for people to just say their part and then zone out</em>, since each person has to talk multiple times because they’re involved in multiple tickets (one in progress, a couple in QA, one in code review, etc.). People are more likely to hear and understand what others are working on since they’re actually paying attention.</li><li><em>Walking the board</em> <em>focuses the conversation on what will move the sprint forward</em>, which is the whole point of the daily standup. You only talk about what’s on the board. In a traditional standup, when people are saying what they worked on yesterday, they often start talking about stuff they did that isn’t related to the current sprint at all, like planning the next sprint, or going to a doctor’s appointment, or getting pulled into a different project for support. None of that stuff is relevant to the point of standup.</li><li><em>Walking the board</em> <em>makes it impossible for tickets to linger in a status</em> for days or weeks. Traditional standups make that too easy, because a ticket doesn’t get brought up at all unless it got worked on yesterday or someone is already planning to work on it today. Walking the board makes it painfully obvious when a ticket isn’t moving.</li></ol>



<p>I also suggest rotating the facilitator regularly, perhaps weekly, to ensure that people aren’t just falling into to the habit of reporting to the leader instead of having a conversation.</p>



<p><em>But what about general announcements the team needs to hear?</em> After you walk the board, ask “any general things we need to discuss?” and let people speak up.</p>



<p><em>But what if the work I’m doing to move the sprint forward isn’t on the board? </em>Then either put it on the board or quit pretending that it’s moving the sprint forward.</p>



<p>Try it out and <a href="https://twitter.com/home">tweet at me if you do</a>!</p>

<p>In the last decade, Microsoft has introduced and subsequently scaled back a number of iterations of their Windows operating mobile phone with little success in the consumer market. Most recently they have announced the release of the Surface Duo, an Android-powered mobile device, as part of the Surface series. The phone is a hinged, foldable device with two distinct screens for the user to interface with – each 5.6 inches large. Microsoft primarily focuses on the value of the dual-screen as the ability to easily multitask and expand the field of vision within an application. Microsoft has long held that users multi-task differently when they can organize their workspace across two screens. As with all its previous models, Microsoft once again leans into the capacity of the phone to function as a productive space. The question is whether the Surface Duo and its foldable function will succeed where its predecessors have failed to provide Microsoft with meaningful reach into the consumer mobile market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two elements that primarily define our smartphone experience:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Function:</strong> Smartphones introduced <em>mobile</em> access to the internet and provided a portal for the browser-like experience on the mobile. This made the transition from the prior models of phones to the smartphone an easy leap – access to the internet enhanced connectivity, the core function of mobile phones.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Form:</strong> The form of smartphones followed the dictates of its functionality, that of a more compact portal for the browser-like experience. This meant while the screen had to be maximized (introducing touchscreens, removing bezels etc.), the phone remained compact enough to be portable.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Since the introduction of the smartphone, phone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung have been competing on improving the form and function to provide users with a better experience and capture market share. Form side developments have largely been limited to incremental changes like the removal of bezels for larger screen size or slimmer designs as a result of battery innovations. The Microsoft Surface Duo and Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold introduce a double, merge-able screen, perhaps the most dramatic shift of form (within one iteration) over the last decade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a way to analyse this deviation in form, the foldable aspect, in a model comparing the motivation for consumers to adopt such a design and the convenience afforded to consumers by such a design.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this context:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Motivation</strong> can be defined as the consumer’s drive to make a purchase decision based on a specific form/function feature of the mobile&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Convenience</strong> can be defined as the enhancement of the ubiquitous mobile experience, where the product taps into the already ingrained consumer habits in both function and form</li></ul>



<p>When design is motivation driven, it is better able to target smaller, more niche groups who desire a certain form or function feature. On the other hand, convenience driven design is able to effectively cater to the masses who share a mutual desire for a convenient, ubiquitous experience. Microsoft’s Surface Duo appears more motivation driven in design – the motivation here being productivity and functional two screen use. </p>



<p>The Surface Duo is a hinged, full rotation device that can be dual-screen or single screen use, depending on the user’s preference. The hurdle, however, is much like the flip phones of the past, the device needs to be “opened” in order to be accessed – with no front-facing screen for interfacing. Despite the trivial nature of an additional opening action, this step represents a greater inconvenience in the flow of the user’s experience. This is especially true when compared to the forms and functions of today, wherein the screen is immediately available and always accessible (e.g. simply lifting the phone towards yourself activates the screen). This is not to mention that the dual screens are in fact distinct screens, separated by a break line down the center – this caters more to a dual-screen experience rather than the single screen experience we are used to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Comparatively, the latest Samsung foldable device – the Galaxy Z Fold 2 – maintains a single-screen experience. This applies both to its front-facing interface, as well as its fold out, seamless screen (no break line). Where the optimal form of current mobile devices is a maximised screen size that does not compromise compact portability, the Galaxy Z Fold 2’s smaller front screen and larger merged screens do not compromise the experience available in the current models. In fact, the fold out single screen enhances certain functions that might have comparatively been compromised when moving from larger devices to mobile, such as video playback or gaming. Ideally, Samsung has attempted to maintain the convenience of single screen models (the front-facing screen), with the fold out further enhancing certain functionalities.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img src="https://4thquadrant.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Diagram_SurfaceDuo.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://4thquadrant.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Diagram_SurfaceDuo.jpg 680w, https://4thquadrant.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Diagram_SurfaceDuo-300x132.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"><figcaption>The ‘form’ of the Surface Duo fold out screen experience – as a comparison to its contemporaries. Image not to scale.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So then why is Microsoft deviating from the ubiquitous form of current devices to distinct dual-screen experience? This is because Microsoft is driven by the theme of its Surface series, one that is focused on productivity and effective workspaces. Where Samsung has created an iteration of its mobile phone products, preserving the experience, simply with a larger screen, Microsoft has adapted its tablet model into a mobile phone. This is where a distinction forms in the ability of Samsung and Microsoft to service convenience, Microsoft aligning more heavily with motivation as mentioned earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In previous iterations of Microsoft’s mobile products, the point of differentiation was the Windows Mobile OS. Microsoft deployed its native operating system rather than leaning into the open source Android OS that was more accessible, familiar and convenient (Play Store) to mass consumers at the time. Surface Duo, while having switched to the Android OS, has been deliberately designed for productive functionality – dual screens being the derivative form. Here Microsoft deviates from what is the ubiquitous and most accessible form for a more general consumer base, likely leading the Surface Duo along a similar trajectory to its previous iterations – capturing a niche rather than converting the masses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the introduction of the foldable phone screen has had a rocky start with several models dismissed as being gimmicky or irrelevant to the mobile experience, it appears that the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 may find a degree of adoption. It may not be too long before the fold-out larger screen format becomes the ubiquitous mobile experience. It then becomes likely that the ‘form’ of the larger screen could usher in an evolution of the ‘function’ of mobile phones – adapting to productivity/workspace use cases with greater ease. At that point, Microsoft’s productivity focused mobile might find success with a mass consumer base more easily.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. Our addiction to our mobile phones dictates ‘form’</h3>



<p>“If you’ve ever misplaced your phone, you may have experienced a mild state of panic until it’s been found. About 73% of people claim to experience this unique flavor of anxiety, which makes sense when you consider that adults in the US spend an average of 2-4 hours per day tapping, typing, and swiping on their devices—that adds up to over 2,600 daily touches. …</p>



<p>…While there is nothing inherently addictive about smartphones themselves, the true drivers of our attachments to these devices are the hyper-social environments they provide. Thanks to the likes of Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, and others, smartphones allow us to carry immense social environments in our pockets through every waking moment of our lives. “</p>



<p>Mobile phones are in a way, a method of chasing dopamine triggers if we look at what the most widely used applications are throughout the world, social media and their notifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How do social media apps take advantage of this dopamine-driven learning strategy? Similar to slot machines, many apps implement a reward pattern optimized to keep you engaged as much as possible.”</p>



<p>If we simplify the use of the mobile phone for the vast majority, we can simplify the function of the phone as dopamine triggers. The form then follows the function, a direct and accessible screen that is immediately available to us and a blinking light indicating awaiting notifications. In this sense, the Microsoft Surface Duo which leans into productivity for its design, neglects to address dopamine triggers as a core use case. To a user, the requirement to open the device which lacks a front-facing screen, is moments of delay to achieve a necessary task. Further, a foldable device isn’t as convenient as a flip phone, the action of a flip being far smoother a transition than having to put some level of care into the opening of the Surface Duo. Then, adding an inconvenience, whilst seconds long, would appear unbearable in comparison to alternatives available.</p>

<h3>2. Consumer behaviour in a world of limitless online and offline options</h3>



<p>A Think Google study assessed consumer behaviour and decisions in a world enabled by smartphones to better understand how consumers make choices both online and offline.</p>



<p>“By examining all of these needs, we learned how consumers choose – both online and offline – to navigate their I-want-to-know, I-want-to-go, I-want-to-do and I-want-to-buy moments.”</p>



<p>The study discovered three primary consumer behaviours across the spectrum of “I-want” needs and these results are strongly indicative of the holistic …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Testing is an essential part of web application development. No website is ready for deployment until testing is done. In my opinion, every web application requires testing irrespective of what technologies are used in it.</p>



<p>There are different types and methods for testing web applications. Many open-source developers have already combined these testing methods into reusable libraries.</p>



<p>There are several <strong>React testing libraries</strong> for quickly testing a React web application. Each of them has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>



<p>In this article, we will discuss what are the <em><strong>best React testing libraries</strong></em> for your specific project.</p>



<h2>Jest</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="336" src="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jest_700.jpg" alt="Jest" srcset="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jest_700.jpg 700w, https://www.edopedia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jest_700-300x144.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-srcset="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jest_700.jpg 700w, https://www.edopedia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jest_700-300x144.jpg 300w" data-src="https://www.edopedia.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/jest_700.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p><strong>Jest</strong> is a React testing library and considered one of the best by many developers. It is created and maintained by Facebook. Along with React, it can also work with TypeScript, Node.js, Angular, and Vue.js.</p>



<p>Apart from Facebook, Jest is also used at Airbnb, Uber, Instagram, Revolut, and many more. The React community consider Jest as the first choice for React unit testing.</p>



<p>Jest is simple to use. It is available in Node Package Manager (NPM), and it requires little configuration. If a person has experience in JavaScript, it won’t be difficult to write tests in Jest.</p>



<h3>Pros:</h3>



<ul><li>Jest is open-source.</li><li>It supports parallel testing.</li><li>Mock by default in Jest makes the testing easy and simple.</li><li>Jest is also applicable for testing React native applications.</li><li>It is fast and also supports promises.</li><li>DOM testing can also be done in Jest because it can bundle with JSDOM.</li><li>It has great documentation.</li></ul>



<h3>Cons:</h3>



<ul><li>It is difficult to run a single test.</li><li>There are multiple error messages for a single error.</li></ul>



<p>At GitHub, Jest has over thirty-one thousand stars, making it the most popular React testing library in this list.</p>

<h2>Final verdict</h2>



<p>There are several <strong>React testing libraries</strong>. Each of them has its own features, pros, and cons. Some of these can be classified as libraries or frameworks while some are just utilities that are used effectively with these libraries and frameworks.</p>



<p>Jest is one of the most popular React testing library. It is frequently used with Enzyme for better results and experience. Mocha and Jasmine are other popular React testing frameworks that are used with Enzyme.</p>



<p>Cypress and Chai are new React testing libraries that are still gaining popularity. They might not have large communities but still they have many features that can be combined with other libraries and frameworks to test React components.</p>



<p>Choosing a React testing library can be a pain because there are too many. In this article, I listed some of the <strong>best React testing libraries</strong> with their pros, cons, and popularity stats.</p>



<p>Now its your turn to choose the one which suits your specific requirements.</p>

<blockquote><p>“We believe that the primary listening experience is passive, for most people, meaning 90 percent of the time you just want to listen to music you like,” said Chopra. “It’s not about picking songs you like and building playlists.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://musically.com/2018/03/15/talking-points-spotify-investor-day/">Gustav Söderström</a>, Chief R&amp;D Officer of Spotify, also by MusicAlly:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Today we have over 200 petabytes of music data,” said Soderstrom. “We believe that with our larger user base and our higher user engagement, the distance to the competition is actually only increasing… Already today, we have more than five times the amount of music data that our nearest competitor does.”</p>
<p>He even compared music-streaming to the world of self-driving cars, where the more vehicles a company (like Google, or Uber) has out on the roads generating data, the better its chances of success in the long-term.</p>
<p>“We have by far the most cars on the road in terms of users, but importantly they’re also driving more hours a day than anyone else, so more miles. And we’re putting more cars on the road every day, because of our free tier… This is self-driving music!”</p></blockquote>
<p>For all the success that streaming services have been having in making algorithmic, editorial and algotorial recommendations, I personally believe that they are neglecting the development of tools better suited to more advanced users.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To use concrete <a href="https://streamingmachinery.com/2020/07/12/the-9000-song-long-playlist-there-must-be-a-better-way/">examples</a>, these tools could serve to allow the user to easily listen through the content of a book like “1001 Albums to Listen Before you Die”. Or to explore one or more lists of the best albums of any given year. Or<span>&nbsp; </span>offer some slightly more robust “queue” tools to plan for an upcoming party or car trip. Or a better way to collect, group and go thru all songs that are recommended to them on social networks and newsletters.</p>
<p>As I detailed in the previous link about “1001 Albums”, on a most basic level one tool could be a “bookmark” to let you know where you stopped on a playlist. Or tick marks to know which songs from it you have listened. But on a larger sense this tool is about embracing new concepts, like<span>&nbsp; </span>‘anthologies’<span>&nbsp; </span>and integrating them on the service in a practical way.</p>
<p>I sense an opportunity here. The number of “power users” who would value these kind of features maybe small, but 1% of a few hundred million people is still a few million people. They may even be more valuable than average users.</p>
<p>Platforms mature and so the users. Perhaps after a few years of using the app, perhaps an increasing number of average users will be increasingly ready to use such tools.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>And then there are second order effects. Who knows how these tools will look like a few years down the R&amp;D road?<span>&nbsp; </span>What new use cases and possibilites will they allow? How much of the tools will trickle-down to new features that every grandma will depend on daily?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Finally, I suspect that the real number of active listeners are being severely undercounted. What if a majority of the very average users are in fact power users some part of the time?</p>
<p>Maybe the need for such tools of music exploration and organisation would arise only once a month or a year, but that would be a huge amount of use too.</p>
<p>Because the truth is that many people <a href="https://streamingmachinery.com/2020/06/23/the-sound-of-music/">care</a> a lot about music, even if they don’t admit so. How common are such habits as reading album reviews and popstar profiles, attending music shows, wearing band t-shirts, even watching two hour music documentaries?<span>&nbsp; </span>These are all ways of actively engaging with music. Heck, how many copies of “1001 Albums to Hear Before You Die” have been sold and read over the decades?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Maybe the demand for the tools is there, widespread but latent.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>I’ve played with my fair share of project management and issue tracker tools. Their claim to make our team more productive drew me in, only to leave me disappointed and frustrated.</p><p>I’ve written about <a href="https://zepel.io/blog/how-issue-tracking-hurts-development/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=product-development-problems">how issue tracking software hurts your product development </a>before. Today, I’d like to show you three problems your team is likely going through because of it.</p><p>And the worst part is, you probably don’t know about it!</p><hr><h3 id="problem-1-false-indicator-of-productivity-is-visualized">Problem 1: False indicator of productivity is visualized</h3><p>It’s easy for teams to look at graphs and think they’re being productive. While the reports may indicate that the team is shipping plenty of features / enhancements / bug fixes, it can never tell you is if those things moved the needle.</p><p>By introducing any form of metrics that focus on productivity, you influence the behaviour of the people contributing to them.</p><ul><li>Developers may cut corners to "<em>get it done</em>”.</li><li>Tests and code reviews may get skipped.</li><li>Instead of finding the root cause of the bug and fixing it, your team might just throw a series of <code>if</code> statements to fix it.</li></ul><p>Of course, before it’s deployed to production a product person will look at it. If they aren’t technically sound or don’t obsess over edge cases, a lot of the corner cuttings will get deployed to production.</p><p>This is snowballs into a series of poor experience for the customer and unnecessary bugs that could’ve been avoided.</p><hr><h3 id="problem-2-disconnected-view-of-what-needs-to-be-built">Problem 2: Disconnected view of what needs to be built</h3><p>Developers get only a fraction of the information they need to build good software.</p><p>They’re told “<em>Hey we need to build feature X. It will help our customers achieve Y. And we need to ship it within Z date.</em>”</p><p>Tickets are created and assigned with the assumption that it has enough detailed information that developers need to know. In reality, there are so many other things that get missed out when you think in tickets/issues.</p><p><strong>This is where the problem starts:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Key interactions are missed</strong> because the path to achieving a benefit from software is never linear. This is rarely communicated explicitly. <br></li><li><strong>Hidden capabilities are added</strong> to the feature because it was assumed to be "<em>cool</em>". Teams never communicate what a feature must not do. And this is more important than what it must do. </li><li><strong>Edge cases are never thought through or talked about</strong>. Sometimes, it’s the developers who bring it up. And that’s okay. Because some things are unearthed only during the creative exploration that a developer undergoes while they build it. However, most of the times, even the simplest of cases fall through the cracks.</li></ul><blockquote>Any developer who’s tried to build even a small chrome extension knows that building software includes ambiguities, uncertainties, intertwined relationships.</blockquote><hr><h3 id="problem-3-sequential-issue-driven-development">Problem 3: Sequential, issue-driven development</h3><p>Issue driven development leads to nothing but issue swamp. It gets messy very quickly as developers independently work on each issue sequentially. More code gets piled on as required and getting it to a production-ready state becomes a nightmare.</p><p>This also leads to a narrowed focus on the issue instead of the bigger goal of building a quality feature.</p><p><strong>Let me explain with an example.</strong></p><p>The customer requests for the ability to view a series of images in a grid view. An issue titled “<em>Get a series of images and display them in a grid</em>” is added. This is then broken down to actionable steps. A front-end and a back-end developer picks it up and together they build it out.</p><p><em>Side note: When your customers ask for a "feature", why do you call it an "issue"?</em></p><p>At a surface level, the feature might look completed. However, a series of issues come up that diminish the perceived quality of the feature:</p><ul><li>Some images look good, while many look pixelated.</li><li>Images don’t have captions. Nor do I have the ability to add a caption to the entire grid.</li><li>The page takes ages to load because of the images.</li><li>How many images should you load at a time?</li><li>Should the images be interactive?</li></ul><p>As you can see, what looks like a simple ticket has a bucket load of questions that need to be answered and functionalities that need to be built.</p><blockquote>The problem with issue driven development is, it quickly shifts the mentality from “Let’s solve this problem” to “What next?”</blockquote><p>As a result of “<em>What next?</em>” mentality, a simple sorting of an object will get implemented using the easiest method. While it might not be the wrong method, it’ll make it exponentially harder for others to debug or understand the code. Cross-pollination or exchange of ideas about the problem rarely occurs. And makes it impossible for teams to communicate the essential details required to build the product.</p><p><strong>These product development problems come from a deep need to satisfy a metric or to show productivity. They pigeon-hole developers to ticket-movers and do not enable them to think at a system level.</strong> </p><p>It ties back to the previous point I made on how teams begin to visualize false-positives.</p><hr><h2 id="so-how-can-you-fix-these-product-development-problems">So, how can you fix these product development problems?</h2><h3 id="understand-the-difference-between-issue-tracking-vs-product-development">Understand the difference between issue tracking vs product development</h3><p>The road to shipping anything that isn’t a bug is filled with speed bumps and diversions. Product development is never as simple as <em>“do X, Y, and Z, and voila!</em>”</p><p>A feature, unlike a bug, goes through a series of exploration. Many functionalities are an implicit necessity. This implicit requirement can never be communicated in a single ticket.</p><p>While a bug, on the other hand, is a lot easier to communicate. All you need are three things:</p><ol><li>Steps to reproduce,</li><li>What you expected to see, and</li><li>What you saw instead.</li></ol><p>Even for something like a bug, that requires only three specific details, the developer will still have to go through an exploration phase to identify the root cause.</p><p>If a bug, that has all the details specified accurately, has to go through an exploration phase, imagine how much more complex it is to build a feature that has an arbitrarily broad spectrum of scale and detail.</p><blockquote>It’s those chock full of implicit requirements that get missed out in a ticket that makes a developer mad and frustrated.</blockquote><p>The next time you ask your developers to build a feature, don’t try to squeeze it all in a two-line ticket. It never works. Instead, spec each interaction and functionality of your feature into separate user stories. That way, you can zoom-in to track each work item and zoom-out to track an entire feature.</p><p><em>Pssst... Thousands of customers build better software with this method using <a href="https://zepel.io/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=product-development-problems">Zepel</a>. Don't take my word for it. <a href="https://zepel.io/customer-reviews/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=product-development-problems">Read it in their own words!</a></em></p><h3 id="negotiate-the-outcome-vs-duration">Negotiate the outcome vs duration</h3><p>“<em>But the product manager wants the feature shipped by next week!</em>”</p><p>Of course, it’s important to not take a year to build a feature. However, teams obsess too much on the deadlines and turn “<em>time taken to build and ship</em>” into a metric.</p><p>This doesn’t happen explicitly. But even the slightest of hints reduces your team’s functional standards to “<em>It runs, let’s deploy.</em>” The quality of the code (and sometimes even the feature’s standards) becomes an afterthought. What you’ll get is a hodgepodge of enough code to get a working product that will eventually fall apart.</p><p>When teams negotiate on what can be built within a timeframe, it pushes the product person to think deeper about what’s <em>really</em> needed. Your customer might have requested guest access with fine-tuned rights. But if it’s going to take three weeks to implement, it might be more sensible to <em><strong>buy</strong></em> time by implementing view-only mode and then iterating on it.</p><p>Sometimes, what a product manager wants isn’t feasible in a given time-frame. The solution to it isn’t to get your team to pull all-nighters. It’s to work together to find a solution that meets the customer’s requirements. If not fully, at least in partial.</p><p><strong>Because sometimes all a customer wants is to feel heard.</strong></p><hr><p>If you liked what you read, I think you’ll love what the project management tool we're building for software product teams.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new study has found that 13% of people think of themselves as pathological liars, or say that others consider them to be pathological liars. Those 13% reported telling about 10 lies per day.</p><p>The study, published in the journal <a href="https://prcp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.prcp.20190046#.XvDDrEQ2jzE%20">Psychiatric Research and Clinical Practice</a>,&nbsp;included 623 people. The researchers recruited them in 2019 from various mental health forums, social media, and a university.</p><p>The participants spanned a range of ages, ethnicities, education levels, and income levels. The researchers asked them whether they thought of themselves as pathological liars, or if others thought of them that way. The respondents also took a lie frequency assessment and other questionnaires.</p><h2>Greater distress and impaired functioning</h2><p>The study found the pathological liars were more likely to experience distress and impaired functioning, especially in social relationships. This diminished functioning also applied to legal contexts, work, and finances. Their distress often had to do with worries about whether their lies would be be discovered.</p><p>The pathological liars in the group also reported telling lies for no specific reason, and said many of their lies grew out of an initial lie.</p><p>The majority of participants in the pathological liars group indicated that their problematic lying began during adolescence. People in this group were also more likely to say their lying was out of their control, indicating a kind of compulsiveness. Likewise, people in this group said they felt less anxious after lying.</p><h2>From <em>pseudologia phantastica</em> to pathological liars</h2><p>The phenomenon of the “pathological liar” was first recorded in 1891 by psychiatrist <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/pathologische-L%C3%BCge-psychisch-abnormen-Schwindler/dp/3226034618/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;qid=1594994372&amp;refinements=p_27%3AAnton+Delbr%C3%BCck&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anton Delbr?ck</a>. He initially called it <em>pseudologia phantastica</em>, and used the term to describe people who told so many outrageous lies that their behavior could be considered pathological.</p><p>Since then, research into pathological lying has been surprisingly scant. One <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1988.tb05068.x">analysis</a> of prior case studies found <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_lying" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pathological lying</a> equally represented among men and women, with the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://psychnewsdaily.com/category/iq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IQs</a> of the liars in the average to above average range.</p><h2>Formal recognition</h2><p>Pathological lying has not (yet) been classified as a diagnostic entity in either the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DSM-5</a> or the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICD-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ICD-10</a>, but the researchers behind the present study are hoping to change that. As they write, “we suggest that PL should be defined as a persistent, pervasive, and often compulsive pattern of excessive lying behavior that leads to clinically significant impairment of functioning in social, occupational, or other areas.”</p><p>Pathological lying also causes distress, they say, and poses a risk to the self or others; an example of this risk is if a pathological liar conceals the presence of suicidal thoughts.</p><p>Formal recognition of pathological lying as a disorder would bring many benefits, as researchers would then be better able to examine its features and causes. And effective treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and possibly pharmaceutical drugs, could then be more thoroughly investigated.</p><hr><p><strong>Study:</strong> P<em>athological Lying: Theoretical and Empirical Support for a Diagnostic Entity</em><br><strong>Authors: </strong><a href="https://prcp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.prcp.20190046#">Drew A.

<h2>The Guide to Social Media APIs</h2>



<p>Here is the scenario: you’ve been tasked with sending event-driven posts to various social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or even newer ones like Telegram, Discord, or Reddit. Developing the front-end functionality to share to these networks is easy, and there are a dozen packages/plugins for <a href="https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-add-social-share-buttons-in-wordpress/">WordPress</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-share">React</a>, or <a href="http://js-socials.com/">Javascript</a>. However, if you need to dynamically share content from your back-end system, well, that means you need to register, be approved, and integrate with each social network.</p>



<p>Building <a href="https://www.ayrshare.com/">Ayrshare</a> wasn’t easy and we found it took a lot of leg-work to find details on the various social media network APIs, so we decided to share what we found. Here are the top networks, links to their API, guides, and process. The APIs can be called directly as RESTful services or search for a well-regarded wrapper for the API in the language of your choice. Most of the APIs use OAuth2 for authentication.</p>







<h2>Top 10 Social Media Network APIs</h2>



<h3>Facebook</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/video-api/overview">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>You need to register your app, and if for commercial purposes, register your business. This includes verifying your legal entity and address. A lot of the Facebook process and requirements are similar to releasing an app to the Apple store.</li><li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference/">Scope</a> permissions are extremely important and don’t be surprised if you get them wrong during the first few builds.</li><li>The API documentation is large and confusing at times, but if you spend the time learning it you’ll find the information you need.</li><li>We didn’t find any good packages that wrap the API calls, so we used direct RESTful calls.</li><li>You can get a permanent access token. However, it requires a few extra calls.</li><li>The Facebook approval process for scope permissions is the most rigorous of any network. You need to write up testing steps, submit a video, and detail your reasoning for needing the permissions. We were rejected once because our video missed a step in our instructions.</li></ul>



<h4>Other guides or packages</h4>



<ul><li><a href="https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable">https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable</a></li><li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-facebook-api/">https://pypi.org/project/python-facebook-api/</a></li></ul>







<hr>







<h3>Twitter</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://developer.twitter.com/">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes</li></ul>

<ul><li>Twitter requires registering your app as a new project (using their new Developer interface). Approval takes a few days, and although we were supposed to get an approval email we never did.</li><li>The API’s examples could be a bit more detailed. Fortunately the Twitter API is not complex. We found some great Twitter API wrappers, so we suggest using one of those. See packages below.</li><li>You can get a permanent access token. This greatly simplifies your token management.</li><li>The new Twitter developer site no longer allows localhost in their approved callback URLs, so you’ll need to use <a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> or an equivalent tunnel to test locally.</li></ul>

<h3>Reddit</h3>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/">API</a></li><li>Requires registration: Yes</li><li>Requires app approval: Yes, only if for commercial use.</li></ul>



<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>Reddit’s API docs are auto-generated and a mess. The information is there, but it will take you a while to get a handle on them. We suggest checking out the subreddit on development (see other guides section).</li><li>Reddit requires you register your app to get the API keys and to complete a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api">Google form</a> for approval if your app is commercial. Don’t forget to do this.</li><li>Subreddit’s have different rules, so don’t blindly post to them or you/your user will be banned. To test your implementation post to the /test subreddit.</li><li>The other networks allow you to get long-lived or permanent access tokens. Reddit’s access token only lasts 1 hours. You can refresh the token even after expiration and some of the wrappers help manage this.</li><li>There are some really great looking wrapper packages. Go to the /redditdev subreddit and see the drop down for packages. However, we still preferred to go directly with the API calls.</li></ul>

<h4>Thoughts</h4>



<ul><li>Instagram has switched to the Facebook Open Graph API format, so if you’ve already built for FB you’ll be familiar with the format.

<p>Spending on depreciating assets can wreck your finances.  Many people associate being wealthy with owning luxury cars, jewelry, designer jeans and high end watches.  This is the image of wealth portrayed in the media and popularized in movies. </p>



<p>The material goods you purchase are really depreciating assets and they are very bad for your financial health.  Every time you choose to make a purchase of a depreciating asset it comes at the opportunity cost of other assets that could be used to increase your net worth.  </p>



<p>Over time compounding interest kicks in to turn modest spending into massive opportunity loss.  This is how depreciating assets can wreck your finances.  </p>



<h2>What Are Depreciating Assets?</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/burningmoney.jpg?resize=332%2C497&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/burningmoney.jpg?resize=332%2C497&amp;ssl=1" alt="burning money" width="332" height="497" title="depreciating assets" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Depreciating Assets burn your wealth</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Depreciating assets are assets that drop in value over time.  Examples include cars, boats, motorcycles, computers. As soon as you buy a depreciating asset your net worth starts going down!</p>



<p>Assets can also appreciate or go up in value over time.  These types of assets are referred to as investments.  Investment work to increase your <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/net-worth-explained/">net worth</a> over time.</p>







<h2>What is the Opportunity Cost of Buying Depreciating Assets</h2>



<p>With every dollar you have comes the choice of what to do with it.  You can choose to invest it or to spend it.  If you choose to spend it, you exchange it for a good or service and it’s gone.  The <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/what-is-opportunity-cost/">opportunity cost</a> of the consumption was the investment that you didn’t get to make.</p>



<p>You have to spend some money to get through life.  The problems arise when you spend much more than you need to for the good or service you want.  This extra money spent adds up and compounds over your lifetime reaching dramatically large amounts in the future.</p>



<h2>The Effect of Compounding Over Your Lifetime</h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="408" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/growth.jpg?resize=640%2C408&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/growth.jpg?resize=640%2C408&amp;ssl=1" alt="Compounding Interest grows wealth over time if you invest rather than buy depreciating assets" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Compounding Interest Grows Wealth Over Time</figcaption></figure>



<p>The most powerful force in all of finance is <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.inc.com/jim-schleckser/why-einstein-considered-compound-interest-most-powerful-force-in-universe.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">compounding interest</a>, or at least that is what Albert Einstein thought.  I agree with him, and you know they say that great minds think alike.  </p>



<p>So the reason Einstein was so fond of compounding interest is because it can turn small amounts of money into extremely large amounts of money over time.  This means that seemingly inconsequential decisions can have a HUGE impact on your finances over time.</p>



<h2>Examples of Opportunity Cost of Depreciating Assets</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="280" height="210" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/red-pill-blue-pill.jpg?resize=280%2C210&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/red-pill-blue-pill.jpg?resize=280%2C210&amp;ssl=1" alt="Opportunity cost means the choice to spend or invest" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Life is full of choices</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>It can be difficult to really understand how much of an impact opportunity cost can have on your eventual nest egg.  It can be helpful to look at an example.  Let’s look at the impact of three choices to spend rather than invest on your long term net worth.</p>



<h3>The Choices Made to Spend</h3>



<ol><li>When you are 20 you decide that you need a new laptop.  Your dad offered you his old one for free, but you decided to buy a $3,000 Macbook Pro instead.  <strong>Opportunity Cost is $3,000 at age 20</strong>.</li><li>Your finally graduate from college, and get your first real job.  You could buy a $30,000 Honda Accord, however you instead decide on a $50,000 BMW.  <strong>Opportunity Cost is $20,000 at age 25.</strong></li><li>At 30 you decide to rack up $10,000 in credit card debt on designer clothes and handbags.  <strong>Opportunity Cost is $10,000 at age 30.</strong></li></ol>



<h3>How Much Does All That Really Cost</h3>



<p>You might look at this and say it all costs $33,000, but this ignores the compounding interest had you invested it instead!  Let’s assume your alternative use for the money was to invest in a low cost index ETF that tracks the US stock market.  Historically you could <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/sec-guide-to-savings-and-investing.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expect a 10% return</a> over a long period of time when investing in stocks.   <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calculating it out</a> it looks more like:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Choice</strong></th><th><strong>Age 40</strong></th><th><strong>Age 50</strong></th><th><strong>Age 60</strong></th><th><strong>Age 70</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Laptop</strong> <br>$3,000 at 20</td><td>$20,182</td><td>$52,348</td><td>$135,777</td><td>$352,172</td></tr><tr><td><strong>BMW</strong> <br>$30,000 at 25</td><td>$83,544</td><td>$216,694</td><td>$562,048</td><td>$1,457,809</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Clothes</strong><br>$10,000 at 30</td><td>$25,937</td><td>$67,275</td><td>$174,494</td><td>$452,591</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>$129,663</strong></td><td><strong>$336,317</strong></td><td><strong>$872,319</strong></td><td><strong>$2,262,572</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Thousand Dollar Choices Can Cost Millions</figcaption></figure>



<p>Here is a chart for those of you that like a visual:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="370" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/oppcost.png?resize=640%2C370&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/oppcost.png?resize=640%2C370&amp;ssl=1" alt="Opportunity Cost of buying depreciating assets instead of investing" data-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/oppcost.png?w=680&amp;ssl=1 680w, https://i2.wp.com/www.dollartrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/oppcost.png?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>What did those purchases cost you?</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>So these three decisions to spend $33,000 that you made between 20 and 30 might have cost you over $1 million by the time you turn 61 years old. If you plan on working to closer to 70 these choices would have cost you over $2 million!  The <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/time-value-of-money/">time value of money</a> can really have a major impact.</p>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>You must choose whether to invest or spend every dollar you make.  Do so wisely because the cost of your choices can compound over time to mind bogglingly large amounts of money.  </p>



<p>Learn to consider the opportunity cost of any item you want to buy today, not just it’s purchase price.  Think of all your spending decisions this way and you can learn to make better financial decisions.</p>

<p>Ocala City Council passed an emergency ordinance last week which mandate the people to wear masks inside businesses. But the ordinance was opposed on Monday by Mayor Kent Guinn. As the city of Ocala sets its order of wearing masks or covering the face in general, Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods told his employees not<a href="https://www.ocala.com/news/20200811/marion-county-deputies-ordered-not-to-wear-masks"> to wear masks</a>. He further ordered the visitors not to wear masks either in his office.</p>
<p>Sheriff Billy Woods passed his order through an email on August 11. The email stated:</p>
<p><strong>“my order will stand as is when you are on-duty/working as my employee and representing my Office – masks will not be worn”</strong></p>

<p>Marion County’s municipalities advised not wearing masks so that the officers can communicate with the people easily where their message is clear and understandable. However, there is no consistent approach statewide as Florida does not have statewide order.</p>
<p>Billy Wood made it clear to wear masks in the situations where there is suspicion of disease like in jail, in public schools, in hospitals, in the courthouse.</p>
<p>However, he made it very clear that the wearing of a mask is only for the above exceptions and officers who do special details will not be allowed to wear a mask on duty unless it is an exception like mentioned.</p>
<p>Billy Woods has said that if any employee is questioned for not wearing a mask, he should just say that he is not required to as per the order of Shariff and then from there Woods will deal with the situation. However, the conversation should be polite and decent.</p>

<p><strong>Bill’s idea of this mask removal is to ensure good and clear communication.</strong></p>
<p>Even though public health officials and others have highly emphasized the idea of wearing a mask as it is a basic barrier for COVID-19. Yet Shariff is rigid with his idea of not allowing the employees to wear a mask on duty. County Commissioner Carl Zalak supports his idea and showed his appreciation towards his idea and commended him for handling the situation well.</p>

<p>However, there are officials in favor and the ones who are not.</p>
<p><u>Agrees:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Ocala Police Chief Greg Graham said the department issues masks to officers but while on duty, he doesn’t expect them to wear masks.</li>
<li>Belleview Police Chief Terry Holland said officers on duty should not wear masks so the lines of communications are clear.</li>
<li>Chief Mike McQuaig of Dunnellon Police Department said he doesn’t require officers to wear a mask in their calls-for-service.</li>
<li>Both Holland and McQuaig said officers are given masks. McQuaig said if a store requires an off-duty officer to wear a mask, then it’s the officer’s decision on whether to wear one or not.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Not agreed:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>City Councilor Matthew Wardell, who sponsored the city’s face mask ordinance, said he disagrees with his stance on the mask.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-c243a880=""><div data-v-c243a880=""><h2><strong>What is Flutter?</strong></h2>
<p><span>Flutter is a Google-developed framework that allows developers to share code between iOS and Android. It’s available through mobile app software development kits (SDKs) and completely open-source.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This allows developers to ensure consistent design and interactivity across operating systems, develop apps at greater speeds and share code from a single base, without having to create duplicate apps in two programming languages.</span></p>
<p><span>You can find out more about the advantages of Flutter and comparisons with other cross-platform frameworks </span><span><a href="https://netsells.co.uk/blog/is-flutter-the-future-of-cross-platform-app-development-in-2020">in our article on the future of Flutter Development in 2020</a>.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What is Flutter for Desktop?</strong></h2>
<p><span>Having successfully created a middle ground for native Swift and Java languages, Google have focused their attention on extending functionality across multiple platforms. As of update 1.5, you are now able to build progressive web applications and desktop applications using Flutter, which can also be embedded in new smart home devices such as Google Home Hub.</span></p>
<p><span>This opens up a huge range of devices to applications written using Flutter, meaning that organisations can swiftly build and deploy across an entire ecosystem using a single codebase.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This has drastic ramifications of speed of development and reducing the costs associated with delivering new features/platforms across mobile, web and embedded applications.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Can You Convert Existing Flutter Code to Desktop?</strong></h2>
<p><span>You are now able to use Flutter to create web content using W3 standard web technologies. This means that you absolutely do have the ability to compile existing Flutter applications into fully compliant web experiences.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Preliminary support now also exists for developing standalone applications on Windows, MacOS, ChromeOS and Linux operating systems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This allows you to take advantage of each respective platform's app store and build robust offline solutions for users, alongside still providing web access.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This means that Flutter is an excellent solution for start-ups and scale-ups who are looking to reach a larger customer base through providing multi-platform support.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://netsells-site.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ba9ef762e968e581006a176d57c2d7fc.png" alt="Flutter Desktop Process Diagram" width="480" height="196">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Creating Smart Home Applications in Flutter</strong></h2>
<p><span>Alongside the new support for web and desktop, developers can also integrate Flutter applications with new smart home technologies such as Google Home, Amazon Alexa and Facebook Portal, giving you the ability to leverage new voice-assisted technologies ahead of the competition.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What Can We Expect From Flutter in the Future?</strong></h2>
<p><span>Despite the major improvements Flutter 1.5 has provided, it isn’t going to be perfect from day one. Google Product Manager Kevin Moore detailed some of the <a href="https://medium.com/flutter/bringing-flutter-to-the-web-904de05f0df0" target="_blank">future plans for the platform in a&nbsp;2019 Medium post</a>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Support for plugins, location features, camera use and file access will be added to allow better user personalisation.</span></li>
<li><span>Support for text features such as copy and paste, allowing for better integration with existing web infrastructure.</span></li>
<li><span>Easier debugging, so apps can get to market quicker.</span></li>
<li><span>Improved performance, browser support and accessibility, boosting your user experience.</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What Does Flutter Mean for the Future of App Development?</strong></h2>
<p><span>With backing from internationally recognisable brands, such as eBay, Sonos and the New York times, as well as 1000s of SMEs, Flutter is quickly becoming the go-to choice of global businesses large and small.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With convenient and reliable cross-platform capabilities which are now even more powerful post the 1.5 update, the expansiveness of Flutter’s offering is growing exponentially. Google’s Flutter Development Team continues to add performance fixes in line with current infrastructure developments, meaning you are able to produce robust and valuable digital products across multiple platforms that will be supported for years to come.</span></p>
<p><span>Whether you’re a large organisation or an SME, creating applications in Flutter may get you top market quicker and reduce your development costs.</span></p>

<p>In the late ’90s, when Sameer Maskey was a college student, artificial intelligence was an esoteric field. Yet Maskey, who “fell in love with computers” during his freshman year at Bates College, took an immediate interest in AI, particularly the idea of speech-to-speech translation. In 2000, after research stints at Carnegie Mellon and the California Institute of Technology, he built the first Nepali speech synthesizer and released it open source at a conference in Nepal.</p>



<p>Back then, “nobody took any interest,” says Maskey. “Not many people were talking about AI in Nepal.”</p>



<p>Today, Maskey is the founder and CEO of Fusemachines, a company that <a href="https://fusemachines.com/">creates AI tools and provides teams of engineers</a> to businesses in the US that want to build their own. Quiet and driven, he has converted his years of research and teaching — as a PhD from Columbia University, a speech-to-speech-translation research scientist at IBM Watson, and an assistant adjunct professor at Columbia —&nbsp;into the foundation for a 250-person company.</p>



<p>Fusemachines began with the aim of producing customer service products, like automated dialogue systems (the first of which Maskey developed after locking himself in a room and writing 20,000 lines of code). The New York City government was its first client. But as the shortage of AI engineers became a prominent issue in the US, where talent is swiftly snapped up by Silicon Valley giants, Fusemachines’ brand has shifted toward teaching AI in developing countries, where, as Maskey puts it, the company is “democratizing AI.”</p>



<p><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>



<h4><strong>Why teach AI and machine learning? Why start in Nepal?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>In the past five years, the demand for AI engineers in the US has gone through the roof. They are being sought after by all the big tech companies, but there aren’t enough of them, which has created a huge gap in the market. Newspapers were talking about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/technology/artificial-intelligence-experts-salaries.html">how getting AI engineers was becoming a lot like sports hiring</a>. Companies in the US that aren’t at the scale of Google and Facebook <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/small-businesses-arent-rushing-into-ai-11560078000">can’t afford AI talent</a>. Colleges and universities are increasing their capacity, but they can’t keep up: the demand for engineers is in the hundreds of thousands.</p>



<p>After starting Fusemachines, I realized the market size is quite big, and that the technology would be useful for companies not just in the US. <em>We need engineers: where do I find them?</em> When I was in Nepal on one of my yearly trips, I thought, <em>Let’s see what happens when I teach students here.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was a cost advantage to building a team in Nepal, of course. It gives us more runway with the same amount of money. But from an impact perspective, it was more interesting to train engineers from Nepal. A lot of the AI technology today gets built by large companies and is geared toward the US: if you put a self-driving Tesla on a road in Nepal, it’s not going to work that well. High-quality AI education in other countries means graduates will build tech adapted to their local issues and contexts.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>A lot of the AI technology gets built by large companies and is geared toward the US: if you put a self-driving Tesla on a road in Nepal, it’s not going to work that well.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h4><strong>Is teaching AI abroad any different than teaching the subject in the U.S.?</strong></h4>



<p>At the beginning, I didn’t really have many expectations. But I started to see sparks of quality talent. I taught the same course as the one I taught at Columbia University. I soon realized my students in Nepal were equally good.</p>



<p>Going into it, I knew there would be some issues with rote learning, but not at the level I saw. Students have read about topics — from a syllabus perspective they have done all the math — but they don’t understand it well enough conceptually to do the coding. A lot of students weren’t ready to take the first course, so our only option was to come up with our own set of foundation courses and teach those beforehand. Our students in Rwanda and the Dominican Republic are similar. And other than the students from the top schools, it’s the same in India too.</p>



<h4><strong>How does the AI training industry compare in the U.S.?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>The bootcamps are expensive — $24,000 or so for a typical course —&nbsp;but bootcamps have a lot of infrastructure costs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/15/new-yorks-programming-ed-tech-startup-general-assembly-sells-to-adecco-for-413-million/">so margins are narrower </a>than for a typical tech company. In traditional coding bootcamps, the students are not computer science students. They’re not making much money yet. In AI bootcamps, students are already software engineers; they already have good jobs. They don’t want to stop making money and enroll in a bootcamp. This might be another reason there aren’t as many AI bootcamps in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Do you think, then, that the talent shortage in the U.S. will continue?</strong></h4>



<p>There are a couple of things that might reduce it. There are the bootcamps, and also, AI tools <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/04/10/the-commoditization-of-ai-and-the-long-term-value-of-data/">are being commoditized</a> —&nbsp;you can build basic versions of a system. But if you want to make any improvement, then it’s a black box. Probably there will be some point in the future where the shortage will start to taper, but it hasn’t happened yet.</p>

<h4><strong>Could online courses teaching AI — such as those offered by fast.ai or deeplearning.ai —&nbsp;help satisfy the demand?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Those are mostly taken by computer science students, but the problem with <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">purely online</a>, <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/">self-paced courses</a> is that the completion rate is less than 10%. We have online classes now too, but they’re live classes, which makes a huge difference. Most students need more hand-holding, and there’s a lack of faculty. The foundation of AI, unlike programming in general, is all math. You can learn Python programming in six months, but you can’t learn all the foundations of math in the same amount of time. It just takes more time and more effort, from students and from teachers. There’s no shortcut.</p>



<p>We want to contribute to that by democratizing quality AI education, which will speed up the adoption and production of AI engineers. We are thinking of scaling up beyond our current reach by rolling out a program called Teach AI for the World. Like Teach for America, talented AI engineers would travel to different countries and teach for one or two years. We want to see thousands of teachers teaching thousands of AI programs around the world.</p>



<h4><strong>You mention </strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/04/16/heres-why-we-need-to-democratize-artificial-intelligence/#32cf4ee4f2c2"><strong>“democratizing AI”</strong></a><strong> often. What does it really mean?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>There are three core things. The first is bringing AI technology to underserved communities, such as Nepal. Our most successful product has been a platform for AI-assisted learning called <a href="https://www.fuseclassroom.com/">Fuse Classrooms</a>, which was adapted from the platform we created to teach fellows. It can inform teachers how students in their classes are doing, what material they’re struggling with, and what they should study to improve. It’s being sold in some markets for as cheap as a dollar, and it hasn’t been long, but altogether, we already have students logging half a million minutes a day.</p>



<p>The second is bringing high-quality AI-education programs as well, so that people in these communities can learn how to build AI themselves. People who live in underserved markets understand how and why AI can make a big impact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third thing is enabling the skilled engineers we train to either find jobs or build their own AI technologies. When we accept fellows, our big focus is on training engineers further so they can impact their community. They will eventually become managers and create more demand for AI solutions and engineers.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>In the long run, we want to make AI education — really good AI education — available to everyone, getting to the bottom of the pyramid.</p></blockquote></figure>



<h4><strong>How do you ensure your students aren’t just the elites in the developing countries where you work?</strong></h4>



<p>In Nepal, we’re already starting to partner with schools outside of Kathmandu, and we’re planning to pilot larger live online classes. In the long run, we want to make AI education — really good AI education — available to everyone, getting to the bottom of the pyramid. But we’re not there right now, because we don’t have enough resources. For example, there are students without access to a mobile device, and we can’t afford to buy them these devices. Right now, we mostly train people who studied computer science, most of whom are from Kathmandu. They’re elite in the sense that they can afford a phone and a laptop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re creating offline platforms, so that if students don’t have internet access but the school does, they can come to the school and download what they need for two or three weeks at a time and continue studying through the app. We also want to go downstream. In Nepal, there are 8 million students in school but only 400,000 in undergraduate programs. More than 7 million students just disappear, so we want to start teaching students in high school or earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>But you’re also a for-profit company. Where is the trade-off between that and the goal of truly democratizing AI?</strong></h4>



<p>The way we look at it is that we have two bottom lines. We have a for-profit company, so we need to make money and grow. We have investors who seek returns on their investment. But our other bottom line is democratizing AI such that it makes lives better for a lot of people. I think there are ways to achieve both; you have to find a balance. For example, our <a href="https://www.fusemachines.com/press/press-release/?id=fuse.ai-global-launch">Fusemachines fellowships</a> were open to anyone who wanted to learn, and half of the students from several cohorts were already employees at other companies. That didn’t make sense from a business perspective, but it did from a democratization perspective. We will probably seek grant funding to democratize beyond what we are able to do as a company.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><em>Hello everyone. I want to bring back one of my old articles. Wrote it in 2012. Long time ago. I found it while searching something on web archive site. 
I'll copy the content as it is, my thoughts on this topic haven't changed so much. This republishing is me paying tribute to that article.
</em></p>
<p>Test driven development is a very powerful thing. Although I don’t use it on every day basis, I’m a big admirer of the whole TDD concept. When I first heard of it, it made me laugh. It sounded impossible to me (especially for my poor skills). It was something like looking into the future. How the hell I can possibly know what and how will I implement something. Sounds familiar?</p>
<p>From my point of view, it’s not easy at all to cross the border and step into the TDD world. You have to think differently. And you probably won’t change your mind over night. Or maybe you will, like in my case when the TDD was the only way out of the problem.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-don-t-use-it-">Why I don’t use it?</h2>
<p>Well, let me present you one more scenario you are, I’m sure, familiar with. New requirements are there and, of course, deadline is near. If you step back and take a look at the whole picture, you’ll see that TDD can save you in general a lot of time. But when the deadline is near we are looking only the small piece of that picture. We just want to finish something before our next deployment, write some test after the implementation and forget about it (until our next meeting with Mr Debugger).</p>
<p>Another thing, I still think you need to be very experienced developer in order to perform truly test driven development all the time.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-do-use-it-">Why I do use it?</h2>
<p>As I wrote before, I didn’t “believe” in TDD until it provided me an exit from a very tricky situation with lots of conditions, loops and complicated logic. I started to write code in a usual way, finished few blocks of code, but soon it became so big I didn’t know where to change, what to change, and if I change something will it work as before. My brain was just over capacity. A colleague of mine told me I was ready for one “TDD session”. He started with really simple tests and forced me to write the rest. Of course, he helped me to finish it later, also with some refactoring. That was the point where I started to look differently at TDD.</p>
<p>I don’t always TDD… But when I do it, it’s because I’m working on something very very complicated, or it’s something I wan’t to be 300% sure it’s working as I want (some financial stuff for example). It doesn’t need to be complicated or serious all the time. I tend to do TDD when I feel I could easily make mistakes and spend more time in debug mode than in developing. Those are situations when I use TDD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.</p>
<p>-- Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="short-example">Short example</h2>
<p>I hope this simple Java example will be enough to present you a basics of TDD. Imagine you have a simple ajax call and as a result you want your Java object presented as JSON. Ok, I know, you already have many ways to convert the Java object to JSON, but for this purpose lets convert it manually. As you can see in example below, there are a lot of double quotes. In Java, you have to escape them if you want to have them in your string, so there is a possibility that you will forget to escape all the double quotes. That’s one of the reasons I found this example interesting for TDD.</p>
<pre><code>
{<span>"menu"</span>: {
  <span>"id"</span>: <span>"file"</span>,
  <span>"value"</span>: <span>"File"</span>,
  <span>"popup"</span>: {
    <span>"menuitem"</span>: [
      {<span>"value"</span>: <span>"New"</span>, <span>"onclick"</span>: <span>"CreateNewDoc()"</span>},
      {<span>"value"</span>: <span>"Open"</span>, <span>"onclick"</span>: <span>"OpenDoc()"</span>},
      {<span>"value"</span>: <span>"Close"</span>, <span>"onclick"</span>: <span>"CloseDoc()"</span>}
    ]
  }
}}
</code></pre><p>Now, let’s say you have list of <code>User</code> objects, and you want to create JSON from it, but you don’t want to include all user fields, just few of them, for example first and last name.</p>
<p>We will start from the beginning. First we will write a test for a case when the list of users is <code>null</code>. For this case we will throw a <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>. I will use this example to show you how to properly test an exceptions.</p>
<pre><code><span>@Test</span>(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
<span><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>testExtractUserNullAsList</span><span>()</span> </span>{
    
    List&lt;User&gt; users = <span>null</span>;

    <span>try</span> {
        
        ModelMapper.extractUsers(users);
    } <span>catch</span> (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        assertEquals(<span>"user list is null"</span>, e.getMessage());
        <span>throw</span> e;
    }
</code></pre><p>After that, you’ll write an implementation to make your test pass. Notice the line138, which is telling that it is OK for this test to throw the exception. Another thing, I put the method into the try-catch block. You can make this test pass without putting the method into the try-catch block. The thing is, when you have more complicated tests where you expect some method calls, only way to verify all of them is to verify them in the catch block and then re-throw the exception. So, if you omit the try-catch block, your test will pass (as you expect the exception) but many of your mocks won’t be verified. Below is simple implementation that will make the first test pass.</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>String</span> extractUsers(List&lt;User&gt; users) {
   <span>if</span> (users == <span>null</span>) {
       <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
   }

   <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;
}
</code></pre><p>Now, let’s make another test. This time, we will pass the empty list. We are taking care of the small things first. Later we will do the complicated things. That’s how you should write your tests. For now, we want the empty JSON object to be returned.</p>
<pre><code><span>@Test</span>
<span>public</span> <span>void</span> testExtractUsersEmptyList() {
    
    List&lt;User&gt; users = <span>new</span> ArrayList&lt;User&gt;();

    
    <span>String</span> result = ModelMapper.extractUsers(users);

    
    assertEquals(<span>"{}"</span>, result);

}
</code></pre><p>After adding some code, our method now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>String</span> extractUsers(List&lt;User&gt; users) {
    <span>if</span> (users == <span>null</span>) {
        <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
    }

    <span>if</span> (users.isEmpty()) {
        <span>return</span> <span>"{}"</span>;
    }

    <span>return</span> <span>null</span>;
 }
</code></pre><p>The next thing, we want to write tests for case we have few users in that list. First, we will write a test, of course, where we will define what we want as a result of the method. That test will look something like this</p>
<pre><code><span>@Test</span>
 <span>public</span> <span>void</span> testExtractUsers() {
    
    User john = createDummyUser(<span>1</span>, <span>"John"</span>, <span>"Doe"</span>);
    User jane = createDummyUser(<span>2</span>, <span>"Jane"</span>, <span>"Doe"</span>);
    List&lt;User&gt; users = <span>new</span> ArrayList&lt;User&gt;();
    users.add(john);
    users.add(jane);

    
    <span>String</span> result = ModelMapper.extractUsers(users);

    
    assertEquals(<span>"{\"users\":[{\"id\":\"1\",\"name\":\"John Doe\"},{\"id\":\"2\",\"name\":\"Jane Doe\"}]}"</span>, result);

 }
</code></pre><p>Of course, if we run this test now, it will fail. Now, we’ll extend our implementation. After finishing the implementation and successfully escaping all of the double quotes, my method now looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>public static String extractUsers(List&lt;User&gt; users) {
    <span>if</span> (users == null) {
        throw <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
    }

    <span>if</span> (users.isEmpty()) {
        <span>return</span> <span>"{}"</span>;
    } <span>else</span> {
        StringBuilder sb = <span>new</span> StringBuilder();
        sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"users\":["</span>);
        <span>for</span> (User u : users) {
            sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"id\":\""</span>)
            .<span>append</span>(u.getId())
            .<span>append</span>(<span>"\","</span>)
            .<span>append</span>(<span>"\"name\":\""</span>)
            .<span>append</span>(u.getFirstName())
            .<span>append</span>(<span>" "</span>)
            .<span>append</span>(u.getLastName())
            .<span>append</span>(<span>"\"}"</span>);
    }

    sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"]}"</span>);

    <span>return</span> sb.toString();

    }
 }
</code></pre><p>But, after running test, I realize I missed something. Test failed because I didn’t separate users by comma. This is where tests are also helpful. If I didn’t covered this with tests, I could continue to develop without noticing that I’m missing this comma and (maybe) I could have long debug time in Javascript in order to find why I can’t parse the response properly.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1597593139559/fRJ9Fiphv.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60"></p>
<p>Here’s my method after small modifications:</p>
<pre><code>public static String extractUsers(List&lt;User&gt; users) {
    <span>if</span> (users == null) {
        throw <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
    }

    <span>if</span> (users.isEmpty()) {
        <span>return</span> <span>"{}"</span>;
    } <span>else</span> {
        StringBuilder sb = <span>new</span> StringBuilder();
        sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"users\":["</span>);
        <span>for</span> (User u : users) {
        sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"id\":\""</span>)
        .<span>append</span>(u.getId())
        .<span>append</span>(<span>"\","</span>)
        .<span>append</span>(<span>"\"name\":\""</span>)
        .<span>append</span>(u.getFirstName())
        .<span>append</span>(<span>" "</span>)
        .<span>append</span>(u.getLastName())
        .<span>append</span>(<span>"\"}"</span>);

        <span>if</span> (users.indexOf(u) &lt; users.size() - <span>1</span>) {
            sb.<span>append</span>(<span>","</span>);
        }
    }
    sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"]}"</span>);

    <span>return</span> sb.toString();

    }
}
</code></pre><p>OK, now I can continue. But, let’s say I don’t like that <code>indexOf(u)</code> mumbo jumbo magic. It doesn’t look nice. I have an idea and with all these tests, it won’t be a problem to do the refactoring. After all, refactoring is one of the steps in the TDD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fail, pass, refactor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One question for you. Imagine you have some complicated Javascript component that do a lot of work and hardly relies on your JSON response and you don’t have unit tests. Would you dare to do the refactoring if you have a deadline? Would you dare to do the refactoring at all? In this case, we have encountered with the double quotes escaping and adding commas. If we had few more things like that, every one of them will be a valid argument against the refactoring.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to the refactoring. In this example I’ll use <code>Iterator</code> because the <code>hasNext()</code> method will be perfect replacement in the <code>if</code> statement. Next step is to refactor until the tests are green again. After introducing <code>Iterator</code>, my method looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>public static String extractUsers(List users) {
    <span>if</span> (users == null) {
        throw <span>new</span> IllegalArgumentException(<span>"user list is null"</span>);
    }

    <span>if</span> (users.isEmpty()) {
        <span>return</span> <span>"{}"</span>;
    } <span>else</span> {
        StringBuilder sb = <span>new</span> StringBuilder();

        sb.<span>append</span>(<span>"{\"users\":["</span>);

        Iterator&lt;User&gt; userIterator = users.iterator();

        while (userIterator.hasNext()) {
            User u = userIterator.next();
           …</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>I hope you enjoyed reading these letters. I’ve certain enjoyed writing them. When I chat with new developers, at meetups, on slack, or via email, they let me know when letters are helpful or unclear. They suggest topics. They give me feedback, which, when you’re writing into the howling abyss of the internet, is very helpful both for calibrating your message and improving your motivation. </p>



<p>I’ve also posted these letters to <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2019/02/11/join-an-online-tech-community/">some online communities</a>. I’ve received plenty of feedback from those folks as well. Some kind, some caustic. That’s not unexpected.</p>



<p> After writing a hundred or so posts, I thought, there’s a book here. </p>



<p>And so I wrote one.</p>



<p>You can buy it from any of the usual suspects:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781484260739">Indiebound</a></li><li><a href="https://bookshop.org/books/letters-to-a-new-developer-what-i-wish-i-had-known-when-starting-my-development-career/9781484260739">Bookshop</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Letters-New-Developer-Starting-Development/dp/1484260732/">Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/letters-to-a-new-developer-dan-moore/1137054764">Barnes and Noble</a></li><li><a href="https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484260739">Apress US website</a> / <a href="https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484260739">Apress international website</a></li></ul>



<p>You can also check out a preview of the chapters on <a href="https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484260739">the publisher’s website</a>. I’d love if you’d do so. </p>



<p>Here’s who I wrote it for:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>For new developers</strong><br>You are new to the software development job market. Perhaps you have completed a bootcamp or college degree. You may refer to yourself as an entry level or junior engineer.</p><p>While everyone’s background and skills growth happens at different speeds, new developers generally have less than five years of professional experience. Many new developers are worried about their abilities, don’t feel welcome, and have a difficult time finding that first job.</p><p>But as an industry, we need more new developers. There are so many problems with which software can help. Companies want experienced engineers, but all the senior developers I know started out as new developers. A senior engineer is just a new engineer seasoned with gaffes, education, and time.</p><p>For new developers, this book will help you avoid missteps I’ve made. It also introduces you to disciplines beyond coding critical to success. While programming is crucial for any software product or service, there is much more required to deliver an application.</p><p><strong>For anyone considering software development<br></strong>If you’re not sure if software engineering is right for you, this book offers perspectives on how to succeed.</p><p>I’ve intentionally kept the barriers to the layperson low with limited technical jargon. Only a few technologies are discussed, and those sections can be skipped. If you are thinking about becoming a developer, I’d recommend buying this book and a book about programming.</p><p>Giving a computer commands that it can execute is an important skill for any software developer. But software engineering is so much more. You must know what to build, how to work with your team, and how to maintain your systems.</p><p><strong>For mentors<br></strong>If you are mentoring a new developer, this book can serve as a discussion guide. Because each chapter has letters approaching a theme from different angles, you and your mentee will find it useful for focused mentoring sessions.</p><p>As an experienced developer, you’ll of course bring your own insights and experience to each topic, from your debugging process to the value of an online community for continuous learning.</p><p>And, of course, you may have had a different experience than what I share. Such contrasts are a jumping-off point to discuss the diversity available in a software development career.</p><cite>Introduction, “Letters To a New Developer”</cite></blockquote>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>



<p>PS If you <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/contact/">shoot me an email</a>, I’ll give you a discount code.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>It’s a story of implementing CMake feature that I call <code>command reference</code>
(similar to existing <code>variable reference</code>), i.e., using result of command 
invocation as an argument. Having this idea for a long time I never had enough 
time to dig into it. Now, being unemployed I decided at least to try it before 
looking for a next job. It was not as easy as I expected but I’m pretty satisfied 
with the result.</p>

<p>It consists of two parts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First part contains motivation, design and results.</li>
  <li>Second part explains some implementation details, such as why new lexer and 
parser is needed.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Most part of my career I used Visual Studio
and when switched to Linux I was slightly shocked. Compared to MSVS, makefiles 
felt like bows and arrows against machine gun. Then I discovered CMake and it felt
much better, instead of cryptic makefiles we got a distinct language with 
commands and variables. And since it’s just another language, the same rules 
apply to its code: meaningful names, small functions, separation of abstractions, 
etc. Unfortunately, many CMake files look like one very big function 
that mixes everything in it. CMake allows us to handle almost all those things 
right except one - it doesn’t have return values, thus, limiting the usefulness 
of function abstraction. As a result, some parts of your 
CMakeLists look bad.</p>

<p>Let’s look at some examples.</p>

<pre><code>if(${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR} STREQUAL ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR})    # is top level list?
if(WIN32)   # surprisingly short name comparing to other CMake vars
if(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "GNU")
if((CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "Clang") 
    OR (CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "AppleClang"))
if(CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P EQUAL 8)    # my favorite one, x64 check
</code></pre>
<p>The problem with such code is that it doesn’t express logic, only implementation 
details. It requires you to remember all those long and tricky variable names,
magic values and relation between them.</p>

<p>We can move that into a function but it doesn’t solve the problem. We are lazy,
nobody wants to write two lines instead of one:</p>
<pre><code>check_is_top_level_list(is_top_level_list)
if(is_top_level_list)...

# is it better than one-liner?
if(${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR} STREQUAL ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR})
</code></pre>

<p>Almost all feature tests become:</p>
<pre><code>check_feature_available(RESULT is_feature_available)
if(is_feature_available)
</code></pre>
<p>It’s better than direct values manipulation but it’s ugly. Now you need to
check documentation for the name of this output argument, intuitive 
candidates are 
<code>RESULT</code>, <code>RESULT_VAR</code>, <code>OUTPUT</code>, or just absence of such argument at all: 
<code>check_feature_available(is_feature_available)</code>(or <code>check_feature_available()</code> with <code>FATAL_ERROR</code>).
It also forces you to think about names for variables, many 
of whom are used only once. In any popular language we can write all of the above 
in a clear manner:</p>

<pre><code>if(IsTopLevelProject()){}
if(IsWindowsBuild()){}
if(IsClang() || IsGcc()){}
if(IsX64Build()){}
if(IsFeatureAvailable()){}
</code></pre>

<p>Why should I know how those checks are performed?</p>

<p>Again, you can handle all that stuff, CMake has been successfully used for years. But why not make it simpler? CMake is a big part of C++ so why 
shouldn’t we make it easier for new people as we do with C++ itself?</p>

<h3 id="why-fh-isnt-possible">Why f(h()) isn’t possible</h3>

<p>Initial idea was to allow something like <code>get_name_by_id(get_id())</code> but it quickly
turned out to be wrong because of two reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>CMake syntax is too simple, it doesn’t have keywords, command names are not 
restricted, anything is a string(including parens).
For example expression <code>if(x AND (y OR z))</code> means
call <code>if_impl("x", "AND", "(", "y", "OR", "z", ")");</code> where <code>AND</code>, <code>OR</code> and parens 
are just plain strings that are handled in a specific way by <code>if_impl</code>. 
The only requirement here is that parens should match, e.g. <code>if(x AND (y))))</code> 
isn’t allowed. Because of that this is ambiguous:</p>

    <pre><code> function(AND a b c)
 endfunction()

 if(x AND (y OR z))  # if_impl(x, AND, (, y, OR, z, )) or
                     # if_impl(x, AND_impl(y, OR, z)) ?
</code></pre>
    <p>You can extend this case to named arguments which, unlike bool operations,
can have non-trivial names.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But the main reason is that the above form isn’t flexible enough. How to use it
within the quoted argument or to mix it with plain strings?</p>

    <pre><code> function(h)
 endfunction()

 f(a_h() "b h()_c")  # not possible
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="meet-the-command-reference">Meet the command reference</h3>

<p>Syntax mimics variable reference: <code>${command_name( args... )}</code>(notice, there’s no 
spaces before command name and after final paren). It works 
just like you expect:</p>

<pre><code>function(get_name)
    return("Alex")
endfunction()

message(${get_name()})    # prints "Alex"
</code></pre>

<p>More generally:</p>

<pre><code>function(f)
    return(return-value-expr)
endfunction()
use_f(${f()})

# is equal to
set(__ret_var_name return-value-expr)
use_f(${__ret_var_name})
</code></pre>

<p>It can be used wherever variable reference can.
Comments, nested calls and lists are also allowed, let’s mix it all together:</p>

<pre><code>function(format_name first last)
    return("First: ${first}, last: ${last}")
endfunction()

function(get_first_name)
    return("John")          # return quoted
endfunction()

function(get_last_name)
    return(Doe)             # return unquoted
endfunction()

function(get_first_and_last)
    return([[John]] Doe)    # return list
endfunction()

message(
    ${format_name(      # pass separate args
        ${get_first_name()}     # comments
        ${get_last_name()}      #[[ inside 
                                    command
                                    reference ]]
    )}
)                       # First: John, last: Doe

message(
    ${format_name(      # pass as a list, expands in two arguments
        ${get_first_and_last()}
    )}
)                       # First: John, last: Doe

# return() becomes a function that returns its arguments
message(${CMAKE_${return("VERSION")}})  # 3.18.1-...
</code></pre>

<p>Current implementation based upon CMake 3.18.1 release. You can build it

<h3 id="warning">Warning</h3>

<p><em>Some CMake features or policies, especially related to syntax or variable 
expansion, might not work. One such policy I’m aware of is OLD part of
<a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.1/policy/CMP0053.html">CMP0053</a>. Syntax related 
error messages are also slightly different. All other things should work, I’ve
successfully built Google Test, Google Benchmark and fmt, using it. I’m not a
CMake developer, integration is quite dirty in some places so don’t expect it to 
be production ready right away.</em></p>

<h2 id="part-2-implementation-details">Part 2. Implementation details</h2>

<p>At the beginning I naively supposed that if CMake can already parse single 
command  invocation, it would be enough just to call that function recursively on 
every argument :) But it turned out to be a way more complex and required 
completely new lexer and parser. I’ve created it using Flex&amp;Bison, you can find
separate project that does parsing and pseudo-evaluation <a href="https://github.com/OleksandrKvl/cmake_parser">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="existing-cmake-parser-and-why-its-not-enough">Existing CMake parser and why it’s not enough</h3>

<p>Current implementation is relatively simple(but not its code). It consists of 
Flex-based scanner and hand-written parser.
Scanner detects separated arguments and their kinds,
it’s easy since we know how each argument starts and ends. Current parser 
mostly verifies basic syntax rules like valid separations, parens matching etc.
For example
<code>command(a "${b}")</code> is parsed as <code>call("command").with_args(unquoted_arg{"a"}, 
quoted_arg{"${b}"})</code>. Notice that variable reference <code>${b}</code> is passed as a plain text.
During command execution each argument is parsed again with another parser that
can detect, verify and evaluate variable references. If such command appears in a 
cycle it does this additional parsing on every iteration.
Also if you make a mistake inside reference, it won’t be detected until 
expression is evaluated:</p>

<pre><code>if(${ALWAYS_TRUE_IN_YOUR_ENV})
    # no errors or warnings on your machine
	message("hello world")
else()
    # syntax error at run-time on another machine
    message(${@:-:@})
endif()
</code></pre>
<p>Now, when we allow another command appear inside argument, argument separation is not so easy:</p>
<pre><code>command("result: ${get_result("a" b)}")
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that highlighter marks “a” in black because it thinks that arguments are
<code>"result: ${get_result("</code>, <code>a</code>, <code>" b)}"</code>. Existing CMake parser sees it in 
the same way.
To separate arguments correctly we got to be able to parse recursively
when we meet command reference.</p>

<p>In terms of BNF existing syntax looks like(simplified):</p>

<pre><code>command_invocation ::= identifier '(' argument* ')'
</code></pre>

<p>with command reference we got:</p>

<pre><code>command_invocation ::= identifier '(' (argument | command_invocation)* ')'
</code></pre>

<p>with only difference that command reference might appear inside argument, not only
as a separate one.</p>

<p>As you can see, now we need to parse it much deeper than existing parser does,
there’s no sense in trying to extend it, also writing parser for recursive rules 
by hand is not trivial so I have no choice but to write both scanner and parser 
from scratch. Flex and Bison were chosen because they’re already used
in CMake.</p>

<h3 id="bnf-for-a-new-syntax">BNF for a new syntax</h3>

<p>Let’s slightly update <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#syntax">official BNF</a> accordingly to new syntax:</p>

<pre><code>command_invocation  ::=  identifier space* '(' arguments ')'

quoted_argument     ::= '"' (quoted_element | reference)* '"'
unquoted_argument   ::= (unquoted_element | reference)+

reference           ::= var_reference | command_reference
var_reference       ::= var_ref_open (variable_name | reference)* ref_close
command_reference   ::= cmd_ref_open command_invocation ref_close

var_ref_open        ::= "${" | "$ENV{" | "$CACHE{"
cmd_ref_open        ::= "${"
ref_close           ::= "}"

quoted_element      ::= &lt;check official docs&gt;
unquoted_element    ::= &lt;check official docs&gt;
variable_name       ::= &lt;check official docs&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike existing implementation, I want to avoid parsing during execution and get
all details in one pass. Now, each quoted/unquoted argument consists of 
string(<code>quoted/unquoted_element+</code>) and reference. To get its real value
at run-time we need to evaluate and …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Xgboost</a> is a gradient boosting library. It provides parallel boosting trees algorithm that can solve Machine Learning tasks. It is available in many languages, like: C++, Java, Python, R, Julia, Scala. In this post, I will show you how to get feature importance from Xgboost model in Python. In this example, I will use <code>boston</code> dataset availabe in <code>scikit-learn</code> pacakge (a regression task).</p>

<p>You will learn how to compute and plot:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feature Importance built-in the Xgboost algorithm,</li>
  <li>Feature Importance computed with Permutation method,</li>
  <li>Feature Importance computed with <code>SHAP</code> values.</li>
</ul>

<p>All the code is available as <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19YiyfATz3JVdXbS3sipbG90uvrefl7ou?usp=sharing">Google Colab Notebook</a>. Happy coding!</p>

<h2 id="xgboost-built-in-feature-importance">Xgboost Built-in Feature Importance</h2>

<p>Let’s start with importing packages. Please note that if you miss some package you can install it with pip (for example, <code>pip install shap</code>).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>numpy</span> <span>as</span> <span>np</span>
<span>import</span> <span>pandas</span> <span>as</span> <span>pd</span>
<span>import</span> <span>shap</span>

<span>from</span> <span>sklearn.datasets</span> <span>import</span> <span>load_boston</span>
<span>from</span> <span>sklearn.model_selection</span> <span>import</span> <span>train_test_split</span>
<span>from</span> <span>sklearn.inspection</span> <span>import</span> <span>permutation_importance</span>
<span>from</span> <span>matplotlib</span> <span>import</span> <span>pyplot</span> <span>as</span> <span>plt</span>
<span>import</span> <span>seaborn</span> <span>as</span> <span>sns</span> <span># for correlation heatmap</span>

<span>from</span> <span>xgboost</span> <span>import</span> <span>XGBRegressor</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Load the <code>boston</code> data set and split it into training and testing subsets. The 75% of data will be used for training and the rest for testing (will be needed in permutation-based method).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>boston</span> <span>=</span> <span>load_boston</span><span>()</span>
<span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>(</span><span>boston</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>columns</span><span>=</span><span>boston</span><span>.</span><span>feature_names</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>boston</span><span>.</span><span>target</span>
<span>X_train</span><span>,</span> <span>X_test</span><span>,</span> <span>y_train</span><span>,</span> <span>y_test</span> <span>=</span> <span>train_test_split</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>test_size</span><span>=</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span> <span>random_state</span><span>=</span><span>12</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Fitting the Xgboost Regressor is simple and take 2 lines (amazing package, I love it!):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>xgb</span> <span>=</span> <span>XGBRegressor</span><span>(</span><span>n_estimators</span><span>=</span><span>100</span><span>)</span>
<span>xgb</span><span>.</span><span>fit</span><span>(</span><span>X_train</span><span>,</span> <span>y_train</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve used default hyperparameters in the Xgboost and just set the number of trees in the model (<code>n_estimators=100</code>).</p>

<p>To get the feature importances from the Xgboost model we can just use the <code>feature_importances_</code> attribute:</p>



<div><div><pre><code>array([0.01690426, 0.00777439, 0.0084541 , 0.04072201, 0.04373369,
       0.20451033, 0.01512331, 0.04763542, 0.01018296, 0.02332482,
       0.04085794, 0.01299683, 0.52778   ], dtype=float32)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s is important to notice, that it is the same API interface like for ‘scikit-learn’ models, for example in <a href="https://mljar.com/blog/feature-importance-in-random-forest/">Random Forest we would do the same to get importances</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s visualize the importances (chart will be easier to interpret than values).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>barh</span><span>(</span><span>boston</span><span>.</span><span>feature_names</span><span>,</span> <span>xgb</span><span>.</span><span>feature_importances_</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://mljar.com/blog/feature-importance-xgboost/xgboost_builtin_feature_importance_unsorted.png" alt="Xgboost Built-in Feature Importance Unsorted"></p>

<p>To have even better plot, let’s sort the features based on importance value:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sorted_idx</span> <span>=</span> <span>xgb</span><span>.</span><span>feature_importances_</span><span>.</span><span>argsort</span><span>()</span>

<span>plt</span><span>.</span><span>xlabel</span><span>(</span><span>"Xgboost Feature Importance"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="about-xgboost-built-in-feature-importance">About Xgboost Built-in Feature Importance</h3>

<ul>
  <li>There are <a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html?highlight=get_score#xgboost.Booster.get_score">several types of importance</a> in the Xgboost - it can be computed in several different ways. The default type is <code>gain</code> if you construct model with <code>scikit-learn</code> like API (<a href="https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html?highlight=get_score#xgboost.XGBClassifier">docs</a>). When you access <code>Booster</code> object and get the importance with <code>get_score</code> method, then default is <code>weight</code>. You can check the type of the importance with <code>xgb.importance_type</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code>gain</code> type shows the average gain across all splits where feature was used.</li>
  <li>The <code>weight</code> shows the number of times the feature is used to split data. This type of feature importance can favourize numerical and high cardinality features. Be careful!</li>
  <li>There are also <code>cover</code>, <code>total_gain</code>, <code>total_cover</code> types of importance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="permutation-based-feature-importance-with-scikit-learn">Permutation Based Feature Importance (with <code>scikit-learn</code>)</h2>

<p>Yes, you can use <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance.html#sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance"><code>permutation_importance</code></a> from <code>scikit-learn</code> on Xgboost! (<code>scikit-learn</code> is amazing!) It is possible because Xgboost implements the <code>scikit-learn</code> interface API. It is available in <code>scikit-learn</code> from <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/release_highlights/plot_release_highlights_0_22_0.html#permutation-based-feature-importance">version 0.22</a>.</p>

<p>This permutation method will randomly shuffle each feature and compute the change in the model’s performance. The features which impact the performance the most are the most important one.</p>

<p>The permutation importance for Xgboost model can be easily computed:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>perm_importance</span> <span>=</span> <span>permutation_importance</span><span>(</span><span>xgb</span><span>,</span> <span>X_test</span><span>,</span> <span>y_test</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The visualization of the importance:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>sorted_idx</span> <span>=</span> <span>perm_importance</span><span>.</span><span>importances_mean</span><span>.</span><span>argsort</span><span>()</span>

<p><img src="https://mljar.com/blog/feature-importance-xgboost/xgboost_permutation_feature_importance.png" alt="Xgboost Permutation Feature Importance"></p>

<p>The permutation based importance is computationally expensive (for each feature there are several repeast of shuffling). The permutation based method can have problem with highly-correlated features. Let’s check the correlation in our dataset:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://mljar.com/blog/feature-importance-xgboost/correlation_map.png" alt="Correlation Heatmap"></p>

<p>Based on above results, I would say that it is safe to remove: <code>ZN</code>, <code>CHAS</code>, <code>AGE</code>, <code>INDUS</code>. Their importance based on permutation is very low and they are not highly correlated with other features (<code>abs(corr) &lt; 0.8</code>).</p>

<p>In AutoML package <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised"><code>mljar-supervised</code></a>, I do one trick for feature selection: I insert random feature to the training data and check which features have smaller importance than a random feature. I remove those from further training. The trick is very similar to one used in the <a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v036i11/v36i11.pdf">Boruta algorihtm</a>.</p>

<h2 id="feature-importance-computed-with-shap-values">Feature Importance Computed with SHAP Values</h2>

<p>The third method to compute feature importance in Xgboost is to use <a href="https://github.com/slundberg/shap">SHAP</a> package. It is model-agnostic and using the Shapley values from game theory to estimate the how does each feature contribute to the prediction.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>explainer</span> <span>=</span> <span>shap</span><span>.</span><span>TreeExplainer</span><span>(</span><span>xgb</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To visualize the feature importance we need to use <code>summary_plot</code> method:</p>

<p>The nice thing about <code>SHAP</code> package is that it can be used to plot more interpretation plots:</p>

<p>The computing feature importances with SHAP can be computationally expensive.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>The are 3 ways to compute the feature importance for the Xgboost:</p>

<ul>
  <li>built-in feature importance</li>
  <li>permutation based importance</li>
  <li>importance computed with SHAP values</li>
</ul>

<p>In my opinion, it is always good to check all methods and compare the results. It is important to check if there are highly correlated features in the dataset. They can break the whole analysis.</p>

<h2 id="important-notes">Important Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The more accurate model is, the more trustworthy computed importances are.</li>
  <li>Feature importance is an approximation of how important features are in the data.</li>
</ul>

	<div>
		<p><span>Online marketing is at the heart of every brand success nowadays. Businesses and brands are going digital, and there is no exception especially for crtypto startups and projects like STO. In this context we are having in mind building a positive brand impression and cultivating a massive audience base for your STO project. That said, you want to avail professional touch to this undertaking. This is where the role of </span><a href="https://www.espay.exchange/security-token-offering-development"><b>STO Development Services</b></a><span> come into play to render their services towards your desired STO solutions. You can always count on a STO Development Company for the professional touch needed to make entry into the digital marketing world. That said, let’s look into the impact you can expect from your social media and community to your STO project.</span></p>
	</div>
<h2>Expenditure Minimization</h2>
	<div>
		<p><span>With social media come massive opportunities to promote your STO project at a very low cost. This practice is quite the rage amongst business and brands across the world. You, too, can make use of this opportunity if you want yours odds of success to be on a par with others in the market ecosystem. Without spending a fortune you can promote your STO globally, cultivate a fan base for your project, and turn interested visitors into valuable investors by way of a productive engagement on your social media platforms.</span></p>
	</div>
<h2>Brand Empowerment</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>Since social media enables you to engage with a global audience your brand becomes all the more visible and generates trust among the audience. It is on social media where most people will get to know about your project. Majority of your audience would get wind of your brand through social media platforms. You do not find fund managers, folks from investment associations and scouts in a social setting, not to mention regular individuals who are into the likes of STOs. In that sense social media is a pool of sorts from where you draw investors towards your project. Billions of people are using the likes of Facebook, YouTube and so on. Amidst such a volume there should be enough folks to make your project successful.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the meantime, official announcement of your STO project on social media platforms and forums builds a positive brand impression for your STO project. Here, positive impression is everything.&nbsp; When people believe in you, you become empowered. Your brand becomes the talk of the town, more so your project where people can participate and make a difference.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;A big brand exposure for your STO project is the key to amassing a handsome capital for your venture. An organic social media following will create a ripple effect of exposure for your brand as followers will spread the word to others. You can regularly post and publicize updates on your company news such as progress of your STO project and how well things are going forward, thereby consolidating potential investors. Because this can serve as a valuable evaluation factor since it showcases that there is demand for the product, there is a vibrant community mood, and inviting growth dynamics.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Resources Optimization</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>Social media also gives you opportunities to enhance and optimize your resources for optimum promotion and exposure of your brand and project. The goal of going for social media in the first place is the objective of maximizing brand exposure. Therefore capitalizing the opportunities social media give, by enlisting and utilizing strategic resources, is only the logical thing to do. Your brand can have its own page on Facebook, Instagram, Linkediln, Medium, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit and Steemit amongst others. The benefits these social media tools can give you is off the charts. Your social media pages with rich content and robust following will help in attracting productive media attention, reviews and feedbacks by various listings and ratings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, the advantage that comes from utilising YouTube is huge. With promotional videos potential investors get to see the face of your company, your project and the technology you have in place, live Q&amp;A streams and video clips of informative speeches from conferences, as well as demonstration of the product. You can also create animated videos that shed light on the concept of the project. Also, you can use your Medium blogging account to post about your industry issues and explain the investment and legal aspects of your STO project. Linkediln can also act as a rich mine for potential investors as it has the most dense concentration of your target audience.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Market Enlargement</h2>
	<div>
		<div>
			<p><span>A sizable community is the key to securing a mass market. It enables potential investors to see that there are other interested users. It is within the community that trust building takes place, as well as exposure and cementing of brand identity. A well-managed community will go a long way in enhancing and consolidating market. A large community commands the attention and enthusiasm of investors. Somehow the community is the market itself. The buzz that your brand could generate within your community will define the chance of success for your project. The more the buzz is, the stronger your odds of achieving project success. It is this spirit of being ready for taking action, being set for proceeding and taking things forward, that will decide brand performance. That is to say a lively community spirit is at the heart of what it takes to make it big with your STO project.</span></p>
<p><span>Your community is where you gauge the pulse of potential demand for your product, and take actions to monitor and promote that demand by raising awareness. To that end, what goes a long way and proves strategic is publication of statistics on a regular basis to show the world the growth of users and the number of companies pitching in for the project, thereby attracting more audience. People want to see proof. They want to see positive signs. They want to be impressed. They want to see everyone is on board first so that they can be sure it is safe to follow suit and tread in with confidence and the knowledge that their investment will pay off. To that end, publishing anything that can be demonstrated by numbers and anything that shows growth in terms of demand will add great value to this aspect.</span></p>

		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Final Note</h2>
	<div>
		<p><span>Resources and opportunities are within your grasp. Social media brings it all. Your project can always avail them. What is important to note is that a failure to capitalize social media will result in poor brand/project performance. Because your counterparts, other companies, have made sure they do and a failure on the part of your company will result in being behind others.&nbsp; You do not want that. When other companies have gone digital and achieve massive milestones, you too want a share of that and catch up with others while, at the same time, making the most of it all and making efforts to be ahead of others nonetheless.</span></p>

</p>


<p>
I recently gave a talk at work to help introduce OpenBSD to my
colleagues. It's a broad introduction to the fundamentals of security
in OpenBSD, as well as some basic system administration tips and
suggestions anyone coming from a Linux background might find useful.
</p>
<p>
It's roughly split up into four sections; the history of OpenBSD,
what sets it apart from other operating systems, a guided
installation, and the system administration introduction.
</p>
<p>
In the original presentation the guided installation was done
interactively with the participants installing OpenBSD in a VM on
their machines to follow along with the slides.
</p>
<p>
I've tried my best to make it as accessible as possible while still
covering the most important beats. If you find any errors please let
me know so I can correct them, my contact info is on the <a href="https://blog.lambda.cx/about/">about</a> page.
</p>
<p>
I've corrected several small issues with the slides since the
recording. I've replaced the file name <code>/etc/mygateway</code> with <code>/etc/mygate</code>,
replaced the smartquotes with regular quotes, and removed the rebound
program, to name the biggest fixes. These corrections are available at
the slides linked below.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<date>Published: 2020-08-15 | Categories: <b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/engineering"><span>[»]</span> Engineering</a></b>, <b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/optics"><span>[»]</span> Optics</a></b>and<b><a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/archives/programming"><span>[»]</span> Programming</a></b>.</date>
<p>4 Months and 400 hours were necessary to bring life to the Spectrum Analyzer software that I am glad to announce to you today.</p>

<p>The software, which was initially modest, has grown into a fully functional program suite that covers most of the features traditionally implemented in commercial spectroscopy software. It includes single and live acquisition of spectra, loading/saving and export to clipboard, filtering, baseline removal and an automated calibration algorithm that I specially designed for the occasion. A screenshot of the software performing a calibration is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<figure><img src="http://www.thepulsar.be/images/spectrum-analyzer-software-for-openraman/screenshot.png"><figcaption>Figure 1 – Spectrum Analyzer software screenshot</figcaption></figure>

<p>A <a href="http://www.open-raman.org/build/software/" target="_blank"><span>[∞]</span> specific page</a> was created on the companion website to host the latest version of the software for download. As the rest of the project, the software is distributed under the open-source CERN OHL-W v2 license.</p>

<p>Although the software was designed to interface to the OpenRAMAN spectrometers, it will actually work with any dispersion-based spectrometers using PointGrey camera. It may even work with different camera manufacturers or with CCD linear array as long as you provide a DLL to interface to the hardware. The source code is given with a the DLL necessary to interface to PointGrey cameras, which can be used as an example on how to implement other camera types. The program even support multiple spectrometers connected to the same computer using each a different hardware! I don’t know if that will actually be useful but I made it as flexible as possible to avoid restrictions that would later block some users.</p>

<p>The software will work with either .CSV files or with a custom file format that I implemented using an upgraded version of the technique I presented <a href="http://www.thepulsar.be/article/implementing-object-persistence-in-c--"><span>[»]</span> here</a>. One of the most challenging difficulty I had to face was to allow 32 bits version of the software to load the files saved with the 64 bits version. This seems easy at glance but the original technique I developed do not cope well with that. One advantage of the custom file format is that the files contains the data, the blank and all the program settings (filtering, calibration etc.) so that you can tweak them later.</p>

<p>As explained above, the software also features an automated calibration procedure. You simply measured the spectra of a Neon or Argon-Mercury lamp, give the number of peaks that appears on screen and click on the “calibrate!” button. The algorithm is extremely robust to missing peaks and converge to a solution within a few seconds (4 seconds on my super-old laptop). By default, the algorithm will look on a very broad range of parameters, which basically cover the whole visible region of the spectrum, but advanced user can also tune the settings when necessary.</p>

<p>The software also implements many other features like time-lapsed acquisitions to monitor reactions, automatic saving of spectra, baseline removal algorithm and Savitzky-Golay filtering. The user can also freely choose between wavelength and Raman shifts axis, save and import calibration data etc. Also, the calibration will be saved inside the camera so if you connect the spectrometer to a different computer it will remain calibrated!</p>

<p>I invite you to test the software to discover all the possibilities. You don’t have to possess a spectrometer to run the software as you can import any .CSV file where the first column represents the x-axis and the second column the y-axis.</p>

<p>During the next weeks/months, I will post detailed articles on how the major features were implemented. The first article will be about the automated calibration procedure.</p>

<p>I would like to give a big thanks to <b>James</b> who has supported this post through Patreon. I also take the occasion to invite you to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/thepulsar" target="_blank"><span>[∞]</span> donate</a> through Patreon, even as little as $1.

Let's start with an important question...</p><p id="viewer-vcge"><span><em>How much do employees really accomplish in a 40+ hour work weeks? <strong>On avg. 15 hours... </strong></em></span></p><p id="viewer-a7ej"><strong>Wasted Time</strong></p><p id="viewer-8pnvh"><span><strong>-10 Hours/Week</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-fg1q7">Americans typically waste about five to ten hours each week, in their commute to work. That means they may be clocked in for 40 hours each week, but really they invest closer to 50 hours each week. </p><p id="viewer-4bphf"><strong>-10 Hours/Week</strong>
While at work corporate employees must foster and nurture their relationships with their coworkers. That's at least an hour or two of water cooler talk and gossip. </p><p id="viewer-95vrl"><span><strong>-15 Hours/Week</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-4352n">Then there are constraints of managing our existing relationships in our lives through social media and cellular devices that take two or three more hours of our time. </p><p id="viewer-fgpg6">That leaves about three hours of work that actually gets done each day, equalling on average 15 hours of productive work per week. I<span>t is next to impossible to expect employees to work productively for such long periods. You will not get their best work since science explains mental and physical fatigue will set in, no matter the amount of caffeine consumption.</span></p><p id="viewer-4nsh9"><span>Here's the tough part of the sell for the companies to digest. <strong>Pay your employee the same salary that you've paid them for the 40+ hours they currently work.</strong> Now wash that down with some cold hard facts. </span></p><p id="viewer-7kn60"><strong>Cold Hard Fact #1: </strong></p><p id="viewer-d6gkv">Most employees have been more productive since working from home.</p><p id="viewer-8lqkg"><strong>Cold Hard Fact #2:</strong></p><p id="viewer-bismg">Fatigue limits productive work.</p><p id="viewer-ep8oa"><strong>Cold Hard Fact #3:</strong></p><p id="viewer-e6bbk">Happy employees are more productive and perform significantly better.</p><p id="viewer-3k395"><strong>Monday - Work From Home 6 Hours</strong></p><p id="viewer-kf6g">Monday is work from home for six hours. This eliminates the 'Monday Blues' that most employees go through. Imagine after a relaxing Sunday, attending church and finishing errands to prepare for the week ahead, you get to work from home. Your employees become elated, generating more endorphins, which ultimately peaks productivity during this work period (and the rest of the week).</p><p id="viewer-b3cgk"><strong>Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday - Work In Office 6 Hours</strong></p><p id="viewer-2g9sq">Doing this eliminates fatigue of your employees. Ultimately, maximizing peak performance periods. Less time, equals more attention to detail and more focus, which maximizes this 18 hour period. This also increases revenue for coffee in the morning, and happy hours after work because more time is available.

		<p>I believe everyone is familiar with the popular saying that one can have 10 years of experience or 10 x 1 (the same) year of professional experience. If you don't get the difference - it's all about being exposed to <u>new experiences</u> (that can be substantial in spurring your personal development) for 10 years versus being stuck for 10 years with something that could have been <u>fresh and inspiring for 1 year at most</u> (because in all the subsequent years one just re-applies the already acquired knowledge thoughtlessly).</p><p>To simplify the following consideration, let's call the 2nd group (10 x 1 year of experience) the <strong>"old juniors"</strong> - mainly because they appear stuck in the same, narrow spectrum of limited experiences that constraint their personal development. They always felt so good being "right" (not questioned by the rest of the organization), that right now they find it their innate privilege (the mark of their status within the org).</p><p>Until now, I've used this concept to illustrate why the job market valuation of certain individuals with similar tenure may differ a lot. But that's not the whole story. Please keep in mind that the global job market is very different from local work environments (stating it plainly - particular companies). While in general the "old juniors" are typically a pitiful group of people who can't understand why no-one (except their former employer) wants to fulfill their financial expectations, there may be companies where the "old juniors" <strong>form the whole "top tier"</strong> of engineers on the company (and co-define the technical vision for the whole enterprise).</p><p><strong>Old Junior</strong> = <strong>Low Overall XP</strong> + <strong>High Local XP</strong></p><p>Even if some Young Buck appears on the horizon, it's easy to set her/him back in place, by shifting the balance of importance towards Local XP (being familiar with semi-obfuscated legacy stuff).</p><p>That's a very dangerous scenario I haven't covered at all until now. It usually happens when the best engineers in the company are never challenged, never face the external verification, are not measured vs market-wide measures, standards &amp; benchmarks. They do fine locally, because the organization doesn't know any better. There are no external stimuli that could either re-align their views or inspire innovation. Let me give you an example: they've never seen how to implement observability properly (because they've always worked in an organization totally ignorant of observability's existence), so it has never been on their agenda.</p><p>In many organizations, the longer the "old juniors" remain at the spearhead of the engineering organization, the worse are the outcomes. Their position becomes virtually inviolable, their opinions are treated (unquestioningly) as facts, they are simply untouchable. And - in the end - the organization's point of view remains limited as well. The current state is satisfying enough, because no-one knows (has experienced personally) that things could have been significantly improved (due to a little bit of "out-of-the-box" thinking).</p><p>That's why EVERY engineering organization should keep looking for <strong>an external talent</strong> (to refresh/reset org's perspectives), not only in terms of fresh &amp; adaptable juniors (ambitious, hungry, open-minded, eager for experimentation), but also experience hires who could provide completely new standpoints &amp; cause some disturbance in so far calm waters. These people should be given enough space and autonomy to enrich the work environment before they get "tamed" and overwhelmed with the luggage of local inertia.</p>

                    <p>A quick post to write about one of my favourite ES6 feature - Spread operator.</p><h3 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h3><p>Official (and frankly boring) definition from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax">Mozilla docs</a>:</p><blockquote>Spread syntax (...) allows an iterable such as an array expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected.</blockquote><p>I don't blame you for dozing off after reading that definition. It doesn't necessarily enthuse you or inform you of its usefulness.

<section>
<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
<p>
IHK/McKernel is a light-weight multi kernel operating system designed specifically for 
high performance computing. It runs Linux and McKernel, a lightweight kernel (LWK), 
side-by-side on compute nodes primarily aiming at the followings: <br>
</p><ul>
<li>Provide scalable and consistent execution of large-scale parallel applications and at the same time rapidly adapt to exotic hardware and new programming models</li>
<li>Provide efficient memory and device management so that resource contention and data movement are minimized at the system level</li>
<li>Eliminate OS noise by isolating OS services in Linux and provide jitter free execution on the LWK</li>
<li>Support the full POSIX/Linux APIs by selectively offloading system calls to Linux</li>
<ul>

</ul></ul></section>

<section>
<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<p>
With the growing complexity of high-end supercomputers, it has become indisputable that the current system software stack will face significant challenges as we look forward to exascale and beyond. The necessity to deal with extreme degree of parallelism, heterogeneous architectures, multiple levels of memory hierarchy, power constraints, etc. advocates operating systems that can rapidly adapt to new hardware requirements, and that can support novel programming paradigms and runtime systems. On the other hand, a new class of more dynamic and complex applications are also on the horizon, with an increasing demand for application constructs such as in-situ analysis, workflows, elaborate monitoring and performance tools. This complexity relies not only on rich features of POSIX, but also on the Linux APIs (such as the /proc, /sys filesystems, etc.) in particular.
</p>
</section>

<br>
<h5><i>Two Traditional Approaches</i></h5>

<p>
Traditionally, lightweight operating systems specialized for HPC followed two approaches to tackle 
the high degree of parallelism so that scalable execution of large-scale applications can be delivered. 
In the full weight kernel (FWK) approach, a full Linux environment is taken as the basis, and features 
that inhibit attaining HPC scalability are removed, i.e., making it lightweight. The pure lightweight 
kernel (LWK) approach, on the other hand, starts from scratch and effort is undertaken to add sufficient 
functionality so that it provides a familiar API, typically something close to that of a general purpose 
OS, while at the same time it retains the desired scalability and reliability attributes. 
Neither of these approaches yields a fully Linux compatible environment.
</p>


<section>
<br>
<h5><i>The Multi-kernel Approach</i></h5>

<p>
A hybrid approach recognized recently by the system software community is to run Linux simultaneously 
with a lightweight kernel on compute nodes and multiple research projects are now pursuing this direction. The basic idea is that simulations run on an HPC tailored lightweight kernel, ensuring the necessary isolation for noiseless execution of parallel applications, but Linux is leveraged so that the full POSIX API is supported. Additionally, the small code base of the LWK can also facilitate rapid prototyping for new, exotic hardware features. Nevertheless, the questions of how to share node resources between the two types of kernels, where do device drivers execute, how exactly do the two kernels interact with each other and to what extent are they integrated, remain subjects of ongoing debate.

<p>
At the heart of the stack is a low-level software infrastructure called Interface for Heterogeneous Kernels (IHK). 
IHK is a general framework that provides capabilities for partitioning resources in a many-core 
environment (e.g.,CPU cores and physical memory) and it enables management of lightweight kernels. 
IHK can allocate and release host resources dynamically and no reboot of the host machine is required 
when altering configuration. IHK also provides a low-level inter-kernel messaging infrastructure, which 
we named as Inter-Kernel Communication (IKC) layer.
An architectural overview of the main system components is shown in Figure 1.

<p>
McKernel is a lightweight kernel written from scratch. 
It is designed for HPC and it is booted from IHK. McKernel retains a binary compatible ABI with Linux, 
however, it implements only a small set of performance sensitive system calls and the rest are 
delegated to Linux. Specifically, McKernel has its own memory management, it supports processes 
and multi-threading with a simple round-robin cooperative (tick-less) scheduler, and it implements 
signaling. 
It also allows inter-process memory mappings and it provides interfaces to hardware performance counters.

<h4 id="functionality">Functionality</h4>

An overview of some of the principal functionalities of the IHK/McKernel stack is provided below. 
<h5><i>System Call Offloading</i></h5>

<p>
System call forwarding in McKernel is implemented as follows.
When an offloaded system call occurs, McKernel marshals the system call number along with its arguments 
and sends a message to Linux via a dedicated IKC channel. The corresponding proxy process running on 
Linux is by default waiting for system call requests through an <b>ioctl()</b> call into IHK’s 
system call delegator kernel module. The delegator kernel module’s IKC interrupt handler wakes up the 
proxy process, which returns to userspace and simply invokes the requested system call. 
Once it obtains the return value, it instructs the delegator module to send the result back to McKernel, 
which subsequently passes the value to user-space. 
The system call offloading mechanism is shown in Figure 2.<br>

<section>
<br>
<h5><i>Unified Address Space</i></h5>

<p>
The unified address space model in IHK/McKernel ensures that offloaded system calls can seamlessly 
resolve arguments even in case of pointers. This mechanism is depicted in Figure 3 and it is 
implemented as follows. <br>

</p><table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>

</td>

<b>Figure 3.:</b> <i>Unified address space between McKernel processes and their corresponding proxy</i> 
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
First, the proxy process is compiled as a position independent binary, which 
enables us to map the code and data segments specific to the proxy process to an address range which is
explicitly excluded from McKernel’s user space. The red box on the right side of the figure 
demonstrates the excluded region. Second, the entire valid virtual address range of McKernel’s 
application user-space is covered by a special mapping in the proxy process for which we use a pseudo 
file mapping in Linux. 
This mapping is indicated by the green box on the left side of Figure 3.

	<p>I host Google fonts locally not only to load them faster but also to take advantage of font loading strategies which goes directly to the heart of creating the ultimate user experience.</p>
<p>Hosting Google fonts locally to boost speed is one thing. Knowing how to load them with an effective strategy that strikes a perfect balance between performance and user perception is another.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, browsers are not quite where we'd like them to be in terms how they handle custom fonts which leaves us to our own devices when deciding on a suitable font loading strategy.</p>
<p>While some of these strategies are still nowhere near perfect, one thing remains certain. You'll need to host Google fonts locally if you want to retain maximum control.</p>

	<p>Without intervention font loading is primarily handled by the browser.</p>
<p>If your preferred font fails to load due to a slow download, the browser will mitigate this by loading a fallback (system) font.</p>
<p>A system font is a font used by your operating system to display text. Common system fonts include Arial, Times New Roman and Georgia.</p>
<p>A fallback font is basically a preferred system font that you specify.</p>
<p><picture><source data-swift-image-lazyload="true" data-srcset="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/specifying-fonts-and-fallbacks.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="specifying preferred google font plus fallback fonts" data-src="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/specifying-fonts-and-fallbacks.png" data-srcset="" data-sizes="" data-swift-image-lazyload="true" data-style="" data-l="" src="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/specifying-fonts-and-fallbacks.png"></picture></p>
<p>Here is a table illustrating the behavior adopted by some of the popular browsers.</p>
<p><picture><source data-swift-image-lazyload="true" data-srcset="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/browser-specific-timeout-to-load-fallback-font.png.webp" type="image/webp"><img alt="times that browsers wait before loading fallback fonts" data-src="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/browser-specific-timeout-to-load-fallback-font.png" data-srcset="" data-sizes="" data-swift-image-lazyload="true" data-style="" data-l="" src="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/browser-specific-timeout-to-load-fallback-font.png"></picture></p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome, Opera and Firefox timeout after 3 seconds. At this point, text will be displayed using the fallback font. As soon as the primary font is available, the text will be re-rendered. Herein lies the problem of FOUT and reflows. Text rendered using the fallback font is referred to as a flash of unformatted text (FOUT). A reflow occurs when the primary font becomes available and the text is re-rendered. Not sure about you but I've experienced this often and found it to be disruptive.</li>
<li>Internet Explorer renders text immediately due to a zero second timeout. A fallback font is used if the primary font is unavailable and re-rendering takes place once the primary font is ready. The benefit of FOUT is that, at very least, the user is faced with text immediately. However, this comes at the expense of a perfect user experience.</li>
<li>Safari has no timeout leaving users without text until such time that the primary font is downloaded and ready for use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to the 3 second timeout with Chrome, Opera and Firefox (or no timeout in the case with Safari), a slow connection or a delay in the Google font download will likely leave users with a flash of invisible text (FOIT).</p>
<p>To add fuel to the fire, our font loading strategy is limited.</p>
<p>The relatively new <code>font-display: block | swap | fallback | optional | auto</code> descriptor allows you to control how your font renders <strong>before</strong> it is fully loaded but is by no means a perfect solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>block</strong> - FOIT + infinite swap period. The invisible fallback text is replaced as soon as the designated font is available.</li>
<li><strong>swap</strong> - FOUT + infinite swap period. The fallback font is replaced as soon as the primary font is ready for us.</li>
<li><strong>fallback</strong> - Almost imperceptible block period (&lt;= 100ms) + small swap period (FOUT + swap).</li>
<li><strong>optional</strong> - Almost imperceptible block period (&lt;= 100ms) + no swap. Great for best user experience where content is preferential to aesthetics.</li>
<li><strong>auto</strong> - based on user agent (browser) strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: Prior to May 2019 the use of the font-display descriptor could only be achieved when hosting Google fonts locally due to the CSS being hosted on your own server.</p>
<p>OK, with a very basic understanding of font loading, let's forge on.</p>

		<div>
	<p>What I've learned from experience is that FOIT is not always FOIT.</p>
<p>Sound cryptic?</p>
<p>Consider a scenario where a site uses white text over a dark image.</p>
<p>Where the internet connection is fast the text may load concurrently with, or just before, the image. No problems here.</p>
<p>But if the connection happens to slow down temporarily or even sometimes on first load of a site in a browser with a clean cache and/or where one's PC is also busy with some background process/es, it can appear as if&nbsp; the header and navigation loads before the text and image, leaving a mostly blank screen.</p>
<p>That said, the text may, in fact have loaded but in the absence of an image the white text is invisible on a white background. So what one may think is FOIT, may in fact have been white text on a white background.</p>
<p>The solution is to use a solid color overlay that will allow text to show while waiting for the image to load. The image may load after milliseconds but it's still preferable to an almost blank screen. The other option is to change the text color.</p>

		<div>
	<p>For starters, the more HTTP requests to external sites needed to render your page/s, the slower your site will load. To exacerbate this, scripts and CSS are render blocking so poor optimization coupled with a slow server and a bloated theme could prove disastrous to user experience.</p>
<p>Additionally, being called by CSS, Google fonts are no exception to the render blocking conundrum.</p>
<p>Render blocking occurs when the parsing of HTML needed to render the page is paused (blocked) temporarily until all scripts and CSS complete their processes.</p>
<p>Besides a number of granular optimizations, <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/optimization/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the most important factors affecting page speed</a> (in this order) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosting</li>
<li>Theme Choice</li>
<li>Caching</li>

<div data-node="5f325db632936">

		<div>
	<p>A fast site is crucial for optimal font loading and this starts with hosting.</p>
<p>No amount of optimizing can compensate for a lack of speed.</p>
<p>And because the whole objective of hosting Google fonts locally is to improve user experience, it would be counterproductive to consider unless you can outperform font delivery provided by Google's cloud servers and CDN.</p>
<p>A shared server is highly unlikely to outperform Google's servers.</p>
<p>I used to host with Siteground but because I wasn't seeing the type of speed I wanted, I switched to Cloudways. This site is served from a Digital Ocean server in New York and it's blazing fast.</p>
<p>On top of that, Siteground's renewal fees are crazy.</p>
<p>With Cloudways you can get a <a title="Cloudways" href="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/go/cloudways/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">hosting plan for as little as $10 per month</a> which will allow at least as many site visits as Siteground's best shared hosting plan at $35 per month.</p>
<p>And that gives you fully dedicated resources and the benefit of Pay-As-You-Go pricing, i.e. No Contracts.</p>

	<p>A lightweight, well coded and optimized theme with a good caching plugin like WP Rocket is the next most important speed factor.</p>
<p>I don't venture past anything but a <a title="Studiopress" href="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/go/studiopress/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">StudioPress theme</a> (Genesis Framework) because there's just nothing that comes close in terms of optimization, i.e. clean coding, zero bloat plus the ability to create any type of site. And while you may expect a theme of such caliber to be pricey, they're actually cheaper.</p>
<p>The licence provides you with <strong>unlimited everything</strong>. So for a <strong>once off cost</strong> you get:</p>

<li>Lifetime updates</li>
<li>Lifetime support and ...</li>
<li>You can use the theme on as many sites as you like.</li>

	<p>Caching is absolutely crucial when it comes to font loading. While there's certainly no shortage of caching plugins, there are only two contenders in my view:</p>
<ul>
<li>WP Rocket.</li>
<li>Swift Performance Pro.</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="WPRocket" href="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/go/wprocket/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WP Rocket</a> is rock solid and has been around for way longer than Swift Performance Pro.</p>
<p>As a result, they've long since ironed out all the small bugs and it's also really simple to setup and works out of the box.</p>

</ul>
<p>Swift Performance Pro offers more granular control. However, it's better suited to those who have a bit of knowledge and experience when it comes to caching.</p>
<p>If you really want to harness it's full features you'll need to know what you're doing and be prepared to <a href="https://www.wpmediamastery.com/swift-performance-review-and-settings/">experiment until you find the settings that give you the best results</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Savings accounts allow you to save money with a regulated financial institution and earn some interest. There are several types of savings accounts, but they mostly revolve around three themes - easy access, notice and fixed savings. Easy access accounts allow you to withdraw your money whenever you want. Notice accounts require you to give your provider a few days' notice before making a withdrawal. Fixed accounts allow you to save your money for a fixed period at a guaranteed interest rate. This rate is usually slightly higher than notice or easy access accounts.<br>‍<br><strong>Your money is protected up to £85,000:</strong><br>When you save money in an authorised financial institution, your savings are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). This means if the financial institution goes bust, you can claim your money back up to £85,000 per financial institution (£170,000 for joint accounts). So, if you have a lot of money to save, it might be wise to spread it across different financial institutions. We recommend you save at most £83,000 in one institution, leaving some room for interest.<br>‍<br>Some of these financial institutions have a shared licence, which means they share their licence with another institution. If you put your money in two institutions that share a licence and both go bust, you'll only be entitled to a maximum of £85,000 from the FSCS. Examples of financial institutions that share a licence are Halifax, Bank of Scotland and BM Savings (all three share the same licence).<br>‍<br><strong>Most people won't pay taxes on savings' income:</strong><br>Depending on your income tax band, you may not have to pay taxes on interest earned on savings. For example, basic-rate taxpayers can earn up to £1,000 in interest tax-free every year. Higher-rate taxpayers can earn up to £500. Additional-rate taxpayers have no tax-free allowance. If you are interested in tax-free accounts, have a look at <a href="https://www.koody.co/saving/isa">ISAs</a>.<br>‍<br>Below, you'll find the easy access, notice and fixed-rate savings accounts which pay the highest interest at the moment. These are not recommendations. They are simply the savings accounts with highest interest rates. All financial institutions we list are regulated by the FCA, and their savings accounts are protected by the FSCS up to £85,000.<br></p><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ea8e1014488c25d7742640f/5f227e4d58bbc37bc1507dec_savings-accounts-sign-500x500px.png" alt="Savings accounts are almost tax free" height="300"></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>I want to show you some ways to represent puzzles with four spatial dimensions. Even though the fourth dimension is used to make the puzzles more exciting, 4D puzzles can show the simplicity of adding one dimension. Playing these puzzles helps visualizing more dimensions than the three we notice in day-to-day life.</p>
<h2>Dimensions</h2>
<p>If you don't look too closely, a grain of sand is a 0D object, a thread 1D, a piece of paper 2D, and a block of wood 3D.</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTQ5NjEucG5n/original/gLK56i.png"></p>
<p>In a 1D world you can only move forward and backward, in 2D you can also move left and right. Moving diagonally is a combination of the others, so doesn't count as a new direction. In 3D you can also go up and down, and for 4D we add two more directions.</p>
<p>To check the number of dimensions of space, get as many sticks as possible perpendicular to each other (as seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KC32Vymo0Q#t=4m50" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>). You get to three in this universe, if your sticks aren't too fancy.</p>
<h2>Projections</h2>
<p>What's the use of talking about four dimensions in a 3D world? The same as talking about 3D games or any other seemingly 3D thing on your 2D computer screen, TV, canvas or paper. Things can feel 3D or 4D, even though the final product is 2D. Squashing an object to lower dimensions, like taking a picture or making a shadow on a wall, is called projection. You can always project, project, project, all the way down to zero dimensions. Here is a projection of a ball:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTU2MDEucG5n/original/qq3UFp.png"></p>
<p>and here's the projection from the top of that projection:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAzNDkucG5n/original/Q3XkUN.png"></p>
<h2>Slices</h2>
<p>Our human eyes use projections, but wouldn't it be nicer to be more alien and look at things like an MRI-scanner? Instead of having your vision blocked by the surface of objects, let's slice them up so you can look inside them. You have to choose how thinly you want to slice things. More slices means there is less space per slice in your field of vision, but less slices means you might miss things in between your slices. Here is the sliced up ball, which turns out to have an orange inside:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTU2MDIucG5n/original/mFaZ9u.png"></p>
<h2>Pre-chopped space</h2>
<p>Games are easier to slice up if the playing field is made of separate squares, like chess or checkers, where you jump between places. (These are technically 1D, but the 2D description is simpler.) You can then give each square a name or number:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxMjcucG5n/original/GSC5NU.png">,<br>which can be sliced up like this:<br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxNDIucG5n/original/RrCPkZ.png">.<br>The left square in the left slice is next to the left square in the right slice, so 1 is still next to 2 and 3; 2 is still next to 1 and 4, etc. This doesn't accomplish much, but now we have room for a third dimension on our 2D screen:<br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxNTYucG5n/original/IH8VTb.png">,<br>where 1 is now next to 2, 3 and 5. 7 is next to 5, 8 and 3. To get to 4D, we can also put slices vertically:<br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NjAxNzkucG5n/original/J5%2FNYB.png">.<br>Now 1 has four neighbors: 2, 3, 5 and 9, because 5 and 9 are in the same position in adjacent slices. This is like putting two cubes next to each other, and acting like the same positions inside the two cubes are adjacent. </p>
<h2>Mazes</h2>
<p>The most basic way to explore a 4D space is to just walk around. To make the walking around a little bit more interesting, people make mazes.</p>
<h2>Some examples</h2>
<p>Going on a quest to find examples of 4D mazes and puzzles leads you through some great old-school web pages like <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth.htm</a>. There are multiple people who seemingly made it their life's work to collect information about 4D things and mazes. A handy start is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_four-dimensional_games" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_four-dimensional_games</a>.<br>Different types of representations are in that list. First, there's the projection of higher dimensional things on a 2D screen seen in <a href="http://superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">http://superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm</a>. </p>
<p>Then there's the option of taking a 3D slice of a 4D world: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t4aKJuKP0Q" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0t4aKJuKP0Q</a>. The maker of that video, Marc ten Bosch, has done a lot of work in this field, and is now working on <a href="https://miegakure.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Miegakure</a>. Miegakure stands out because it's more polished than other 4D games, and you can smoothly walk around, instead of step by step. </p>
<p>Finally, instead of slicing just once, you can use the 2D grid of 2D slices we've seen before. This 4D crossword puzzle is a simple example: <a href="http://www.ing.iac.es/~crb/misc/xwd65.html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.ing.iac.es/~crb/misc/xwd65.html</a>, and there's more to be found here: <a href="http://old.nklein.com/products/54321/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://old.nklein.com/products/54321/</a>. Here's a 2x2x2x2 solved crossword:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTUzNTgucG5n/original/%2F0qVeK.png">.<br>Notice words&nbsp;like&nbsp;ai&nbsp;(a&nbsp;type&nbsp;of&nbsp;sloth),&nbsp;ti&nbsp;and&nbsp;no.&nbsp;(aa&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=aa+lava&amp;t=ffab&amp;iar=images&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images" rel="nofollow noopener">rough lava</a>. <a href="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/2-letter-words.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">This list of 2-letter words</a> was helpful.)
</p>
<h2>Triangles and big wally squares</h2>
<p>If you want to have a clear overview of a 4D maze, this 2D grid of 2D slices is often used. There are two ways these mazes are represented: Spaces with lines in between, or having walls and open squares take up the same amount of space. The first one seems more natural for drawing mazes: you take a blank piece of paper and draw walls on it using your pen lines. The second one is like using graph paper and coloring in squares for walls. <br><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTUwNzMucG5n/original/xdpYOa.png"></p>
<p>To walk around in 4D, the thin wall system needs to show possible moves between slices. Usually triangles point in the direction of the square to jump to (like <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/mazes/comments/71syq5/10x10x10x10_4d_maze/" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>). In the next picture, the way from 1 to 3 is blocked, but 2 has a triangle pointing to the right, so you can reach 4 from there. The triangle to the left in 4 also allows to go back to 2 from 4. (Everybody colors these triangles, so I do too.)</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNDExNDgucG5n/original/aBTxbK.png"></p>
<p>The thick wall maze expands more naturally to four dimensions when using 2D slices. With square walls, you can move to the same position on adjacent squares. To show a passage, you can show an absent wall on the next slice. This is the system used in <a href="https://trudieprod.itch.io/boxpusher-4d">Boxpusher 4D</a>. </p>
<p> In these examples you can follow the same route from the top left all the way through the maze:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNDExNTAucG5n/original/kMAvRk.png">.</p>
<p>Here is the route:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzM5NTU0NjAucG5n/original/z6RPSJ.png">.</p>
<p>With thin walls, you need a lot of triangles for a big empty room. Thick walls are thus better for games which have more open spaces:
</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNDExNTIucG5n/original/lu7xCn.png"></p>
<p>Thick wall games also feel less like you're teleporting, although that still is an issue in getting that 4D feeling.</p>
<h2>Making it feel 4D</h2>
<p>Letting things feel 4D instead of some weird thing where you teleport around is quite challenging. One thing that helps is switching dimensions around to show that you get the same puzzle in a different view. Here is the same maze as before to the left, and on the right a version with the dimensions switched:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzQwNTA3MTYucG5n/original/IKuKDY.png">.</p>
<p>On the right, the first six steps are still in a U-shape, but now you jump between slices. Next, where in the left maze you jump two slices to the right, in the right maze there are two little steps. The same steps in both mazes are shown in green.</p>
<p>Something else that works well is when you can't see everything on your screen at once, like with a 10x10x10x10 map on a 4x4x4x4 grid, and you scroll in different directions.</p>
<h2>6D? 20D?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can expand this approach to n dimensions. You do need enough screen space. And it probably gets confusing.</p></section></div>]]>

<p><em>This post is part of a series of articles on </em><a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/managing-managers/"><em>managing managers</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>Before we dive further into techniques and tools for budding managers of managers, it’s worth spending some time to get to know what sort of progression may lie ahead on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1weNoeSUfHYOHy9sHKad_ax6qrVXNFlP4ieTwaRll70M/edit#gid=668888240">management track</a> once you begin to go beyond managing just one team.</p>



<p>In this article we’ll step through some of the common job titles that are used for higher level management track positions in technology companies, with reference to the career tracks that we created at <a href="https://www.brandwatch.com/">Brandwatch</a>. We created these so that we had transparent career progression paths both for engineers already working at the company, but also for those that were applying for our vacancies so they could see how they could grow with time if they got the job.</p>



<p>We’ll not go into the CTO role in this article because we believe it’s fairly well understood: you run a department, either by being promoted up through the management track – sometimes over the course of a whole career – or by being the founding lead engineer at a company. However, the levels in between are often a bit of a mystery, so we’ll spend some time untangling them. It should give you a better idea of what may lie ahead for you if you choose this path, but also better understand what people at your current company are doing in those kinds of roles.</p>



<p>The job titles on the management track of most good technology companies are fairly standardized. You have Engineering Managers, Directors of Engineering, VPs of Engineering and then the CTO. However, what the role actually <em>entails</em> is a function of the size of the company. For example, a Director of Engineering at a medium sized company may have a few small teams reporting to them, but in the biggest companies (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech#FAANG">FAANG</a>), that same job title may entail running a division of 250 people. As such, when switching to very large companies, one may have to take what looks like a job title “demotion”, even though the role that they are doing is larger.</p>



<p>As such, in this article we’ll look at each of the job titles and see what it might mean at a start-up or smaller company, then compare that to the equivalent position at some of the largest companies in our industry. This should give you an idea of not only what the role entails, but where you might best begin to think about your next step. Would you, for example, prefer to take on a larger role with more autonomy at a smaller company, or do you want to begin to establish yourself in larger technology companies by making the sideways step first then working your way up? Different folks have different motivations.</p>



<h2>The Three Levels of War</h2>



<p>In order to better frame the job titles below, there’s a neat, albeit scary-sounding level definition from the military: <a href="https://www.doctrine.af.mil/Portals/61/documents/Volume_1/V1-D34-Levels-of-War.pdf"><em>the three levels of war</em></a>. I’m not a military person by any means, but they’ve certainly thought quite hard about leadership topics over the years.</p>



<p>These three levels are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Tactical</strong>: guiding others to win individual battles and engagements.</li><li><strong>Operational</strong>: planning, conducting, sustaining and adapting campaigns to accomplish strategic goals.</li><li><strong>Strategic</strong>: defining outcomes that form strategic goals: <em>why</em> and <em>with what </em>we will achieve.</li></ul>



<p>We can use these to better frame what it means to move up the management track.</p>



<h2>Engineering Manager</h2>



<p>An Engineering Manager (EM) will typically manage one team, of usually around 5-7 people. If you are an individual contributor, it is sometimes tricky to get that first EM role, since companies will sometimes favour hiring candidates who have managed people before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our level definition, EMs are <strong>tactical</strong>. They guide one team to ship their part of the whole. What that part of the whole is will have typically been defined for them.</p>



<p>One strategy for getting your first EM role is to join a fast growing company as an IC with a view to converting, ensuring that you practice and demonstrate skills that show you have suitability for leadership. This may involve nominating yourself to lead projects, mentoring others, influencing decisions and continually building a track record for shipping good quality software. If you’re not already working for a company where EM roles become available regularly, then it’s much harder to progress as you’ll have to apply elsewhere.</p>



<p>This website goes into the EM role in detail (see the <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/management-101/">Management 101</a> and <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/growth/">Levelling up</a> sections), and <a href="https://www.theengineeringmanager.com/book">I’ve even written a book about it</a>! So I won’t go into it further here. However, what’s important to know is that it’s that crucial first rung on the management ladder where you can begin to gain the experience that you need to consider moving upwards towards managing managers. Everyone’s gotta cut their teeth somewhere.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that you may also see the <em>Senior</em> Engineering Manager job title. Typically this means that somebody is managing one team, but has much more tenure and experience than an EM without the Senior prefix. Larger companies may offer that progression step as a way of ensuring that EMs have more opportunities for career growth that don’t immediately involve taking the plunge into Director, since that requires more org chart movement. Additionally, for EMs that enjoy being able to mix technical contribution and management, the EM to Senior EM career arc can be long-lasting and highly rewarding. They can grow in influence, seniority and impact and still contribute code.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Director of Engineering</h2>



<p>The Director of Engineering role is typically where you first begin to manage managers. I mentioned at the beginning of this article that I would explore what the role means at start-ups and at larger companies, however it’s rare to see Director of Engineering at start-ups, since it’s very much an artifact of middle management at medium to large companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In our level definition, Directors are <strong>operational</strong>. They coordinate and execute multiple efforts within a larger strategic goal. Typically they have more control over the <em>how</em>, but the <em>why</em> has already been decided for them.</p>



<p>The role itself varies across companies. However, there are often some common threads in how it is defined as the next major progression step from EM:</p>



<ul><li><strong>You begin to manage other managers</strong>. This means you can progress towards a reasonably sized org. Assuming that an EM may have 7 or so direct reports that are ICs, the largest team that an EM could therefore manage is that same number. However, given that a Director manages managers, they could have 7 or so managers reporting to them, each with their own team. That’s a lot more people to consider, steer and grow.</li><li><strong>You typically are accountable for an operational area</strong>. What this means is that you may find yourself with a comma after your job title, followed by some words that describe the area that you own. For example, a <em>Director of Engineering, Data Infrastructure</em> could run multiple teams that build and maintain the core storage infrastructure of the application. A <em>Director of Engineering, Fizzbuzz</em> could run an org consisting of all the engineering teams producing new features in the Fizzbuzz application, one of many applications in the whole Foobar application suite.</li><li><strong>You step away from driving the vehicle</strong>. Whilst EMs usually continue to write code for their team – although typically less on the critical path – Directors of Engineering will usually involve themselves much less, if at all, in committing code. Instead, their focus will be ensuring their teams are productive, coaching their managers, working on the combined engineering roadmap for their area, and maximizing efficiency and collaboration. If we use Andy Grove’s management equation of the <em>output of a manager = the output of their team + the output of those they influence</em>, it becomes clear that there are higher leverage activities than being in the weeds of an IDE and committing code. Instead, deciding what to do and what not to do, connecting and sharing information with peers and delegating effectively through their teams will always result in more output.</li></ul>



<p>So how does this role come about? I’ve often seen it happen in two ways.</p>



<p>The first is that it occurs naturally through <em>growth</em>. As a department hires more people, EMs begin to acquire more direct reports that they can effectively manage. Teams get too big. Thus teams split, and the need for the org chart to maintain a logical grouping creates gaps for people to begin managing managers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although this presents a great opportunity, it’s important not to make yourself redundant if you happen to be the person getting promoted into the Director role. For example, if you end up splitting an overly large team in two, promote an EM to run one of them and report to you first whilst you run the other one. This way you can gradually ease away from driving the vehicle, which gives you a longer period of time in your comfort zone of running one team whilst delegating another to a new manager who will need ramping up.</p>



<p>The second way is that Director of Engineering roles at the biggest technology companies are an entry point for experienced external managers of managers to begin to establish themselves in bigger companies. For example, someone who has experience of being a Director (but often above) at a medium-sized company may get recruited externally in order to begin to scale a new initiative, or to provide stable engineering management for an acquired team that the larger company wants to retain and grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not uncommon to see CTOs who have run departments of around 100 join big technology companies to run a smaller team with a plan to grow rapidly. From what I have learned talking to contacts, Directors of Engineering at FAANG companies can run orgs in the hundreds of people, whereas VPs have<em> thousands</em> reporting up into them.</p>



<p>All of this sounds very exciting and important, but the step upwards to Director of Engineering is where an EM must <em>firmly</em> commit to management and coaching being their …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

August 17, 2020 | https://www.francescmm.com/new-release-of-gitqlient-1-2-0/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.francescmm.com/new-release-of-gitqlient-1-2-0/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                            
<p><strong>I’m happy to announce the release of GitQlient 1.2.0</strong></p>



<p>Three months after the <a href="https://www.francescmm.com/new-gitqlient-release-v1-1-0/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">last minor release</a>&nbsp;I present a new GitQlient 1.2.0 with some fixes, several improvements and a lot of new features. For this release I’ve put the main focus in the UI/UX. That includes both the new features and the improvements of the existing ones.</p>



<p>During this development phase, part of the UI changes have happened in the diff widget by providing multiple views for the changes. I’ve also added a tiny text editor with syntax highlight (for C/C++ for now). Other UI/UX changes are the possibility to minimize the branches widget and to pin repositories. All of this has been marinated with an improvement in the way the settings are stored.</p>



<p>Finally, it is worth to mention the <em>tech preview </em>of GitHub/GitLab integration where you can create issues, pull/merge requests as well as see the status of those in the graph view. This is a new path that I’ll explore in the future where I have other ideas about the integration of third party apps. As a complement, from now on, GitQlient will notify you when a new version is available!</p>



<h2>The binaries</h2>



<p>You can find the binaries for GitQlient 1.2.0 on the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/francescmm/GitQlient/releases/tag/v1.2.0" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">release section</a>&nbsp;on the GitHub repo:</p>



<ul><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/francescmm/GitQlient/releases/download/v1.2.0/GitQlient-1.2.0-x86_64.AppImage" target="_blank">GitQlient for Linux</a>&nbsp;(AppImage)</li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/francescmm/GitQlient/releases/download/v1.2.0/GitQlientInstaller-1.2.0.exe" target="_blank">GitQlient for Windows</a>&nbsp;(Installer)</li><li><a href="https://github.com/francescmm/GitQlient/releases/download/v1.2.0/GitQlient-1.2.0.dmg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitQlient for OSX</a>&nbsp;(DMG)</li><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/francescmm/GitQlient/archive/v1.2.0.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Download Source code</a></li></ul>



<h2>What’s new in GitQlient 1.2.0?</h2>



<p>The new version includes a lot of things:</p>



<ul><li>Pinned tabs</li><li>GitHub integration (tech preview)</li><li>Tiny text editor</li><li>New diff for the WIP</li><li>Minimalist branches widget</li><li>Refactored the diff view</li><li>Bright colours schema</li><li>Update notifications</li><li>Settings per repository</li><li>More configuration options</li></ul>



<h3>New WIP diff view</h3>



<p>The new diff view adds the possibility of viewing the file in differnt ways (full view or split) as well as navigate through the changes (in the split mode for now).</p>



<p>When the diff it’s opened from the WIP view, it also adds several extra controls like edit, stage and revert.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1024x526.png" alt="New WIP diff view" srcset="https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1024x526.png 1024w, https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-300x154.png 300w, https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-768x394.png 768w, https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1536x788.png 1536w, https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-620x318.png 620w, https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.png 1851w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>GitQlient – New WIP diff view</figcaption></figure>



<h3>New tiny text editor</h3>



<p>The second big feature is the tiny text editor I’ve embedded in GitQlient. It allows you to edit the files that are currently in WIP and pending to be commited.</p>



<p>Some times I’ve missed the ability to edit the files because I forgot something and in QtCreator may be I’ve changed the project or closed the file. I usually work with very large projects and it’s very handy to have an editor just in case.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1-1024x526.png" alt="GitQlient tiny text editor" srcset="https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1-1024x526.png 1024w, https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1-300x154.png 300w, https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1-768x394.png 768w, https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1-1536x788.png 1536w, https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1-620x318.png 620w, https://www.francescmm.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1.png 1851w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>GitQlient – Tiny text editor</figcaption></figure>



<h2>The future</h2>



<p>For the next release there are some nice features already planned:</p>



<ul><li>Add <em>subtree</em> Git feature support</li><li>Git LFS</li><li>RPM and DEB packages</li><li>Prepare GitQlient for translations</li></ul>



<p>As I said, you can see the release planning and all the features that every release will contain in the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/francescmm/GitQlient/wiki/Planning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Release Plan</a>.</p>



<p>As always, if you’d like some feature or you’re missing something in GitQlient, check that it’s not yet in the backlog and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/francescmm/GitQlient/issues" target="_blank">open an issue on GitHub</a>!</p>

<p> Modern computer hardware is amazing. Manufacturers have orchestrated billions of pieces of silicon into terrifyingly complex and efficient structures that sweep electrons through innumerable tangled paths, branchings, and reunions with the sole purpose of performing computations at more than a billion times per second. This awe-inspiring piece of computational wizardry has at its disposal multiple billions of uniquely addressible silicon plates where it can store the results of millions of computations in an array of several vanishingly small chips. All of this hardware, though each component often sits no further than 7 or 8 centimeters away from the others, cycles so fast that the speed of light, a physical law of the universe, limits the rate at which they communicate with each other.
</p><p><span>So why is software still slow?</span>
</p><p>Why does it take your operating system 10 seconds, 30 seconds, a minute to boot up? Why does your word processor freeze when you save a document on the cloud? Why does your web browser take 3, 4, 10 seconds to load a web page? Why does your phone struggle to keep more than a few apps open at a time? And why does each update somehow make the problem worse?
</p><p><span>We made it slow</span>.
</p><p>Not necessarily you, not necessarily me, not necessarily any single person in particular. But we, the software development community, made it slow by ignoring the fundamental reality of our occupation. We write code, code that runs on computers. Real computers, with central processing units and random access memory and hard disk drives and display buffers. Real computers, with integer and bitwise math and floating point units and L2 caches, with threads and cores and a tenuous little network connection to a million billion other computers. Real computers not built for ease of human understanding but for blindingly, incomprehensibly fast speed.
</p><p><span>A lot of us have forgotten that</span>.
</p><p>In our haste to get our products, our projects, the works of our hands and minds, to as many people as possible, we take shortcuts. We make assumptions. We generalize, and abstract, and assume that just because these problems have been solved before that they never need to be solved again. We build abstraction layers, then forget we built them and build more on top.
</p><p>And it's true that many of us think we do not have the time, the money, the mental bandwidth to always consider these things in detail. The deadline is approaching or the rent is due or we have taxes to fill out and a manager on our back and someone asking us why we always spend so much time at the office, and we just have to stick the library or virtual machine or garbage collector in there to cover up the places we can't think through right now.
</p><p>Others of us were never taught to think about the computer itself. We learned about objects and classes and templates and how to make our code clean and pretty. We learned how to write code to make the client or the manager or the teacher happy, but made the processor churn. And because we did, that amazing speed we'd been granted was wasted, by us, in a death by a thousand abstraction layers.
</p><p><span>But some of us aren't satisfied with that.</span>
</p><p>Some of us take a few extra steps into the covered territory, the wheels sitting, motionless, in a pile behind us, examine their designs and decide there is a better way. The more experienced among us remember how software used to be, the potential that we know exists for computer programs to be useful, general, <em>and</em> efficient. Others of us got fed up with the tools we were expected to use without complaint, but which failed us time and time again. Some of us are just curious and don't know what's good for us. Don't trust what we've been told is good for us.
</p><p>We sat down and looked at our hardware, and examined our data, and thought about how to use the one to transform the other. We tinkered, and measured, and read, and compared, and wrote, and refined, and modified, and measured again, over and over, until we found we had built the same thing, but 10 times faster and incomparably more useful to the people we designed it for. And we had built it by hand.
</p><p>That is what Handmade means. It's not a technique or a language or a management strategy, it isn't a formula or a library or an abstraction. It's an idea. The idea that we can build software that works with the computer, not against it. The idea that sometimes an individual programmer can be more productive than a large team, that a small group can do more than an army of software engineers and *do it better*. The idea that programming is about transforming data and we wield the code, the tool we use to bend that data to our will.
</p><p> It doesn't require a degree, or a dissertation, or a decade of experience. You don't need an
expensive computer or a certificate or even prior knowledge. All you need is an open mind and a sense of
curiosity. We'll help you with the rest.
</p><p><span>Will you join us?</span>
</p><p>Will you build your software by hand?</p>

    <p>Hello and welcome to my Coronavirus Genome Walkthrough.</p>

<p>(Hoping someone comes out with that Vaccine Speedrun soon. This boss battle is really shaping up to be an intense one and we’ll need all the artifacts we can get.)</p>

<p>Here, I aim to provide a <em>mechanistic explanation</em> of the SARS-CoV-2 genome’s syntax and semantics. Let’s investigate what the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome actually does as if reading through code like a compiler, from nucleotides to amino acids all the way to proteins. From the four base pairs all the way up to the completed protein-coated virus, what is a virus like this is actually made of on the concrete, physical level?</p>

<h3 id="understanding-a-full-system">Understanding a Full System</h3>

<p>The underlying purpose of this essay is less about the coronavirus <em>per se</em> and more about how having a small—but functionally complete—piece of viral RNA to analyze gives me a unique opportunity to try to understand a complete self-replicating machine from scratch. This is not a feat that I would have the fortitude to manually replicate with the full human genome, for example—but the coronavirus genome, like the <a href="http://openworm.org/">nematode genome</a>, is small enough that we stand a chance at building a complete understanding. The task is perhaps akin to <a href="https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/">interpretability</a>, but for biological systems instead of artificial neural networks.</p>

<p>As a consequence, this essay is not intended to produce epidemiological conclusions; there are plenty of other sources for that! This essay is about fully understanding a biological system at the chemical and physical level.</p>

<h3 id="play-curiosity-and-mechanical-understanding">Play, Curiosity, and Mechanical Understanding</h3>

<p>Throughout this essay, I follow my curiosity in the style of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_play">serious play</a>: if I <a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Noticing-Confusion-Sequence">notice I’m confused</a> about something, I look into it and explore it until I’m satisfied that I now understand, and that my understanding is <em>a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/science-mechanisms/#ConMec">mechanical</a> understanding</em>. Things are made of stuff! It turns out that we can understand that stuff!</p>

<p>I may skip over some details that were not confusing to me during my own research, but your journey need not be the same as mine. If you’re confused about something while reading this essay, I encourage you to go and look it up! <a href="http://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-art-of-noticing.html">Notice</a> when your curiosity arises; that’s the meditation. Together, we can <a href="http://samoburja.com/how-to-find-the-frontier-of-knowledge/">learn new things</a>.</p>

<p>This all, at least, has been my intention as I set out to create this piece! As Ken Liu said of his philosophy while translating The Three-Body Problem, “I may not have succeeded, but these were the standards I had in mind as I set about my task.”</p>

<p>Part 1, here, covers just the genome and its translation to proteins. I hope to also write a Part 2 which would cover the structure and function of those proteins, their protein-protein interactions, and the full viral life cycle.</p>

<!--Finally, as you may already be able to tell, this essay also serves as a philosophical manifesto-by-example of how to think concretely about problems in biology. Along the way, I give some of my thoughts about the role of thermodynamics in molecular biology, legibility in complex systems, pedagogy, and the future of computational modeling.-->

<p>Let’s get started.</p>



<p>As a reminder, SARS-CoV-2 is a <em>positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus</em>.</p>



<p>What does this mean we can expect?</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Single-stranded</em>: Its genome is a single strand of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA">RNA</a> (ssRNA).</li>
  <li><em>Positive-sense</em>: That single strand of RNA can be immediately translated into protein by the ribosomes of the cell it infects.</li>
</ol>

<p>From this we can also infer that one of the proteins the virus encodes for must be <em>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase</em> (RdRP), a protein which synthesizes new RNA given an RNA template. That’s right: RNA → RNA. However, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a>, isn’t RNA → RNA an unconscionable heresy? Correspondingly, RdRP is not naturally found in cells! All known positive-sense ssRNA viruses therefore <em>must encode</em> RdRP in order to successfully commit this heresy.</p>



<p>…Wait a minute, the phrase “positive-sense ssRNA virus” implies the existence of <em>negative-sense</em> viruses. If those don’t encode their proteins directly, how can they possibly work?</p>

<h2 id="positive-sense-and-negative-sense">Positive sense and negative sense</h2>

<p>Negative-sense ssRNA viruses also exist! Influenza, Ebola, and measles are examples.</p>



<p>The inner contents of <em>negative-sense</em> ssRNA viruses consist not of an RNA genome but of a <em>ribonucleoprotein</em>, which incorporates both an RNA genome as well as a cohort of viral proteins capable of replicating RNA. Unlike positive-sense ssRNA viruses, negative-sense ssRNA viruses must travel with a working copy of their RNA-replicating proteins. This ribonucleoprotein has enzymatic activity!</p>

<h2 id="rdrp-as-drug-target">RdRP as drug target</h2>

<p>Since RdRP has (as far as I know) no legitimate purpose in human cells and is not naturally coded by them, might it offer a potential target for novel antiviral drugs?</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">Velkov et al. 2014</a> explores RdRP as a drug target for antivirals against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henipavirus">Hendra virus</a>, a negative-sense ssRNA virus, though I am unable to find the full text.</p>

<!-- <div class="unfurl-embed-info-media-default gallery-item-selectable"><img class="unfurl-embed-card-feature-image" src="https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/persistent/pubmed-meta-image.png"><div class="unfurl-embed-card-title unfurl-embed-card-title-default notranslate"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24102407/">The RNA-dependent-RNA Polymerase, an Emerging Antiviral Drug Target for the Hendra Virus - PubMed</a></div><div class="unfurl-embed-card-description unfurl-embed-card-description-default notranslate"><div style="overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; display: -webkit-box; -webkit-line-clamp: 2;">Australia is facing a major national medical challenge with the emergence of the Hendra virus (HeV) as a medically and economically important pathogen of humans and animals.

<blockquote>
  <p>This review examines the current knowledge based on the multi-domain architecture of the Hendra RdRP and highlights which essential domain functions represent tangible targets for drug development against this deadly disease.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There must be some reason that developing antivirals against this protein is technically (or socially) complicated, or I’d have expected us to do it by now – there are a lot of RNA viruses that this drug target could theoretically hit. Flagging this discrepancy for further research.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p>



<p>Back to SARS-CoV-2! First, let’s get us a genome. Obviously this virus has seen some mutations as it’s spread around, as you can explore at <a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global">NextStrain</a>, so we’ve technically got choices as to which one to analyze. For this thread I’ll just stick to analyzing <em>one</em> version of the genome: Wuhan-Hu-1.</p>

<p>As a reminder, each <code>A</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>T</code> in a genome is one of the four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">nucleotides</a>: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenine">adenine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanine">guanine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytosine">cytosine</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymine">thymine</a>. There are actually <a href="https://www.scripps.edu/romesberg/publications.html">plenty of ways to engineer</a> different <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22850726/">unnatural base pair systems</a> by adding <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6429/884">artificial nucleotides</a>, and these can even be integrated into <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/98/9/4922">transcription</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24659">translation</a>, but <a href="https://carlbrannen.wordpress.com/2007/06/13/why-does-dna-only-use-4-nucleotides/">for</a> <a href="https://dreamerbiologist.wordpress.com/2013/02/16/why-did-nature-settle-on-just-four-nucleotides/">whatever</a> <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/32/E6476">reason</a>, these four <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-07389-2">and not others</a> are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331698/">what life ultimately ended up with</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/nucleotides.png"></p>
<p><small>The four nucleotides in DNA.</small></p>

<p>The genome of Wuhan-Hu-1 is available from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, each <code>T</code> in this string technically represents a <code>U</code>, for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uracil">uracil</a>, RNA’s information-equivalent of thymine. The genome sequence is therefore:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1     AUUAAAGGUU UAUACCUUCC CAGGUAACAA ACCAACCAAC UUUCGAUCUC UUGUAGAUCU
61    GUUCUCUAAA CGAACUUUAA AAUCUGUGUG GCUGUCACUC GGCUGCAUGC UUAGUGCACU
121   CACGCAGUAU AAUUAAUAAC UAAUUACUGU CGUUGACAGG ACACGAGUAA CUCGUCUAUC

...

29761 ACAGUGAACA AUGCUAGGGA GAGCUGCCUA UAUGGAAGAG CCCUAAUGUG UAAAAUUAAU
29821 UUUAGUAGUG CUAUCCCCAU GUGAUUUUAA UAGCUUCUUA GGAGAAUGAC AAAAAAAAAA
29881 AAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAA AAA
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>That’s 29,903 nucleotides. Since there are only four possible nucleotides, we can estimate the information compression value of each nucleotide at approximately 2 bits; the virus’s genome therefore requires only 7.5 kilobytes to store. That’s roughly as much data, byte for byte, as there are characters in this essay up to this point!</p>

<!-- <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/05/02212445/Figure_03_05_03.png"> -->

<p>Lay out those 29,903 nucleobases along a ribose-phosphate backbone, reading them left to right <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directionality_(molecular_biology)">from the 5’ end to the 3’ end</a>, and bam – if that single molecule* were teleported into a cell, that’s 100% chemically sufficient** to infect a person with the plague du jour.</p>

<p>*plus the 5’ cap, discussed below</p>

<p>**modulo viral load effects??</p>

<p><small>How to interpret the Wuhan-Hu-1 genome as a complete molecule.</small></p>

<h2 id="poly-a-tail">Poly-A tail</h2>

<p>First question, and perhaps the most obvious one to the naked eye – what’s with all the <code>AAAAA</code> at the end of the viral genome?</p>

<div><div><pre><code>29821 ...                                                ... AAAAAAAAAA
29881 AAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAA AAA
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a target="blank" href="https://benchling.com/s/seq-28k9llmwnY475iv7ogwF/edit">Follow along with the genome »</a></p>

<p>It’s… yelling at us? Is it… suffering? Should we <a href="https://reducing-suffering.org/is-there-suffering-in-fundamental-physics/">help</a>?</p>

<p>Simple: It’s a <a href="https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/11227/why-does-the-sars-cov2-coronavirus-genome-end-in-aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa">3’ poly-A tail</a>! This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">long tail of adenosine monomers</a> is extremely common in both our own cells and in RNA viruses.</p>

<p>Our own messenger RNA (mRNA) has a poly-A tail when it’s freshly produced in the nucleus so as to slow its degradation by the cell, allowing it to last long enough to be transcribed into protein. Naturally, if you’re a positive-strand RNA virus, you’re also going to want to last long enough to be transcribed into protein – so, you need the same feature, yourself.</p>

<p>Genome 0.11% explained. So far so good!</p>

<h2 id="5-cap">5’ cap</h2>

<p>While we’re discussing chemical features of mRNA, note that the viral genome presumably must also have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> – an extra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-Methylguanosine">7-methylguanosine</a> at the 5’ end of its RNA strand – just like mRNAs do.</p>

<p><img src="https://csvoss.com/images/5primecap.png"></p>
<p><small>A 5' cap, consisting of a 7-methylguanosine as well as methylation of the first two ribose sugars.</small></p>

<p>The cap is not directly shown in the viral genome sequence or mentioned in NCBI GenBank, but it is referenced in multiple papers discussing coronaviral genomes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn increased attention and stimulated numerous studies on the molecular virology of coronaviruses. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by coronaviruses to produce the 5′-cap structure and methylation modification of viral genomic RNAs.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Coronaviruses possess a cap structure at the 5′ ends of viral genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs, which is generated through consecutive methylations by virally encoded guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) and 2′-O-methyltransferase (2′-O-MTase). The coronaviral N7-MTase is unique for its physical linkage with an exoribonuclease (ExoN) harbored in nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) of coronaviruses.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>Here, we have reconstituted complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation <em>in vitro</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Like the poly-A tail, the 5’ cap helps the genome to be recognized and translated by ribosomes rather than destroyed by the cell’s immune response.</p>

<p>How does the virus even ensure that it receives a 5’ cap and a poly-A tail, not to mention its outer coat? Hopefully these questions will be resolved by our review of its genes and proteins… let’s move on to look at those!</p>



<p>Per the “Features” section of the genome, again from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3">NCBI GenBank</a>, here are the identifiable genes in this genome, in order:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>Orf1ab</code> (for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/1791269089">orf1ab polyprotein</a>)</li>

The money he invested into his SaaS company was taken from credit cards so he needed another avenue to earn some money. Rob pivoted to Google Ads and started generating some money.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In some time, other people also started approaching Rob to help them with Google Ads. Helping people with google ads became a primary source of revenue as he was not generating any money from the SaaS company so he decided to scale google ads consultancy. From there, Rob formally entered into online marketing.</span></p><p><strong>First product launch&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>Rob was approached by an agency to provide their clients PPC services. Rob agreed to it and they decided to split the revenue 50-50. In 2013, Rob attended a marketing event in Colorado to find new clients and there he was approached by the event organiser who wanted to do a partnership with him.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He asked Rob to make a course which they were going to sell. Rob agreed to it. Rob’s partner had a massive experience in the internet marketing space. The first product that Rob launched was a course on how to sell google ads to local businesses. It was priced at $697 and offered an upsell of google ads software priced at $67. They sold 150 units and generated around $100k in revenue. 50% of the revenue went to JV partners whereas the remaining was divided between Rob and his partner.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After the first launch, they did around 20 launches of the same product in the next 18 months and earned around a million dollars in revenue</span></p><p><strong>Low ticket product launch</strong></p><p><span>Recently, Rob launched a product with the name “Dental Smart Pages”. It was a low ticket product launch. The primary purpose of this launch was to reach new people as they could not generate much revenue from the low ticket product launch. Dental smart pages was a landing page for dentists which they could use for lead generation. They priced it for $27 with the $37 upsell of different niche landing pages. Rob generated $70K in revenue and sold 1200 units of product.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It was a three phase launch. In the second phase, they launched a mid ticket product which was a dental master class priced at $497 to compliment the product launched in the first phase. They doubled their revenues with the second phase launch whereas in the phase three, they planned to do a live event in Florida.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Advice for new marketers</strong></p><p><span>Rob’s advice for new marketers is to always be honest with yourself and that success lies in consistently following a proven model. He also advised people not to rely solely on product launches, you need to have other revenue streams.</span></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><a href="https://code-cop.org/">Peter &lt;Code Cop&gt; Kofler</a> and I recently facilitated a refactoring workshop where we guided our participants to incrementally extract a microservice from a monolith. Similar workshops were mostly about the technology side of things and neglected the coding part which we found was sad. So we obviously decided to focus on <strong>hands on coding</strong> and to practice the refactoring steps needed for this task.</p>

<p>We identified several milestones in this refactoring exercise which we then laid out as the <strong>‘Levels of Modularity’</strong>.
Each level represents a different kind of architecture that shows stronger or weaker modularity.</p>

<p>The model helps us to reason about our current architecture and decide where we want to go.
But most interestingly it acts as a play book how to extract a microservice.
It is feasible to go through each level and gradually increase the modularity in an attempt to extract the microservice.</p>

<h2 id="modularity-is-about-controlling-the-scope-of-change">Modularity is about controlling the scope of change</h2>
<p>Modularity is the property of a system to which degree it is composed of modules. 
Modularity is recursive - Modules may be further decomposed into submodules.
A module is a cohesive, loosely coupled, encapsulated and composable piece of software that does one thing.<br>
I don’t see modularity and its characteristics as absolutes. 
I rather see nuances and trade offs.
But it is all about controlling the scope of change.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cohesion tells whether code that changes for the same reason, is put closely. We aim for high cohesion.</li>
  <li>Coupling tells to which degree a change in one part of the system affects another. 
Usually we aim for loose coupling so that we can change things independently. 
But the decoupling may come with a burden, which forces us to make trade offs. 
So we like to find the sweet spot.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="level--1-the-distributed-monolith">Level -1: The Distributed Monolith</h2>

<p><img src="https://gregorriegler.com/assets/modularity/modularity_level99_distributed_monolith.svg" alt="Distributed Monolith" width="25%"></p>

<div>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Drawing</th>
        <th>What it means</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Grey Box with Black Border</td>
        <td>The Unit of Deployment</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Colored Circles</td>
        <td>This is Code. The Color represents what the Code is doing work for. Every Color signifies another Feature / Behaviour.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Lines connecting Things</td>
        <td>Dependencies</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

</div>

<p>The structure tells that there has been an attempt to decompose the system into services.
But what it apparently does is it tears apart cohesive pieces of software and puts thick walls between them. 
None of the parts is able to perform useful work on its own. They have a strong coupling with their dependencies. 
<em>Shotgun Surgery<sup id="fnref:ShotgunSurgery" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ShotgunSurgery">1</a></sup></em> is the result. 
One has to touch many services when changing a single feature.
Another effect is that it’s mostly impossible to deploy any of those services independently.</p>

<p>I put this even below level 0, as i see negative modularity going on. 
In an attempt to increase its modularity we would first have to join the services again, only to arrive at level 0.</p>

<p>How did we get there?</p>
<ul>
  <li>We just didn’t understand how to properly decompose a system into modules.</li>
  <li>We drew the boundaries before we had a proper understanding of the domain we’re building.</li>
  <li>There are different developers working on different layers of the same thing. (<em>Conways Law<sup id="fnref:ConwaysLaw" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ConwaysLaw">2</a></sup></em>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="level-0">Level 0</h2>

<p>Monoliths with low cohesion and high coupling.</p>

<h3 id="level-0-the-big-ball-of-mud">Level 0: The Big Ball of Mud</h3>

<p><img src="https://gregorriegler.com/assets/modularity/modularity_level0.svg" alt="The Big Ball of Mud" width="25%"></p>

<p>This animal is completely disorganized. There is no recognizable structure, no abstraction, dependencies are intertwined. 
Strong coupling is the result. Changes in one area of the code lead to bugs in several other areas. 
It contains all sorts of <em>Code Smells<sup id="fnref:CodeSmell" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:CodeSmell">3</a></sup></em> from <em>God Classes</em> to <em>Feature Envy</em>, <em>Dead Code</em> and <em>Change Preventers</em>.</p>

<p>Developers get there because of many reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lack of Experience</li>
  <li>Carelessness after feeling treated unfair</li>
  <li>Rushing Changes to try and meet a deadline</li>
  <li>Developers with different views working independently on the same codebase without sufficient alignment.</li>
  <li>Fluctuation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="level-0-monolith-packaged-by-layer">Level 0: Monolith packaged by Layer</h3>

<p><img src="https://gregorriegler.com/assets/modularity/modularity_level0_layered.svg" alt="Monolith packaged by Layer" width="25%"></p>

<p>This is probably the most common monolith out there. 
Its package structure is often guided by frameworks and code generators that propose having packages like <code>controllers</code>, <code>domain</code> and <code>repositories</code> on the top level. 
This framing proposes <em>Separation of Concerns<sup id="fnref:SeparationOfConcerns" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:SeparationOfConcerns">4</a></sup></em> which is a good thing. 
But the proposed way of having those packages on the top level obfuscates what the application is doing. “Controllers” does not provide any clue about what the app is doing.</p>

<h2 id="level-1">Level 1</h2>

<p>Monoliths with high cohesion.</p>

<h3 id="level-1-package-by-feature">Level 1: Package by Feature</h3>

<p><img src="https://gregorriegler.com/assets/modularity/modularity_level1.svg" alt="Package by Feature" width="25%"></p>

<p>Package by Feature is much more desirable. 
It puts the names of features like Order, Cart and User at the top level which are screaming<sup id="fnref:ScreamingArchitecture" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ScreamingArchitecture">5</a></sup>: “I am a Shop!”.
It helps us to quickly find the code we need to change. 
As the cohesion is increased, we typically just have to touch a single top level package when changing a feature. 
There is no <em>information hiding<sup id="fnref:InformationHiding" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:InformationHiding">6</a></sup></em> going on between the features though. 
A code within one feature knows about the internals of another feature and has access to it. 
For Example: Feature A may fetch data from the Repository of Feature B, or use its business logic. 
So there is still coupling going on.</p>

<h3 id="level-1-features-but-layered-inside">Level 1: Features, but layered inside</h3>

<p><img src="https://gregorriegler.com/assets/modularity/modularity_level1_layered.svg" alt="Features, but layered inside" width="25%"></p>

<p><em>Separation of Concerns</em><sup id="fnref:SeparationOfConcerns:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:SeparationOfConcerns">4</a></sup> again, just inside feature packages.
We do this when we want to isolate our domain, our <em>Happy Zone<sup id="fnref:UniversalArchitecture" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:UniversalArchitecture">7</a></sup></em> from infrastructure code.
Or maybe we just like to organize our many files and put them into distinct folders to gain a better understanding of what a file is about.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-the-modular-monolith">Level 2: The Modular Monolith</h2>

<p><img src="https://gregorriegler.com/assets/modularity/modularity_level2.svg" alt="The Modular Monolith" width="25%"></p>

<p>A Monolith with both low coupling and high cohesion.</p>

<p>Feature packages turn modules. 
Each module now has a clear api which is the only way to access it. 
One module doesn’t know about the inner details of another module anymore. 
So they are encapsulated, and the coupling is further reduced. 
But as the module does not encapsulate its data, the modules are still coupled by the shared database.</p>

<p>Increasing the modularity further than this may come with a significant cost.</p>

<h2 id="level-3-the-microservice-ready-monolith">Level 3: The Microservice Ready Monolith</h2>

<p><img src="https://gregorriegler.com/assets/modularity/modularity_level3.svg" alt="The Microservice Ready Monolith" width="25%"></p>

<p>The coupling of a shared database is removed. 
Each module now uses its own data. 
Could be a separate database, or just separate tables within the same database. 
As long as there is no hidden coupling like a foreign key, we consider it as separated.
Sometimes, two or more modules need to access the same data.
In this case they would access the data through the module that owns it, or have a separate copy of the data.
In case of a copy we would choose a data model that perfectly fits the needs of the respective module. 
The data might be updated through events.</p>

<p>It’s still a monolith, but a very decoupled one. 
Extracting a microservice is very easy from this level.</p>

<h2 id="level-4-microservices">Level 4: Microservices</h2>

<p><img src="https://gregorriegler.com/assets/modularity/modularity_level4_microservice.svg" alt="Microservices" width="25%"></p>

<p>We can now deploy, as well as scale each service independently.
Each microservice has a strong autonomy and can be developed by its own team that uses the tech that best fits the services job.</p>

<p>But it comes at a cost and a lot of pain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hard to Integrate.</li>
  <li>Hard to Maintain.</li>
  <li>An organizational challenge.</li>
  <li>Lot’s of additional Technology might be needed.
    <ul>
      <li>API Gateway</li>
      <li>Event Bus</li>
      <li>Container Orchestration</li>
      <li>Configuration Broker</li>
      <li>Contract Testing</li>
      <li>Bulkheads</li>
      <li>Circuit Breakers</li>
      <li>Distributed Tracing</li>
      <li>Distributed Logging</li>
      <li>Service Registry</li>
      <li>and so on</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Don’t even consider microservices unless you have a system that’s too complex to manage as a monolith.”</p>

  <p>~Martin Fowler</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The <strong>Levels of Modularity</strong> provide a model to reason about an architecture and help decide on where you want to go. 
The higher the level, the more modular an architecture is.</p>

<p>Also, we may use the <strong>Levels of Modularity</strong> as a cook book to refactor to a more modular architecture. 
We want to go level by level incrementally.</p>

<p>To get from a <em>Big Ball of Mud (Level 0)</em> to a <em>Modular Monolith (Level 2)</em>, we first want to find the features and collect them in distinct packages to arrive at <em>Package by Feature (Level 1)</em>. 
Only then would we decouple the feature packages to finally arrive at a <em>Modular Monolith (Level 2)</em>. 
We may even apply the <em>Strangler Pattern<sup id="fnref:StranglerPattern" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:StranglerPattern">8</a></sup></em> and carry one feature at a time through all levels.</p>

      <p><a href="https://crdt.tech/">CRDTs</a> are often praised as the "holy grail" for building collaborative applications because they don't require a central authority to resolve sync conflicts. They open up new possibilities to scale the backend infrastructure and are also well-suited as a data-model for distributed apps that don't require a server at all.</p><p>However, several text editor developers report not to use them because they impose a too significant overhead.</p><p>Just recently, Marijn Haverbeke wrote about his considerations against using CRDTs as a data model for <a href="https://codemirror.net/6/">CodeMirror 6</a>:</p><blockquote>[..] the cost of such a representation is significant, and in the end, I judged the requirement for converging positions to be too obscure to justify that level of extra complexity and memory use. <a href="https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/collaborative-editing-cm.html">(source)</a></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor">Xi Editor</a> used a CRDT as its data model to allow different processes (syntax highlighter, type checker, ..) to concurrently access the editor state without blocking the process. They reverted to a synchronous model because ..</p><blockquote>[..] CRDT is not pulling its (considerable) weight. <a href="https://github.com/xi-editor/xi-editor/issues/1187#issuecomment-491473599">(source)</a></blockquote><p>Apparently, everyone recognizes that CRDTs have a lot of potential, but concluded that the memory overhead of using them must be too expensive for real-world applications.</p><p>They bring up a fair point. Most CRDTs assign a unique ID to <em>every character</em> that was ever created in the document. In order to ensure that documents can always converge, the CRDT model preserves this metadata even when characters are deleted.</p><p>This seems to be particularly expensive in dynamic languages like JavaScript. Other languages allow you to efficiently represent all those characters and IDs in-memory using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)">structs</a> (e.g. C or Rust). In JavaScript, everything is represented as an <code>Object</code> - basically a key-value map that needs to keep track of all its keys and values. CRDTs assign multiple properties to every single character in the document to ensure conflict resolution. The memory overhead of merely representing a document as a CRDT could be immense.</p><p>Every user-interaction creates more metadata that the CRDT needs to retain in order to ensure conflict resolution. It is not uncommon that CRDTs create millions of objects to store all this metadata. The JavaScript engine manages these objects on the heap, checks if they are referenced, and, if possible, garbage collects them. Another major problem is that with an increasing number of object creations, the cost of creating additional objects increases exponentially. This is shown in the following graphic:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/scatter-plot.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/scatter-plot.png 600w"><figcaption>Average time to create one object increases with the number of objects on the heap <a href="https://jsperf.com/cost-of-objects">(Data Source)</a></figcaption></figure><p>So the question arises if CRDTs are actually suitable for shared editing on the web, or if they impose a too significant cost to be viable in practice.</p><p>In case you don't know me, I'm the author of a CRDT implementation named <a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs">Yjs</a>, that is specifically designed for building shared editing applications on the web.</p><p>In this article, I will introduce you to a simple optimization for CRDTs and examine the exact performance trade-off of using Yjs for shared editing. I hope to convince you that the overhead is actually very small even for large documents with long edit histories.</p><h2 id="yjs">Yjs</h2><p>Yjs is a framework for building collaborative applications using CRDTs as the data model. It has a growing ecosystem of extensions that enable shared editing using different editors (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-prosemirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/prosemirror">ProseMirror</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remirror/extension-yjs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/remirror">Remirror</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/yjs-quilljs"></a><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/quill">Quill</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/editor-bindings/codemirror">CodeMirror</a>, ..), different networking technologies (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-websocket">WebSocket</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-webrtc">WebRTC</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/connection-provider/y-hyper">Hyper</a>, ..), and different persistence layers (<a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-indexeddb">IndexedDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-leveldb">LevelDB</a>, <a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/ecosystem/database-provider/y-redis">Redis</a>, ..). Most shared editing solutions are tied to a specific editor and to a specific backend. With Yjs, you can make any of the supported editors collaborative and exchange document updates through your custom communication channel, over a peer-to-peer WebRTC network, or over a scalable server infrastructure. My vision for this project is that you can simply compose your collaborative application using the technologies that make sense for your project. </p><figure><a href="https://github.com/yjs/yjs"><div><p>yjs/yjs</p><p>Peer-to-peer shared types.

The concepts discussed here are pretty generic and could be extended to almost any CRDT.</p><p>In order to determine the performance cost, we are are going to examine how Yjs maintains data. Please bear with me while I describe how the CRDT model is represented using JavaScript objects. This will be relevant later.</p><p>Similarly to other CRDTs, the YATA CRDT assigns a unique ID to every character. These characters are then maintained in a doubly linked list.</p><p>The unique IDs are<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_timestamp"> Lamport Timestamps</a>. They consist of a unique user identifier and a logical clock that increases with each character insertion.</p><p>When a user types the content "ABC" from left to right, it will perform the following operations: <code>insert(0, "A") • insert(1, "B") • insert(2, "C")</code>. The linked list of the YATA CRDT, which models the textual content, will look like this:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.kevinjahns.de/content/images/2020/07/crdt-datamodel.svg" alt=""><figcaption>CRDT model of inserting content "ABC" (assuming the user has the unique client identifier "1")</figcaption></figure><p>Notice how every character can be uniquely identified by the combination of the unique client-id and an ever-increasing <code>clock</code> counter.</p><p>Yjs represents the items of the linked list as <code>Item</code> objects that contain some content (in this case a String), a unique ID, the links to the adjacent <code>Item</code> objects, and additional metadata that is relevant for the CRDT algorithm.</p><p>All CRDTs assign some kind of unique ID and additional metadata to every character, which is very memory-consuming for large documents. We can't get rid of metadata as it is necessary for conflict resolution. Yjs also uniquely identifies each character and assigns metadata, but represents this information efficiently. Larger document insertions are represented as a single <code>Item</code> object using the character-offset to uniquely identify each character individually. The below <code>Item</code> uniquely identifies character <code>"A"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 0 }</code>, character <code>"B"</code> as <code>{ client: 1, clock: 1 }</code>, and so on..</p><figure><pre><code>Item {
    id: { client: 1, clock: 0 },
    content: 'ABC',
    ...
}</code></pre><figcaption>Yjs's internal representation of items in the linked list</figcaption></figure><p>If a user copy/pastes a lot of content into the document, the inserted content is represented by a single <code>Item</code>. Furthermore, single-character insertions that are written from left to right can be merged into a single <code>Item</code>. It is just important that we are able to split and merge items without losing any metadata.</p><p>This type of compound representation of the CRDT model and its split-functionality have first been described in <a href="https://kundoc.com/pdf-a-string-wise-crdt-algorithm-for-smart-and-large-scale-collaborative-editing-sys.html">"A string-wise CRDT algorithm for smart and large-scale collaborative systems"</a>. Yjs adapts this approach for YATA and also includes functionality to merge <code>Item</code> objects.</p><h2 id="the-cost-of-operations">The Cost of Operations</h2><p>With this simple optimization in mind, let's have a look at how the number of modifications on a document relates to the amount of metadata that needs to be retained. We will measure metadata by the amount of <code>Item</code> objects created and later examine what the cost of a single <code>Item</code> is.</p><p>Every user interaction with a text editor can be expressed as either an <strong>insert</strong> or a <strong>delete</strong> operation.</p><ul><li><code>insert(index: number, content: string)</code><strong> </strong>Insertions of any size create a single <code>Item</code> that is integrated into the document. In some cases the integration requires to split an existing <code>Item</code>. So we have a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations per insertion.</li><li><code>delete(index: number, length: number)</code> Deleting an <code>Item</code> only marks it as deleted. I.e <code>item.deleted = true</code>. Therefore, <code>Item</code> deletions are free and will reduce the amount of memory used because the <code>Item.content</code> can be removed. The <code>Item</code> doesn't need to retain the content for doing conflict resolution. But deleting a range of content might require to split two existing items. Therefore, the cost of deletions is a maximum of two <code>Item</code> creations also.</li></ul><p>By using the compound representation of CRDTs, the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations produced by a user. Not to the amount of characters inserted. This makes a huge difference in practice. Most larger documents are created by copy-pasting existing content or by moving paragraphs to other positions. Any kind of operation, even copy-paste and undo/redo, only create at most two <code>Item</code> objects.</p><p>Yjs also supports rich-text and structured documents. The above statement, that the amount of metadata only relates to the amount of operations, still holds true for these kinds of documents. But measuring operation-cost for more complex operations is out of scope of this article. An interesting observation in practice is that the document size of long-running …</p></div></article></main></div></div></div>

		<p><em><span>A</span></em><span><em><span>n Ecology of Mind</span></em></span><span> </span><span> is a film portrait of Gregory Bateson, celebrated anthropologist, philosopher, author, naturalist, systems theorist, and filmmaker, produced and directed by his daughter, Nora Bateson.</span></p>
		<p><span>T<span>he</span></span><span> film includes footage from Bateson’s own films shot in the 1930s in Bali (with Margaret Mead) and New Guinea, along with photographs, filmed lectures, and interviews.  His youngest child, Nora, depicts him as a man who studied the interrelationships of the complex systems in which we live with a depth motivated by scientific rigor and caring integrity.</span></p>
		<p><span>N<span>ora</span></span> Bateson’s rediscovery of his work documents the vast – and continuing – influence Bateson’s thinking has had on the work of an amazingly wide range of disciplines.  Through contemporary interviews, along with his own words, Bateson’s way of thinking reveals practical approaches to the enormous challenges confronting the human race and the natural world.</p>
		<p><span>G<span>regory</span></span> Bateson’s theories, such as “the double bind” and “the pattern which connects”, continue to impact the fields of anthropology, psychiatry, information science, cybernetics, urban planning, biology, and ecology, challenging people to think in new ways.   </p>
		<p><span>U</span><span>ntil now, his work has been largely inaccessible to most of us.  Through this film, Nora Bateson sets out to show that his ideas are not just fodder for academic theory, but can help instruct a way of life. She presents his thinking using a richly personal perspective, focusing on the stories Bateson used to present his ideas and how the beauty of life itself provided the framework of his life’s pursuits.</span></p>
		<p><span>T</span><span>his film hopes to inspire its audience to see our lives within a larger system - glistening with symmetry, play, and metaphor. An invitation to ask the kinds of questions that could help thread the world back together from the inside.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>I got into a discussion about monads recently. On a search to find some resources to share, I realized that most essays explained them with type signatures and rules. A missing ingredient to grok them, I think, is to understand the intuition behind them. How could you end up <em>inventing</em> monads?</p><p>Okay, let’s try to build that intuition. We’ll avoid both types and category theory.</p><p>Say you have a few functions to get a user, a profile, and a display picture:</p><pre><code>function getUser(id) { 
  return USERS[id] 
}

function getProfile(user) { 
  return user.profile
}

function getDisplayPicture(profile) { 
  return profile.displayPicture
}</code></pre><p>Now, given an id, how would you get the profile picture?</p><p>You could write this: </p><pre><code>getDisplayPicture(getProfile(getUser(id)))</code></pre><p>Buut, this would throw an error: all these functions <em>could</em> return null. If <code>getUser</code> returned null for example, you would see: </p><pre><code>Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'profile' of undefined</code></pre><p>To fix this, you may end up writing something like this:</p><pre><code>function getDisplayPictureFromId(id) { 
  const user = getUser(id)
  if (!user) return
  const profile = getProfile(user)
  if (!profile) return
  return getDisplayPicture(profile)
}</code></pre><p>But, this is getting pretty ugly. All these conditional returns distract from what you’re really trying to do. <strong>What if there was a way to get rid of these conditionals?</strong></p><p>So, that’s our challenge: let’s get rid of these conditionals. One way we can do this, is to make some kind of helper. This helper would let us chain these functions together: </p><pre><code>new Chainer(getUser(id))
  .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
  .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))</code></pre><p>This looks pretty good. Let’s implement it.</p><h2>whenExists</h2><p><code>.whenExists</code> would only run the callback if the value exists. Here’s how you could write this:</p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
}</code></pre><p>And voila, with just this, we can now write</p><pre><code>function getProfilePictureFromId(id) { 
  return new Chainer(getUser(id))
    .whenExists(user =&gt; getProfile(user))
    .whenExists(profile =&gt; getDisplayPicture(profile))
}</code></pre><h2>More Problems</h2><p>Notice that <code>getDisplayPictureFromId</code> now returns a <code>Chainer</code>. </p><p>Imagine we had another function <code>resizeDisplayPicture</code>, that <em>also</em> returned a Chainer</p><pre><code>function resizeDisplayPicture(pic) { 
    return new Chainer(pic).whenExists(pic =&gt; ...
}</code></pre><p>What would happen, if we wrote:</p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id).whenExists(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))</code></pre><p>Let’s look at whenExists again:</p><pre><code>whenExists(f) { 
  if (!this.value) return this;
  return new Chainer(f(this.value))
}</code></pre><p>If <code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)</code> did exist, we would run </p><pre><code>new Chainer(f(this.value))</code></pre><p>which in this case is</p><pre><code>new Chainer(resizeDisplayPicture(this.value)) </code></pre><p>Which becomes </p><pre><code>new Chainer(new Chainer(this.value)...</code></pre><p><strong>Uh oh. We now have a Chainer inside of a Chainer.</strong> Ideally, we’d want a function that somehow “merged” these chainers together.</p><h2>whenExistsMerge</h2><p>So let’s do that. We can call it <code>whenExistsMerge</code></p><pre><code>class Chainer {
  constructor(v) { 
      this.value = v
  }
  whenExists(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return new Chainer(f(this.value))
  }
  whenExistsMerge(f) { 
      if (!this.value) return this;
      return f(this.value)
  }
}</code></pre><p>And with that, we can write </p><pre><code>getProfilePictureFromId(id)
  .whenExistsMerge(pic =&gt; resizeDisplayPicture(pic))
  .whenExists(resizedPic =&gt; ...)</code></pre><p><strong>Aand voila, you’ve just invented a specific type of monad.</strong> Kind of (1). Chainer is analogous to the <code>Maybe</code> monad. <code>whenExists</code> is analogous to its <code>fmap</code> operation, and <code>whenExistsMerge</code> is analogous to its <code>bind</code> operation. If you’re curious about the type-based technicalities now, <a href="http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html" target="_blank">see this essay</a>. </p><p>So, now we’ve found this cool <code>Chainer</code>. We can stop here, or think a bit further. What’s so special about it? </p><p>Well, it’s like a box that wraps around some information. We can interact with that box with  <code>whenExists</code> and <code>whenExistsMerge</code>.</p><p>How else can we use the idea of <code>box</code> and <code>whenExists?</code></p><p>Here’s one. Let’s say you were dealing with callback hell: </p><pre><code>fetchUser(id, (err, user) =&gt; {
  if (err) ... 
    fetchProfile(profile, (err, profile) =&gt; { 
      if (err) ...
        fetchDisplayPicture(...
    }
}</code></pre><p>What if we created something like an <code>Async Chainer</code>: it stores the result of some future computation. Then, you could use the <code>whenExists*</code> functions, which let you interact with the value <em>when</em> it is computed. We turn the callback hell into</p><pre><code> fetchUser(id).whenExistsMerge(fetchProfile).whenExistsMerge(fetchDisplayPicture)</code></pre><p>Well, replace <code>whenExistsMerge</code> with <code>then</code>, and you're on a road to discover <code>Promise</code>, which is also a monad. Kind of (2). </p><p>Now, it’s pretty cool to notice that both the nullable use case and the async use case have the same interface. The name <code>whenExists</code> may be a bit too specific. Really, what it does is give you an interface to <code>map</code> over the value. If you use the word <code>map</code>, <code>whenExistsMerge</code> really lets you <code>flatMap</code> over the value. </p><p>This begins to get us to the fundamental abstraction of a monad: a box, with an interface for <code>map</code>, and <code>flatMap</code>. As you look deeper, you’ll notice that this abstraction can handle a lot of other things. If you’re curious, research the <code>Result</code> monad for example.</p><p>And with that, you’ve invented monads : ) </p><h2>Aside: Do you <em>really</em> need this?</h2><p>As you went through this, you may have realized that there are other ways to solve the problems that monads solve. Instead of <code>Chainer</code>, your language could have a <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html#safe-calls" target="_blank">safe call</a> abstraction. Instead of <code>Promise</code>, your language could have an <code>async/await</code> abstraction. Sometimes those can be a better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5WdGrpoug" target="_blank">better choice</a>. Nevertheless, if your language doesn’t have those abstractions, you can use monads to solve them. And of course, like any powerful abstraction, you can invent new monads to simplify your business logic.</p><hr><p>(1) I cheated a bit with <code>Chainer</code>, by avoiding the subtypes <code>Just</code> and <code>Nothing</code>. This makes it so you can’t express something like <code>Just(null)</code>. Still, it gets at the essence : ) </p><p>(2) Likewise, <code>Promise</code> isn’t quite a monad, because it mixes both <code>flatMap</code> and <code>map</code> with <code>then</code>. This makes it so you can’t have a <code>Promise&lt;Promise&lt;Res&gt;&gt;</code>. Again though, it gets at the essence</p><p><em>Thanks to Joe Averbukh, Mark Shlick, Daniel Woelfel, Irakli Safareli, Jacky Wang for reviewing drafts of this essay</em></p></span></p></div></div></div>]]>

						<blockquote><p>I don’t know anything, but I do know that<strong> <i>everything is interesting</i></strong> if you go into it deeply enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>—Richard Feynman</p>
<p>I’m fascinated by “Why?” questions! When I start following a&nbsp;well-framed question down chains of causality, I often find that the answers end up cycling among&nbsp;some combination&nbsp;of the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fundamental forces</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_constant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physical constants</a>&nbsp;and math</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Probability</h4>
<p>(Derived forms include entropy and habit; combine with energy gradients to get evolution.)</p></li>
<li>
<h4>Uncertainty</h4>
<p>(See also: the <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/uncer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncertainty principle</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_scale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planck scale</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_foam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum foam</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shannon entropy</a>)</p></li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/section-12.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computational irreducibility</a></h4>
<p>(See also: unpredictability and&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chaos theory</a>)</p></li>
<li>
<h4>Mutual causality</h4>
<p>The Buddhist idea of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paticca samuppāda</a>, or interdependent co-arising. Explored at length in <a href="http://joannamacy.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joanna Macy</a>‘s book <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Mutual_Causality_in_Buddhism_and_General.html?id=APvFjc1VmW4C" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Mutual Causality in Buddhism and General Systems Theory</em></a>. (See also <a title="Prickles and goo - Category: strange loops" href="http://pricklesandgoo.com/category/systems-theory/strange-loop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strange loops</a>.)</p></li>
<li>
<h4><a name="game_rules"></a>Game rules and social agreements</h4>
<p>This last one is less of a <a title="Semantic Stopsigns - Less Wrong" href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/it/semantic_stopsigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopping point</a> and more of a placeholder, signifying “If you aren’t willing to follow the&nbsp;rule, you can’t keep playing the&nbsp;game.” If it’s a multiplayer game like “Romantic Relationships!” or “Capitalism!” the limiting factor is often other people’s willingness to continue playing with you. In retributive justice games, rule violations can carry a risk of ostracism, exile, imprisonment, or other inconvenient punishments such as execution. In restorative justice games, social agreement violations may require extensive processing to repair&nbsp;empathetic connections before the player is allowed to rejoin the game.</p>
<p>If it’s a single-player game like “Life!” or “Consciousness!” the limiting factor is more like, “If you don’t go along with the rules, it might undermine your ability to continue exploring the game space.” These conventions are very situation-dependent, but share a common feature: violations can carry a risk of impeding your access to the energy gradients necessary to maintain the homeostasis that supports the wetware that’s running your consciousness [to the best of our knowledge].</p>
<p>These game rules are something like Sheldon Cooper’s shorthand for “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1127907/quotes?item=qt0419289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-optional social conventions</a>,” but are they really “non-optional”?&nbsp;If we want to avoid getting stuck in a <a title="Design-space traps - Less Wrong" href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/j0u/designspace_traps_mapping_the_utilitydesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local optimum</a>&nbsp;of awesomeness, important followup questions&nbsp;include: “Can this game rule or social convention be hacked or optimized?” and “What are the potential consequences of hacking it?”</p>
<p>Some games may not be “<a title="Alan Watts - A Game That's Worth the Candle - YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN15Ohevar0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worth the candle</a>,” meaning the experience&nbsp;isn’t worth the energy expenditure. (For other games, “<a title="That scene from War Games - YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHWjlCaIrQo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the only winning move&nbsp;is not to play</a>.”) Perhaps the best question of all:&nbsp;“Can we find a better game to play?”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>(This classification system is somewhat similar to a system proposed by Robert Anton Wilson in <em>The New Inquisition</em>, “in which propositions can be assigned one of 7 values: true, false, indeterminate, meaningless, self-referential, game rule, or strange loop” [<a title="Non-Aristotelian logic - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aristotelian_logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>].)</p>
<p>These points can interact in interesting ways. If you ask, “Why are the fundamental forces and physical constants the way they are?”, potential answers could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because if the forces and constants were sufficiently different, the universe could not support life and/or computation, and there would be no one around to ask the question. (See also: various flavors of the weak&nbsp;<a title="Anthropic principle - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anthropic principle</a>) [Physics + Mutual causality]</li>
<li>Because if the forces and constants were sufficiently different, the universe could not support conscious observers, and there would be no one around to collapse the wave function of the universe. (See also: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#von_Neumann.2FWigner_interpretation:_consciousness_causes_the_collapse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participatory anthropic principle</a>) [Physics + Uncertainty and/or Mutual causality]</li>
<li>Because, if universes in the multiverse reproduce through black holes (or unimaginably advanced intelligent life), then seemingly “fine-tuned” universes will predominate through <a title="Cosmological natural selection - Evo Devo Universe" href="http://evodevouniverse.com/wiki/Cosmological_natural_selection_(fecund_universes)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cosmological natural selection</a>. [Physics + Probability]</li>
<li>Because we’re living in a simulation, and it’s been optimized for good computation. (See also: <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2535" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this SMBC comic</a>) [Physics + Computational irreducibility]</li>

			<p>More and more people are talking about meditation and even worse, suggesting that I try it. While I appreciate that other people like the activity, some of the woo-vocabualry and the way that people treat it as a panacea really scratch my face.</p>
<p>But also, I’m kind of indignant about the fact that there are plenty of things that I’ve done that are ‘contemplative’ and I want them to <em>count.</em> While I’ve never regularly meditated, I am a very curious-about-my-mind kind of person. In this post I thought I’d give a run down of mind-states that I have experienced <em>without meditating</em>.</p>
<p>I’ll also write some stuff afterwards about how it all 100% counts and is Very Good.</p>
<h2>Lights Behind The Eyes</h2>
<p>I remain somewhat shocked when people don’t know what I mean when I say this.</p>
<p>The description: Close your eyes, as if for sleep. There is no light. I’m not talking about closing your eyes in bright sunlight I mean in darkness. Concentrate your attention/mind on the sense data you are getting from your eyes (or would be getting if they were open).</p>
<p>In a few seconds you should be able to see not-total-blackness, rather something else. Lights or colours or something. Shifting patterns that are dark but not black.</p>
<p>NB: if you have aphantasia you can still do this. I’m not talking about “picturing in your mind’s eye”, which is a sort of thinking, I’m talking about actual “seeing” with your actual eyes, even though what you see might be your brain experiencing “false” signals.</p>
<p>I find that when I’m ‘watching’ the colors I tend to focus my eyes onto a specific spot. AndÂ&nbsp;I mean literally focus, like squinting, not “focus” in the sense of “concentrate”. I can feel that my eye muscles are moving, probably to focus on something that is very close to my face, I assume that it’s literally my eyelids, or maybe it’s infinity.</p>
<p>This concentrating my attention and literally focussing on the back of my eyelids is different to thinking/imagining, where we typically look up or down and to the side, or totally unfocus our eyes. Â&nbsp;In this case I feel that I’m actively looking at something, but with eyelids closed.</p>
<p>This might be hard to understand for two reasons: it could be that the lights are obviously there and so much a part of your life experience, that you don’t see them, your brain ignores them. Or because you have never done this before and just because your eyes are closed you are deliberately turning your mind off, so you are not actually looking at the lights that are there. I find people who fall asleep easily struggle to know what I mean about these lights.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that my weak blue coloured irises have already lead to eye damage and only I can see this stuff – but apparently other people agree with me so hopefully it’s not that.</p>
<p>If you still can’t see them, you might want to try closing your eyes in bright sunlight. Your visual field then will be bright orange. Try to see the veins in your eyelids, which will be darker. It is this focus position for your eyes that you need in the darkness.</p>
<p>Once in darkness, pressing on your closed eyelids might also help, as this moves your eyeball around and sets off signals to your brain.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this technique will help you see something. Now, I will talk about my experiences of doing this.</p>
<p>I once heard that when a person is in a sensory deprivation tank, the brain likes to make up hallucinations of things. This is because there has never been a time in all your long life that you are awake, and yet there is no sensory data whatsoever. Your brain’s top-down processing is saying, “what’s there, there must be something there, a light, is there a light, perhaps a bird? Is it this thing? Is it this thing?” And it makes you hallucinate all the things. In the tank this happens with every sense – people report hearing loud noises, feeling sensations and seeing things, none of which were present in or outside of the tank.</p>
<p>Anyway, this explains why with your eyes closed in perfect darkness and focussing on the back of the eyelids one can “see” lights.</p>
<p>I experience them as orange or purple or a bit of both (something very like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_fringing">purple fringing</a> in photos) on a dark background.</p>
<p>Once you can see them and start watching them, they can start to take on patterns. Sometimes you’ll only get incoherent blobs, they might be ghosts of lights if you just came from a bright room or looked at your bedside lamp as you turned it off. Occasionally the patterns might be something like veins or crazy paving cracks but mine most often end up taking specific shapes, such as a five-pointed (palmate) leaves or my favourite, peacock feather ‘eyes’.</p>
<p><img src="http://theoryengine.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/peacock-feathers-3617473_1280.jpg" alt="peacock-feathers-3617473_1280" width="1280" height="854" srcset="http://theoryengine.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/peacock-feathers-3617473_1280.jpg 1280w, http://theoryengine.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/peacock-feathers-3617473_1280-300x200.jpg 300w, http://theoryengine.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/peacock-feathers-3617473_1280-768x512.jpg 768w, http://theoryengine.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/peacock-feathers-3617473_1280-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Another feature is that this pattern ground is not static, the lights are moving, and in the most fun instances the patterns seem to rush towards the viewer (me) in a never-ending tunnel, just like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVb5GV6lntU">youtube animations and artworks that seem to be moving towards you</a>.</p>
<p>The patterns seem to respond to your will if you relax into it enough, and can produce some beautiful shapes and novel morphing from one thing to another. Sometimes of course you drift away into thinking about things and if you’re not aphantasic then those things can be imagery. I imagine this is how artists get their ideas. Anyway, for a time in my life I “watched” these lights so often I wondered if there was something wrong with me.</p>
<p>The most interesting effects occur when deprived of sleep or when using some drugs, or ideally both. Cannabis is excellent for making the lights more patterned. The most intense effects I’ve had were when I stayed awake all night using cannabis and drinking tea (caffeine), and another time on a very small dose of mdma, some cannabis and also very sleep deprived – awake until 5am or so.</p>
<p>When sleep deprived, the patterns are more coherent, continuously move down this animated tunnel I have just described, morph and merge beautifully from one shape to another and once, one of them even ended in a final, stunning image which was a closed eye, styled like the ‘all-seeing eye’ or an ancient Egyptian eye, suddenly opening in a blinding flash and looking directly back at me.</p>
<p><img src="http://theoryengine.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/eye.jpg" alt="eye" width="1200" height="998" srcset="http://theoryengine.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/eye.jpg 1200w, http://theoryengine.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/eye-300x250.jpg 300w, http://theoryengine.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/eye-768x639.jpg 768w, http://theoryengine.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/eye-1024x852.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p>
<p>It is from this experience that I have the intuition that the location of the ‘third eye’ spoken of in various traditions is indeed located between and slightly above our two natural eyes, but it is also, in the third dimension actually hanging out in space about 2 inches in front of the forehead, not directly on the skin, because this is the location of the focus point when watching this internal light show / when focussing on the inner landscape.</p>
<h2>Body scanning</h2>
<p>Body scanning is a phrase I’ve heard only recently, but it seems to describe what I mean. Again, it involves lying in the dark but this time “feeling” one’s body with very great attention. I did this with most effect around my reproductive organs. For a while I focussed very carefully on feelings of period pain, curious about what it really was.</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion that the Greeks were half-right, your womb really does move around (a bit) across the menstrual cycle (the cervix radically changes position) and it also tenses and twists, inflates and deflates across it too. Because that’s what it <em>feels</em> like. I realised my womb was likely pressing on my intestines, or that they were unusually full, hence the bloaty, crampy feeling when premenstrual and why Victorian doctors dismissed period pain as “just” constipation.</p>
<p>It’s interesting what mental picture one has when thinking about the body with eyes closed. I once experienced my clitoris as a curve of blue light on a dark background. I don’t have any visual metaphors for other things though. On psychedelics, I once got the feeling that my lungs were in front of my body. I sometimes visualise my alveoli becoming wetter and softer when I’m feeling wheezy from asthma to ease the symptoms.</p>
<p>This practice seems to be the entire point of Focusing by Eugene Gendlin, whose technique involves careful, deliberate “feeling” of ones body, trying to identify and locate bodily sensations, then very slowly drawing out the experience into words. Through this one realises the tight coupling of bodily processes and emotions, and the great extent to which people are typically ignoring their bodies.</p>
<p>This kind of body awareness helps me with understanding emotions, diagnosing illness and improving my technique for physical things, such as weight lifting, as well as feeling like I understand and appreciate my body.</p>
<p>NB: doing this is not a good idea when in an anxious state or panic attack, it is likely to make symptoms worse.</p>
<h2>Psychedelics</h2>
<p>In some ways, much has been made of the visual effects that psychedelics can have. If you do an internet search for “psychedelic art” or even just “psychedelic” a typical range of artworks show up. From the first page of results I would say <a href="https://d2jv9003bew7ag.cloudfront.net/uploads/Alex-Grey-2-Hads-Trippy-Image-via-Thingstolookathigh-com.jpg">this image</a> is quite close to the kinds of things that I see.</p>
<p><a href="http://androidjones.com/tag/hyperdigital/">Android Jones</a> is by far the leader in psychedelic arts, now and maybe ever. Go ahead and check him out, I’ll wait.</p>
<p>The mind-state on psychedelics is quite interesting and largely not popularised by media outlets or anyone else. I plan to make a longer post of what being on LSD is really like.</p>
<p>Visually, when looking at a very blank, boring background (such as an 8/8 cover cloudy grey sky) I often see goddesses, sometimes with many arms like Shiva.</p>
<p>When looking at patterns, straight lines become wiggly. In wiggly, the wiggles grow fingers and curl and move around even more than in reality. Clouds become fractal on the edges. When looking at uniform colour fields, their contrast changes in continuous waves, like a cloud casting a moving shadow on the ocean. When looking at natural patterns, like stone, which has subtle gradations of colour, shapes and faces and lines continuously arise and retreat, flow and merge.</p>
<p>But the key to all of this imagery is that it is moving in a very specific way. It will turn, curl or shadow a small amount in one …</p></article></div>

  <p>
  I recently created a macOS app called Slack Lite, which beats Slack's desktop app across a few performance axises.
  Slack Lite uses Slack's official UI, so it's visually indistinguishable from the official client.
  Even so, Slack Lite uses 5x fewer threads, 3.5x less time to startup, 1.2x less memory, and significantly less CPU.
  In the Activity Monitor screenshots below, you can see the raw numbers (Slack Lite's processes are highlighted):
</p>


<img src="https://kofi.sexy/slack-app-fewer-resources/cpu.png" alt="
Table from Activity Monitor's CPU tab:
Slack Helper (Renderer), CPU %: 0.9, Threads: 15.
Highlighted: https://app.slack.com, CPU %: 0.1, Threads: 6.
Slack, CPU %: 0.1, Threads: 30.
Slack Helper, CPU %: 0.0, Threads: 9.
Slack Helper (GPU), CPU %: 0.0, Threads: 8.
Highlighted: Slack Lite, CPU %: 0.0, Threads: 5.
">


<img src="https://kofi.sexy/slack-app-fewer-resources/memory.png" alt="
Table from Activity Monitor's Memory tab:
Highlighted: https://app.slack.com, Memory: 262.4 MB.
Slack Helper (Renderer), Memory: 95.4 MB.
Slack, Memory: 62.8 MB.
Slack Helper (GPU), Memory: 49.7 MB.
Highlighted: Slack Lite, Memory: 24.1 MB.
Slack Helper, Memory: 12.4 MB.
">

<p>
  It's time to come clean: the performance differences described in this post are not really inherent to Slack Lite.
  I suspect you could get similar numbers by applying this Slack Lite approach to any Electron-based macOS app.
  Slack Lite is a <a href="https://github.com/hkgumbs/multi">Multi</a> app, which means it's using a WebKit WebView behind the scenes.
  Ultimately, the numbers above are a proxy for the Chrome vs. Safari comparison.
</p>

<p>
  I'm neither a performance engineer nor a desktop application engineer, but the Slack Lite approach just <em>feels right</em> to me.
  If I already have a browser engine built into my operating system, why should application developers ship a different one for use with their "native" app?
  Especially if that application is a minimal wrapper for an existing web application.
  I know that the answer circles around developer productivity, but to me the "state of the art" still feels off.
  I also know that other folks are thinking about this tension!
  Here's a neat demo from Twitter via <a href="https://twitter.com/nateparrott/status/1275829708354211840" rel="external">@nateparrott</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Here's another experiment we built at <a href="https://twitter.com/browsercompany" rel="external">@browsercompany</a>: "Launcher." Half the apps I use are web apps, and half are macOS apps. What if they behaved the same? (1/5)
    <video src="https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/EbSmCcZWAAES5EK.mp4" autoplay="" muted="" controls="" loop="" alt="Screen recording of a macOS app called Launcher. It appears to work much like Spotlight or Alfred, except that once an item is \" launched\",="" it="" becomes="" a="" full="" macos="" app="" with="" new="" window="" and="" dockbar="" entry."="">
    </video>
  </blockquote>


<p>
  Perhaps the most exciting part of this experiment is that I created the Slack Lite in <a href="https://kofi.sexy/slack-app-fewer-resources/demo.mp4">30 seconds</a>.
  As I mentioned above, Slack Lite is a Multi app.
  I built Multi specifically for this use case: quickly creating a lightweight macOS app from any group of websites.
  If that approach <em>feels right</em> to you as well, I hope you take a moment to try out Multi, which is open-source and available on GitHub:
  <a href="https://github.com/hkgumbs/multi">github.com/hkgumbs/multi</a>.

<p>Here’s why Google hires the way it does but you shouldn’t.</p>



<p>Every month or so on HackerNews, there’s a thread about how interviewing is broken which usually devolves into “Google (and the rest of the FAANGs) suck at interviewing”.</p>



<p>Last year, I spent a few months working on <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/about">The Holloway Guide to Technical Hiring and Recruiting</a>, over the course of which I got to spend a lot of time talking to people who have been really successful at designing hiring processes, conducting interviews and being interviewed. I learned far more about interviewing than I could have imagined, and it was a great chance to reflect on a lot of these interviewing debates.</p>



<p>One quote from my discussions with hiring managers stood out, and it was from a frustrated high-ranking VP at one of the FAANGs: “Our hiring process is what we can get away with”. He was making the point that many companies blindly copy their hiring process in general and their interviewing process specifically, assuming it’s the reason behind their success, but in reality, their hiring process isn’t actually that good and they’ve just been able to get away with it because they have a strong enough brand and can pay well enough (to quote him, “we still think we’re the only game in town”).</p>



<p>I think that’s partly true, and definitely would fit into the “big companies suck at interviewing narrative”, but I also think that if you just take it at face value, it’s a little simplistic. These big tech company’s have spent years looking at their hiring data and feeding that back into their hiring process (coining the term “<a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/subjects/people-analytics/">people analytics</a>” along the way). Yes, they could all probably be a little more successful if they just dialed down the arrogant “you’d-be-blessed-to-work-here” attitude that’s ingrained in their hiring processes, but in reality, their interviewing processes work quite well for <em>them.</em></p>



<p>Why? Well if you ask someone why big tech co’s do the types of algo/coding (aka “leetcode”) interviews they do, one answer you might get is that you <em>need</em> to have solid algorithm skills to succeed there. In fact, Dan Luu cites that as “<a href="https://danluu.com/algorithms-interviews/">the most common answer</a>” for why algorithmic interviews are necessary. I actually don’t think that’s the most common answer (at least, not from the people I asked, who were hiring managers and recruiters). The most common answer is actually: <strong>we want to hire smart problem-solvers with strong analytical skills, and since we <a href="https://qz.com/378228/google-is-over-those-ridiculous-brainteasers-but-some-employees-didnt-get-the-memo/#:~:text=The%20brain%20teasers%20that%20Google,would%20fit%20inside%20a%20747%3F%E2%80%9D">stopped asking brain-teasers because they’re irrelevant</a>, algorithmic questions are the next best thing</strong>. In other words, algorithmic questions are just a better way of assessing analytical skills.</p>



<p><strong>That’s bullshit.</strong> Anyone who has been on either side of an algo interview knows that you can totally prepare for them. Dozens of best-selling books, venture-backed startups, and cottage industry coaching practices have made money<em> </em>helping people improve their performance on these interviews. So it doesn’t actually assess your raw analytical skills. If you look at criticisms of algo interviews, what you’ll hear is that they actually assess:</p>



<ul><li>willingness to spend time preparing for these types of interviews.</li><li>pattern-matching skills (map a problem to something you’ve seen before).</li></ul>



<p>But this still works for big tech co’s.</p>



<p>If you’re a large tech co with a big brand and a salary scale that ranks at the top of <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">Levels.fyi</a>, a good interview weeds out people who wouldn’t do well at your company. To do well at a large tech company, you need to (and I’m painting with a really broad brush, but this is true for 90% of roles at these companies):</p>



<ol><li>Some sort of problem-solving skill that’s a mix of raw intelligence and/or ability to solve problems by pattern-matching to things you’ve seen before.</li><li>Ability/commitment to work on something that may not <em>always </em>be that intrinsically motivating, in the context of getting/maintaining a well-paying job at a large, known company.</li></ol>



<p>Hopefully you can see where I’m going with this. Basically, the very criticisms thrown at these types of interviews are the reason they work well for these companies. They’re a good proxy for the work you’d be doing there and how willing you are to do it.</p>



<p>Not that there’s anything wrong with that type of work. I spent several years at big tech co’s, and the work was intellectually stimulating most of the time. But a lot of times it wasn’t. It was a lot of pattern-matching. Looking at how someone else had solved a problem in a different part of the code-base, and adapting that to my use-case.</p>



<p>You really only need one Dan Luu per like 10 or 100 engineers at a FAANG. Most people aren’t going to be optimizing at the level he is, they’re going to be doing work that’s mostly a mix of problem-solving by pattern matching, and ideally, they’re motivated enough to have that job for as long as possible.</p>



<p>Now, unless you are one of those large companies, the type of people you want to hire will be a little different. You might need people who are passionate about a particular domain, or are really strong <em>creative </em>problem-solvers—and sometimes the very things that make someone a strong creative problem-solver can make them a weak pattern-matcher. Entrepreneurs tend to be creative problem-solvers; VCs tend to be strong pattern-matchers. With few exceptions, strong entrepreneurs are shit VCs and vice versa.</p>



<p>To tie this back to the original quote, you also probably don’t have the brand or money that big tech co’s do. So you might incorporate algorithms into your interview process, but you might also consider <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/conducting-interviews">hands-on in-person interviews</a> or <a href="https://www.holloway.com/g/technical-recruiting-hiring/sections/take-homes">take-home interviews</a> (though those also have pro’s and con’s). The point is, don’t dismiss what big tech co’s do, but don’t blindly copy them either.</p>

					<p>“That deer is huge!”</p><p>I’d been driving home late that night. As I came up to my house, my headlights landed on the biggest deer I had ever seen, right in the middle of the road. I live by some woodlands and neighbors had mentioned deer having free reign in there, but this was the first time I got to see one. This guy didn’t grow that big with proverbial instincts: when my headlights landed on it, Bambi dashed away...straight up my driveway!</p><p>Come back!</p><p>I chased after it, hoping to prolong my impromptu safari by another second or two, only to see a white tail disappear into the bushes.</p><p>That was too short, I wanted to see Bambi again!</p><p>I rarely see animals around the house, but they’re definity there. We hear coyotes howling at night and were warned of a bobcat prowling the area. They know how to stay out of sight though, I almost never get to see them in person.</p><p>Hmm...could I fix that?</p><p>What if I set up a camera to look for the animals and tell me when walked by? I’d get to see them every day! (I'm not going to deny it, I was kinda inspired by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFZFjoX2cGg">ninja squirrel obstacle course</a>).</p><p>Time to brainstorm what I’d build:</p><ul><li>A live video feed pointed at the woods.</li><li>Then record video whenever animals walk by. I’ll save it in the cloud!</li><li>I’d need an iPhone app to notify me when an animal is outside.</li><li>Oh, and I can stream the video feed to the app.</li><li>Gotta have AI! I’ll use image recognition to detect which animal is walking by so that I’m only notified when the more unique animals walk by (sorry racoons).</li><li>Finally, some logging to record the time of day each animal showed up. Let’s get scientific</li></ul><p>It was totally doable. I was already imagining the day when I’d get an alert on my phone saying “Quick, there’s a deer outside!” </p><p>But there was a nagging voice in the back of my head. It whispered: <strong>“You’ll never finish this”</strong></p><p>See, I have a long line of side projects left abandoned by the wayside. “You’ll abandon this one too” the voice kept insisting, “Don’t bother starting.” </p><p>I didn’t want to listen to that voice. But it wasn’t lying either. </p><p>Now what?</p><p>Alright, it’s calling out a real risk. Risk noticed. What can I do to mitigate it and improve my odds? I thought back to my past projects, hoping to find a hint that would let this one have a happy ending.</p><p>I found one.</p><p>It sounds crazy, but as I thought through all my old projects, I realized the dead projects had something surprising in common: I abandoned them about two weeks after starting. Almost every side project I completed was something I finished in under two weeks. <strong>Two weeks seemed to be when my motivation ran out.</strong></p><p>Huh, that was unexpected. </p><p>It kinda made sense though. All of those passion projects were something I did for fun, without a large cause propelling them. I had certainly completed large, multi-month side projects before, but all of them solved some pressing need. But the ones which were just for fun? They were forgotten once the enthusiasm wore off. Which apparently takes two weeks.</p><p>Watching deer was definitely a “for fun” project. That meant <strong>I had a deadline</strong>, and not an artificial one. There was an invisible hourglass, and with each passing second my motivation was trickling away. </p><p>I had a clock to beat.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/pasted_image_0-1-.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/pasted_image_0-1-.png 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/pasted_image_0-1-.png 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/pasted_image_0-1-.png 1087w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>How do I do that? There’s no way I could build that many features in two weeks.</p><p>It was time to do the same thing I do at work: Cut scope mercilessly.</p><p><strong>If I couldn’t complete the project in two weeks, it wasn’t worth attempting</strong>. As much as I was in love with the vision, I had to look at the entire project with this lens. So what gets the axe?</p><p>First I had to <strong>be clear about the *real* problem I was trying to solve. </strong></p><p>I wanted to see the animals as they walked by. That required software to notice when they showed up. And something to notify me about it immediately. That’s it. <strong>Everything else was fluff.</strong></p><p>I had to kill the fluff</p><p>Saving footage of the deer would be really cool, but nope. Goodbye cloud recording. </p><p>Live streaming video to my phone? Never mind.</p><p>Logging? Only at the end, if I have time.</p><p>Even for the remaining features I tried to keep cutting scope. For every bit of work I’d ask myself: Do I really need to have this? <strong>Is there a simpler way I can achieve the same goal?</strong></p><p>Did I really need to build my own app to tell me about the animal outside? A telegram bot could do that. Great, no need to learn how to build iphone apps.</p><p>It was critical to <strong>limit how many new tools I’d have to learn</strong>. Learning one new tool would take a while and eat into the two week window. Learning two new tools would guarantee failure. </p><p>Maybe this wasn’t the time to figure out a new machine learning library, I’ll use a motion sensing algorithm instead. When the app detected motion it would take a picture and send it to me. I’d take over the AI’s job and decide if it was interesting.</p><p>Sometimes the scope cuts were much more subtle. Some steps which might be best practices at work are unnecessary bloat at home. To know which is which,<strong> think about why </strong>it’s a best practice in the first place. </p><p>Should I write tests for the motion sensing code? I had no idea how to test that. Heck, I won’t be maintaining this code after two weeks anyways. Cut. What about a clean, general way to send notifications to people? I’m the only recipient here, so I’ll just hardcode myself into the telegram bot instead.</p><p>But the urge to add “useful” features doesn’t go away. There’s even a name for it: scope creep. </p><p>It’s the insistent urge that you should add one more thing. “I should make it easier to code this” “What if I do that with a different tool instead?”</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/one-more-thing.png" alt=""></figure><p>Scope creep happens naturally, and<strong> if I didn’t fight it the timer would run out</strong>.</p><p>Time for the coding spree. I found the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Camera-Module-1080P30/dp/B071WP53K7/">right camera</a> on Amazon. Buy. Wrote the motion sensing code, hooked it up to a camera. Done. Wrote a telegram bot. Woohoo! Hooked them up to each other. Boo yeah!</p><p>I hit the two week mark, but I was still going strong. I was going to finish this! Calibrating the motion sensor to work outdoors turned out to be trickier than I’d expected but I was making progress...when the last grain of sand trickled out ⏳</p><p>Despite my best efforts, a couple days went by when I couldn’t work on the project and suddenly the motivation timer ticked down to zero. &nbsp;Suddenly pushing it to completion felt like a slog. I didn’t want to continue. </p><p>No! I had almost finished it! The project was 95% finished, it just needed a bit more of a push to be complete. </p><p>But it just didn’t feel interesting anymore. </p><p>There had never been a grand vision driving this thing, I’d started it on a whim. And the motivation was as fleeting as the motive.</p><p>A part of me wanted to deny it. “I’ll finish it tomorrow,” I kept thinking. Five tomorrows later I had to accept the truth. It was time to move on and let go of that mental burden. This was a passion project, once the passion wore off it just wasn’t worth slogging through. </p><p>But all wasn’t lost. When I started the project I had carefully designed it to really be three distinct projects disguised as one: a motion sensing algorithm, a telegram bot, and an integration project which put it all together. I had completed the first two projects! That would not have happened without me relentlessly cutting scope.</p><p>And every project was useful. I’d designed the motion sensor and telegram bot to be independent of the exact application I was developing. Now in any of my future projects I’ll be able to <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/create-reusable-components/">reuse those components</a> if needed, saving me days of work and letting me complete more ambitious projects in that same two week period. I have new tools in my tool belt. That’s still a win!</p><p><strong>By trying to do less stuff, I got more stuff done.</strong></p><p>So I moved on. But now if that niggling voice ever comes back, I’ll be ready. </p><p>And if I see Bambi again, I’ll just take a picture.</p><figure><img src="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/deer.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/deer.jpg 600w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/deer.jpg 1000w, https://www.zainrizvi.io/content/images/2020/08/deer.jpg 1377w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>

<section id="mc_embed_signup">

</section>
<p>When I graduated from college, my dream was to lead a team at a startup. Over the past decade, I’ve had the opportunity to serve in a <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/work/">variety of engineering and management roles</a> with funded tech startups and, most recently I joined The Graide Network as their <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/joining-the-graide-network">Chief Technology Officer</a>.</p>
<p>The Graide Network was my dream job. I got to pick the tech stack, hire the team, make important decisions, and speak and write about all of it. It was challenging, exciting, and it felt like something I’d want to do forever.</p>
<p>In 2020, when Covid-19 struck, the business hit a wall. Our customers (K-12 schools) tightened their budgets, and like many early-stage startups, we had to let a few team members go. I had been managing the engineering team for four years, and now and after Covid, the team had contracted to just one other developer and me.</p>
<p>As I reflected on my career, I realized that it was time for a change. I had grown very comfortable as an early-stage startup CTO, and I was afraid that by continuing with The Graide Network (or finding a similar startup job), I would remain safely in my comfort zone forever.</p>
<h2 id="the-comfort-zone-the-most-dangerous-place-to-be">The Comfort Zone: The Most Dangerous Place to Be</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you opt for a safe life, you will never know what it’s like to win.”
<strong>- Richard Branson</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mECllQz.jpg" alt="Get out of your comfort zone"></p>
<p>Every leap forward I’ve made in my career has been followed by a visceral, gut-wrenching increase in anxiety.</p>
<p>I distinctly remember being brought into a meeting with the founders when I was at Packback and being told that our Head of Engineering was leaving and that I’d be taking over. I didn’t sleep that night. I couldn’t stop thinking, worrying, and asking myself what the hell I was going to do.</p>
<p>The same feeling carried me through <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/one-year-conference-summary">my first conference talk</a>. I had spoken in front of small audiences in meetings and informal settings, but being on stage with lights and a microphone, and a timer was sickening. I basically blacked out and, at some point, walked off stage while people clapped politely.</p>
<p>But, after leading small engineering teams for over five years at early stage startups, the job had become mundane. I had a process for everything, I knew what the most likely technical and business challenges were going to be, and I was getting great reviews from my teammates. I’m not saying I was the world’s best engineer or manager, but I had reached a level of adequacy that allowed me to be very comfortable.</p>
<p>While living in my comfort zone, I wasn’t having sleepless periods of frantic anxiety, but I also wasn’t growing.</p>
<h2 id="the-hedgehog-concept">The Hedgehog Concept</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hedgehog Concept comes from the Greek fable about the fox and the hedgehog: while the wily fox knows many things, the simple hedgehog only knows one thing, but that one knowledge bite is highly impactful in protecting itself against danger.
<strong>- Jim Collins</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Knowing that I needed to be chasing growth, I began contemplating a more significant career pivot, and <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html">Jim Collins’ Hedgehog Concept</a> kept coming to mind. The Hedgehog Concept says that to build something <em>great</em>, you have to focus on the intersection of these three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>What are you deeply passionate about?</li>
<li>What can you be the best in the world at?</li>
<li>What drives your economic engine?</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D7CA14F8F5FDBCC0CAA5D1A347773A815DA981E958DB2DB5DE1BEBB0452535C7_1597613694050_hedgehog.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Collins was talking about building companies, but it’s true for careers as well. My job as an engineering leader had allowed me to earn good money, but I wasn’t going to be the best in the world at it, and I wouldn’t call engineering my life’s passion. When I think about what people might say at my funeral, it’s not, “Oh, Karl, he was a great engineer.”</p>
<p>As I started exploring my options, talking to friends and mentors, and weighing various business ideas, I kept wondering what I really wanted to be the “best in the world at?”</p>
<h2 id="the-best-at-one-thing-or-pretty-good-at-two-things">The Best at One Thing or Pretty Good at Two Things?</h2>
<p>Several years ago, I read <a href="https://amzn.to/2BEjOWx"><em>How To Fail at Almost Everything And Still Win Big</em></a>, by Dilbert creator Scott Adams. While I don’t agree with much of Adams’ politics, the book is full of sage advice for anyone who thinks differently from the mainstream.</p>
<p>One of my biggest takeaways was Adams’ idea about combining skills:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want something extraordinary, you have two paths:</p>
<ol>
<li>Become the best at one specific thing.</li>
<li>Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first strategy is difficult to the point of near impossibility…I don’t recommend anyone even try. The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort.
<strong>-</strong> <a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/07/career-advice.html"><strong>Scott Adams</strong></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adams goes on to talk about how he was never going to be the best cartoonist, but he was pretty good at it and had a business background that was unique in the field. He realized that he didn’t want to compete with the best cartoonists, but instead to compete with the <em>very few</em> people who were good cartoonists with a prior career in business.</p>
<p>This simple yet brilliant idea makes becoming successful an order of magnitude easier.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_D7CA14F8F5FDBCC0CAA5D1A347773A815DA981E958DB2DB5DE1BEBB0452535C7_1597613794724_0_RSROzF7UkOg8sdvO.png" alt="Skill stacking visualized on Forge"></p>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h2>
<p>As I thought about my skills, passions, and the things that people would pay me for, I started to think about <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/writing/">writing</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve always loved writing. It’s therapeutic and allows me to help, teach, and encourage others. My final internship in college was as a technical writer, and a few companies had approached me about writing for their blogs. I figured that if I could find a few clients to pay me to write, I’d make a go of it.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-two-months">The First Two Months</h2>
<p>In May 2020, I <a href="https://github.com/malgamves/CommunityWriterPrograms">found a list of freelance technical writing opportunities</a>, and <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/start-freelance-blogging">I started applying</a>. By June, I had written for six different clients, and I was starting to trade out some of my lower-paying clients for higher-paying ones. I wasn’t making as much as I would as a developer, but I started to see a path forward.</p>
<p>I talked to my CEO at The Graide Network to let her know that <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/i-gave-my-notice-im-going-full-time-b37d46266b">I’d be transitioning out</a> by the end of the summer. I offered to ramp down slowly and stay on as a part-time advisor if she thought it would help. This eased the transition and allowed me to start thinking about how I could make a real living as a writer.</p>
<h2 id="the-fish-start-biting">The Fish Start Biting</h2>
<p>After writing a few articles and continuing to comb through my network, I had more work than I could handle.</p>
<p>I found out that companies have a really hard time finding experienced software engineers who are also good writers and started to wonder if the market might be bigger than I first thought. I was doing almost zero outbound sales and still being approached by 2-3 new clients per week. Several of my early clients had mentioned job opportunities, and people referred business to me from all over.</p>
<p>So, I did the logical thing and kept raising my rates.</p>
<p>While this priced out some of my early clients, they understood that I needed to make a living.</p>
<h2 id="so-this-is-product-market-fit">So this is Product-Market Fit?</h2>
<p>As I continued to field interest, I kept thinking about Justin Jackson’s essay, <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/jump"><em>What Does Product-Market Fit Feel Like?</em></a> In it, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without you having to try too hard, customers should be showing up to buy your product…Many of the problems entrepreneurs face are related to <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/niche"><strong>targeting a niche</strong></a> where there aren’t a lot of fish, or the fish aren’t biting.
<strong>- Justin Jackson</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had worked with several startups where sales were <em>by far</em> the biggest challenge. Reflecting on those experiences, I realized that <strong>my past startups were trying to convince people to pay for something completely new.</strong> While this path makes sense for funded startups, I expected to spend months finding my first few clients, and instead, I had stumbled into a pond filled with hungry fish. It was exciting and a little bit scary.</p>
<p>I started to think about what it would take to scale this business up.</p>
<h2 id="productize-and-scale">Productize and Scale</h2>
<p>I’ve been listening to <a href="http://bootstrappedweb.com/">Brian Casel’s Bootstrapped Web podcast</a> for the past year. Brian runs a business called <a href="https://audienceops.com/">AudienceOps</a>, a “productized” content writing service where he’s been able to serve more clients and grow a profitable lifestyle business that runs mostly without him.</p>
<p>While I enjoy writing, I was nervous about freelancing full-time forever. What happens if I want to take a month off? If I have to keep increasing my rates, will I only be able to work with huge, boring clients? Will I get sick of writing variations on the same few technical topics for years?</p>
<p>One of my long-term career goals has always been to start a business. Freelancers may be self-employed, but they’re really just working several small jobs, so I knew I wanted to do something bigger than that.</p>
<p>In July, I stopped taking clients who wanted to hire me specifically and started redirecting them to my fledgling agency, <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft</a>. While I imagine I’ll continue doing much of the writing this year, hiring other writers allows me to continue focusing on hard (to me) problems like sales, marketing, and building processes.</p>
<h2 id="the-new-corner-store">The New “Corner Store”</h2>
<p>Compared with the ambitious, venture-funded startups I worked for in the past, Draft is so…simple. There are customers with a need, and I have a skill that helps them meet that need. If I’m smart, I’ll be able to operationalize it and get out of the day-to-day within a few years. To me, that sounds like a fascinating problem to solve, even if it’s not something worthy of outside investment.</p>
<p>I see online lifestyle businesses like mine as the “corner store” of our generation. Our grandparents could lease a storefront, and (with a little luck and hard work) ride the wave of growing prosperity in their neighborhood to make a living. I’m not going to build the next Facebook, but there’s enough growth in the technology sector to make a living in lots of little niches you might not have expected.</p>
<p>So that’s why I left my career as a startup CTO to become a writer. <a href="https://twitter.com/karllhughes">Find me on Twitter</a> or <a href="https://mailchi.mp/a183cf10b418/startups">sign up for my newsletter</a> if you want to follow along.</p>
