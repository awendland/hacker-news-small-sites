            <div>
                <div><p>“The people that think you’re an asshole, they already think that about you now, Leo! You might as well do what you want anyway.” This Is what my friend Ed told me when I shared with him my fears about telling some grueling stories in my upcoming book. And what people might think about me when they read it and what I’ve done so far in my life. Strangely that was a huge relief.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if they don’t think so negatively about me as I’d projected when they find out about another “outing”, it’ll probably bring us closer together. In a way, it’s a win-win.</p>
<p><a href="https://leowid.com/the-6-practices-that-influenced-my-life-the-most-over-the-past-5-years/">Radical honesty</a> is a bitch, I’m learning. It hurts so bad at times but also frees me so much.</p>
<p>I’ve since mentioned this phrase of his several times with friends and in coaching sessions in various ways: those people that you think don’t like you, they already don’t like you now. Whether you do the thing or not.</p>
<p>What this leads to is courage. Courage is the thing we find when we give up on needing to be liked. Even for a brief moment. Then we are free to do what we want to do because we want to do it. This is real freedom.</p>
<p>It’s crushing and disappointing that we can’t stay there in that state of freedom. That we retreat again after a while into the darkness and the need to be liked and wanted. That’s ok, that’s life. From there, we garner and ripen the courage yet again to go out there and not care for what others think of us.</p>
<p>Along the way, we might make some friends that encourage us in this process and that back and forth. But it’s really not necessary to be too harsh on ourselves when we realize none of these states are permanent.</p>
<p>“Cheer up! You can’t blame anyone else for the kind of world that you’re in. And if you know that “I”, in the sense of the person, the front, the ego, it really doesn’t exist. Then it won’t go to your head to badly if you wake up and discover that you’re god.” is what Alan watts said, which I feel belongs here.</p>
<p>So go out there. And don’t worry about the people you fear think of you as an asshole, they already do that now anyway. You might as well take my friend Ed’s advice and do your thing regardless. Good luck and I’m here if I can help.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Like I said in one of my previous posts, I just started my first semester in my <a href="https://ruky.me/2020/12/23/what-is-health-informatics-and-what-i-do-for-a-living/" data-type="post" data-id="85">MSc in health informatics</a>. And the first semester has a module for object oriented programming.</p>
<h2>Some history</h2>
<p>I was lucky to learn computers since I was 10 years old, even though computers were mostly used in offices and even though my parents didn’t have much knowledge in computers, they sent me to a class where they taught the basics in computing.</p>
<p>After some basics in computers, we were fist taught MS Basic, as a 11 year old, basic was an easy to understand language, me and my friends experimented in creating new programmes and it was all fun.</p>
<p>Then as the years went on we learned Pascal, C++, Visual Basic and JAVA. By 14-15 I created some interesting programs with Visual Basic and .NET. Every Saturday me and my friends at the computer class showed off to each other what they have created during the week. It was a fun time.</p>
<p>As a 15 year old one thing I failed to grasp was object oriented programming, yes I knew how to use Visual Basic, but it took me some more time to really understand the scope of Object Oriented Programming.</p>
<h2>Me trying to teach programming to doctors</h2>
<p>I went to become a doctor, but even at medical college I never lost my touch in programming, and curiosity to learn new things. I learned JavaScript, frameworks like Angular, Vue, React, and now I’m more interested in web technologies.</p>
<p>Fast forward 15 years later, I’m learning basics in Object Oriented Programming again, as a post graduate student in health informatics.</p>
<p>Even though I’m also a newbie in networking and software engineering (I never liked hardware and networking side of things as a child), because I have learned the basics of programming, I feel object oriented programming and JAVA lessons as something that comes natural to me.</p>
<p>However, the same cannot be said to some of my colleagues, whom they have not learned programming or basics in computing when they were young. This is their first time in learning object oriented programming, JAVA. Almost everyone is more than 30 years old, and some of them turn to me to explain them how to get though their JAVA assignments.</p>
<p>I constantly repeat them the fact that,</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Don’t learn java, don’t try to memorise the java syntax, learn the principals of object oriented programming, and programming. Once you learn the concepts, you will be able to apply that to any OOP language and crate whatever you want.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>However, they constantly find it difficult to grasp the concepts object oriented programming, and in return they also find it difficult to learn java or any other language.</p>
<p>And when I try to explain, or “<em>try to</em> <em>teach</em> them” Java they always find it difficult to understand</p>
<ul><li>What is a function/method?</li><li>What is meant by return?</li><li>What is an array? What is an index? </li><li>Why looping is so hard to understand?</li><li>What is the meaning of <em>public stat</em>ic void main()</li></ul>
<p>There are some of the usual questions I get to answer but still no matter how hard I explained to them, they always find it difficult to understand it.</p>
<h2>Why teaching programming is so difficult?</h2>
<ul><li>Maybe I’m not a good teacher</li><li>Maybe I’m trying to explain to them in a position where I’m subconsciously explaining to them thinking they also had some basic knowledge in computing when they were children.</li><li>It is a known fact that with age you lose the ability to learn new skills, is due to their age which makes it difficult for them to understand programming?</li><li>Is it because they straightaway had to go to Java instead of learning a simpler language first, like what I did as a child?</li><li>Since they are doctors I don’t think they lack the analitical capabilities in understanding the logics behind programming. </li></ul>
<p>So what makes it so difficult for them to understand programming?</p>
<h2>What should I do to make them like programming, and learn the basics in object oriented programming?</h2>
<p>I tried everything possible, </p>
<ul><li>I explained to them as simple as I can</li><li>I showed them some articles available online</li><li>I wrote some easy to understand posts by my self and emailed to them</li><li>I showed them some YouTube videos that explains object oriented programming and java </li></ul>
<p>But none of them seems to work and I don’t see a good progress in any of them.</p>
<p>What do you recommend that I should to to make them learn programming basics and JAVA? The last option is to create some basic lessons coupled with some simple exercises for them to do, instead of somewhat complex assignments given to them by the MSc program.</p>

<![CDATA[Rust's SemVer Snares: `Repr(transparent)` Super-Cut]]>

January 17, 2021 | https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/semver-snares-transparent/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/semver-snares-transparent/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><a href="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/semver-snares"><em>(Part of an ongoing series!)</em></a></p>
<p>In the last two posts, <code>repr(transparent)</code> provided an unusual mechanism by which safe, downstream code could inadvertently rely on the <a href="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/semver-snares-size/">size</a> and <a href="https://jack.wrenn.fyi/blog/semver-snares-alignment/">alignment</a> of an upstream type. In this post, I'll recap the issue and discuss why it is tricky to fix.</p>
<p>To recap, <code>repr(transparent)</code> attribute provides a mechanism for observing the alignment of a type. The <code>repr(transparent)</code> attribute can be applied to types where:</p>
<ul>
<li>at most one field has size greater-than zero, and</li>
<li>all <em>other</em> fields have minimum alignment equal to 1</li>
</ul>
<p>...to specify that the annotated type's layout is identical to that of the non-zero-sized field.</p>
<p>Applying <code>repr(transparent)</code> to a type with more than one field of size ≥1 is a compile error:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(transparent)]
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>Foo {
    </span><span>bar</span><span>: </span><span>u8</span><span>, </span><span>// size = 1
    </span><span>baz</span><span>: </span><span>u8  </span><span>// size = 1 (⚠)
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>...as is applying <code>repr(transparent)</code> to a type with more than one field having alignment &gt;1:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(transparent)]
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>Foo {
    </span><span>bar</span><span>: </span><span>u8</span><span>,      </span><span>// align = 1
    </span><span>baz</span><span>: [</span><span>u16</span><span>; 0] </span><span>// align = 2 (⚠)
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>At present, you should not use <code>#[repr(transparent)]</code> unless you are sure your ZST fields are <em>guaranteed</em> to have size equal to zero, and alignment equal to one.</strong></p>
<p>What would it take to fully shift this diligence from the programmer to the compiler?</p>
<h2 id="potentially-breaking-changes">Potentially-Breaking Changes</h2>
<p>To answer this, let's consider the sorts of (otherwise) non-breaking changes that can increase the alignment and size of ZSTs.</p>
<h3 id="repr-annotations"><code>repr</code> Annotations</h3>
<p>Applying a <code>repr</code> annotation to a type can alter its size and alignment. The <code>align(N)</code> modifier specifies that the annotated type will have a minimum alignment of at least <code>N</code>:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// uncommenting this line breaks `Bar`:
/* #[repr(align(2))] */
</span><span>struct </span><span>Foo;

#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(transparent)]
</span><span>struct </span><span>Bar(</span><span>u8</span><span>, Foo);
</span></code></pre>
<p>Adding <code>repr(C)</code> or <code>repr(&lt;primitive&gt;)</code> to an ZST <code>enum</code> can increase its size:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// uncommenting this line breaks `Bar`:
/* #[repr(isize)] */
</span><span>enum </span><span>Foo {
  Variant
}

#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(transparent)]
</span><span>struct </span><span>Bar(</span><span>u8</span><span>, Foo);
</span></code></pre><h3 id="fields">Fields</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, it is not a breaking change to:</p>
<ul>
<li>modify or remove private fields</li>
<li>add private fields to structs marked with <code>#[non_exhaustive]</code></li>
<li>add private fields to structs that already have private fields</li>
</ul>
<p>...but, in the presence of <code>repr(transparent)</code>, all of the above changes can potentially break downstream code.</p>
<p>The minimum alignment of <code>repr(C)</code> and <code>repr(transparent)</code> types is equal to the greatest minimum alignment of its fields. Adding a &gt;1-aligned field to a 1-aligned ZST prohibits that ZST from use as a field in a <code>repr(transparent)</code> type:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(C)]
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>Foo {
    </span><span>bar</span><span>: [</span><span>u8</span><span>; 0], </span><span>// align == 1
    // uncommenting this field breaks `Bar`:
    /* baz: [u16; 0], */ // align == 2
</span><span>}

#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(transparent)]
</span><span>struct </span><span>Bar(</span><span>u8</span><span>, Foo);
</span></code></pre>
<p>Likewise, adding or modifying a field of a ZST such that the size increases in a breaking change:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(C)]
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>Foo {
    </span><span>bar</span><span>: (),
    </span><span>// uncommenting this field breaks `Bar`:
    /* baz: u8 */
</span><span>}

#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(transparent)]
</span><span>struct </span><span>Bar(</span><span>u8</span><span>, Foo);
</span></code></pre><h3 id="type-parameters">Type Parameters</h3>
<p>As type parameters provide a mechanism for consumers to alter the private, internal details of a type, <em>changes</em> to how type parameters are instantiated directly effect the alignment of a type:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>/// `Foo` is *always* a ZST, but its alignment is equal to that of `T` 
</span><span>#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(C)] </span><span>struct </span><span>Foo&lt;T&gt;([T; 0]);

assert_eq!(</span><span>0</span><span>, size_of::&lt;Foo&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;&gt;());
assert_eq!(</span><span>0</span><span>, size_of::&lt;Foo&lt;</span><span>u16</span><span>&gt;&gt;());

assert_eq!(</span><span>1</span><span>, align_of::&lt;Foo&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;&gt;());
assert_eq!(</span><span>2</span><span>, align_of::&lt;Foo&lt;</span><span>u16</span><span>&gt;&gt;());
</span></code></pre>
<p>...and the size of a type:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>/// `Foo` is 1-aligned, but has the size of `T`
</span><span>#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(C, packed)] </span><span>struct </span><span>Foo&lt;T&gt;(MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;);

assert_eq!(</span><span>1</span><span>, size_of::&lt;Foo&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;&gt;());
assert_eq!(</span><span>2</span><span>, size_of::&lt;Foo&lt;</span><span>u16</span><span>&gt;&gt;());

assert_eq!(</span><span>1</span><span>, align_of::&lt;Foo&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;&gt;());
assert_eq!(</span><span>1</span><span>, align_of::&lt;Foo&lt;</span><span>u16</span><span>&gt;&gt;());
</span></code></pre>
<p>Consequently, Rust must usually assume that generically-instantiated fields are <em>not</em> one-aligned ZSTs:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(transparent)]
</span><span>struct </span><span>Foo&lt;T, U&gt;(T, [U; 0]);
</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>error<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/error-index.html#E0690" target="_blank">[E0690]</a>: transparent struct needs exactly one non-zero-sized field, but has 2</span>
 <a href="#" data-line="2" data-col="1">--&gt; src/lib.rs:2:1
</a>  |
2 | struct Foo&lt;T, U&gt;(T, [U; 0]);
  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^-^^------^^
  | |                |  |
  | |                |  this field is non-zero-sized
  | |                this field is non-zero-sized
  | needs exactly one non-zero-sized field, but has 2
</code></pre>
<p>This error is necessary if one wants to provide <em>definition-site</em> errors for <code>repr(transparent)</code> violations.</p>
<h3 id="const-parameters">Const Parameters</h3>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the instantiation of a const-generic parameter can affect the size of a type:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>/// the alignment of `Foo&lt;N&gt;` is 1
/// the size of `Foo&lt;N&gt;` is `N` bytes
</span><span>#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(C)]
</span><span>struct </span><span>Foo&lt;</span><span>const</span><span> N: </span><span>usize</span><span>&gt;([</span><span>u8</span><span>; N]);
</span></code></pre>
<p>The instantiation of const-generic parameters can also affect the alignment of a type:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use </span><span>std::mem::align_of;

</span><span>/// alignment of `ZST&lt;{N}&gt;` is equal to `N`
/// the size of `ZST&lt;{N}&gt;` is equal to 0.
</span><span>#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(C)]
</span><span>pub struct </span><span>ZST&lt;</span><span>const</span><span> N: </span><span>usize</span><span>&gt;
where
    (): Align&lt;{N}</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,
{
    align: [</span><span>&lt;</span><span>() </span><span>as </span><span>Align&lt;{N}</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>::Type; </span><span>0</span><span>],
}

assert_eq!(</span><span>1</span><span>, align_of::&lt;ZST&lt;1&gt;&gt;());
assert_eq!(</span><span>2</span><span>, align_of::&lt;ZST&lt;2&gt;&gt;());

</span><span>pub trait </span><span>Align&lt;const N: usize&gt; { </span><span>type </span><span>Type; }
#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(</span><span>align</span><span>(1)</span><span>)] </span><span>pub struct </span><span>Align1;
#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(</span><span>align</span><span>(2)</span><span>)] </span><span>pub struct </span><span>Align2;
</span><span>/* and so on */
</span><span>impl </span><span>Align&lt;{1}&gt; </span><span>for</span><span> () { </span><span>type </span><span>Type </span><span>=</span><span> Align1; }
</span><span>impl </span><span>Align&lt;{2}&gt; </span><span>for</span><span> () { </span><span>type </span><span>Type </span><span>=</span><span> Align2; }
</span><span>/* and so on */
</span></code></pre><h3 id="default-repr-and-rustc-version">Default <code>repr</code> and <code>rustc</code> Version</h3>
<p>Generally speaking, the layout properties of "default repr" (i.e., a type without a <code>repr</code> attribute) are <em>unspecified</em>. To my knowledge, it is not currently specified that:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>enum </span><span>Foo {
  Bar
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>is guaranteed to be a one-aligned and zero-sized. Although <code>Foo</code> may be laid out as such by <em>particular</em> versions of Rust (such as the version available at the time of writing), that may not be true for <em>future</em> versions of Rust. This is a deeper issue than just SemVer stability.</p>
<h2 id="enforcing-semver-stability">Enforcing SemVer Stability</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, there is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78586">some effort to eliminate</a> the stability hazards of <code>repr(transparent)</code>. However, to <em>comprehensively</em> enforce that uses of <code>#[repr(transparent)]</code> are SemVer-respecting at type definition sites in this manner, <code>rustc</code> would need implement all of the following restrictions atop the basic well-formedness check:</p>
<ol>
<li>prohibit, on all but one field, most occurences of type parameters</li>
<li>prohibit, on all but one field, most occurences of const parameters</li>
<li>require, on all but one field, that field types are fully-implicitly constructible</li>
<li>require, on all but one field, that field types have well-specified sizes and alignments</li>
<li>document that changing the <code>repr</code> of <em>any</em> one-aligned ZST is a SemVer Breaking Change™</li>
</ol>
<p>These requirements have far-reaching implications for the role of layout and <code>repr</code> in SemVer stability. Since these adjustments would likely need to be timed with an edition change anyways, it's worth considering if a simpler formulation of <code>repr(transparent)</code> exists. I think there is: limit <code>repr(transparent)</code> to structs on which at most one field is <em>not</em> <code>PhantomData</code>.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-repr-transparent">Beyond <code>repr(transparent)</code></h2>
<p>SemVer aside, <code>repr(transparent)</code>'s restrictions on generic parameters are complex and unwieldy. These restrictions are necessary to ensure, <strong>at definition site</strong>, that <em>any</em> instantiation of the annotated type will be transparent with respect to its non-one-aligned-ZST field. But, in the future, <code>repr(transparent)</code> may not be necessary at all as a layout modifier (merely as a definition-site check).</p>
<p>The Unsafe Code Working Group <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/pull/164">proposes</a> that one-aligned-ZST fields shalt not influence the layout of default-<code>repr</code> structs, and that default-<code>repr</code> structs with exactly one <em>non</em>-one-aligned-ZST field shall have layout identical to that of the field. If accepted, these rules would mean that one could determine whether or not a particular type was <em>effectively</em> transparent, even in the absence of <code>repr(transparent)</code>. What would be missing is an in-language mechanism to double-check. To this end, I'd suggest the introduction of the compiler-intrinsic trait <code>mem::AbiEq&lt;Other&gt;</code>, which is implemented for all types whose ABI is identical to <code>Other</code>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

    <p><a href="https://www.philippflenker.com/hecto-chapter-1/">First chapter</a> - <a href="https://www.philippflenker.com/hecto-appendices/">Appendices</a> - <a href="https://www.philippflenker.com/hecto-chapter-7/">Last chapter</a></p>

<p>This is a series of blog posts that shows you how to
build a text editor in Rust. It’s a re-implementation of
<a href="http://antirez.com/news/108">kilo</a> in Rust, as outlined in <a href="https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html">this fantastic
tutorial</a>. Same as the
original booklet, these blog posts guide you through all the steps to build a
basic text editor, <code>hecto</code>.</p>

<p>You will almost always be able to see your changes in action by applying the
changes, saving and running the program. I will explain every step along the way
as best as I can - sometimes in great detail, and often linking to other pages.
Feel free to skim over the prose and ignore the links, there is plenty to learn
just by applying the code changes and watching your text editor grow!</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>I have always thought that every software engineer needs to have more than
superficial knowledge of at least two programming languages. However, I have to
admit, that in the past few years, my knowledge in pretty much everything except
JavaScript has started to fade.</p>

<p>That’s why I started to learn Rust, and I have re-implemented <code>kilo</code> as a
learning experience. But <em>why</em>? In order to learn Rust, I wanted ro re-implement
a well-understood piece of software, so that I could focus on the language
without getting lost in the implementation details. But I did not want to
re-implement stuff I used JavaScript for, as I think that JavaScript is designed
for a different problem space than Rust. Or in other words: If you are a
plumber, you best learn how to use an axe by using it to chop down some trees,
and not to unclog a sink.</p>

<p><code>kilo</code> is complex enough to pose a challenge, and when I read it, I wished it
was available for Rust - and now it is!</p>

<p>And <em>why</em> the name? <code>hecto</code> follows more modest goals than <code>kilo</code>. It does not
aim to be small, and it wasn’t even my own idea - so it seemed appropriate to
give it a more modest name than its spiritual predecessor.</p>

<h2 id="license">License</h2>

  <li><code>kilo</code> was distributed under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause">BSD-2 Clause

<h3 id="indication-of-changes">Indication of Changes</h3>
<p>While these blog posts are based firmly on the <a href="https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html">original
tutorial</a>, the code has
been adapted to Rust, not only by calling the closest “rust counterpart
function”, but by trying to solve things “the rust way”. Similarily, all
explanations have been checked and revised, and in many cases heavily rewritten,
in the context of Rust. Therefore, this tutorial should be seen as a “rust
remix” of the original <code>C</code> version.</p>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
<p>I’m happy that you read my work and would love to <a href="https://www.philippflenker.com/about">hear from you</a> - especially if you are either stuck or have found a
better way to solve specific things. Keep in mind that this is mostly an
exercise for me to get to know Rust - so if there’s a better way to do things,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="nRF9160 Feather Test CLI" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_10.30.55_AM.png" data-src="images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-06_at_10.30.55_AM.png"></p><p>Rust has grown on me over the past year. I consumed <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/" target="_blank">The Book</a> while on a plane ride in February of last year <em>right</em> before Covid hit. It has basically been all downhill since. 😅</p><p>Since then, i’ve designed a (very alpha) <a href="https://github.com/jaredwolff/eagle-plm" target="_blank">CLI based MRP system</a>, e-commerce backend for <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/store/" target="_blank">my static website</a>, CLI based tester and firmware for my nRF9160 Feather test fixture. Yea, all in Rust.</p><p>In this article, i’ll be sharing details about how I developed the CLI and ATSAMD based tester for the <a href="https://www.jaredwolff.com/store/nrf9160-feather/" target="_blank">nRF9160 Feather</a>. By the end this should give you confidence that you can also develop your own firmware and software 100% in Rust!</p><p>Let’s get started.</p><h2 id="sprinkle-some-rust-in-your-firmware">Sprinkle some Rust in your firmware</h2><p><img alt="nRF9160 Feather tester hardware render" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/feather-tester_v14.png" data-src="images/feather-tester_v14.png"></p><p>As mentioned earlier, I designed my tester hardware (pictured above) to use an ATSAMD microcontroller. I had a few reasons why I chose the ATSAMD21:</p><ol><li>It has a <strong>ton</strong> of pins. (ATSAMD21J18A-MFT has 52 to be exact!) This was going to be important in order to connect to and control everything about the DUT (Device under test) in the tester.</li><li>SAMD21 series is also ubiquitous and plentiful elsewhere. It also happens to have great support in the form of the <code>atsamd-hal</code> crate. (<a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd" target="_blank">Link</a>)</li></ol><p>While there is some test firmware on the DUT itself, there’s a bunch of exciting stuff happening on the tester side. But before we do, let’s chat about the bootloader.</p><h3 id="first-thing-you-should-do">First thing you should do</h3><p>After lots of tinkering I realized that one of the first things you should do on any SAMD based project is get the UF2 bootloader loaded. Since loading it onto my test board <strong>I haven’t used my debug probe.</strong> (Rust makes this extremely easy since it eliminates 80% of the stupid mistakes i’d otherwise make in C)</p><p>Here’s a quick primer on how I got my board working:</p><ol><li><p>I cloned the UF2 repo:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/microsoft/uf2-samdx1
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>Created a folder called <code>circuitdojo_feather_tester</code> within the <code>boards</code> directory.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cd uf2-samdx1
mkdir boards/circuitdojo_feather_tester
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>I created <code>board.mk</code> and <code>board_config.h</code></p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cd boards/circuitdojo_feather_tester
touch board.mk
touch board_config.h
</code></pre></div></li><li><p>Using the already existing boards in the <code>boards</code> folder, updated the contents of <code>http://board.mk</code> and <code>board_config.h</code>. First <code>board.mk</code> to define what chip I was targeting:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c">CHIP_FAMILY <span>=</span> samd21
CHIP_VARIANT <span>=</span> SAMD21J18A
</code></pre></div><p>Then <code>board_config.h</code> for all the configuration bits:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c"><span>#ifndef BOARD_CONFIG_H
</span><span>#define BOARD_CONFIG_H
</span><span></span>
<span>#define VENDOR_NAME "Circuit Dojo"
</span><span>#define PRODUCT_NAME "Feather Tester"
</span><span>#define VOLUME_LABEL "BOOT"
</span><span>#define INDEX_URL "https:</span><span>//www.jaredwolff.com/"
</span><span></span><span>#define BOARD_ID "SAMD21G18A-Feather-v0"
</span><span></span>
<span>#define USB_VID 0x16c0
</span><span>#define USB_PID 0x27dd
</span><span></span>
<span>#define LED_PIN PIN_PA22
</span><span></span>
<span>#endi
</span></code></pre></div></li><li><p>Then using the instructions in the Readme, build the code:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">make BOARD<span>=</span>circuitdojo_feather_tester
</code></pre></div><p>I used the toolchain that comes with NCS v1.4.1. I did have to make a change to the Makefile for everything to compile without borking. Turns out my toolchain was newer than expected. Fortunately adding <code>Wno-deprecated</code> inside the Makefile to the <code>WFLAGS</code> variable fixes this problem.</p></li><li><p>Once complete it will dump your binary/hex files to <code>build/&lt;your board name&gt;</code></p></li><li><p>Then I flashed the bootloader using <code>pyocd</code> like so:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">pyocd flash -t ATSAMD21J18A -f <span>4000000</span> bootloader-circuitdojo_feather_tester-v3.4.0-65-gdf89a1f-dirty.elf --format elf
</code></pre></div><p><code>pyocd</code> is just one of many ways to load firmware. The <a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd" target="_blank"><code>atsamd-rs</code> repo</a> has a ton more options.</p></li></ol><p>Once programmed, hit the reset button twice in quick succession to enable bootloader mode. (I believe this is consistent across all other boards using the UF2 bootloader. Correct me if i’m wrong!) This will cause the bootloader to remain active so you can transfer new firmware.</p><p>On a scale from easy to painful, this was defintiely on the easy side of the spectrum. The folks at Microsoft and contributors like Adafruit made this process <em>really simple.</em></p><h3 id="hey-my-name-is-hal">Hey, my name is HAL</h3><p><img alt="Compiling Rust firmware" src="https://www.jaredwolff.com/testing-hardware-using-rust/images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-10_at_12.37.34_PM.png" data-src="images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-10_at_12.37.34_PM.png"></p><p>As of this writing, every different hardware platform has some type of independently created HAL (hardware abstraction layer). Atmel’s SAMD differs slightly from nRF and that differs from the STM32s of the world. The nice thing is as long as they conform to the higher level APIs, you can use something like the <a href="https://github.com/mvirkkunen/usb-device" target="_blank">USB crate</a> which supports ATSAMD and STM32.</p><p>The fastest way to get started with your own ATSAMD based board to create your own board definition. You can find a <strong>ton</strong> of example in the <code>boards</code> directory. Many off the shelf boards are already supported which makes for one less thing you need to do!</p><p>If you do find yourself with a custom board, you can copy one of the already existing boards that is closest to yours. For instance I used <code>feather_m0</code> as the base for my tester board. I tweaked <code>memory.x</code> and <code>src/lib.rs</code> to my liking.</p><p>There’s even a cool way to define pins so you can easily access them later. For for instance if you have a pin named <code>FLASH_EN</code> and it’s mapped to pin port B, pin 8 you can simply reference it later on using the <code>Pins</code> struct like <code>pins.flash_en</code>. (More below..)</p><p>The ATSAMD repo is going through some slow and steady improvements. There are even some nice additions to the <a href="https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd/pull/371" target="_blank">board support</a> area that i’m excited about and testing. While it’s mostly useable, it is rough in some areas (especially related to documentation).</p><p><em>Big shoutout to Bradley who has been spearheading these improvements. If I were to do any of this, i’d be surprised it would be working by then of it.</em> 😅</p><h3 id="dont-be-unsafe">Don’t be <code>unsafe</code></h3><p>When I first started developing the test firmware, I notice that I was using <code>unsafe</code> a lot. While in hardwareland using <code>unsafe</code> is not uncommon, from a readability and risk for increased errors perspective, it can get hairy.</p><p>There is a cool solution around this and that’s where <code>rtic</code> enters the picture. <code>rtic</code> is a new spin on how to write firmware in Rust. Instead of having the familiar <code>main</code> function, it works differently. Here’s the features from <a href="https://github.com/rtic-rs/cortex-m-rtic" target="_blank">the Github page</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>Tasks</strong>&nbsp;as the unit of concurrency [^1]. Tasks can be&nbsp;<em>event triggered</em>&nbsp;(fired in response to asynchronous stimuli) or spawned by the application on demand.</li><li><strong>Message passing</strong>&nbsp;between tasks. Specifically, messages can be passed to software tasks at spawn time.</li><li><strong>A timer queue</strong>&nbsp;[^2]. Software tasks can be scheduled to run at some time in the future. This feature can be used to implement periodic tasks.</li><li>Support for prioritization of tasks and, thus,&nbsp;<strong>preemptive multitasking</strong>.</li><li><strong>Efficient and data race free memory sharing</strong>&nbsp;through fine grained&nbsp;<em>priority based</em>&nbsp;critical sections [^1].</li><li><strong>Deadlock free execution</strong>&nbsp;guaranteed at compile time. This is an stronger guarantee than what’s provided by&nbsp;<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html" target="_blank">the standard&nbsp;<code>Mutex</code>abstraction</a>.</li><li><strong>Minimal scheduling overhead</strong>. The task scheduler has minimal software footprint; the hardware does the bulk of the scheduling.</li><li><strong>Highly efficient memory usage</strong>: All the tasks share a single call stack and there’s no hard dependency on a dynamic memory allocator.</li><li><strong>All Cortex-M devices are fully supported</strong>.</li><li>This task model is amenable to known WCET (Worst Case Execution Time) analysis and scheduling analysis techniques. (Though we haven’t yet developed Rust friendly tooling for that.)</li></ul><p>While all these features and capabilities seem great, so what gives?</p><p>Well, for starters there’s no <code>main</code> function. 🙀</p><p>Here’s what a basic blinky app looks like using some of the new BSP (Board support packages) I mentioned earlier:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#![deny(unsafe_code)]</span>
<span>#![no_main]</span>
<span>#![no_std]</span>

<span>extern</span> <span>crate</span> circuitdojo_tester <span>as</span> hal;

<span>use</span> hal::prelude::<span>*</span>;
<span>use</span> hal::Pins;

<span>#[rtic::app(device = hal::pac, peripherals = true)]</span>
<span>const</span> APP: () <span>=</span> {

            <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> peripherals.SYSCTRL,
            <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> peripherals.NVMCTRL,
        );
        <span>let</span> pins <span>=</span> Pins::new(peripherals.PORT);
        <span>let</span> led_pass <span>=</span> pins.led_pass.into_push_pull_output();

        <span>let</span> delay <span>=</span> Delay::new(cx.core.SYST, <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> clocks);

        init::LateResources { led_pass, delay }

            cx.resources.delay.delay_ms(<span>500</span><span>u32</span>);
        }
    }
};
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>init</code> function is where you would normally put anything you’d normally put in an Arduino <code>setup</code> function. We’re setting up pins and peripherals. If you want to use them later on though, you’ll need to create an entry in <code>Resources</code>. This is also where you store any type of static mutable data structures that you need elsewhere in your firmware.</p><p>The <code>idle</code> function is similar to the <code>loop</code> function in Arduino. It’s important though that if you want a loop, you have to implement it. Here’s the warning in the <a href="https://rtic.rs/0.5/book/en/by-example/app.html?highlight=loop#idle" target="_blank"><code>rtic</code> documentation</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Unlike init, idle will run with interrupts enabled and it’s not allowed to return so it must run forever.</p></blockquote><p>You don’t <strong>need</strong> to use an <code>idle</code> function though. If you don’t, your microcontroller will go to sleep. This is ideal for battery powered applications that need to sleep as much as possible.</p><p>In <code>rtic</code> every work function gets a <code>Context</code> variable. It allow you to access resources that are pertinent to that function’s purpose. Access is only granted though when you add a resource like below:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>#[idle(resources=[led_pass, delay]</span>)]
</code></pre></div><p>If <code>resources</code> was not set like above, I would not be able to use <code>led_pass</code> or <code>delay</code> within the function!</p><p>While this is a simple example, when you start using static resources like fixed size vectors you’ll be happy you chose to use <code>rtic</code>. The <a href="https://github.com/japaric/heapless" target="_blank"><code>heapless</code></a> crate has been extremely useful for setting size contrained elements that you’d normally be able to use with Rust’s <code>std</code> lib.</p><p>While <code>heapless</code> implements a few very handy types, the <code>Vec</code> and <code>spsc</code> imlementation have been <em>extremely</em> useful. If you’re looking for <code>std</code> conventions for embedded, no need to look further. Get started with <code>heapless</code> with their great documentation <a href="https://japaric.github.io/heapless/heapless/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h3 id="the-confusion-ensues">The confusion ensues</h3><p>One thing that may be confusing …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It's now roughly seven or eight years that I'm building dynamic front ends for the web. From <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ascribe.io/">digital art wallets</a> to games (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ipfs.leapdao.org/blog/Planet-A-ccc-ethberlin-recap/">1</a>, <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/videogame">2</a>) and <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/wasm-synth">synthesizers</a>, I've seen it all. And since my process of creation has dramatically changed over the years, today, I'd like to share how I'm developing web apps in 2021.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-build-processes.">I avoid build processes.</h2>
<p>I still remember the debates with colleagues about using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://babeljs.io/">babel</a> a few years ago. Within the front end development world, transpiling had just become a thing, so we ended up babelifying our builds to use ES6. Our argument back then was that one day, we would be able to push our application's directory structure on a web server and since all browsers would then support the augmented ES6 features, our app would just work! Without a build process. WOW! That must have been around 2015. When I look at the source code of these old applications now, our technical visions didn't end up becoming reality.</p>
<p>Now, I try to keep my build process to a minimum. When I need to write a demo app, I particularly like using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-standalone#script-tags"><code>&lt;script type="text/babel"&gt;</code></a>. I love <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/getting-started/#no-build-tools-route">preact's "no build tools route."</a> too. When I have to set up an actual app, I avoid <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rollupjs.org/">rollup</a>. I mainly get frustrated about the myriad ways of configuring them. Some minor thing always ends up being broken, which leads to hours of debugging foreign code. And that's frustrating. Using preact's no build route, finally something like the above is possible:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;script type=<span>"module"</span>&gt;</span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>import</span> { h, Component, render } <span>from</span> <span>'https://unpkg.com/preact?module'</span>;</span><br><span>  <span>const</span> app = h(<span>'h1'</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>'Hello World!'</span>);</span><br><span>  render(app, <span>document</span>.body);</span><br><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>When having to use a build tool, I gravitate towards <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://parceljs.org/">parcel</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/developit/microbundle">microbundle</a> as they come preconfigured. And in particular, parcel is excellent, as it's merely using an HTML file as its entry point. To me, that's promising as it assumes a proper directory structure and properly connected files such that maybe one day I can push my app to the web without that build step.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-transpiling.">I avoid transpiling.</h2>
<p>For the same reasons as pointed out above, I also try to avoid transpiling. It's not because I don't like ESNext features, but more because I want to minimize the risk of getting stuck with the transpiler. Hence, I try to avoid using babel. <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/01/typescript/">I also don't use Typescript</a>. To me, JavaScript is productive enough. Additionally, for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/">react</a>-style projects, no transpilers mean I stopped using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>. Instead, I found an excellent library called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/developit/htm">htm</a> that uses JavaScript's template strings. It has a similar syntax to JSX, but it's not breaking ECMAScript standards and hence needs no transpliation.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-the-new-and-shiny.">I avoid the <em>new</em> and <em>shiny</em>.</h2>
<p>I even avoid changing the way I work if I don't feel comfortable or inclined. For example, I never switched to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">react hooks</a>. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html">lifecycle methods</a> that I initially know from iOS Objective-C programming are - in my opinion - a beautiful metaphor for writing front end components. And neither did I have any issues with my sites' performance. I would make the switch if I started to have problems. But I don't. The same goes for up and coming frameworks. Angular V2? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>? Cool, but why relearn a framework when I'm already productive with the one I use?</p>
<h2 id="i-test-everything.">I test EvErYtHiNg.</h2>
<p>When I started front-end development, testing was complicated. Only a few front end developer colleagues tested their apps properly. I ended up doing a lot of testing by hand. It was frustrating and unproductive. But testing front ends has improved dramatically over the years. Not only have the tools been significantly enhanced.</p>
<p>We, as front-end developers, have now also figured out how to correctly write front end tests. Finally, we're able to distinguish between functional code and presentational code. For functional code, we now write unit tests. For presentational code, we use snapshot-based testing and integration tests. I'm pleased about tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cypress.io/">cypress</a> that is great for integration tests. I also like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/avajs/ava/">ava</a> for unit tests.</p>
<h2 id="i-optimize-for-performance-and-quality.">I optimize for performance and quality.</h2>
<p>I used to be eager about building extensively functional software: the more features, the better. I'm not anymore. Instead, I try to develop software that works well for my users. I strive for quality. So I try to measure my build's size. I take proper care about delivering my application, meaning I turn on compression and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching">caching</a>. I care about optimizing my static assets like pictures. And I like to check my apps by using tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=de">PageSpeed Insights</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">lighthouse</a>.</p>
<h2 id="i-use-my-own-work">I use my own work</h2>
<p>From experience, I learned that I hardly ever get stuck on a algorithmic problem. On the contrary, I get motivated to learn something new and excel in the process. However, I caught my self often spending many hours on debugging other people's code. Mainly when it's third-party libraries that I included via npm. Once, I thought that using npm packages was a JavaScript developer's superpower. Now, I know that it can also be their curse.</p>
<p>Instead of collecting heaps of third-party code, I now prefer following <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://hintjens.com/blog:96">Peter Hintjens' principles for writing good code</a>. I "use my own work." Meaning, I dare to write seemingly complex code myself. I still won't roll my own crypto or write a date library, but I dare to implement parts of a protocol or build an algorithm. It's not to say that I ditch every npm package and go npm-keto-diet. No, instead, I take a more mindful approach towards dependencies and only include them when I truly need them.</p>
<p>I try to do that by leaving my technical vision at the doorstep of my office, so that I can now focus on solving the problems at hand. I try to stop worrying about eventualities far in the future as I view that as speculation. In cases I have past experiences, I use it to form my decision. For unchartered teritory, I move carefully, step by step.</p>
<h2 id="i-use-open-source-to-my-advantage.">I use open source to my advantage.</h2>
<p>I'm building websites since I'm a teenager. And had I open-sourced and maintained a few pieces of code that I need frequently, I'd be more productive now. Unfortunately, I was short-sighted. Surprisingly, I didn't think about still using JavaScript at 29 years of age 😂</p>
<p>I stopped framing open source mainly around certain virtues like free speech, fairness or certain politics. They're still important virtues for me, but I learned that I could use open source also for building a personal toolset.</p>
<p>Extracting a library from a codebase allows me to think about it from a user's perspective. It means I'm able to think about a piece of code's interfaces emphatically. Additionally, there's positive peer pressure. I'm not going to release shit to the world. When my project is public, it's going to have a proper README and some docs. And it's going to be tested. Since everybody can see it, I might as well create something I can be proud of.</p>
<p>Hence, contributing to open source, for me, is about building high-quality software. Being anxious about not being able to monetize this particular piece of code has become less of a concern. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/sindresorhus">sindresohrus</a> inspired me to treat open source packages like my personal toolbox.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>And that's my incomplete list of principles. I'm sure there's more than just these. Anyway, I still find some of these points quite controversial. I'm sure they won't work for everyone as all our contexts differ. But working solo as a freelancer, I've found that these principles contribute to me being content about what I'm doing. Hence, I was eager to share them.</p>
<p>I'm curious to hear other's thoughts and see if they've taken similar paths. Please reach out! Also, don't forget to subscribe to my newsletter!</p>

<p>Back in October of 2016, the partnership of Dubai Municipality and Philips Lighting released their Dubai Lamp, a series of the “world’s most efficient commercially available” LED light bulbs. This past Sunday, May 7, two Dubai developers signed a deal for the installation of these Dubai Lamps for their upcoming projects.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://kbelectricpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dubailamp.jpg" alt="dubai lamp" width="450" height="305" srcset="https://kbelectricpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dubailamp.jpg 450w, https://kbelectricpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dubailamp-300x203.jpg 300w, https://kbelectricpa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dubailamp-390x264.jpg 390w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></p>

<p>Dubai is a city-state located in the country of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). For a visual, the UAE is located at the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, neighboring&nbsp;Saudi Arabia and Omen.&nbsp;The partnership between Philips and Dubai Municipality began as an initiative by Dubai for the commitment of sustainability. It is Dubai’s goal to seek a 30% cut in&nbsp;their energy consumption by 2030, as well as a reduction of carbon emissions by 16% in the year 2021.</p>

<p>Through their partnership, Philips Lighting and Dubai Municipality created the Dubai Lamp, a light bulb that is said to decrease an electricity bill by 90%. According to a press release on Philips Lighting website, this is the world’s first commercially available light bulb that produces 200 lumen per watt. The Dubai Lamp comes in 4 different light bulb varieties:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Watt, equivalent to 25W incandescent light bulb. Lifetime = 15,000 hours, or 15 years based on 1,000 hours a year.</li>
<li>2 Watt, equivalent to 40W incandescent light bulb. Lifetime = 15,000 hours, or 15 years based on 1,000 hours a year.</li>
<li>3 Watt, equivalent to 60W incandescent light bulb. Lifetime = 15,000 hours, or 15 years based on 1,000 hours a year.</li>
<li>3 Watt Spot light bulb, equivalent to 35W or 50W&nbsp;halogen light bulb. Lifetime = 25,000 hours, or 25 years based on 1,000 hours a year.</li>
</ul>

<p>All 4 light bulbs are available in warm white tone and cool daylight, and last 15 times longer than your conventional light bulb. Even though it is said to be the “world’s most efficient commercially available” LED light bulb, the Dubai Lamp is applicable in households as well as businesses.</p>

<p>Throughout this year alone, Philips Lighting and Dubai Municipality are preparing, for market-use, 2 million of these Dubai Lamps. That number is said to increase to 10 million by the year 2021.</p>

<p>The 4-year deal that was signed this past Sunday with Emaar and Dubai Properties Group to integrate the Dubai Lamps in their new&nbsp;facilities is said to include a study conducted by Dubai Municipality to monitor the energy savings that the Dubai Lamp is said to&nbsp;achieve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Developer&nbsp;Emaar is known for building&nbsp;the world’s tallest tower, the Burj Khalifa, as well as the&nbsp;Dubai Mall, one of the world’s largest shopping centers. Dubai Properties Group is a well-established real estate developer, known for numerous Dubai destinations including&nbsp;Jumeirah Beach Residences (JBR), Dubailand, Business Bay, and Culture Village, among other housing and retail spaces.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>BitLocker is a modern data protection feature that is deeply integrated in the Windows kernel. It is used by many corporations as a means of protecting company secrets in case of theft. Microsoft recommends that you have a Trusted Platform Module which can do some of the heavy cryptographic lifting for you.</p><p>Given a Windows 10 system without known passwords and a BitLocker-protected hard drive, an administrator account could be adding by doing the following:</p><ul><li>At the sign-in screen, select “I have forgotten my password.”</li><li>Bypass the lock and enable autoplay of removable drives.</li><li>Insert a USB stick with my .exe and a junction folder.</li><li>Run executable.</li><li>Remove the thumb drive and put it back in again, go to the main screen.</li><li>From there launch narrator, that will execute a DLL payload planted earlier.</li></ul><p>Now a user account is added called hax with password “hax” with membership in Administrators. To update the list with accounts to log into, click <em>I forgot my password</em> and then return to the main screen.</p><h2 id="bypassing-the-lock-screen"> <a href="#bypassing-the-lock-screen">Bypassing the lock screen</a></h2><p>First, we select the “I have forgotten my password/PIN” option. This option launches an additional session, with an account that gets created/deleted as needed; the user profile service calls it a default-account. It will have the first available name of defaultuser1, defaultuser100000, defaultuser100001, etc.</p><p>To escape the lock, we have to use the Narrator because if we manage to launch something, we cannot see it, but using the Narrator, we will be able to navigate it. However, how do we launch something?</p><p><img src="https://secret.club/assets/bitlockerbypass/1.png" alt=""></p><p>If we smash shift 5 times in quick succession, a link to open the Settings app appears, and the link actually works. We cannot see the launched Settings app. Giving the launched app focus is slightly tricky; you have to click the link and then click a place where the launched app would be visible with the correct timing. The easiest way to learn to do it is, keep clicking the link roughly 2 times a second. The sticky keys windows will disappear. Keep clicking! You will now see a focus box is drawn in the middle of the screen. That was the Settings app, and you have to stop clicking when it gets focus.</p><p>Now we can navigate the Settings app using CapsLock + Left Arrow, press that until we reach Home. Now, when Home has focus, hold down Caps Lock and press Enter. Using CapsLock + Right Arrow navigate to Devices and CapsLock + Enter when it is in focus.</p><p><img src="https://secret.club/assets/bitlockerbypass/2.png" alt=""></p><p>Now navigate to AutoPlay, CapsLock + Enter and choose “Open Folder to view files (File Explorer).” Now insert the prepared USB drive, wait some seconds, the Narrator will announce the drive has been opened, and the window is focused. Now select the file <strong>Exploit.exe</strong> and execute it with CapsLock + Enter. That is arbitrary code execution, ladies and gentlemen, without using any passwords. However, we are limited by running as the default profile.</p><p>I have made a video with my phone, as I cannot take screenshots.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdsSgklRoag" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2 id="elevation-of-privilege"> <a href="#elevation-of-privilege">Elevation of privilege</a></h2><p>When a USB stick is mounted, BitLocker will create a directory named ClientRecoveryPasswordRotation in System Volume Information and set permissions to:</p><div><div><pre><code>NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(F)
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
</code></pre></div></div><p>To redirect the create operation, a symbolic link in the NT namespace is needed as that allows us to control the filename, and the existence of the link does not abort the operation as it is still creating the directory.</p><p>Therefore, take a USB drive and make <code>\System Volume Information</code> a mount point targeting <code>\RPC Control</code>. Then make a symbolic link in <code>\RPC Control\ClientRecoveryPasswordRotation</code> targetting <code>\??\C:\windows\system32\Narrator.exe.local</code>. If the USB stick is reinserted then the folder <code>C:\windows\system32\Narrator.exe.local</code> will be created with permissions that allows us to create a subdirectory:</p><div><div><pre><code>amd64_microsoft.windows.common-controls_6595b64144ccf1df_6.0.18362.657_none_e6c5b579130e3898
</code></pre></div></div><p>Inside this subdirectory, we drop a payload DLL named <em>comctl32.dll</em>. Next time the Narrator is triggered, it will load the DLL. By the way, I chose the Narrator as that is triggerable from the login screen as a system service and is not auto-loaded, so if anything goes wrong, we can still boot.</p><h2 id="combining-them"> <a href="#combining-them">Combining them</a></h2><p>The <code>ClientRecoveryPasswordRotation</code> exploit to work requires a symbolic link in <code>\RPC Control</code>. The executable on the USB drive creates the link using two calls to <code>DefineDosDevice</code>, making the link permanent so they can survive a logout/in if needed.</p><p>Then a loop is started in which the executable will:</p><ul><li>Try to create the subdirectory.</li><li>Plant the payload <code>comctl32.dll</code> inside it.</li></ul><p>It is easy to see when the loop is running because the Narrator will move its focus box and say “access denied” every second. We can now use the link created in <code>RPC Control</code>. Unplug the USB stick and reinsert it. The writeable directory will be created in <code>System32</code>; on the next loop iteration, the payload will get planted, and exploit.exe will exit. To test if the exploit has been successful, close the Narrator and try to start it again.</p><p>If the narrator does not work, it is because the DLL is planted, and Narrator executes it, but it fails to add an account because it is launched as <code>defaultuser1</code>. When the payload is planted, you will need to click back to the login screen and start Narrator; 3 beeps should play, and a message box saying the DLL has been loaded as <code>SYSTEM</code> should show. Great! The account has been created, but it is not in the list. Press “I forgot my password” and click back to update the list.</p><p>A new account named hax should appear, with password hax.</p><p>I used these steps to arm the USB device</p><div><div><pre><code>C:\Users\jonas&gt;format D: /fs:ntfs /q

          <p><em>I created a very basic note taking web app that utilizes the browser's local storage and comes packaged with an export function</em></p>
        
        <hr>
        <p>I’ve always been a fan of simple note taking applications, since I tend to take a lot of random notes throughout the work day. Sometimes I reach for simple pen and paper, but other times it’s nice to stay focused jotting down notes on the same device I’m working on.</p>

<p>Previously, I just created quick <code>notes.txt</code> files in my open code editor or fell back on the default OS note apps. These worked perfectly fine but often got in my way (or even worse - lost among everything else).</p>

<p>So I said the hell with it and built <a href="https://writxt.fun/">Writxt</a> (pronounced “write text”).</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-writxt-special">What makes Writxt special?</h2>

<p>Nothing, really. It’s actually a pretty “stupid” app compared to others on the market. But this one is <em>mine</em>. Plus, it was fun to piece it together on a random evening before bed.</p>

<p>For those curious, let’s take a look at the feature list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>free and open source (<a href="https://github.com/bradleytaunt/writxt">github.com/bradleytaunt/writxt</a>)</li>
  <li>uses <code>localStorage</code> to keep changes persistent (helpful for browser crashes, etc)</li>
  <li>includes basic export functionality to download content as a simple <code>output.txt</code> file</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Mind blowing stuff, eh?</p>

<h2 id="making-stuff-is-fun">Making stuff is fun</h2>

<p>My main takeaway when building this tiny, dumb app was to just <em>enjoy building fun stuff</em>. It crossed my mind several times how there are already hundreds of note taking apps across the vast Internet. I also thought about how others might look at the code I wrote and go, “Oh my God - why did he do it that way? What an idiot!”. But I don’t care - I had fun making it.</p>

<p>Hopefully you enjoy using it as well!</p>

			<p>At least a significant portion of their supporters, according to U of Aarhus researchers.</p>
<p>When two competing political parties in Denmark reversed their policy stance on an issue — suddenly they both supported reducing unemployment benefits — their voters immediately moved their opinions by around 15% into line with their party.</p>
<p>The same thing happened when one of these parties shifted from opposing to supporting ending Denmark’s early retirement.</p>
<p>The researchers were studying how public opinion is formed. Their recent paper sheds light on how much influence political parties have over their supporters, according to the researchers, who surveyed their panel of subjects in five successive waves between 2010 and 2011. They studied the same group of party supporters before, during and after a policy reversal.</p>
<p>“We can see that [the] welfare programs were actually quite popular … and many of the voters of the center-right party were in favor of these welfare programs,” commented one of the researchers, Rune Slothuus. “Nevertheless, we can see that they reversed their opinion from supporting these welfare programs to opposing these welfare programs.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I was surprised to see the parties appeared this powerful in shaping opinions,” Slothuus said. “Our findings suggest that partisan leaders can indeed lead citizens’ opinions in the real world, even in situations where the stakes are real and the economic consequences tangible.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The researchers pondered Western democracy in light of their findings: “If citizens just blindly follow their party without thinking much about it, that should lead to some concern about the mechanisms in our democracy. Because how can partisan elites represent citizens’ views if the views of citizens are shaped by the very same elites who are supposed to represent them?”</p>

    <h3>The brain listens for things it is trying to predict</h3>
    <div><p>The brain interprets sounds as they contrast with its expectations; it recognizes patterns of sounds faster when they’re in line with what it is predicting it will hear, but it only encodes sounds when they contrast with expectations, according to <span>Technische U researchers. </span></p>
<p>The researchers showed this by monitoring the two principal nuclei of the subcortical pathway responsible for auditory processing: the inferior colliculus and the medial geniculate body, as their subjects listened to patterns of sounds which the researches modified so that sometimes they would hear an expected sound pattern, and other times something unexpected.</p>

    <h3>We have a particular way of understanding a room</h3>
    <div><p>When several research subjects were instructed to explore an empty room, and when they were instead seated in a chair and watched someone else explore the room, their brain waves followed a certain pattern, as recorded by a backpack hooked up to record their brain waves, eye movements, and paths. It didn’t matter if they were walking or watching someone else, according to UC researchers led by Dr Matthias Stangl.</p>
<p>The researchers also tested what happened when subjects searched for a hidden spot, or watched someone else do so, and found that brain waves flowed more strongly when they had a goal and hunted for something.</p>

    <h3>Extroverts and introverts use different vocabularies</h3>
    <div><p>Extroverts use ‘positive emotion’ and ‘social process’ words more often than introverts, according to new research conducted at <span>Nanyang Technological U</span>.</p>
<p>‘Love,’ ‘happy,’ and ‘blessed’ indicate pleasant emotions, and ‘beautiful’ and ‘nice’ indicate positivity or optimism, and are among the words found to be used more often by extroverts. So too are ‘meet,’ ‘share,’ and ‘talk,’ which are about socializing. Extroverts use personal pronouns — except ‘I’ — more too, another indication of sociability.</p>
<p>The correlation, however, was small, and the researchers think that stronger linguistic indicators need to be found to achieve their general goal, which is improving machine learning approaches to targeting consumer marketing.</p>

    <h3>WhatsApp is changing today - Users must give the app permission to send their private data to Facebook or lose account</h3>
    <div><p>WhatsApp was bought by Facebook in 2014, but has thrived while promoting itself as a privacy-respecting messaging app that now has 1.5b monthly active users. This week, though, WhatApp sent out an update to users’ phones that they must ‘consent’ to a new policy or lose access.</p>
<p>Whatsapp will now share more of your data, including your IP address (your location) and phone number, your account registration information, your transaction data, and service-related data, interactions on WhatsApp, and other data collected based on your consent, with Facebook’s other companies. Facebook has been working towards more closely integrating Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger.</p>
<p>Users who do not agree to ‘consent’ to the new policy will see their WhatsApp account become inaccessible until they do ‘consent.’ These accounts will remain dormant for 120 days after which they will be ‘deleted.’</p>
<p>The biggest change to the user policy, which many people ignored and clicked ‘agree’ to, thinking it was just another unimportant app update message, now reads,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>‘We collect information about your activity on our Services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (including how you use our Services, your Services settings, how you interact with others using our Services (including when you interact with a business), and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities and interactions), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports. This also includes information about when you registered to use our Services; the features you use like our messaging, calling, Status, groups (including group name, group picture, group description), payments or business features; profile photo, “about” information; whether you are online, when you last used our Services (your “last seen”); and when you last updated your “about” information.’</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Notably, Elon Musk tweeted on the news, saying that WhatsApp users should switch to Signal, one of several popular privacy-focused messaging apps similar to WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The data sharing policy change doesn’t affect people in Europe due to GDPR data protection regulations.</p>

    <h3>President Trump silenced on top social media platforms after mob storms Capitol</h3>
    <div><p>The US president was locked out from posting new messages on his Facebook and Twitter accounts after an unruly group of supporters assembled outside the capitol building where Biden’s election win was being confirmed.</p>
<p>The lockdown on Twitter lasted 12 hours until the president removed tweets Twitter said violated its ‘civic integrity policy,’ but Zuckerburg said that Trump would be silenced on Facebook and Instagram for at least two more weeks until his presidential term was over. Facebook and Twitter are two of the main ways the president communicates with citizens and the world.</p>
<p>It is the first time social media platforms have chosen to limit the free speech of such an important figure.</p>
<h6><em>Trump’s tweets from Jan 6, 2020, as recorded by thetrumparchive.com</em></h6>


<p>Many news organizations covered the story using language such as <a href="https://thespeakernewsjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Trump-Incites-Rioters.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="1324866489" data-slb-internal="0" data-slb-group="15093_15041">‘Trump Incites Rioters.’</a></p>
<p>Following Trumps ‘ban,’ there was renewed talk about treating social media platforms, where people share informative content, as publishers themselves, in part because their algorithms amplify things shared when those things are engaging. There was also talk about how the social media platforms that censored the president’s content did so as a response to content or events but without first drawing their ‘red line’ and saying which content is and isn’t allowed on their platforms.</p>
<p>Some of Trump’s staff resigned following the incident at the Capitol building, and there were also a lot of questions why the national guard wasn’t capable of handling the incident properly.</p>
<p>UPDATE January 8: Twitter permanently banned Trump’s account. Google removed Parler, an app like Twitter used by Trump supporters, from the Android app store to make it harder for people to download it, saying Google requires social media apps to have content moderation policies to remove posts that incite violence.</p>

Someone else writes her thoughts: “Really, prepare to question groupthink”. A history of adoptable cyberpets. It is addicting to read people’s neat summaries of interests, ascii art embellishments.</p>

<p>But something about it makes me sad.</p>

<p>There’s something called the Eternal September, about how – well, should I be pretending to tell you from the position of someone who’d know? It happened the month after I was born.</p>

<p>Every September before, college students with new network access would stream onto Usenet fora without ever having accustomed themselves to the etiquette. Things would get rowdy and stupid for a while. Then they would learn or get bored and things would quiet down again.</p>

<p>That September, though, was more than just college students – America Online offered Usenet access to all its members. Ever after, the numbers would be dominated by those who had no manners, who didn’t know there was culture to learn. September continued forever.</p>

<p>The design of Gemini isn’t the community. I’m sure there are a few people who use the bridged NPR website available served via Gemini who are really in it because they’re Just That Mad About JavaScript, but those aren’t the people who make the place. It’s a bunch of people who learned a new markup language and installed some new fiddly tools and wrote their journals in plain text and taught me what seaweed is edible… why?</p>

<p>Something about Gemini strikes me as a grail quest for the Eternal August, before webscale crushed the things we love.</p>

<p>While everything I have seen served via Gemini is friendly and sociable, the technical barriers of what-is-a-command-line and how-do-I-use-one are a fence put up that keep out the riffraff. Certainly, you can walk around the corner and go through the gate, but ultimately the geminiverse is lovely because it is underpopulated, slower-paced, and literate. It is difficult enough to access that those who can use it can be welcoming without worrying its smallness will be compromised.</p>

<p>The tragedy is that I don’t think many of its denizens would claim that they <em>only</em> want to hear from technical, educated people, but in order to use a <em>small</em> internet, an August internet, they have let the fence keep out anyone else.</p>

<p>This is the part of the piece where I pivot to My Proposal to Fix Everything, right? Where I tell you about my new community or my idea for what people should be doing or if we only started using tags <em>right</em>…</p>

<p>I don’t know that I think that it’s that neat.</p>

<p>I will probably keep reading things on Gemini, keep querying its search engine for terms and being delighted by neatly crafted plain-text.</p>

<p>But I will probably keep finding it sad.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>While getting my degree in Physics, I had to take classes in both MatLab and Python
for scientific computing. I preferred python, where we used the SciPy and NumPy
packages. In fact, I used those packages again (along with matplotlib) in an
undergraduate research project simulating bacteria films. There's a catch: I was
also pursuing a degree in Computer Science, and Python just wasn't fast enough
for that side of me, so, during my free time in graduate school, I rewrote my biofilm
simulation in my new favorite language, Rust.</p>
<p>First problem: I needed to replace
<code>jsonpickle</code> for data serialization. This problem was easy, as the <code>serde</code> crate
is an amazing replacement (I even transitioned from JSON to Rusty Object Notation, RON).
Second problem: Should I try to get matplotlib bindings in Rust or should I use
a more Rust-y plotting library? I decided on the latter, finding <code>plotters</code> to be
a suitable replacement for matplotlib. Last problem: How do I replace the differential
equation solvers of SciPy? I ended up writing a custom predictor-corrector solver
which worked well enough, giving identical simulation results while being five
hundred times faster than my python code at just the simulation step, rendering
not included (plotting directly to an RGB buffer then using libx264 bindings to
generate raw H.264 frames that mpv can understand also gave a similar speedup to
the rendering step over writing out every frame as a png file in matplotlib and
using a shell script to ffmpeg the outputs together). Full disclosure, a large part
of this speedup probably comes from my <em>derivative</em> function being not-python, rather
than my implementation of a differential equation solver over SciPy's. Furthermore,
I only breached the five hundred barrier when switching to using a QuadTree to
find the nearest neighbors of a bacteria, before that the speed up was more in
the three hundreds. This port of my old project can be found <a href="https://github.com/aftix/rustfilm">here</a>
if you care for some reason.</p>
<h2>Introducing bacon-sci</h2>
<p>Inspired, I decided to start on a full SciPy replacement in rust as I could not find
one I liked on crates.io (I later found the <code>peroxide</code> crate). I even had a clever name:
<a href="https://github.com/aftix/bacon">bacon</a>, named after Francis Bacon and the pork based food; however, <code>bacon</code> is already
a crate, so I went for the next best thing: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bacon-sci">bacon-sci</a>.</p>
<p>I started out with the easiest part. SciPy has a set of scientific constants from
the NIST. I just took the list of important constants from SciPy and put it in a module.
In addition, I took NIST's CODATA and put it into a global map that corresponds a
String of the constant's name to a triplet: an f64 of its value, an f64 of its uncertainty,
and a String of its units. How do you make a static map? I just used the <code>lazy_static</code>
crate.</p>
<p>Next, I returned to the area that inspired me: initial value problems. After that,
I tackled root finding and polynomials. Lastly, as of now, I implemented a few special
polynomials and numeric differentiation. Armed with a copy of Burden and Faires's
"Numerical Analysis (8th ed.)", Wikipedia, and SciPy source code, I went to work.</p>
<p>The first decision I made was to use a linear algebra crate, specifically <code>nalgebra</code>.
I have written many vector and matrix implementations in the past, and I didn't feel
like doing it this time. Besides, <code>nalgebra</code> is probably faster than anything I
can write.</p>
<p>The next decision was using the <code>alga</code> crate to handle generics
of complex types and real types. I wanted all algorithms that could work on
complex numbers to be able to, so most of the functions in <code>bacon-sci</code> work on
<code>N: ComplexField</code>. If an algorithm requires a parameter to be well-ordered (like time),
then it is a <code>N: RealField</code>. In cases where a function takes both, the generic parameter
is a <code>N: ComplexField</code> with the real parameters being <code>N::RealField</code>, which is the real
"backing type" of the possibly complex field. Some functions require complex arithmetic,
so they automatically upgrade from <code>N: ComplexField</code> to <code>Complex&lt;N::RealField&gt;</code> from
<code>num_complex</code>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there are cases where I wanted to automatically
downgrade from definitely complex back to "maybe complex", which was more difficult
than the other way. To upgrade, all I needed was <code>Complex::&lt;N::RealField&gt;::new(z.real(), z.imaginary())</code>,
where <code>z</code> is a possibly complex value,
with real types giving zero on the imaginary component. To go the other way, I decided
to basically take the real component and ignore the imaginary component. To do this from
a <code>N: ComplexField</code> I had to check if <code>N::RealField == N</code> to see if <code>N</code> was real
or complex. To do this, I used <code>TypeId::of::&lt;N::RealField&gt;() == TypeId::of::&lt;N&gt;()</code>.
If <code>N</code> was real, converting from complex was easy: use <code>ComplexField::from_real</code> on
the real component, ignoring the imaginary. On the other hand, if <code>N</code> was complex,
the conversion needed to preserve the imaginary component. <code>ComplexField</code> has no
<code>from_imaginary</code>, so I directly implemented \( a + bi \) with
<code>ComplexField::from_real(z.re) + (-ComplexField::one()).sqrt() * ComplexField::from_real(z.im)</code>,
with <code>z</code> being the definitely complex value.</p>
<h2>Euler Method</h2>
<p>A differential equation is an equation describing a thing in terms of how
that thing changes. For those unfamiliar, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4">this</a>
is a good introduction. In order to solve a differential equation, you need some conditions.
These come in two flavors: boundary conditions and initial values, with both names
being self-describing. My second task on <code>bacon-sci</code> was to implement algorithms
that solve initial value differential equations, referred to as initial value
problems or <code>ivp</code> in the code.</p>
<p>Abstractly, the system of differential equations can be written, with an arrow
representing a vector quantity, as
\[ \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{y}}{\mathrm{d}t} = f(t, \vec{y}) . \]
This is a first-order system of differential equations since
only the first derivative is present. Generally, many higher-order
equations can be reduced to first-order by thinking of each derivative
as a new variable. The initial condition is then represented as
\[ \vec{y}(t_0) = \vec{y}_0 \]</p>
<p>These equations immediatly lead to the first algorithm
for solving initial value problems, Euler's method. Consider
this question: given a timestep \( \Delta t \), what is the
corresponding \( \Delta \vec{y} \)? We can approximate
\( \Delta \vec{y} / \Delta t \approx \mathrm{d}\vec{y}/\mathrm{d}t = f(t, \vec{y}) \),
(that is, use the tangent line to estimate the function),
leading to \( \Delta \vec{y} = f(t, \vec{y} )\Delta t \). This gives us an iterative
algorithm, \( \vec{y}_{i + 1} = \vec{y}_{i} + f(t, \vec{y})\Delta t \). This
is Euler's method. From the starting conditions, pick a timestep and iterate until
you reach the end.</p>
<p>So how good is Euler's method? Not very good. As an example, imagine solving
a mechanics differential equation with positions and velocities. Conservation
of energy says that energy should be conserved. Will Euler's method conserve
energy? In general, it will not. Energy in Euler's method tends to explode.
One solution to this is to use a slightly different version of the algorithm
known as Euler-Cromer or the semi-implicit Euler's method. In this method,
velocities are updated first, then positions are updated using the new velocities
(in Euler's method, you'd use the old velocities). Euler-Cromer is much better,
tending to conserve energy, especially in spring systems. According to Gaffer on Games,
game physics tend to use the Euler-Cromer as it only requires calculating the derivative
once but gives much better results than Euler's.</p>
<h2>Runge-Kutta Methods</h2>
<p>One problem with Euler's method is that the error in each step is linear in the
step size. We can do better. To start with, remember Taylor series from
basic calculus. That is, remember you can approximate a function of one
variable like
\[
f(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0) (x - x_0) + \frac{f''(x_0)}{2} {(x - x_0)}^2 + \ldots .
\]
Similarly, we can approximate our derivative function from the last section with
\[
f(t, \vec{y}) = f(t_0, \vec{y}_0)
+ \left((t - t_0)\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(t_0, \vec{y}_0)
+(\vec{y} - \vec{y}_0)\frac{\partial f}{\partial \vec{y}}(t_0, \vec{y}_0)\right)
+ \ldots ,
\]
where the powers of our vectors are done element-wise. Additionally, Taylor's Theorem
bounds the error via some small parameters \(\xi, \mu\).
In this light, we can say Euler's method is a zeroth order approximation, which is
why the error is linear. You can use Taylor polynomials for better IVP solvers, but
this requries information about the derivatives of \(f\). Instead, Runge-Kutta
methods allow for tighter error bounds without using the derivative.</p>
<p>To see an example of this, I will derivethe midpoint method here. Imagine for a
moment that instead of taking a full timestep, you take a partial timestep and use
\(f\) at that point to approximate the second Taylor polynomial. That is, choose
a \(a_1, \alpha_1, \beta_1\) so that \(a_1 f(t + \alpha_1, \vec{y} + \beta_1)\)
approximates
\[
T^{(2)}(t, \vec{y}) = f(t, \vec{y}) + \frac{h}{2}f'(t, \vec{y}),
\]
where \(h\) is the timestep, with quadratic error in the timestep.
Note that \(f'(t, y) = \partial f/\partial t(t, \vec{y})
+ \partial f/\partial \vec{y}(t, \vec{y}) \vec{y}'(t) \).
Thus,
\[
T^{(2)} = f(t, \vec{y}) + \frac{h}{2}\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}f(t, \vec{y})
+ \frac{h}{2}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \vec{y}}(t, \vec{y}) f(t, \vec{y}) .
\]
Expanding \(a_1 f(t + \alpha_1, \vec{y} + \beta_1)\) via Taylor series gives
\[
a_1 f(t, \vec{y}) + a_1 \alpha_1 \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}(t, \vec{y})
+ a_1\beta_1 \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(t, y) .
\]
Thus, \(a_1 = 1\), \(a_1 \alpha_1 = h/2\), and \(a_1 \beta_1 =
f(t, \vec{y}) h / 2\). This uniquely determines the coefficients, giving rise to
the midpoint method:
\[
\vec{y}_{i + 1} = \vec{y}_i + hf\left(t_i + \frac{h}{2}, \vec{y}_i + \frac{h}{2}f\left(t_i, \vec{y}_i\right)\right) .
\]</p>
<p>This process can be repeated for higher order polynomials. The classic
Runge-Kutta method is order 4, and is used as follows:
\[
\vec{k}_1 = hf(t_i, \vec{y}_i),
\]</p></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Sampling is very common in the society to model distributions and estimate variables. For a very common example, we randomly sample a large quantity of families to model the family income distribution and estimate the mean of family income. Here, family income is something that can be directly measured therefore estimating the mean of family income from the samples is not very interesting. Whatâ€™s interesting is that if we want to model the family income distribution and there must be some latent variables or variables that are dependent on the latent variables that can hardly be directly observed from the samples, what the most likely values, i.e., the expected values, for these variables are. This process is sometimes called statistical inference.</p>



<p>The result of statistical inference could be further used for estimating some additional variables. However, unfortunately determining the expected values for these variables during statistical inference is difficult if the model is non-trivial.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss why determining the expected values for these variables is difficult and how to approximate the expected values for these variables by sampling.</p>

<h3 id="statistical-inference">Statistical Inference</h3>

<h4 id="expected-values">Expected Values</h4>

<p>Suppose we have a multivariate joint distribution $P(X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n)$ and the mathematical form of the multivariate joint distribution is known. We will use $X = \{X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n\}$ in this article for brevity. Sometimes, we would like to compute the expected values of $\mathbb{E}_{P(X)} \big[f(X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n)\big]$ for some function $f$. For example, we would like to compute the expected value of the mean of $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n$, i.e., $\mathbb{E}_{P(X)} \big[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \big] $.</p>



<p>Using the property of expected values,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}_{P(X)} \bigg[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \bigg] 
&amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{E}_{P(X)} \big[ X_i \big] \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \int_{x \in X_i}^{} P( X_i = x ) x dx \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>According to the property of total probability,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(X_i ) &amp;= \int_{x_1 \in X_1} \int_{x_2 \in X_2} \cdots \int_{x_{i-1} \in X_{i-1}} \int_{x_{i+1} \in X_{i+1}} \cdots \int_{x_n \in X_n} \\
&amp; \quad P(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, \cdots, X_{i-1} = x_{i-1}, X_i, X_{i+1} = x_{i+1}, \cdots, X_n = x_n) \\
&amp; \quad d x_1 d x_2 \cdots d x_{i-1} d x_{i+1} \cdots d x_n \\
&amp;= \oint_{X - X_i} P(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_{i-1}, X_i, x_{i+1}, \cdots, x_n = x_n) \prod_{j \neq i} d x_j
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Usually the form of $P(X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n)$ is non-trivial, and this integral will immediately become intractable to derive if the number of variables $n$ becomes large. The reader might check such an <a href="https://leimao.github.io/article/Introduction-to-Variational-Inference/">example</a> in variational inference.</p>



<p>Now we are stuck. We could not compute the expected value of the mean of $X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n$, even if the joint distribution is known, because we cannot derive the conditional probability distribution $P(X_i)$ for each single variable $X_i$.</p>

<h4 id="approximate-by-sampling">Approximate By Sampling</h4>

<p>Although we cannot derive the conditional probability distribution $P(X_i)$ and further the expected value of some of the functions of variables that we are interested, if we can get some multivariate samples from the distribution $P(X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n)$, we can empirically determine the distribution of $P(X_i)$ and its statistics, such as the expected value, from the samples.</p>



<p>Going back to the example of computing the expected value of the mean of the variables, if we can get $N$ samples, $x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, \cdots, x^{(N)}$ where $x^{(i)} = \{x_1^{(i)}, x_2^{(i)}, \cdots, x_n^{(i)}\}$, from $P(X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n)$, because the law of large numbers, the mean of the variables could be estimated as the mean of the mean of the variables in the samples. Concretely,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}_{P(X)} \bigg[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \bigg] 
&amp;= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{E}_{P(X)} \big[ X_i \big] \\
&amp;\approx \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_i^{(j)} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{nN} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{N} x_i^{(j)} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>More generally, if we are interested in the expected value of a random variable $f(X)$ and the (posterior) distribution $P(X)$, given $N$ samples, $x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, \cdots, x^{(N)}$, we could estimate expected value of a random variable as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}_{P(X)} \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x^{(i)})
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="sampling-methods">Sampling Methods</h4>

<p>Now the most important question becomes how to generate samples from a complex multivariate joint distribution. We could imagine, without special methods, we could not even write a program to do samplings from a â€œsimpleâ€� multivariate Gaussian distribution easily. There are sampling methods such as Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to do a sequence of sampling from conditional univariate distributions that approximates the sampling from the multivariate joint distribution. I will write additional articles on these methods in the future.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Sampling is critical for statistical inference, especially from a multivariate joint posterior distribution for latent variables. The samples could be used for estimate variables, approximate joint distributions or marginal distributions.</p>

<h3 id="quiz">Quiz</h3>

<h4 id="how-to-do-sampling-from-a-univariate-distribution-using-an-existing-uniform-sampler">How to do sampling from a univariate distribution using an existing uniform sampler?</h4>

<p>A simple approach is to derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F_X(X = x) = P(X \leq x) = y \in [0, 1]$ for the univariate distribution $P(X)$, if CDF does exist. The inverse CDF is $F_X^{-1}(Y)$. Then with the uniform sampler $Y \sim U[ 0, 1 ]$, $F_X^{-1}(Y)$ has the same distribution as $P(X)$.</p>



<p><em>Proof</em></p><p>

\[\begin{align}
F_Y(y) &amp;= P(Y \leq y) \\
&amp;= P(F_X(x) \leq y) \\
&amp;= P(X \leq F_X^{-1}(y)) \\
&amp;= F_X(F_X^{-1}(y)) \\
&amp;= y
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
P(Y = y) &amp;= \frac{dF_Y}{d_Y}(y) \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore, for any distribution $P(X)$, $F_X(X) = Y \sim U[0, 1]$. The inverse function $X = F_X^{-1}(Y)$ maps from variable $Y$ to $X$, so $F_X^{-1}(Y)$ has the same distribution as $X$.</p>

<h4 id="why-for-some-modern-deep-models-doing-sampling-is-not-very-difficult-during-inference">Why for some modern deep models, doing sampling is not very difficult during inference?</h4>

<p>Many models, such as image semantic segmentation models, are maximizing $P(Y_1, Y_2, \cdots, Y_n | X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_m) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(Y_i | X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_m)$ during training, and during inference sampling from each of the univariate distribution $P(Y_i | X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_m)$ is relatively simple. Some other models, such as recurrent neural networks for language modeling, are maximizing $P(X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n) = P(X_1) P(X_2 | X_1) \cdots P(X_n | X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_{n-1})$ during training, and during inference sampling from each of the univariate distribution $P(X_i | X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_{i-1})$ is relatively simple.</p>

                        <h2>What is GraphQL</h2>
<p>In short, <a title="GraphQL" href="https://amzn.to/2JCioQm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GraphQL</a> is an API query language and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a defined data type system. It was developed at Facebook in 2012 before they released it to the public in 2015. GraphQL's primary goal wat to address the shortcomings of RESTful APIs. To provide more control over the data, how it is requested, and how it is returned. One thing I admire GraphQL for is the fact that you only use one endpoint, whereas on REST you use many numerous API endpoints.</p>
<p>To learn more about GraphQL, There is a list of <a title=" GraphQL tutorials " href="https://workly.dev/tutorials/technology/graphql/">GraphQL tutorials </a>on this blog which you can follow and learn.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is Django</h2>
<p><a title="Django" href="https://workly.dev/tutorials/django-web-framework-how-to-create-a-django-blog/">Django</a> is an open-source, python web framework that follows the Model-Template-View architecture.&nbsp; It advocates for rapid development, clean, and pragmatic design. You can use Django to build backend/APIs,&nbsp; small scale web applications, and large scale web applications. Django comes with a lot of functionalities and so you can complete a project very fast. It is fast, secure, and highly scalable.</p>



<h2>What is an API</h2>
<p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a service, kind of software, that allows two separate software or components of software to talk to each other ie to share data. Modern web applications have a backend that acts as the API and a frontend that serves the data from the backend or API.</p>

<h2>Creating the Django GraphQL API</h2>
<p>This tutorial is going to be a continuation of the tutorial where we <a title="learnt how to build a Django blog" href="https://workly.dev/tutorials/django-web-framework-how-to-create-a-django-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned how to build a Django blog</a>. I'm going to assume you have already build Django blog projects, created an article application, and created the models, views, and URLs.</p>
<p>To continue from where we left off, we need one python package, Django graphene. So inside the root directory of your blog project, open a terminal, and run the following commands.</p>

<pre><code>source env/bin/activate
pip install graphene-django</code></pre>

<p>We have activated the virtual environment and installed graphene-django in our virtual env.</p>
<p>Now open your <span>blog/settings.py</span> and add the Django graphene application under installed applications.</p>

<pre><code>INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    "django.contrib.staticfiles", # Required for GraphiQL
    "graphene_django"
]</code></pre>

<p>We now need to update our <span>blog/urls.py</span> file to add the graphql endpoint. So open the root urls.py file under blog i.e <span>blog/urls.py</span> and add the following code.</p>

<pre><code>from django.urls import path
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt

from graphene_django.views import GraphQLView

urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path("graphql/", csrf_exempt(GraphQLView.as_view(graphiql=True))),
]</code></pre>

<h3>GraphQL Schema and Object Types</h3>
<p>Inside the articles application create a <span>schema.py</span> and <span>types.py&nbsp;</span> file i.e under <span>article/schema.py</span>.</p>

<pre><code>touch article/schema.py
touch article/types.py</code></pre>

<p>Open the <span>types.py</span> first and add the following code.</p>

<pre><code>from graphene_django import DjangoObjectType
from article.models import Article

class ArticleType(DjangoObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = Article</code></pre>

<p>You have created the Articles object type. Now open the <span>schema.py</span> file and add the following code.&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>import graphene
from article.types import ArticleType
from article.models import Article

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    articles = graphene.List(ArticleType)

    def resolve_articles(self, info):
        return Article.objects.all()
</code></pre>



<p>Now let's create another <span>schema.py </span>file inside the blog project. The one with settings.py. Add the following code.</p>

<pre><code>import graphene
import article.schema

class Query(article.schema.Query, graphene.ObjectType):
    pass

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)</code></pre>

<p>Update your <span>settings.py</span> file and add the following code at the bottom which will point to the root schema.py we've just created.</p>

<pre><code>GRAPHENE = {
    "SCHEMA": "blog.schema.schema",
}</code></pre>

<p>After saving the file, restart your server and go to /graphql endpoint, you'll be able to see your GraphQL playground there.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="layout">
    <div id="main">
        
        
        <div id="content" data-role="content"> 
<p>My first proper programming language was C.
It was super confusing, and I wrote some terrible code that didn't really do anything terribly useful.</p>
<p>Along the way, however, I learned a bit about how computers do things, sort of.
I say sort of because <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/267583/why-is-c-still-in-the-category-of-high-level-language" title="If you disagree, please voice your dissent in my comment section">C is a <em>high level language</em></a>.</p>
<p>Of course, there are <em>higher-level</em> languages, and those end up being really good for a very wide array of tasks, so I went and learned them, and then I started actually getting things done.
I'm glad I started with C, though, since it gave me an idea of what these other languages must be doing under the hood to accomplish so much with so little code.</p>
<p>Using Scheme, Python, or Javascript, I didn't have to bother with managing the computer's memory allocation manually, and that turned out to be a lot more fun.</p>
<p>At some point a while back, I heard about <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust-lang</a>.</p>
<p>What is Rust?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sounds-good-right">Sounds good, right?</h2>
<p>Yea, actually.</p>
<p>I think it's a pretty awesome language.
The problem is, I make my living writing stuff working on web apps, and that means writing Javascript.
That's not a problem, necessarily, but I just don't have much use for a language like Rust.</p>
<p>It definitely seems awesome, and as a lisp aficionado, I love a lot of its high level concepts.
As I recall, Rust even has properly nesting block comments, which I find quite practical.</p>
<h2 id="where-am-i-going-with-this">Where am I going with this?</h2>
<p>Well, I just wanted to clear up that I don't think Rust is a bad language.
I'm not going to criticize <em>Rust</em> in this article, however, I am going to criticize a part of the community surrounding the language.</p>
<p>To be honest, actually, I'm not really sure the people I'm going to criticize are even a part of the community.
At best, they seem to be a part of the fringe.</p>
<p>Who are these people?</p>
<p>They are the people who show up unannounced on your software project's doorstep (probably your issue tracker) and ask the following question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you considered <em><strong>Rewriting It In Rust</strong></em>?</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="yes-im-starting-a-language-flame-war">Yes, I'm starting a language flame war</h2>
<p>Ok, here we go.</p>
<p>If you've spent any time at all in a community where programmers hang out, you've probably seen a flame war over which language is best.</p>
<p>I don't know which language is best, though I've argued for Scheme many times because nobody else seems to be doing it.</p>
<p>That being said, I've noticed that this particular subset of the Rust community seems to do this particular thing often enough that it's nearly the only thing that I know about the Rust community.</p>
<p>I've joked about it with friends and coworkers, and sure enough, most of them have witnessed it in the wild.</p>
<p>I believe the first time I saw it was on the (now disabled) <a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns">cjdns</a> issue tracker.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have the tracker turned on for long enough that I was able to get a screenshot:</p>
<p><img src="http://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/cjdns-eventually-moving-to-rust.jpg" alt="" title="'prevent thread problems' in software that runs on one thread... yea"></p>
<p>It all started and ended pretty quickly.
Some <em>Rustafarian</em> asked a question, and the author (<a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle">@cjdelisle</a>) answered somewhat sarcastically.</p>
<p>Once OP figures out that their brilliant idea is not being taken seriously, they get annoyed and leave.</p>
<h2 id="but-wait-theres-more">But wait, there's more</h2>
<p>Yea, of course it goes on.
I heard it a few more times, laughed about it (oh, this again), and then continued on with my life.</p>
<p>Of course, clearly it happened enough times that I started to notice a trend, because as I mentioned, I've joked about it with people, and they've noticed it too.</p>
<p>So, this morning (<strong>2016-03-22</strong>) I saw <a href="https://github.com/fc00/go-fc00/issues/1">a thread</a> in a repo I'm watching, and there it was again:</p>
<p><img src="http://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/go-fc00-why-go.jpg" alt="" title="...my actual question was about building a maybe more valuable solution..."></p>
<p>Once again, my friends make some snappy comments.
Pair those with a classic <em>if you want it written why don't you write it</em>, a few more <em>lulz</em> and our <em>Rustacean</em> acquaintance gets annoyed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ok, didn't thought a simple question would attract that much angry trolls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>..and things pretty much die out.</p>
<h2 id="but-then-i-started-thinking">But then I started thinking</h2>
<p>We joked about it on IRC, and a few more people comment that they've also seen this in the wild, and quickly enough we find that we need an acronym because <em>Rewrite It In Rust</em> takes too long to type and so <strong>RIIR</strong> is born.</p>
<p>So, naturally, once an acronym is born, we have a meme, and memes like to spread.
So, naturally, I start digging:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who else has been hit by this storm that has been sweeping the web?</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="nix">Nix</h3>
<p>Apparently there were a few threads like <a href="http://lists.science.uu.nl/pipermail/nix-dev/2015-December/019040.html">this one</a> which went on for a while.
I haven't checked the exact timelines, but since this is a language flame war, I'm sure somebody will leap in to do that research for me.</p>
<p><img src="http://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/nix-dev-perl-to-rust.jpg" alt="" title="Rust does this very well, to the point where me enumerating its benefits would be redundant."></p>
<h3 id="tor">Tor</h3>
<p>Yup, Tor, the very large, critical infrastructure that keeps journalists, criminals, schizophrenics, and <del>piracy</del> privacy activists anonymous has been <a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11331">asked to rewrite their software</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://transitiontech.ca/assets/riir/rewrite-tor-in-rust.jpg" alt="" title="Writing C code that is safe is super hard (even for exeperienced Tor devs)"></p>
<h2 id="more-still">More still...</h2>
<p>Why not <a href="https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-possible-advantageous-to-rewrite-the-Linux-kernel-in-Rust-when-the-language-is-stable" title="this one isn't on an issue tracker, at least">rewrite the Linux Kernel</a>? I'd love to hear Linus's answer to this.</p>
<p>Then of course there's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11337399">this comprehensive thread</a> on Hacker News covering a bunch of angles on the pros and cons of this meme.</p>
<p>Finally, I stumbled across <a href="http://robert.ocallahan.org/2016/02/rewrite-everything-in-rust.html" title="rewrite everytihng in rust">this blog</a>.</p>
<p>Despite being quite new, and certainly newer than the meme itself, this post seems to exemplify many of the talking points extolled by proponents of <strong>RIIR</strong>.</p>
<p>Its title even comes in the form of a call to action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rewrite Everything In Rust</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="so">So...?</h2>
<p>I don't really have more to say on the matter.
I just wrote this much to document a phenomenon I've noticed.</p>
<p>I don't have a comments section, because it ends up being really time consuming to say annoying, opinionated things if you have to answer for the fallout in your comments section.
Instead, I made <a href="https://github.com/ansuz/RIIR" title="Rewrite It In Rust">a github repo</a> where you can <a href="https://github.com/ansuz/RIIR/issues">file an issue</a> which:</p>
<ol>
<li>voices your own obnoxious opinion</li>
<li>supports my thesis<ul>
<li>super bonus points if you find more github issues asking for Rust rewrites</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>refutes my thesis<ul>
<li>super science points if you find that this behaviour is not exhibited disproportionately by Rust users</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>links to some project where somebody actually did <em>Rewrite It In Rust</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="did-this-post-offend-you">Did this post offend you?</h2>
<p>Cool.</p>
<p>Talk about it.</p>
<p>Tell your friends.</p>
<p>Good memes die hard.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>As of this writing (but perhaps not for very much longer!) the four mainstream compilers
on Godbolt Compiler Explorer give four different answers for
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/jo3dc4">this simple C++ program</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>struct A {
    using T = T1;
    using U = U1;
    operator U1 T1::*();
    operator U1 T2::*();
    operator U2 T1::*();
    operator U2 T2::*();
};

inline auto which(U1 T1::*) { return "gcc"; }
inline auto which(U1 T2::*) { return "icc"; }
inline auto which(U2 T1::*) { return "msvc"; }
inline auto which(U2 T2::*) { return "clang"; }

int main() {
    A a;
    using T = T2;
    using U = U2;
    puts(which(a.operator U T::*()));
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The question is whether <code>U</code> should be looked up in the scope of <code>test</code> or in the scope of <code>A</code>;
and the same question for <code>T</code>.</p>

<p>According to the current draft standard, it sounds like the conforming answer is
“they should <em>both</em> be looked up in the scope of <code>A</code>”; i.e., GCC’s answer is correct
and the others are wrong in three different ways. <a href="http://eel.is/c++draft/basic.lookup.unqual#5">[basic.lookup.unqual]/5</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An unqualified name that is a component name of a <em>type-specifier</em> or <em>ptr-operator</em>
of a <em>conversion-type-id</em> is looked up in the same fashion as the <em>conversion-function-id</em>
in which it appears. If that lookup finds nothing, it undergoes unqualified name lookup;
in each case, only names that denote types or templates whose specializations are types are considered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m never a fan of lookups that don’t consider certain <em>kinds</em> of names; I’m sure there’s more divergence
to be discovered in this area. Anyway, in the type name <code>U T::*</code>, <code>U</code> is the <em>type-specifier</em>
and <code>T::*</code> is the <em>ptr-operator</em>, and the whole type is pronounced “pointer to a data member of <code>T</code>,
where that data member itself is of type <code>U</code>.”
(More concisely: “pointer to data member (of type <code>U</code>) of <code>T</code>,” or “pointer to a <code>U</code> member of <code>T</code>.”)</p>

<p>See also:</p>

<p><span>I often speak with leaders of organizations, and they tell me they want their people to be more innovative. â€œOur SVP is wanting our whole group to do that Design Thinking thing,â€� or â€œOur companyâ€™s growth strategy is dependent on innovation.â€�</span></p>
<p><span>According to the </span><a href="https://www.accenture.com/t20180705T112257Z__w__/us-en/_acnmedia/PDF-10/Accenture-Innovation-Research-ExecSummary.pdf"><span>2015 US Innovation Survey</span></a><span> by </span><a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en"><span>Accenture</span></a><span>, 84% of executives believe innovation is critical to success. Accenture asserts that they just donâ€™t know how to do it. Executives are on the right path, but arenâ€™t effectively instilling innovation in their businesses. </span></p>
<h3><b>Real problems, real solutions</b></h3>
<p><span>If organizations really want to drive innovation and create concrete innovative solutions and products, Design Thinking is an excellent place to start. Design Thinking refers to a set of creative problem-solving techniques that are used to discover human-centric, customer-focused solutions to real world problems. </span></p>
<p><span>Design Thinking is a highly effective tool for driving innovation in any company. Unfortunately, I hear people complain that Design Thinking does not work â€“ â€œWe tried that, and it didnâ€™t work for our companyâ€� or â€œDesign Thinking is not the way to go.â€�</span></p>
<h3><b>Agree to disagree</b></h3>
<p><span>But when I dig into why Design Thinking is not working for them, I get answers like </span><a href="https://twitter.com/malbonster?lang=en"><span>Tim Malbon</span></a><span>â€™s in his article titled </span><a href="https://medium.com/the-many/the-problem-with-design-thinking-988b88f1d696"><span>The Problem with Design Thinking</span></a><span>. â€œDesign Thinking delivers a wonderful day or two off from the realities of boring old business-as-usual. Youâ€™ll always remember the day you were let out of your work cubicle (aka veal-fattening pen) to â€˜playâ€™ with Sharpies and Post-Its along with colleagues on Brainstorm Island. [â€¦] However, in terms of lasting, impactful, commercial innovation, the Design Thinking scorecard doesnâ€™t look so healthy.â€�</span></p>
<p><span>Tim is a founding partner of </span><a href="https://www.madebymany.com/"><span>Made by Many</span></a><span>, a digital product innovation and strategy company. Heâ€™s a smart guy, but I feel he falls victim to the same type of thinking that many other executives do which I call the â€œcargo cult of Design Thinking.â€�</span></p>
<h3><b>Cult following</b></h3>
<p><span>A â€œ</span><a href="https://www.anthroencyclopedia.com/entry/cargo-cults#h2ref-0"><span>cargo cultâ€�</span></a><span> is a term to describe belief systems that developed among less technologically advanced societies when new and foreign technology was introduced. For example, during World War II, an enormous amount of supplies and equipment were airlifted to the islands of Melanesia, from which the indigenous people benefited greatly. After the war, the shipments stopped and they didnâ€™t know why. To lure back planes loaded with desirable goods, the Melanesians cut airstrips out of the jungle </span><span>and made replicas of the planes and equipment that had brought the goods that they desired</span><span> with the hope that the supplies would return.</span></p>

<h3>“Sometimes management works the same way with regard to innovation â€“ they act out rituals and create models of the things they think will bring them the ever-elusive creativity they seek.”</h3>
<p><span>Sometimes management works the same way with regard to innovation â€“ they act out rituals and create models of the things they think will bring them the ever-elusive creativity they seek. They want their workforce to be innovative, but they donâ€™t know how to get it to be. So theyâ€™ll do any number of things, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Designate a â€œcreative room,â€� stock it with bean bags, toys, and sticky notes, fill it with team members â€¦ and then tell them, â€œOK, go innovate!â€�</span></li>
<li><span>Send some poor soul to a two-day class, and hope they come back and â€œinfectâ€� the entire organization with creativity.</span></li>
<li><span>Give some other person a title like â€œCreative Lead,â€� and charge them with making the organization more innovative.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>And so on. To be expected, this cargo cult-style method of introducing innovation doesnâ€™t work. </span></p>
<p><span>So what does it take to make design and innovation work for an organization? First, an acknowledgement that design- and innovative thinking are not easy. The Design Thinking process may look simple and fun from the outside, but true creativity doesnâ€™t just happen â€“ it takes knowledge and deep understanding of proven theories and mechanics, training, and above all, practice.</span></p>
<h3><b>No train, no gain</b></h3>
<p><span>When you identify an organization that has successfully made Design Thinking part of their culture, youâ€™ll also see that the organization has made a commitment to training.</span></p>
<p><span>According to </span><a href="https://www.intuitlabs.com/"><span>Intuit Labs</span></a><span>, â€œeach and every employee is expected to think like an entrepreneur, and itâ€™s everyoneâ€™s job to create, to invent, and to look for new and better ways to improve our customersâ€™ lives. […] We all learn the techniques, and practice the behaviors to be innovators and help our customers around the world be prosperous.â€� </span></p>
<p><span>As </span><a href="https://twitter.com/intuitbrad?lang=en"><span>Brad Smith</span></a><span>, former CEO of Intuit explained, â€œAt Intuit, innovation is everyoneâ€™s job.â€� This is the way it should be. Innovation is not just one- or two-day training sessions for a few people; it is a way of working for the entire company. Organizations like Intuit look at training as an investment in their entire workforce.</span></p>
<p><span>Investing in training is key to making your organization more innovative and creative. Instead of converting an empty office into a â€œcreative caveâ€� and filling it with toys, find out more about the training course Iâ€™ve built for organizations like yours; it specifically makes Design Thinking approachable and doable for non-designers.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			<p><strong>The social media platform Minds had to remove ‘major functionality’ from its Android app after getting a chilling warning from Google. Its co-founder said plans for a censorship-resistant infrastructure are in the works.</strong></p>
<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.minds.com/newsfeed/1196949029506060288" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">post</a>&nbsp;on Friday evening, Bill Ottman said that Minds had received a&nbsp;<em>“24 hour warning”</em>&nbsp;from the Google Play store. This forced them to submit an updated version of the app, based on&nbsp;<em>“interim solution and ninja developers,”</em> which removed the search, discovery and comments functionality.</p>
<p><em>“I know. We aren’t happy and will be working towards something better,”</em>&nbsp;Ottman said.&nbsp;<em>“What is happening on the internet with major providers is fueling the cultural divide as much as anything,”</em>&nbsp;he added.</p>
<p>Operating since 2015, Minds was conceived as a blockchain-based community-owned social media platform that would not monetize user data but enable free speech instead.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/minds-anti-facebook/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wired</a>&nbsp;magazine once described it as the&nbsp;<em>“anti-Facebook.”</em></p>
<p><em>Owen is joined by James O’Keefe of Project Veritas, after the explosive video released of Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who revealed his true intentions on social media.</em></p>
<p>Ottman advised users to download the app from Minds directly if possible.&nbsp;<em>“If you are on Apple, leave if you’re smart,”</em>&nbsp;he said.</p>


<p>As for going forward, he said a plan for&nbsp;<em>“fully censorship-resistant infrastructure”</em>&nbsp;is coming soon, and that Minds has&nbsp;<em>“multiple escape pods ready to go”</em>&nbsp;if Amazon moves against them.</p>
<p>Ottman’s comments were a clear reference to what happened to Parler. The free-speech social media platform attracted tens of thousands of users purged from Twitter in the wake of the January 6 unrest at the US Capitol – only to be banned from Google and Apple stores, and then taken down from the internet entirely after Amazon Web Services (AWS) denied them access to the cloud. Parler’s executives later revealed that other vendors rushed to jump ship as well, leaving them unable to operate entirely.</p>
<p>Those who complained about the rising tide of censorship have typically been told that the First Amendment to the US Constitution did not apply to private companies and that people should&nbsp;<em>“build their own”</em>&nbsp;platforms if they disagreed. Parler’s shutdown has shown that this is near-impossible when the major players control the internet infrastructure itself, however.</p>
<p>Mainstream media and tech platforms have gone after Parler, Gab, Minds, and Telegram for allegedly having&nbsp;<em>“far-right”</em>users and allowing&nbsp;<em>“hate speech”</em>&nbsp;as content. In Parler’s case, Amazon’s ultimatum demanded moderation policies they would approve of in order to avoid removal from AWS.</p>
<p>In a lawsuit accusing Amazon of breach of contract, antitrust violations and defamation, Parler argued that this was pretextual and revealed that Amazon staff sought to find out if US President Donald Trump – freshly banned from Twitter and locked out of Facebook – had set up an account on the platform.</p>

<p>LEET is my vision of a new kind of modular affordable synth you can build yourself. It consists of several MIDI devices that can be used together or separate with your preferred DAW. </p>

<p>It became a massive project covering industrial design, embedded programming, 3D modelling, electronics and music theory. I’m happy with the current state, but I hope that with the help of others, the project will continue to evolve and improve.</p>

<p>I have designed a <a href="https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/leet-keyboard/">keyboard</a>, <a href="https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/leet-pad/">drum pad</a>, <a href="https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/leet-chord/">chord keyboard</a>, <a href="https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/leet-control/">control unit</a>,  <a href="https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/leet-arpeggiator/">arpeggiator</a> and a <a href="https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/leet-sequencer/">step sequencer</a>. One special feature is that the units have RGB LEDs for each key, enabling playback visualization (so each device is both MIDI out and in). This is helpful for music training and editing, but it also looks great. They can be used as input devices to any computer with a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) like Ableton, Logic, Cubase, Garageband etc. It will run on Windows, Mac or Linux (including Raspberry Pi). They can even be connected to your mobile phone (Android or iOS), providing a tactile super portable music development platform.</p>

<p>Everything is open source and built with the easy to use Arduino framework so it can be tweaked, improved and complemented with new functions to fit all kinds of different needs. Build a wooden stand, add a light sensor to control timbre, connect it to a speak and spell or build something completely new – the possibilities are endless!</p>

<p>All devices are built around a 3D printed core (3DPCB) that creates the exterior of the product, holds all components in place and has integrated wire channels that connects the components in a fool proof way. 3DPCB makes the devices easier to replicate, less expensive and you don’t need to wait for PCB delivery.</p>

<p>I designed the devices to be simplistic, solid and playful. The design might be called retrofuturism since they are inspired by old-school mainframe computers from the 70s with lots of blinkenlights like PDP-10, but the addition of full color LEDs and 3DPCBs makes them futuristic at the same time (maybe they are from a past that never happened ;)</p>



<h2>Modularity</h2>



<p>I kept the form factor for each unit similar and designed a simple snap on stand where two or three units can be stacked and tilted for easy access. The units can also be equipped with magnets, allowing them to be snapped together side by side. With this approach, a two or three octave keyboard can be constructed by joining modules next to each other. </p>

<p>There is also a snap on accessory that just contains a sticker in order to identify the units. Like “Lead, ch2” or “Drums, ch7”.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>



<p>This project started as an idea to develop a synth using the 3DPCB idea. I initially planned to design a self-contained synth with batteries, sound generation and built-in speaker, but quickly realized that it would be more useful to build a modular system instead. By using MIDI, the project becomes flexible and enable high quality sound generation. I considered using MIDI over Bluetooth, but the increased complexity with batteries, charging circuits, size, cost and reliability, made me stick with traditional USB connections.</p>



<p>Before I started, I defined some goals for the project – this is what I aimed for:</p>



<div><div>
<ul><li>Playful</li><li>Modular</li><li>MIDI</li><li>Portable</li><li>Affordable</li><li>Easy to replicate</li><li>Lots of blinkenlights</li></ul>
</div></div>



<p>To demonstrate the abilities, I decided to develop different parts that are needed for a system that can record and playback a song with a keyboard, arpeggiator and a basic sequencer.</p>

<p>To me this is a proof of concept – see it as a base for inspiration. The input units/ keyboards are working great, but the more complicated sequencer has room for improvements. I hope that others will assist on development and that future firmware releases will improve the functionality.</p>



<p>What I really like with the project is how easy it is to build something unique. Combining the components (microprocessor, LEDs and switches) is like building with LEGO. It would take me less than a day to build a working keyboard that starts with the note “A” instead of “C” (if I for some reason would want one). Adding a gamepad joystick, or even a light sensor to control pitch bend, is just as easy. Sure, you need to have basic understanding of electronics, 3D modelling and Arduino programming, but it’s not that complicated, and a project like this is a great learning experience.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>



<div><div>
<blockquote><p><strong>Can anyone build one?&nbsp;</strong><br>If you can hold a soldering iron in the right end you should be fine. My 12-year-old have built a keyboard that works great.<br></p><p><strong>What equipment is needed?</strong><br>You need a 3D printer (fff/ fdm) with a spool of PLA plastic, a soldering station with a narrow tip (and preferably a smoke extractor) and basic tools like pliers. If you don’t have this at home visit your local hackerspace!<br></p><p><strong>What does it cost?</strong><br>The components for keyboard costs around <strong>$6</strong> (depending on shipping and supplier). Prices from eBay: <br>* Arduino pro micro ($4), <br>* 13 LEDs from a ws2812 led strip (60led/m) ($1.1), <br>* 15 6×6 tact switches ($0.2), <br>* 34g PLA filament ($0.7).<br>The more expensive sequencer also needs <br>* 2pcs of 8×8 ws2812 LED matrixes (2*$8) and <br>* a micro SD card reader ($3)<br></p><p><strong>How long does it take to build one?</strong><br>Printing time for a keyboard is 3.5h on a Prusa i3 and soldering takes 1-2 hours, depending on your experience.</p><p><br><strong>What is generating the sound?</strong><br>A computer or mobile phone generates the sounds mapped to different channels. Sunvox is a great free option, but DAWs like Ableton Live, Logic Pro, Pro Tools, FL Studio, Cubase, Studio one, Reason, Garageband can be used.<br>The keyboards and sequencers are only sending MIDI commands (like note C3 on channel 4 at full velocity). This gives you full freedom to choose from east coast (subtractive), west coast (additive), FM, samples, wavetable, vector, granular or any other synthesis of choice. With a MIDI to CV interface they can control analog modular systems. Maybe I should design a eurorack version one day?..</p><p><br><strong>Is the keyboard velocity sensitive?</strong><br>No, the standard tact switches used does not provide any velocity or after-touch data. Using two switches per key and measure time difference can be done, but not something I have investigated.<br></p><p><strong>How big is it?</strong><br>The dimensions of a keyboard unit are 154x45x8mm (6×1.8×0.3 inches) (without cables and knobs)</p><p><br><strong>This is a great project – how can I help?</strong><br>I appreciate all feedback and ideas for future devices and improvements.<br>It would be super cool to develop a simple Android or PC application that maps soundfonts/ samples to different MIDI channels and automatically echo MIDI commands to enable LED feedback. If you are good at embedded development, the sequencer has room for improvements.</p><p><span>I created a forum where people who want to contribute can share ideas and assist with development: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/forums/forum/leet-synthesizer-development/" target="_blank">https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/forums/forum/leet-synthesizer-development/</a></span></p><p><br><strong>What does it take to modify or hack one?</strong><br>Most important is a “how hard can it be?“ mentality. Modifying it is a great way to understand how it works and learn new things. When you are done you will know more about electronics, 3D CAD and embedded programming. Don’t forget to post your hacks!</p><p><br><strong>Do you have any ideas for future improvements?</strong><br>Yes, lots of them, here are some:<br>* A playback device (Raspberry Pi zero?) that generates sound without the need  for mouse, keyboard or monitor. (MIDI in -&gt; audio out). Maybe something like <a href="https://vonkonow.com/wordpress/forums/topic/ideas-for-a-raspberry-pi-based-synth-engine/">this</a>: <br>* A keyboard with mechanical linear switches (Gateron/ Kailh/ Cherry MX)<br>* A keyboard covering two octaves<br>* A keyboard with a small MIDI sampler and transposable playback.<br>* A tiny sequencer with 0.96” OLED display(s) instead of LED matrix.<br>* A full color MIDI visualizer using the sequencer display.<br>* An AI based deep learning synth using google magenta and ESP32…</p></blockquote>

<p>We as a society recognize that discriminating against someone based on the color of their skin, or sexual orientation, is flat out wrong. That discriminating on the basis of inborn qualities that cannot be controlled by the individual, is deeply &amp; fundamentally unfair.</p>
<p>Well, what about height?</p>
<p>Is it ok for major institutions in our society to discriminate on the basis of height, when choosing who to hire? I would certainly hope not. Just like racial discrimination, I’m sure certain small amounts of height discrimination are bound to occur. But if we see an organization or institution where such discrimination is glaringly obvious &amp; easily proven, shouldn’t we as a society step in &amp; try to remedy this in the best way we can?</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the epicenter of height-discrimination: <a href="http://www.besttickets.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Height-and-Weight.png?e9aabb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The NBA</a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s0209.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><b>42%</b> of American males are 5’9 or shorter</a>. And yet, <b>0.45%</b> of NBA players fall into this category.</li>
<li><b>80%</b> of American males are under 6 feet tall. And yet, only <b>3.5%</b> of NBA players can say the time.</li>
<li><strong>99.9%</strong> of American males are 6’4 or shorter. And yet, the <em>average</em> height in the NBA is still <strong>6’7</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming basketball as a sport did not penalize players for their height, we would expect there to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>360 </b>NBA players under 6 feet in height</li>
<li><b>90 </b>NBA players over 6 feet in height</li>
</ul>
<p>What the numbers currently look like:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>16 </b>NBA players under 6 feet in height</li>
<li><b>434 </b>NBA players over 6 feet in height</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the current NBA rules, the number of under-6-feet people who were denied the opportunity to play in the NBA due to height discrimination: <b>344</b></p>
<p>The number of over-6-feet people who became NBA players due to height-discrimination in their favor: <b>344</b></p>
<p>That’s right. Out of 450 players in the NBA, <b>76%</b>&nbsp;of them are only there due to height discrimination. These 344 players are keeping out others who deserve their spot, but were denied this dream due to height discrimination.</p>
<p>Now what if we considered a drastic solution: <strong>Ban anyone over 6-feet in height from playing in the NBA.</strong></p>
<p>What the player height distribution would now look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>450 NBA players under 6-feet</li>
<li>0 players over 6-feet</li>
</ul>
<p>Compare this to the ideal &amp; fair height distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>360 under 6 feet</li>
<li>90 over 6 feet</li>
</ul>
<p>Net result under this new policy: 90 players would be unfairly locked out of the NBA due to height-discrimination. However, these 90 players only represent 20% of the NBA players.</p>
<p>Hence, by instituting this ban-on-anyone-over-6-feet, we can cut down the number of undeserving NBA players <b>from 76%</b> of the player base, <b>to 20%</b>. This solution may not be perfect, but anytime we can cut down discrimination from 76% to 20%, that’s a <em>huge</em> win worth pursuing.</p>
<p>The argument in favor of instituting this ban seems obvious: Cutting down discrimination by an order of magnitude and making the NBA accessible to the vast majority of Americans. Are there any reasons why we shouldn’t pursue this ban?</p>
<p><strong><i>“Banning tall players would make the games less fun to watch.”</i></strong></p>
<p><span>Completely bogus. Player height in the NBA is just like Einstein’s famous theory; it’s all relative. If every single NBA player shrunk by 12-inches right before the start of the game, and </span><i>the basketball hoop was lowered</i><span> by 12-inches as well to compensate, the audience would never know the difference. The game would play itself out in almost the exact same way, and it would be exactly as enjoyable to watch as it was before.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>“Shorter people are less athletic than tall people, and therefore, deserve to be underrepresented.”</i> </strong></p>
<p>Again, completely bogus. For any person not suffering from &nbsp;malnutrition, his height is 99% determined by genetics, and is absolutely independent of how fit, healthy, agile or dextrous he is. Shorter men are just as athletic as taller men, and would be equally represented in any sport that doesn’t discriminate on the basis of height. Looking at Football (Soccer) for example, a sport that demands just as much athleticism as basketball, statistics show that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Height_in_sports#Association_football" target="_blank" rel="noopener">professional footballers have heights that match that of the general population</a>.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What about people who are stronger or more fit? Aren’t they overrepresented? Should we ban them too?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Of course not. Unlike height, these other qualities like strength &amp; speed can be trained &amp; developed by anyone. Our society rewards people for earned talents, such as educational or technical proficiency, all the time. Height, on the other hand, isn’t an earned quality. It’s more like race, something we are innately born with &amp; cannot alter. Hence why it is immoral to discriminate on the basis of these innate qualities.</p>
<p><strong><i>“A player’s height is instrumental in fulfilling the job role. Hence why discriminating on the basis of height should be allowed.”</i></strong></p>
<p>This is only true under current NBA rules. Team owners are forced to discriminate on the basis of height when hiring players, because the only players who can successfully fulfill the job role tend to be tall players. However, changing the NBA rules to ban over-6-feet players would resolve this dilemma. A 5’10 player would now be able to fulfill the job role if he trains hard enough, and can thus earn his spot on the team. And the business customers for their part (spectators), would find themselves watching a game that is just as exciting and entertaining as it always was.</p>
<p><strong><i>“This new rule discriminates against people who are tall!”</i> </strong></p>
<p>Guilty as charged. But which is worse? Discriminating against <b>344 individuals</b> for <b>being too short</b>? Or discriminating against <b>60 individuals</b> for being too tall? Imposing a 6-foot-height maximum rule would cut down discrimination in the NBA <b>from 76% to 20%</b>. Ideally, we should find some way to remedy even this problem. However, just like in the real world, we can never reach an ideal solution. But that shouldn’t stop us from taking steps in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What about players who are 5’8 or shorter? Under this new rule, wouldn’t someone who’s 5’11 still have an unfair advantage over them?”</i> </strong></p>
<p>This is somewhat true, but isn’t as big a problem. If you look at the list of NBA greats, many of them are multiple inches shorter than their opponents, and yet still outclassed them with other skills. Being an entire foot shorter is a recipe for disaster, but being a few inches shorter still allows for a relatively even match-up. A 5’8 player may be locked out completely by a 6’8 opponent, but he will still be able to compete against a 5’11 opponent. Once again, this is still not an ideal situation, but that shouldn’t stop us from taking steps in the right direction.</p>


<hr>



<p>There are millions of children who grow up every year, dreaming of becoming a sports superstar like their idols on television. Most of them will never realize this dream, but every one of them deserves a fair shot at it. </p>



<p>Under the current paradigm, 99% of kids will grow up to realize that they will never be given a fair shake in the NBA, simply due to their genetic height. They will grow up to realize, either consciously or subconsciously, that most of the stars making millions of dollars in the NBA, are there only because of a height discrimination system that unfairly rewards them for being born a certain way, while simultaneously locking out millions others for no fault of their own. We may never be able to bring these numbers down to 0. But it’s time we tried.</p>

It was part of the thesis, but we quickly found that investors were skeptical about the efficacy of remote teams, and didn’t see the market potential. Instead, we focused on other changes affecting the workplace: the need for more decentralization and more humanity in our tools.</p><p id="2464">Fast-forward to 2021 and the COVID-19 pan<span id="rmm">d</span>emic has forced millions of people to experience remote work first hand. It hasn’t been “normal” remote work for sure, but after a year, companies have had to figure out how to make it work. It’s starting to look like <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/us-remote-work-survey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pandora’s box has been opened</a>.</p><p id="cee0">Remote work is firmly here to stay, but that doesn’t mean all companies will be all remote all the time. That’s an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/hybrid-remote-work-offers-the-worst-of-both-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extreme position</a> and isn’t pragmatic or desirable for everyone. At the same time, very few companies will go back to being all co-located, all the time.</p><blockquote><p id="8e37">Remote work is firmly here to stay, but that doesn’t mean all companies will be all remote all the time.</p></blockquote><p id="21a9">Even Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21426956/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-return-to-office-vaccine-working-from-home-negative" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reed Hastings</a> — who thinks that work from home is a “pure negative” — concedes that people may be remote one day a week. And while <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/google-delays-return-to-office-and-eyes-flexible-work-week.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google is requiring that employees live within commute distance of an office</a>, they will only require three days a week in the office. Both these are hybrid models for remote work.</p><p id="7006">Hybrid will be the new normal.</p><p id="6d12">It won’t be without its challenges and there won’t be a one-size-fits-all answer, so to get started I want to discuss a few variants that we’ll see emerge.</p><p id="2414">We should expect more companies to follow the path of <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitLab</a> and <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapier</a>, and to become fully distributed, but it will still be a minority. I do expect many startups to begin fully distributed, since it reduces costs and can make hiring easier, but as they grow they will often shift to hybrid models.</p><p id="c141">Being fully distributed requires intentionality in how you structure work processes. You have to actively design systems that facilitate information flow and cultivate belonging. However, because <em>everyone</em> is remote, there is a more of a level playing field, so in some ways is the easier path.</p><p id="9851">Many people can’t easily work from home; they might have kids or roommates, or no dedicated home office space. Some people simply like the separation of leaving the house, going to work, and being in an office with other people.</p><p id="dea0">To make accommodations for these people, some companies will set up working spaces in urban hubs where there is a critical mass of employees.</p><p id="e47b">However, there will be no fixed expectations around where people are, and as such all work processes will be designed around the assumption that teams won’t be in the same place at the same time.</p><p id="fec6">Operationally it will be very similar to a fully distributed team. But it will take extra effort to ensure that those working in close proximity don’t fall back to informal, in-person channels of communication that leave some people feeling excluded.</p><p id="497a">In this model some teammates are remote, some are in the office, but locations are generally consistent. For example, you might work in an office in SF five days a week, while a colleague works from home in Colorado five days a week.</p><p id="411a">Project teams may be “defragged”, such that a team is all in the same office, while another team is fully distributed.</p><p id="2ba5">Consistency makes it easier to coordinate meetings and there are clear expectations about how different people interact. You and your Colorado colleague will always interact over video chat, you know there’s a timeshift, while another person on your team sits near you in SF, so you always have your 1:1s on the Embarcadero.</p><p id="3602">This model has predictability and operationally will be familiar to many people, as it was quite common prior to COVID. Back when I worked on Gmail, we were split across several locations in a way that was functionally equivalent to this model.</p><p id="3189">My guess is that this model will become most common.</p><p id="1c7e">People will have reserved desk space at an office. However, teammates are able to fluidly move from working from home (or a coffee shop) to working in the office.</p><p id="189e">Some informal norms will exist, such as being in person for 1:1s or team meetings. And there may be guidance about how many days you can be in the office or working from home. But individuals will generally be free to do what they want.</p><p id="f7d6">This is how many “high trust” startups used to operate prior to COVID, but it’s not without tension. Different people have different expectations about presence, and managers in particular can find themselves frustrated about the lack of predictability.</p><p id="0bb2">I myself remember doing laps of the Medium office looking for someone, only to realize they were randomly WFH.</p><p id="fcbb">With Pandora’s box open, and only a <a href="https://blog.perceptyx.com/just-4-percent-of-employees-want-to-return-to-the-office-full-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small percentage</a> of people wanting to return to the office full-time, management teams who favor in-person collaboration will be forced to make compromises in order to compete for talent.</p><p id="a3b8">A hybrid strategy where everyone is expected to be in the office on a synchronized schedule is more predictable for management and allows for traditional forms of collaboration and meetings to continue (I picture sticky notes on the wall and project plans on communal whiteboards.)</p><p id="e43c">The most common form is likely to be a fixed weekly schedule. For example, “Friday From Home” or a Tuesday/Thursday split. However, I expect some teams will find that they only need to be in person on the first and last days of a sprint.</p><p id="a709">I’m optimistic about the changes we’re seeing. We’ve long known that the 40 hour work week, with it’s <a href="https://kylechowning.com/butts-in-a-seat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">butts-in-seats management</a> philosophy, isn’t how you foster creativity and get the most of people.</p><p id="8868">These shifts in expectations for how we work will create a better world for workers. It shifts the conversation away from what managers need from their teams, to what teams need in order to be successful, and what employees want from their work environment.</p><blockquote><p id="6d0f">Unlocking remote collaboration will create greater flexibility for how we work.</p></blockquote><p id="9c66">Unlocking remote collaboration will create greater flexibility for where and when we work which will allow people to <a href="https://www.range.co/blog/rethinking-the-workweek?utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=medium&amp;utm_campaign=dan-blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rethink their workweek</a>, crafting schedules that work for their logistical and <a href="https://www.danpink.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/When_Planner.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creative needs</a>.</p><p id="48a7">One of the reasons I was excited to start <a href="http://www.range.co/?utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=medium&amp;utm_campaign=dan-blogs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Range</a> was to build the tools I wish I had earlier in my career.

     ● 10 Jan 2021
  </p>
  
  <p><em>Sections of this post were co-authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cornelia-scheitz/">Cornelia Scheitz</a>. Last updated on January 18, 2021.</em></p>

<p>Bert Hubert’s excellent and widely shared article about <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">Reverse Engineering the source code of the Pfizer-BioNTech SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine</a> is all it took to turn hundreds of software engineers and other Silicon Valley types into armchair vaccine experts overnight! Jokes aside, the article explains the 4284 base pair long mRNA inside the Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine for those who are more familiar with software than molecular biology.</p>

<p>Bert’s article is primarily about the biology of the vaccine, how it relates to the virus and how it works in the human body, but there’s this one sentence about vaccine production:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the very beginning of the vaccine production process, someone uploaded this code to a DNA printer (yes), which then converted the bytes on disk to actual DNA molecules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next to it is a picture of a <a href="https://codexdna.com/products/bioxp-system/">CodexDNA BioXP</a> device that is advertised as producing “custom DNA fragments of up to 7,000 base pairs”. Could this be the next <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makers:_The_New_Industrial_Revolution">distributed manufacturing revolution</a>? This time with DNA printers making COVID-19 vaccines in our garages instead of 3D printers and plastic widgets?</p>

<p>I’ll start with the bad news: Nobody will be making an mRNA vaccine in their garage any time soon.</p>

<p>The following text is a collection of notes I wrote down while exploring the process for manufacturing and distributing the two new vaccines that have appeared all over the news and in more and more people’s arms over the recent weeks. I started reading about mRNA but quickly found myself on tangents about glass vials and temperature tracking devices.</p>

<p>This text was written over a week worth of evenings in early January 2021. It covers the two vaccines currently authorized for distribution in the United States where I live: One by Pfizer-BioNTech and one by Moderna. Several other mRNA based COVID-19 vaccines <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html">are in various stages of clinical trials</a> and are likely similar to those covered here in some ways and different in others.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that I got everything right. Corrections and suggestions are welcome, please email jn@jonasneubert.com.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-list">Ingredients List</h2>

<p>The list of ingredients, or “bill of materials” in engineering parlance, is a good starting point for understanding the supply chain of any product. The ingredient lists for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines are public and have been widely reported.</p>

<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is also known under its code name “BNT162b2”, it’s registered trademark “Corminaty”, and its international non-proprietary name “Tozinameran”. The list of ingredients can be found in information material available on the various country-specific product websites on <a href="https://www.cvdvaccine.com/">www.cvdvaccine.com</a> or government websites like that of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulatory-approval-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/information-for-healthcare-professionals-on-pfizerbiontech-covid-19-vaccine">UK’s MHRA</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tozinameran#Manufacturing">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

<p>The Moderna vaccine is also known as “mRNA-1273”, but appears to lack a brand name other than “Moderna COVID-19 vaccine” which is what it says on the product label. The list of ingredients can be found on the <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/">EUA factsheet on Moderna’s website</a>, or in these <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download">FDA meeting notes</a>. It, too, has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA-1273">Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>

<p>The two vaccines share some ingredients but not all. The following table is my attempt to sort the available information and compare the two.</p>

<p>In addition to what’s in the vaccine vial, Pfizer-BioNTech needs to be diluted with sodium chloride shortly before use (more about that below). The Moderna vaccine does not seem to require such a “DIY assembly” step.</p>

<p>Now that we know all the ingredients, let’s go shopping.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Please don’t perform chemistry or create pharmaceuticals unless you have the appropriate safety training and equipment. I include links to online shops below, but note that they sell “for research use only” and will verify your affiliation with a research organization before taking your business.</p>

<h2 id="mrna">mRNA</h2>

<p>To make RNA, you start by making DNA. This makes sense if you know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a> which, for the purposes of this article, can be simplified to “DNA makes RNA, and RNA makes protein”.  Making DNA is a known, stable process in 3 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Create:</strong> Synthesize a small number of copies of the desired DNA, somehow. There are vendors for this sort of thing such as <a href="https://twistbioscience.com/">Twist Bioscience</a> just down the street from my apartment when I lived in San Francisco.</li>
  <li><strong>Copy:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Insert this DNA into innocent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli">E. coli bacteria</a> by means of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophoresis">electrophoresis</a>, i.e. zapping them.</li>
      <li>Put those bacteria into a stainless steel growth chamber full of nutrients and let them multiply for four days.</li>
      <li>Drain the vat, kill the bacteria, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_extraction">extract the DNA</a>. Depending on growth chamber volume, this may take one week or longer.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Perform several tests to confirm that the DNA you got is the DNA you wanted. There’s no need for me to explain how testing for the presence of specific DNA sequences works, y’all learned that nine months ago when you did your reading about how COVID-19 tests work.</li>
</ol>

<p>This yields grams of DNA and what is needed are bags of mRNA. mRNA is the most discussed ingredient of the vaccine for three reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>mRNA is the active ingredient of the vaccine.</li>
  <li>It is the first time an mRNA vaccine has been approved and is now produced at scale.</li>
  <li>The skills to produce mRNA at scale and the associated supply chain are new.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>
The conversion process from DNA to mRNA in living cells is well understood. However, doing it at scale, in a factory, and with a long shelf-life is still an area of development. To multiply the DNA we utilized E.coli and this tiny organism comes with all components needed for the job. The same process does not work for making mRNA for the vaccine. Instead, the DNA gets combined with nucleotides, polymerase, and special enzymes that protect the mRNA.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleotide">Nucleotides</a> are the raw building blocks for the mRNA.</li>
  <li>RNA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase">Polymerases</a> read DNA and translate it to mRNA using these nucleotides.</li>
  <li>Enzymes add a cap and a tail to the mRNA to protect it.</li>
</ul>

<p>The third part, protecting the mRNA, is the crux of the matter. mRNA is not very stable especially at the ends. If you lose the first and last word of a sentence its meaning may be lost entirely. The same can happen here and the vaccine would not work anymore. To protect the beginning of the mRNA statement, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-prime_cap">5’ cap</a> is added using a mRNA Cap 2′-O-Methyltransferase and the vaccinia capping enzyme (VCE). (The “vaccinia” in the name has nothing to do with vaccines.) To protect the end of the mRNA we add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyadenylation">poly(A) tail</a> to the message using a Poly(A)Polymerase. New England Biolabs’ online store lists prices for <a href="https://www.neb.com/products/m0366-mrna-cap2-o-methyltransferase">mRNA Cap</a>, <a href="https://www.neb.com/products/m2080-vaccinia-capping-system">VCE</a>, and <a href="https://www.neb.com/products/m0276-ecoli-poly-a-polymerase">Poly(A)Polymerase</a>.</p>

<p>All ingredients of the vaccine besides the mRNA are “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excipient">excipients</a>”, substances whose purpose is somehow related to getting the vaccine from the factory into a human cell.</p>

<h2 id="lipids">Lipids</h2>

<p>Lipids are fatty molecules. Each of the two vaccines contains four types of lipid. Cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, an ionizable cationic lipid, and PEGylated phospholipds. In the vaccine, these lipids form a capsule around the RNA called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_lipid_nanoparticle">lipid nanoparticle</a> (LNP) that protects it from the hostile environment until it is inside a human cell.</p>

<p>Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use the same structural components which are already approved in many drugs.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DSPC</strong>, full name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distearoylphosphatidylcholine">Distearoylphosphatidylcholine</a> or 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, is the main component of the lipid bilayer that protects the mRNA.</li>
  <li><strong>Cholesterol</strong> is natural to the human body. In the vaccine it is used to achieve optimal liposome formation and structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other two ingredients are used to optimize the LNPs for its cargo and the delivery<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> and are novel or uncommon in drug formulation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cationic</strong>, or positively charged, lipids bind to and help stabilize the negatively charged mRNA during assembly. Once inside the cell, the cell’s different pH environment triggers the release of mRNA.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Pfizer-BioNTech uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALC-0315">ALC-3015</a> patented by Acuitas Therapeutics, Inc.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Moderna has a proprietary molecule called Lipid SM-102. Or maybe it isn’t that proprietary, because it might be covered by a patent owned by Arbutus Biopharma.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> Moderna’s <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/sites/default/files/mRNA-1273-P301-Protocol.pdf">Phase 3 Clinical Study Protocol</a> defines it as “heptadecan-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl) (6-oxo-6-(undecyloxy)hexyl)amino)octanoate” and calls it a “proprietary ionizable lipid”. In 2018, Moderna researchers published <a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/pdfExtended/S1525-0016(18)30118-7">a Cell paper</a> proposing 10 new lipids, of which SM-102 is number 8, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/1stClef/status/1306653592691113986">this tweet</a>. The paper has a “synthesis” section and supplementary materials which somebody more knowledgeable about such things than I might be able to reproduce. Everyone else will have to purchase it, for example from <a href="https://organixinc.com/lipids/atx001-crrdc-b9dnh-phs3e">Organix Inc at $5,000/100mg</a>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>PEGylated phospholipids</strong> help stabilize the LNP and protect it from early detection by our immune system. It ensures the LNPs and thus the mRNA can reach its target.
    <ul>
      <li>Pfizer-BioNTech uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALC-0159">ALC-0159</a>.</li>
      <li>Moderna uses DMG-PEG 2000 or …</li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div>

<p>Most of the 300,000 + plant species have leaves, and the function of all of them is to perform photosynthesis.&nbsp; They are the ultimate source for all of the oxygen and food for the rest of the food chain and help regulate the global carbon and water cycles.&nbsp; They are also nutrition superstars.&nbsp; To figure out why greens are good for you and whether all leaves are equal in this regard, we need to take quick look at global leaf structural variability and broad evolutionary patterns in the species that make their way onto our tables.<span id="more-937"></span></p>

<p>Across the global flora leaves are extraordinarily structurally variable.&nbsp; They vary in size from a tiny duckweed leaf to a huge palm frond, and in thickness from a thin lettuce leaf to a thick leaf of a succulent aloe or pine needle.&nbsp; We don’t fully understand yet why leaves are so structurally variable across species. My colleagues and I <a title="Osnas et al. Science 2013" href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2013/03/27/science.1231574" target="_blank">recently published a paper</a> demonstrating that across the global flora leaf nutrient concentrations and physiological rates of maximum photosynthetic carbon gain and respiratory carbon loss change in proportion to leaf area more strongly than they change in proportion to leaf mass.&nbsp; We demonstrate the consequences of this area-proportionality of leaf traits for how we measure, analyze and use these leaf traits in models of the global carbon cycle.</p>

<p>Of relevance here, however, is that the high area-proportionality of leaf traits simply means that the parts of the leaf that are most beneficial for humans (digestible protein, vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, digestible fiber) are likely proportional in many species to the leaf’s photosynthetic apparatus, which is clustered in a relatively thin band of cells beneath the epidermis (see image). &nbsp;Adding thickness to a leaf doesn’t necessarily add nutritious tissue and might instead add mostly fibrous, indigestible structural material (see agave photo below). &nbsp;This does not mean that the thinner the leaf, the more nutritious it is; this is just a general tendency across all plants. &nbsp;Scaled up to the level of the whole plant, though, we see that leaves have the highest ratio of nutritious material (digestible protein, vitamins and minerals, fiber) to indigestible material (for most species). &nbsp;Some fruits probably come close, but fruit is rare, and leaves are abundant.</p>

<p>One of the key variables modulating area- vs mass-proportionality of leaf traits is leaf mass per unit leaf area (LMA), which increases with leaf thickness and density. &nbsp;Lettuce leaves have very low LMA, pine needles and holly leaves have high LMA.&nbsp; Although there is very little data on the subject, the leaves that we eat tend to fall on the low end of the global LMA spectrum, shown here for a global dataset of more than 2500 wild species.</p>

<p>Leaf tenderness—reducing LMA–is certainly a trait that has undergone selection in cultivated varieties.&nbsp; In species with varietals that have undergone selection on different structures, the varieties in which selection has been directed at the leaves invariably have more tender, less bitter, and larger leaves than do varieties in which selection has been directed at different structures, such as the roots.&nbsp; For example, chard has larger and more tender greens than do beets (both <i>Beta vulgaris</i>, Caryophyllales); celery grown for stalks and leaves is more tender than the aboveground portion of the celery varietal grown for its root (both <i>Apium graveolens</i>, Apiales); and Siberian kale varieties have more tender leaves than do rutabaga varieties (both <i>Brassica napus</i>, Brassicales).</p>

<p>Kale and collards, grown for their leaves, have leaves that are more tender than those of conspecific <i>Brassica oleracea</i> grown primarily for other structures:&nbsp; kohlrabi, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts (and for those of you keeping track at home, in the <a title="The extraordinary diversity of Brassica&nbsp;oleracea" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/the-extraordinary-diversity-of-brassica-oleracea/" target="_blank"><i>B. oleracea</i></a>, <a title="Thanksgiving turnips and the diversity of the genus&nbsp;Brassica" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/598/" target="_blank"><i>Brassica</i></a>, and<a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/" target="_blank"> Brassicaceae posts</a>,<i> </i>I erroneously lumped all kales into <i>Brassica oleracea</i>—<a title="Brassica napus kales" href="http://seedambassadors.org/Mainpages/still/napuskale/napuskale.htm" target="_blank">some of them are <i>B. napus</i></a>, including my favorite variety: Red Russian kale).&nbsp; Don’t dare throw out your beet, celeriac, rutabaga or <i>B. oleracea </i>greens, though, if you’re lucky enough to get them—they need a bit more cooking or tenderizing, but they’re still delicious and nutritious.&nbsp; At least put your celery root greens in stock.&nbsp; LMA also varies within a varietal based on growing conditions.&nbsp; Leaves grown in sun have higher LMA than leaves grown in shade.&nbsp; The impact of growing conditions within species, however, will have to wait for another time.</p>
<p>LMA is hardly the only determinant of which species make it onto our plates.&nbsp; Otherwise, we’d have our pick of hundreds of species on the low-LMA end of the global curve.&nbsp; Instead, we can put most of our greens species on a fairly legible phylogenetic tree in need of only a few disclaimer paragraphs of omissions.</p>

<p>Like many phylogenetic trees of more than a handful of species, this tree of our “greens species” commits sins of both commission and omission in the interest of producing a readable image. Omission because the species on the tree do not comprise an exhaustive list of species whose leaves people around the globe regularly consume. Commission because I included a few unusual items, such as sweet potato leaves (<i>Ipomoea</i>, Solanales), and pea shoots (Fabales), and a few taxa are single representatives of a large group.&nbsp; Sister to sweet potato on the tree, for example, is the entire family Lamiaceae, the mints.</p>

<p>We mostly use leaves from the mints as herbs and spices:&nbsp; peppermint and spearmint (<i>Mentha </i>sp.), basil (<i>Ocimum</i> sp.), thyme (<i>Thymus</i> sp.), oregano and marjoram (<i>Origanum</i> sp.), rosemary (<i>Rosmarinus</i> sp.), lemon balm (<i>Melissa</i> sp.), lavender (<i>Lavandula</i> sp.), shiso (<i>Perilla frutescens</i>), bee balm (<i>Monarda</i> sp.), and mountain mint (<i>Pycnanthemum</i> sp.).&nbsp; Also, scallions are the only representatives on the tree from the genus <i>Allium</i> in the monocot order Asparagles, which includes many edible species, the leaves of some of which are regularly employed:&nbsp; garlic, <a title="A look at&nbsp;leeks" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/a-look-at-leeks/" target="_blank">leeks</a>, ramps, and onions.</p>
<p>I included some of the more exotic greens in the greens tree both to avoid rousing the ire of their champions and because I was a bit shocked that some large, charismatic orders that feature prominently in the diet at large are reduced to single entries on the greens tree or are gone altogether, meaning we primarily use roots, stems, fruits or seeds from these clades, not leaves.&nbsp; Granted, this “greens tree” is mostly a tree of “greens obtained from Whole Foods and summer farmer’s markets in the continental United States.”</p>

<p>I’ve included a few weedy, wild things that I pick regularly and that one can actually occasionally pay money for at the farmer’s market:&nbsp; nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>, Rosales), chickweed (<i>Stellaria media</i>, Caryophyllales), miner’s lettuce (<i>Claytonia perfoliata</i>, Caryophyllales), purslane (<i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, Caryophyllales), and dandelion (<i>Taraxacum officinale</i>, Asterales).&nbsp; Largely, however, I’ve omitted species whose leaves are technically edible, at least in small doses at some point in their life cycle, but that are reduced to curiosities at the modern American table, not staples.&nbsp; Therefore, please hold your fire if you’re shaking your fist at the tree because it omits the young beech (<i>Fagus grandifolia</i>, Fagales), sassafras (<i>Sassafras albidum</i>, Laureles), or violet (<i>Viola odorata</i>, Malpighiales) leaves you like to nibble on when you hike east of the Mississippi. Fern fiddlehead (assorted Polypodiales) enthusiasts, too, forgive me. &nbsp;We use some leaves to prepare other food: &nbsp;banana leaves and corn husks to wrap&nbsp;<em>tamales</em>, and palm fronds and fig leaves to wrap fish for baking or grilling. &nbsp;I salute these leaves, but they’re not on the tree. &nbsp;Some are gone simply because I didn’t have room, such as many of the <a title="The most political vegetables: A whirlwind tour of the edible&nbsp;crucifers" href="https://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/the-most-political-vegetables-a-whirlwind-tour-of-the-edible-crucifers/">crucifer greens</a>, and asterids chrysanthemum, borage and comfrey (although those last two haven’t been placed to order yet and would therefore have been difficult to place within the asterids anyway).</p>

<h2><span id="Introduction"></span>Introduction<span></span></h2>



<div><p>Single board computers aren’t anything new infact they have existed since 1976 when the dyna-micro was released based on the Intel C8080A CPU. </p><p>Since then they have been used in many embedded applications from digital signage to satellite and aerospace applications, in 2012 the Raspberry Pi foundation released the Raspberry Pi Model B which redefined the SBC standard with many manufacturers producing boards based on the Raspberry Pi form factors and GPIO standard ever since but what was the prior standard? </p></div>



<div><p>Back in 1987 a company called Ampro released an SBC which would later define a standard known as PC/104 (or PC104) in 1992. In 1997 the PC/104-plus form factor was developed which included PCI and in 2008 the PC/104-Express was the final revision including a PCI-Express Bus. </p><p>The PC-104 is based on the IBM XT bus which includes 64 pins and the IBM AT bus which includes 40 pins hence the name PC/104. </p></div>



<p>The PC/104 pin out can be found here: <a href="http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_PC104_Pinout.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_PC104_Pinout.html</a></p>



<p>The PC/104 standard is designed to be stack-able with different add on cards available. </p>



<div><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201%201'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kay_Roemer/publication/215619137/figure/fig2/AS:667826658480133@1536233691415/The-RoBM-2-board-replaces-the-Connector-Board-2-in-the-PC104-stack.ppm" alt="The RoBM 2 board replaces the Connector Board [2] in the PC104 stack." data-old-src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kay_Roemer/publication/215619137/figure/fig2/AS:667826658480133@1536233691415/The-RoBM-2-board-replaces-the-Connector-Board-2-in-the-PC104-stack.ppm" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Stacked PC/104 cards (Image from  https://www.researchgate.net/)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p> The PC/104 standard includes 3 form factors:</p>



<ul><li>104<ul><li>3.550″ x 3.775″</li></ul></li><li>EBX<ul><li>5.75″ x 8″</li></ul></li><li>EPIC<ul><li>6.5″ x 4.5″</li></ul></li></ul>



<div><p>All of the above standards are electrically and physically compatible with one another, the only difference is the physical board size although the mounting holes and ports align. </p><p>More history on the PC/104 can be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC/104#History_and_standardization">Wikipedia here.</a> Lets have a look at a PC/104 compatible board. </p></div>

<div><p>The HannStar EMC-3412 is a PC104 compatible SBC produced sometime between 2001 and 2005, the board features a PC133 SODIMM slot, a USB header, PS/2 connector, RS232 Male and RS232 Female, VGA Video, CF and IDE. A NSC Geode GX1S@300Mhz and a single Realtek 100Mb NIC. </p><p>Whilst I purchase this board brand new with 128MB of RAM I’ve struggled to find much information on the device. I decided to review it as if it was any other SBC. </p><p>I installed Debian 8 onto a 4GB Microdrive using Virtualbox with my <a href="https://amzn.to/2MR7SGi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">BENFEI 4in1 USB USB-C to SD Micro SD MS CF Card Reader </a>as the board does not boot from USB and I did not have a IDE optical drive to hand. Debian 8 is the final release of Debian to support i586 processors. The install ran smoothly and the board booted without issue from the MicroDrive fitted in its CF card slot.</p><p>The board is powered using a standard Molex 4 pin connector although it appears that it only uses the 5v pins.

<h2><span id="Conclusion"></span>Conclusion <span></span></h2>



<p>The Hannstar EMC-3412 was fun to play with and would likely make a great Retro Gaming machine although I can’t think of any real useful use cases for the board in 2021. I purchased this new on ebay and the seller still has a fair few for sale priced at £30 with make offer, I made a very low offer and it was accepted. If you’d like to try one out for yourself you can buy one <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-SINGLE-BOARD-COMPUTER-ECM-3412-P-N-1907341200/164283322681?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&amp;_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649">here</a>. </p>



<div><p>The PC/104 standard is still widely used in embedded computing with lots of manufacturers producing new boards with modern CPU’s however they are very expensive and designed for very specific applications. </p><p>If you would like to see more covered on retro SBC’s leave a comment below.  </p></div>

<p><span>This narrative is part of a series called ‘</span><a title="" href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/sustainability-transitions/drivers-of-change/about-the-series" target="_self">Narratives for change</a><span>’ published by the EEA</span></p>
<h2>Growth and narratives for change</h2>
<p>The world is undergoing rapid change. Numerous drivers of change interact in a highly complex interplay of human needs, desires, activities and technologies (EEA, 2020) and contribute to the Great Acceleration in human consumption and environmental degradation. Human civilisation is currently profoundly unsustainable.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>These dynamics have to change. Governments, scientists and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) worldwide are coming together to try to devise new ideas, policies, blueprints and narratives. This narrative is part of a series called ‘Narratives for change’ published by the EEA. It presents alternative perspectives on economic growth and human progress and explores the diversity of ideas needed to transform our society towards sustainability goals and fulfil the ambitions of the European Green Deal.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>By building on the insights of EEA reports on drivers of change and sustainability transitions (EEA, 2017, 2019a, 2019b, 2020), this briefing explores alternative ideas about growth and progress with the aim of broadening the sustainability debate. This comes at a crucial time for the EU, which faces urgent challenges and opportunities associated with fundamental change. The EU has achieved unprecedented levels of prosperity and well-being in recent decades, and its social, health and environmental standards rank among the highest in the world (EEA, 2019c).<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Maintaining this position does not have to depend on economic growth. Could the European Green Deal, for example, become a catalyst for EU citizens to create a society that consumes less and grows in other than material dimensions?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As global decoupling of economic growth and resource consumption is not happening, real creativity is called for: how can society develop and grow in quality (e.g. purpose, solidarity, empathy), rather than in quantity (e.g. material standards of living), in a more equitable way? What are we willing to renounce in order to meet our sustainability ambitions?</span></p>

<h2>Global-scale, long-lasting and absolute decoupling may not be possible</h2>
<p>Globally, growth has not been decoupled from resource consumption and environmental pressures and is not likely to become so (Parrique et al., 2019; Hickel and Kallis, 2020; Wiedmann et al., 2020). The global material footprint, gross domestic product (GDP) and greenhouse gases emissions have increased rapidly over time, and strongly correlate (Figure 1). While population growth was the leading cause of increasing consumption from 1970 to 2000, the emergence of a global affluent middle class has been the stronger driver since the turn of the century (Panel, 2019; Wiedmann et al., 2020). Furthermore, technological development has so far been associated with increased consumption rather than the reverse.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Europe consumes more and contributes more to environmental degradation than other regions, and Europe’s prospects of reaching its environmental policy objectives for 2020, 2030 and 2050 are poor (EEA, 2019c). Several of Europe’s environmental footprints exceed the planetary boundaries (Sala et al., 2020; EEA/FOEN, 2020).</span></p>

<p>High-level policies (e.g. the European Green Deal and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs) propose decoupling of economic growth and resource use as a solution. However, scientific debates on the possibility of decoupling date back to the 19th century and there is still no consensus. Recent studies, such as Hickel and Kallis (2020) and Parrique et al. (2019), find no evidence of absolute decoupling between growth and environmental degradation having taken place on a global scale.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>While some EU countries achieved a reduction in some forms of pollution between 1995 and the mid-2010s (e.g. acidification, eutrophication, greenhouse gas emissions), the decoupling between growth and environmental footprints (e.g. water, materials, energy and greenhouse gases) associated with EU consumption patterns is often relative and varies between countries (Sanyé-Mengual et al., 2019; NTNU, 2020).<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Such changes are associated with a combination of factors (see EEA, 2020). These include structural economic change, which led to the outsourcing of significant shares of energy-intensive activities to non-EU countries and the financialisation of EU economies (Kovacic et al., 2018). An absolute reduction of environmental pressures and impacts would require <b>fundamental</b> transformations to a different type of economy and society — instead of <b>incremental</b> efficiency gains within established production and consumption systems.</p>

<h2>100 % circularity is impossible</h2>
<p>If economic growth cannot be decoupled from resource use, can the use of existing resources be extended within the economy? Circular economy policies aim to improve waste management and induce responsible production and consumption cultures. The circular economy, however, may not deliver the transformation to sustainability if circularity measures fuel a growth strategy that leads to increased material consumption. An economy downsized to match the material input that it can recycle would be a very slow economy (Kovacic et al., 2019a).<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The concept of ‘circular economy’ suggests that material resources could be increasingly sourced from within the economy, reducing environmental impact by increasing the reuse and recycling of materials. However, this socio-technical ‘imaginary’ has a limited potential for sustainability, as revealed by biophysical analysis (Kovacic et al., 2019a). In fact, at the scale of the whole economy only around 12% of the material input was being recycled in the EU-27 in 2019 (Eurostat, 2020). Given current product design and waste management technologies, recycling rates of materials such as plastics, paper, glass and metals can —&nbsp;and should — be greatly increased in&nbsp; line with EU policy ambitions. However, overall, recyclable material remains a meagre portion of material throughput.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The low potential for circularity is because a very large share of primary material throughput is composed of (1) energy carriers, which are degraded through use as explained by the laws of thermodynamics and cannot be recycled, and (2) construction materials, which are added to the building stock, which is recycled over much longer periods (Figure 2). This can be interpreted in the light of Tainter’s (1988) study of the collapse of complex societies: as complexity increases, there are diminishing marginal returns on improvements in problem-solving; hence, improvements at the local scale have a very small impact on the overall system.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, high throughput and low rates of recycling appear to be conditions for high productivity (Hall and Klitgaard, 2012). Advanced societies require high throughputs of energy and materials to maintain their organisational complexity (Tainter and Patzek, 2012). What these insights point to is the need to rethink and reframe societal notions of progress in broader terms than consumption.</span></p>

<h2>Avenues for rethinking growth and progress</h2>
<p>Historically, modern states embraced economic thought that focused on economic growth and conceptualised social and environmental problems as externalities. As a result, growth is culturally, politically and institutionally ingrained. Worldwide, the legitimacy of governments cannot be separated from their ability to deliver economic growth and provide employment.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>However, recent decades have seen a variety of initiatives to ‘rethink economics’ (including the movement with that name, Rethinking Economics, 2020) and develop theoretical perspectives that combine attention to the legitimate needs of the present human population with the need for a transformation to a sustainable future. Ecomodernist thought&nbsp;<sup>[<a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/sustainability-transitions/drivers-of-change/growth-without-economic-growth/#footnotes" target="_self" title="">2</a>]</sup>&nbsp;promotes ‘green growth’ through scientific and technological progress.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Other scholarly fields and social movements went beyond the idea of green growth (Wiedmann et al., 2020) and proposed concepts like “doughnut economics” (Raworth, 2017) and “degrowth” (Demaria et al., 2013), which are outlined in Table 1.</span></p>

  <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>One of the less known Vim features is “abbreviations”. It’s something similar to mapping, but it has a different purpose.</p>
<p>Abbreviations are a very flexible and really powerful tool.</p>
<p>For simplicity, this post will cover only the Insert mode abbreviations.
This is Part 1 of the post. Part 2 will be published soon.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="basic-use-of-abbreviations">Basic use of abbreviations</h2>
<p><strong>The command</strong><br>
The command for Insert mode abbreviations looks like this:</p>
<p><code>:iabbrev [&lt;expr&gt;] [&lt;buffer&gt;] {abbreviation} {expansion}</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;expr&gt;</code> -  stands for Vimscript expression to create the expansion.</li>
<li><code>&lt;buffer&gt;</code> -  means that it only applies to the current buffer.</li>
<li><code>{abbreviation}</code> -  is the thing you type, or your “trigger”</li>
<li><code>{expansion}</code> - is your final outcome</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything that’s inside a [] is optional.</p>
<p><strong>Correcting typos</strong><br>
Let’s start with the simple commands first.</p>
<p>Run this command in your Vim: <code>:iabbrev teh the</code>. Now enter the Insert mode and type <code>teh end</code>.
As soon as you hit <kbd>Space</kbd> after typing the <code>teh</code>, Vim will replace it with <code>the</code>.</p>
<p>You probably have a few or more words which you misspell quite often. This is a good way to solve that problem.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding commonly used phrases</strong><br>
Of course, you can store all of your abbreviations in your <code>.vimrc</code> file. For example:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev @@ hi@jovica.org
iabbrev ccc Copyright 2020 Jovica Ilic, all rights reserved.
</code></pre><p>You’re coding in C? How about:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev #i #include
iabbrev #d #define
</code></pre><p>Now, let’s create one abbreviation with a Vimscript expression. We can use <code>strftime()</code> function.
If you run this command in Vim: <code>:put =strftime('%c')</code>, you’ll insert the current date and time in your current buffer.</p>
<p>So, we can do something like this with an abbreviation:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev &lt;expr&gt; ddd strftime('%c')
</code></pre><p>Save your <code>.vimrc</code>, open Vim and try them out. Cool, ha? :)</p>
<p>Basic text expanding and correcting spelling mistakes are just the tip of the iceberg. You can use abbreviations to generate entire code snippets.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="advanced-use-of-abbreviations">Advanced use of abbreviations</h2>
<p>Let’s create an abbreviation for generating a C style comment:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev cc /*&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;/&lt;Up&gt;
</code></pre><p>Basically, after you type <code>cc</code> in Insert mode and hit <kbd>Space</kbd>, a code snippet like this is generated:</p>
<p>In the expression above, we basically told Vim to type <code>/*</code> then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice(<code>&lt;CR&gt;</code>), type <code>/</code> and hit the <kbd>↑</kbd> key.</p>
<p>If you have to write Java code for a living, you could add something like this to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev psvm public static void main(String[] args){&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;
</code></pre><p>So every time you type <code>psvm</code> and hit <kbd>Space</kbd>, you get a snippet like:</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args){

}
</code></pre><p><strong>File-type specific abbreviations</strong><br>
What if you want to use the same abbreviation for multiple programming languages? This is possible, as you can use abbreviations in auto commands. This way, you can create file-type specific abbreviations.</p>
<p>Let’s say we want to make one abbreviation for printing a string in Python and Java.</p>
<pre><code>"python
autocmd Filetype python :iabbrev ppp print("");&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;
"java
autocmd FileType java :iabbrev ppp System.out.println("");&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;&lt;left&gt;
</code></pre><p>With these lines in your <code>.vimrc</code>, you can now hit <code>ppp</code> and <kbd>Space</kbd>, and depending on the file type, you’ll insert an appropriate snippet for printing a string!</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at another, more complex example:</p>
<pre><code>autocmd FileType c iabbrev start #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \int main() {
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \  printf("hello\n");
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \  return 0;
                                     \&lt;CR&gt;
                                     \}
</code></pre><p>So if you open a <code>.c</code> file, type <code>start</code> and hit <kbd>Space</kbd>, you’ll get the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;

int main() {
      printf("hello\n");
        return 0;

}
</code></pre><p>This is pretty cool. But all these “Enters” and other keys we need to simulate make these expressions a bit overwhelming. There’s a better way!</p>
<p><strong>Vim commands in abbreviations</strong><br>
Let’s get back to the previous abbreviation we defined for Java:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev psvm public static void main(String[] args){&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;Up&gt;
</code></pre><p>We can achieve the same result with the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev psvm public static void main(String[] args){&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;esc&gt;O
</code></pre><p>What happens here? Let’s see:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>psvm</code> - our “trigger” expression</li>
<li><code>public static void main(String[] args){</code> - first part of the string to insert</li>
<li><code>&lt;CR&gt;</code> - hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> once</li>
<li><code>}</code> - second part of the string to insert</li>
<li><code>&lt;esc&gt;</code> - hitting <kbd>Esc</kbd> once and entering the Normal mode</li>
<li><code>O</code> - Normal mode command, which puts you in Insert mode, one line above your current line</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of simulating every single keystroke, we can “hit” <kbd>Esc</kbd> to go to Normal mode. From there, we can run any command we want :)</p>
<p>How about creating a <em>for loop</em>, and placing our cursor in Insert mode, exactly where the cursor should be?</p>
<p>Here’s a simple C-style loop sample:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="C"><span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span><span>=</span><span>1</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>&lt;=</span><span>NUM</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>We could create an abbreviation like this:</p>
<pre><code>iabbrev forl for (i=1; i&lt;=NUM; i++) {&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;Esc&gt;?NUM&lt;CR&gt;cw
</code></pre><p>What happens here:</p>
<ul>
<li>At first, we insert the first part of the string</li>
<li>Then we hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice, and insert the second part of the string (<code>}</code>)</li>
<li>After that, we hit <kbd>Esc</kbd></li>
<li>Then we perform a search backwards for string <code>NUM</code>, by “hitting” <code>?NUM</code> and <kbd>Enter</kbd></li>
<li>Lastly, we run the <code>cw</code> command which stands for “change word”. This way we delete the string <code>NUM</code> and stay in the Insert mode, ready to type a desired value.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2 id="theres-more">There’s more</h2>
<p>There’s much more to be said about abbreviations.</p>
<p>Here are just a few interesting bits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just like mappings, abbreviations can be local to a buffer.</li>
<li>Abbreviations are never recursive.</li>
<li>Abbreviations can be mapped.</li>
<li>To avoid the abbreviation in Insert mode, you can hit Ctrl-v before the character that would trigger the abbreviation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll cover things like these in the upcoming, Part 2, of this post.<br>
Also, abbreviations are something I’ll definitely cover in the new edition of <a href="https://jovicailic.org/mastering-vim-quickly/">Mastering Vim Quickly: From WTF to OMG in no time</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Regularly, I discover myself thinking <em>"wow, that's so simple I can build this in a weekend"</em>. My rational brain kicks in at some point: <em>"Waaaaiiit a second, if it's so simple, why am I not seeing this done a million times?"</em>. Here I usually start better scoping and either find the answer to my question.</p><p>Often, my developer mind insists on "it's actually just two API endpoints and then I could do this and that". And often this holds true for the core functionality. If some <a href="https://peterthaleikis.com/business-idea-validation/">basic validation</a> gives a green light for working on it from a commercial perspective, I still need to consider the tech stack and marketing approach, as <a href="https://roadmap.sh/guides/why-build-it-and-they-will-come-wont-work-anymore">building alone doesn't do it</a>.</p><p>I'm not super fixed on the approach, my main goal is usually to keep long term overhead low. Laravel is my go-to solution for anything backend-heavy, but its power comes at a complexity cost too. For two little API endpoints used in, for example, a browser extension is a bit of an overkill.</p><p>Function as a service sounds like a great step towards "just having a few API endpoints". AWS Lambda is the name everyone is having in mind here. But any gains from simplicity are eaten up by AWS complexity. If you are new to AWS (Lambda), it easily takes you double or more time to get it running as you spend building the little lean function in the first place. This doesn't go well with the plan to "just chuck this out over the weekend".</p><h2 id="enter%3A-faasd">Enter: faasd <a href="#enter%3A-faasd">#</a></h2><p>Function as a Service should be easy. Here comes <a href="https://www.openfaas.com/blog/introducing-faasd/">faasd</a> into play. It's a self-hosted alternative to run functions. It allows you to run a simple copy &amp; paste installer script on your machine getting it up and running. It takes less than ten minutes to get to work. It's production-ready and helps to remove the learning curve involved with Kubernetes and co.</p><blockquote><p>faasd is a self-hosted alternative to AWS Lambda to run functions. Production-ready within minutes ⏲️</p></blockquote><p>Once you have deployed your faasd instance, it's a matter of one command to push your function into production. From there it's up to you what you like to build. I catch myself breaking up the structure of larger applications in functions. It builds the container, publishes, and deploys your function code ready-to-use in seconds. To run this you will need the <a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faas-cli">FaaS CLI</a>. Again this is installed in under one minute thanks to copy and paste that just works.</p><p>Found a great library but it's written in the "wrong" language? Thanks to the flexibility, you can also jump between programming languages easily. I use a mix of nodejs, PHP, and Python by now.</p><blockquote><p>With functions you libraries aren't in the <em>wrong</em> language anymore.</p></blockquote><p>This helps to truly break up large applications into functional parts using the best tool for you. You can get a rich list of the official templates by running:</p><pre><code>$ faas-cli template store list<p>NAME                     SOURCE             DESCRIPTION<br>csharp                   openfaas           Classic C<br>dockerfile               openfaas           Classic Dockerfile template<br>go                       openfaas           Classic Golang template<br>java8                    openfaas           Java <span>8</span> template<br>java11                   openfaas           Java <span>11</span> template<br>java11-vert-x            openfaas           Java <span>11</span> Vert.x template<br>node12                   openfaas           HTTP-based Node <span>12</span> template<br>node                     openfaas           Classic NodeJS <span>8</span> template<br>php7                     openfaas           Classic PHP <span>7</span> template<br>python                   openfaas           Classic Python <span>2.7</span> template<br>python3                  openfaas           Classic Python <span>3.6</span> template<br>python3-dlrs             intel              Deep Learning Reference Stack v0.4 <span>for</span> ML workloads<br>ruby                     openfaas           Classic Ruby <span>2.5</span> template<br>ruby-http                openfaas           Ruby <span>2.4</span> HTTP template<br>python27-flask           openfaas           Python <span>2.7</span> Flask template<br>python3-flask            openfaas           Python <span>3.7</span> Flask template<br>python3-flask-debian     openfaas           Python <span>3.7</span> Flask template based on Debian<br>python3-http             openfaas           Python <span>3.7</span> with Flask and HTTP<br>python3-http-debian      openfaas           Python <span>3.7</span> with Flask and HTTP based on Debian<br>golang-http              openfaas           Golang HTTP template<br>golang-middleware        openfaas           Golang Middleware template<br>python3-debian           openfaas           Python <span>3</span> Debian template<br>powershell-template      openfaas-incubator Powershell Core Ubuntu:16.04 template<br>powershell-http-template openfaas-incubator Powershell Core HTTP Ubuntu:16.04 template<br>rust                     booyaa             Rust template<br>crystal                  tpei               Crystal template<br>csharp-httprequest       distantcam         C<br>csharp-kestrel           burtonr            C<br>vertx-native             pmlopes            Eclipse Vert.x native image template<br>swift                    affix              Swift <span>4.2</span> Template<br>lua53                    affix              Lua <span>5.3</span> Template<br>vala                     affix              Vala Template<br>vala-http                affix              Non-Forking Vala Template<br>quarkus-native           pmlopes            Quarkus.io native image template<br>perl-alpine              tmiklas            Perl language template based on Alpine image<br>crystal-http             koffeinfrei        Crystal HTTP template<br>rust-http                openfaas-incubator Rust HTTP template<br>bash-streaming           openfaas-incubator Bash Streaming template<br>cobol                    devries            COBOL Template</p></code></pre><p>There are also inofficial templates you can find with a bit of research on GitHub.</p><p>Start with a new function by running:</p><pre><code>faas-cli new function-name --lang node12</code></pre><p>This creates a function based on the node12 template.

      <p>I recently started learning the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust programming language</a> by going through <em>"<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">the book</a>"</em>, which does a phenomenal job of explaining the language basics.</p>
<p>After working through the book’s main content I got started with my first non-trivial, real-world application.
But I soon found myself faced with a question I didn’t yet feel well-equipped to handle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“How should you structure error handling in a mature rust application?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article describes my journey of discovering the answer to this question.
I will try to explain the pattern I’ve settled on together with example code showing its implementation, in the hope that other newcomers may have an easier time getting started.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>While the book goes through the basics of error handling, including use of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/">std::Result</a> type and error propagation with the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#a-shortcut-for-propagating-errors-the--operator"><code>?</code></a> operator, it largely glosses over the different patterns for using these tools in real-world applications or the trade-offs involved with different approaches. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>When I began looking into best practices, I came across quite a bit of outdated advice to use the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/failure/"><em>failure</em> crate</a>.
<em>Failure</em> had a semi-official feel to it as a result of being in the <code>rust-lang-nursery</code> namespace, but <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/failure/pull/347">it has recently been deprecated</a>.</p>
<p>There have been a number of improvements to the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html">std::error::Error</a> trait in the past two years. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
These have made <em>failure</em> less needed in general and have sparked a number of more modern libraries taking advantage of these improvements to offer better ergonomics.</p>
<p>After reading through quite a lot of historical context and evaluating a number of libraries, I’ve now settled on a (largely library-agnostic) pattern for structuring errors, which I implement using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/anyhow">anyhow</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/thiserror">thiserror</a> crates. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The rest of this article will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduce a relatively trivial word-counting application to explore and explain the problem space.</li>
<li>Explain why applications and libraries should use different error-handling patterns.</li>
<li>Demonstrate how to apply these patterns using <code>anyhow</code> and <code>thiserror</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="counting-words">Counting words</h2>
<p>Let’s introduce some example code for use throughout the rest of this article.
We’ll build a program to count the number of words in a text file, much like <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wc.1.html">wc -w</a> would do.</p>
<p>A naive implementation with basic error handling using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/">std::Result</a> might look like this:</p>

</div>
</div><p>Let’s generate an input file for our new word counter and try to run it:</p>
<pre><code>$ fortune &gt; words.txt
$ cargo run --quiet -- words.txt
50 words.txt
</code></pre><p>If you don’t have a <code>words.txt</code> however, you’ll encounter the following error:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo run --quiet -- words.txt
Error: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
</code></pre><p>This error is the result of <code>File::open()</code> returning an error in <code>main()</code>.</p>
<p>To make the example complete, let’s also <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/36f4545f2b994f054a17ac31df07e2f762c6ac24/src/wordcounter.rs#L124-L125">simulate an error</a> in the <code>read()</code> call happening under the hood inside <code>count_words()</code> <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> so we can see what that looks like:</p>
<pre><code>$ cargo run --quiet -- words.txt
Error: Custom { kind: BrokenPipe, error: "read: broken pipe" }
</code></pre><h3 id="missing-context">Missing context</h3>
<p>So what’s wrong with the above error?
While the underlying error cause (<em>“broken pipe”</em>) is made clear, we’re missing a lot of context.
We can’t tell which file could not be opened and there is no information about the sequence of events leading up to this error.</p>
<p>When you think about it, there’s a chain of errors here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>main()</code> returns an error because <code>count_words()</code> returns an error.</li>
<li><code>count_words()</code> returns an error because we run into an error iterating over <code>reader.lines()</code> (lines 14-15).</li>
<li>Iterating over <code>reader.lines()</code> errors because we injected an implementation of <code>std::io::Read</code> that fails on the first call to <code>read()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we don’t really see this reflected in the error messages above.</p>
<p>In this example the file name is an input argument for the program itself.
This makes it easy to correlate the error to the file it was trying to open.</p>
<p>Now imagine an error happening 5 calls deep inside a library within a much larger piece of software.
Without any information on the chain of events in such a case, it quickly gets very difficult to understand what might be causing the error.</p>
<h2 id="libraries-versus-applications">Libraries versus applications</h2>
<p>Earlier on I mentioned <strong>two</strong> different libraries, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/anyhow">anyhow</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/thiserror">thiserror</a> (though both are by the same author, <a href="https://rustaceans.org/search/dtolnay">dtolnay</a>).
You might be wondering why we need two separate libraries to do something as basic as dealing with errors.</p>
<p>It took me a moment to appreciate this distinction, but there’s value in approaching error handling differently between libraries and applications as they tend to have different concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Libraries should focus on <em>producing</em> meaningful, structured error types/variants.
This allows applications to easily differentiate various error cases.</li>
<li>Applications mainly <em>consume</em> errors.</li>
<li>Libraries may want to cast errors from one type to another.
An IO error should likely be wrapped by a high-level error type provided by the library.
<ul>
<li>Otherwise an IO error in library <code>foo</code> cannot be distinguished from a similar IO error in library <code>bar</code>.</li>
<li>Not doing so also requires the consumer to know library internals.
For example, is it just IO errors that might be returned? What about HTTP errors that might originate from an HTTP client internal to the library?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Libraries must be careful when changing errors or creating new errors, as these can easily introduce breaking changes for consumers.
They may produce new errors internally, but these are unlikely to require special structure and can be more easily changed at will.</li>
<li>Where libraries return errors, applications decide if and how those errors are formatted and displayed to users.</li>
<li>Applications may also want to parse and inspect errors, for example to forward them to exception tracking services or to retry operations when doing so is deemed to be safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, and I think this is quite important, <strong>libraries should always use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/">std::Result</a> together with an error type implementing <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html">std::error::Error</a> in their public APIs</strong>.
Custom result types like <a href="https://docs.rs/failure/0.1.8/failure/trait.Fail.html">failure::Fail</a> may not compose well with other parts of your user’s code and force them to learn yet another library.</p>
<h3 id="api-boundaries">API boundaries</h3>
<p>Coming back to our word counting example, imagine we want to make <code>count_words</code> available as a public library.
You wouldn’t normally do this for such a small and simple piece of code, but there can be value in making functionality available through public crates within larger projects.</p>
<p>As a demonstration, we can define boundaries in our word counter to separate this code into a library and an application part.</p>
<p>We’ll extract <code>count_words</code> into a <em>library crate</em> named <em>wordcounter</em>.
I’ll highlight relevant parts below, but if you want to skip ahead, you can find the complete <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/master/src/wordcounter.rs">src/wordcounter.rs</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>Everything outside of <code>count_words</code> is our application code.
This is going to live in a <em>binary crate</em> which we’ll call <em>rwc</em> (for <em>Rust Word Count</em> — very original, I know).
The relevant files for this are <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/master/src/main.rs">src/main.rs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/master/src/lib.rs">src/lib.rs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-library-error-type">The library error type</h3>
<p>For our <em>wordcounter</em> library, we’ll define a top-level error type called <a href="https://github.com/zoni/rust-wordcount/blob/36db340c9beaf14032c93f63afcb413f99ec3291/src/wordcounter.rs#L23-L38">WordCountError</a>.
This enum has error variants for every possible error that our library might encounter.</p>
<p>This is where <a href="https://crates.io/crates/thiserror">thiserror</a> comes into play.
While we could implement this by hand, <em>thiserror</em> allows us to avoid writing lots of boilerplate code:</p>

<p>With this error type, we can now change the signature of <code>count_words</code> as follows:</p>

</span></code></pre></div><p>Remember previously, the signature looked like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>count_words</span><span>&lt;</span><span>R</span>: <span>Read</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>input</span>: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span><span>R</span><span>)</span><span> </span>-&gt; <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>u32</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span><span> </span><span>Error</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>/* .. */</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>

It’s going to be scary for some time to come. What has been unleashed, what has been revealed, is ugly. It is what makes democracies die.</p><p>In the despair, it is easy to lose perspective. I certainly do all the time. But from time to time, I step back and try to remember where we are as a country on the arc of things.</p><p>And I see then that this is both a very dark time and, potentially, a very bright time. It's important to hold these truths together.</p><p>When I look down at the ground of the present right now, I feel depressed. If I lift my head to the horizon, I see a different picture.</p><p>This is not the chaos of the beginning of something. This is the chaos of the end of something.</p><p>Because the 40 years of this plutocratic takeover — of the ideology that said if you're torn between doing what's good for money and what's good for people, always do what’s good for money; these stories about lazy workers and welfare queens; and any number of other fraudulent tales that were meant to justify life in the Hamptons — if I allow myself to feel this way on a good day, it all actually feels like it's burning down.</p><p>And on matters of race and identity, likewise, the Trump era doesn't have the crackle of a launch. It has been a mourning. A mourning for white power. A mourning for a time when simply to be white and show up was enough. A mourning for an era in which simply to be a man, and not necessarily an especially capable one, could get you ahead of other people. A mourning for a time when you could be the default idea of an American and not have to share your toys.</p><p>We must understand that what we've been living through is backlash. Backlash. It's not the engine of history. It is the revolt against the engine of history. Then we might remember — just to pat ourselves on the back for a second — that what we are actually endeavoring to do right now is to become a kind of society that has seldom, if ever, existed in history. Which is become a majority-minority, democratic superpower.</p><p>I have a lot of love for my friends in Europe, but actually none of you all have your immigration rates and naturalization rates at a high enough level to get there anytime soon. And you all may never get there.</p><p>Look at India and China. I love India. My parents are from India. India is never going to be a nation of immigrants. It's never going to be a country of people from all the world. It can barely get unity with people just from India. China is never going to be a nation of immigrants. No shade. That's just not their history. It's not who they are. </p><p>We are falling on our face because we are jumping very high right now. We are trying to do something that does not work in theory.</p><p>To be a country of all the world, a country made up of all the countries, a country without a center of identity, without a default idea of what a human being is or looks like, without a shared religious belief, without a shared language that is people's first language at home. And what we're trying to do is awesome. It is literally awesome in the correct sense of that word.</p><div><p>And, therefore, that we are having insurrections on the Mall or four years of an autocratic attempt or racism oozing through the television and social media portals is both terrifying and a completely predictable, inevitable result of people in power exploiting these transitional anxieties for their own pecuniary gain.</p><p>And what we have to do is get smarter than those powerful people. Get more organized than them, and understand that there is a different story to tell those who mistakenly went to the Mall and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-poll/majority-of-americans-want-trump-removed-immediately-after-u-s-capitol-violence-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN29D2VG">the 12 percent of Americans who actually supported that terrorist attack</a>, and everybody else — a story to tell them about something great we are trying to do. We will actually create a country that's better for every single person. But we have to be willing to tell that story forcefully.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		


<p>You may see the following error if you try to turn on Bluetooth on FreeBSD with a recent Intel chipset:
</p>

<p>
# service bluetooth start ubt0<br>
/etc/rc.d/bluetooth: ERROR: Unable to setup Bluetooth stack for device ubt0
</p>

<p>Your <code>dmesg</code> output may also show the card being recognized, but unable to load:</p>

<p>
$ dmesg | grep bt<br>
ng_ubt: HCI command 0xfc05 timed out<br>
ubt0 on uhub0<br>
ubt0: &lt;vendor 0x8087 product 0x0a2b, class 224/1, rev 2.00/0.10, addr 1&gt; on usbus0
</p>

<p>I'll show you how to enable Bluetooth on FreeBSD, at least 12.2-RELEASE, for the following Intel chipsets:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
	<th>Name</th>
	<th>USB Vendor ID</th>
	<th>USB Product ID</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Intel Wireless Bluetooth 8260/8265</td>
	<td>0x8087</td>
	<td>0x0a2b</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Intel Wireless Bluetooth 9460/9560</td>
	<td>0x8087</td>
	<td>0x0aaa</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Intel Wireless Bluetooth 9260</td>
	<td>0x8087</td>
	<td>0x0025</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Intel AX201 Bluetooth</td>
	<td>0x8087</td>
	<td>0x0026</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Intel AX200 Bluetooth</td>
	<td>0x8087</td>
	<td>0x0029</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The above table is taken from a <a href="https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/head/sys/netgraph/bluetooth/drivers/ubt/ng_ubt_intel.c?view=markup#l70">list in <code>ng_ubt_intel.c</code></a> of Bluetooth chipsets that require firmware to be loaded with <code>iwmbtfw</code>. This article aims to document how to use the firmware loader described in <a href="https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=237083">Bug 237083</a>.</p>

<p>First, you'll need to install the firmware files needed by <code>iwmbtfw</code>, which you can do either with <code>ports</code> (<code>comms/iwmbt-firmware</code>) or <code>pkg</code>:</p>

<p># pkg install iwmbt-firmware</p>

<p>In my case, it was enough to restart, and then <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/network-bluetooth.html">start the Bluetooth service</a> <em>twice</em>:</p>

<p>
# service bluetooth start ubt0<br>
/etc/rc.d/bluetooth: ERROR: Unable to setup Bluetooth stack for device ubt0<br>
# service bluetooth start ubt0<br>
</p>

<p>I was then able to <a href="https://notebook.niklaas.eu/freebsd-bluetooth-keyboard/">successfully connect a Bluetooth keyboard</a>, after enabling authentication (<code>hccontrol -n ubt0hci write_authentication_enable 1</code>).</p>

<p>If you do have trouble, you could try to manually load the firmware to your wireless card. To do so, identify the vendor and product IDs of your wireless card. You can find this in your particular <code>dmesg</code> output (last line of sample above), or by comparing the output of <code>usbconfig</code> (see below) to the table above. In my case, my Intel Wireless 8265 card has vendor ID 0x8087 and product ID 0x0a2b.</p>

<p>You'll need your chipset's vendor and product IDs to find its USB unit and address. Take a look at the output of <code>usbconfig</code>. Here's mine:</p>

<p>
$ usbconfig<br>
ugen0.1: &lt;0x8086 XHCI root HUB&gt; at usbus0, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=SUPER (5.0Gbps) pwr=SAVE (0mA)<br>
ugen1.1: &lt;0x8086 XHCI root HUB&gt; at usbus1, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=SUPER (5.0Gbps) pwr=SAVE (0mA)<br>
ugen0.2: &lt;vendor 0x8087 product 0x0a2b&gt; at usbus0, cfg=0 md=HOST spd=FULL (12Mbps) pwr=ON (100mA)
</p>

<p>From the above output, my wireless card (<code>vendor 0x8087 product 0x0a2b</code>) is at the USB address <code>ugen0.2</code>.</p>

<p>Use the USB address for your card to load its firmware using <code>iwmbtfw</code>:</p>

<p># iwmbtfw -d ugen0.2</p>

title: Why 1-based indexing is right for Lua
date: 2021-01-16
update: 2021-01-16
-->

<p>Programming can be looked at from the lens of borders vs. no borders.</p>
<p>People who like borders do so because ideas and concepts, when properly defined in their boxes, can be more easily manipulated and fit into existing processes. This diminishes the cognitive load of working in an otherwise chaotic environment.</p>
<p>People who dislike borders do so because they want to mix and match ideas and concepts so that something new emerges out of it. They thrive in the chaos despite the higher cognitive load environment that comes with it.</p>
<p>In general, languages that are dynamically typed are more borderless than bordered, and the reverse is true for statically typed ones. Lua is dynamically typed, therefore it's a more borderless language. However, Lua is not only dynamically typed, it also has borderlessness as its core philosophy.</p>
<p>Lua asks of its users to mix and match its basic elements into something new continuously. From the way tables work to the way coroutines work, the authors made sure that it had building blocks that were flexible and useful enough that they could be shaped into whatever the user needed. <em>That</em> is the fundamental spirit of the language. It's not a batteries included language because it wants you, the user, to figure out what you need, and to build it yourself.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with 1-based indexing? People who like borders like them because they decrease cognitive load. There's a good argument to be made that because programming convention is 0-based indexes, Lua should just follow it, which would decrease the cognitive load of working with it. This is true. There's also a good argument to be made that Lua should be a more batteries included language because that makes it more useful generally. This is also true.</p>
<p>But Lua, as I just explained, is a fundamentally borderless language. Its entire way of operating constantly places the user in a very borderless and chaotic environment by design where they constantly have to mix and match its basic building blocks to do things from scratch themselves. <em>"It's taxing, it's unnecessary"</em>, the bordered thinker would say.</p>
<p>People who don't like such borderless environments will not like Lua. Maybe those people should have early signals available to them that they won't like the language? I think there's hardly a better way to do that than to break small conventions left and right, like indexing.</p>
<p>So it is my argument that 1-based indexing acts as a barrier against people who wouldn't enjoy Lua in the first place. If you're the kind of person who doesn't want to deal with the very small increased cognitive load that comes with 1-based indexing, you're likely not going to want to deal with the larger amounts of it that come with using the rest of the language.</p>
<p>I obviously don't think this happened intentionally, it's just a happy coincidence. I also don't think that language designers should break (or follow) conventions mindlessly. In this case this convention break makes sense, but it wouldn't make sense for instance to make it 2-indexed, as that obviously serves no purpose.</p>
<p>I also don't think there's anything wrong with people who don't enjoy borderlessness environments, dynamic typing or 1-based indexes in general. Everyone has different preferences. But I definitely think those people shouldn't be using Lua and that the language shouldn't be catering to them, and that's a good thing.</p>

                    <p>So you want to start your own Fediverse server? This guide will walk you through it step-by-step, including the concrete details.</p><p><strong>2021 UPDATE:</strong> I now recommend using <a href="https://soapbox.pub/">Pleroma+Soapbox</a> instead of Mastodon. This option is more flexible and easier to host. The article below teaches you how to install Mastodon, and the instructions still work if that's what you want to do.

It gained over 7000 users in its first month, and sustained attacks from the outside due to its controversial nature. User activity crashed the server and I had to scale it. This article will incorporate what I've learned.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.alexgleason.me/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-03-15-53-40.png" alt=""><figcaption>Spinster stats from fediverse.network at time of writing</figcaption></figure><h2 id="mastodon-vs-pleroma-vs-gab">Mastodon vs Pleroma vs Gab</h2><ul><li><strong><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a></strong> is the most feature-rich option. I highly recommend it as the main choice.</li><li><strong><a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a></strong> is significantly more efficient than Mastodon. It's geared towards advanced users.</li><li>There are also some Mastodon forks, such as <a href="https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/">glitch-soc</a>, <a href="https://code.gab.com/gab/social/gab-social">Gab Social</a>, and <a href="https://gitlab.com/spinster-xyz/spinster">Spinster</a>. They have different goals and limited development resources.</li></ul><p>For this guide, we'll be using <strong>Mastodon</strong>. Please don't overthink this. Running my own fork has taught me it's not for the faint of heart. Pleroma is great if your users are advanced, but this guide is intended for servers geared towards the average person.</p><p>Choose a domain name for your server. Ideally, choose something that's <strong>2 syllables or less</strong> and resonates with your users.</p><p>I recommend using <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">NameCheap</a> to buy the domain name. You can search for available names there.</p><p>When naming Spinster, we tried a few different things.</p><ol><li>I created word clouds with data from Wikipedia and Reddit.</li><li>We used <a href="https://namelix.com/">Namelix</a> to generate business names using artificial intelligence.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://blog.alexgleason.me/content/images/2019/11/feminist-literature-titles.png" alt=""><figcaption>Word cloud generated from Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_feminist_literature">List of Feminist Literature</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>These activities got us thinking, but ultimately didn't lead us to the answer.</p><p>While scanning our bookshelf I saw <em>The Spinster and Her Enemies</em> by Sheila Jeffreys. It occurred to me that "Spinster" sounds like "Twitter," and that it could be used in a positive way like Jeffreys intended.</p><p>When I pitched the name Spinster, it was met with hesitation.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.alexgleason.me/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-03-15-56-41.png" alt=""><figcaption>Conversation with MK about the name "Spinster"</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Go with your gut</strong>. Spend time on this, but once you have a name you like don't second-guess yourself or you'll stall.</p><p>Once you have a name idea, start searching on NameCheap. <code>.com</code> is the best option, but in my opinion <code>.xyz</code> is just as good and it's usually cheap too. <code>spinster.xyz</code> cost us $1, so you should not feel pressure to spend a lot of money.</p><h2 id="step-1-1-use-cloudflare">Step 1.1: Use Cloudflare</h2><p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> is a free service that will protect your site against DDoS attacks. It works by sitting between your domain name and server, absorbing malicious traffic.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.alexgleason.me/content/images/2019/11/how-cloudflare-works.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>How Cloudflare works</figcaption></figure><p>Once you've purchased your domain name on NameCheap, create an account on Cloudflare and follow the instructions.

This will be needed later to prevent infinite redirects.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.alexgleason.me/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-04-13-30-35.png" alt=""><figcaption>Cloudflare SSL mode</figcaption></figure><h2 id="step-1-2-set-up-email">Step 1.2: Set up email</h2><p>You will need an email provider to send confirmation emails, "I forgot my password" emails, and other notification emails to your users.</p><p>To do this, create an account with <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a> and follow the instructions to set it up with your domain name. You will need to:</p><ul><li>Create a <strong>server.</strong></li><li>Add a <strong>domain.</strong></li></ul><p>Under the "servers" tab, click "Create server" and follow the instructions.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.alexgleason.me/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-03-16-31-58.png" alt=""><figcaption>Creating a Postmark server</figcaption></figure><p>You will also want to add a <strong>domain</strong>.

Go back into Cloudflare, then "DNS". Add a <code>TXT</code> record and <code>CNAME</code> record as instructed. I had to set the CNAME to "DNS only" by clicking the orange cloud icon before it worked.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.alexgleason.me/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-04-12-09-12.png" alt=""><figcaption>Postmark DNS on Cloudflare</figcaption></figure><p>You can verify everything is working once you have all green checkmarks.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.alexgleason.me/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-03-16-43-13.png" alt=""><figcaption>Green checkmarks indicate the domain is working</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, you will need to take note of your credentials.

You <strong>do not</strong> want them to be stored directly on the droplet. Apart from being a security risk, you will wake up one day to learn your server is offline due to storage running out. The solution is <strong>DigitalOcean Spaces</strong>.</p><p>The same way you created a droplet, create a <strong>space</strong> instead. Give it a unique name and use the default settings. You can put it in the same datacenter region as your droplet.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.alexgleason.me/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-03-17-49-19.png" alt=""><figcaption>A new empty space on DigitalOcean</figcaption></figure><p>Media files will be hosted on a subdomain of your site, such as <code>media.mysite.com</code>.

Within the modal, click "<strong>Bring your own certificate</strong>." We'll generate one from Cloudflare.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.alexgleason.me/content/images/2019/11/Screenshot-from-2019-11-04-12-53-14.png" alt=""><figcaption>SSL certificate generated by Cloudflare</figcaption></figure><p>Back on Cloudflare, go to <strong>SSL/TLS</strong> &gt; <strong>Origin Server</strong> &gt; <strong>Create Certificate</strong>.

		<p>Google’s <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/">Safe Browsing</a> program protects a lot of people from <strong>phishing</strong>, <strong>malware</strong>, and other harmful sites. In fact, it’s so pervasive that it’s not just used by Chrome. Google has managed to get competing browsers,&nbsp;<strong>Safari and</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Firefox,</strong>&nbsp;to use it as well. The list of websites blacklisted though is all maintained by Google, giving Google&nbsp;a&nbsp;disproportionate amount of power over what sites are seen versus blocked.</p>
<p>I’ll explain what happened during our harrowing week in a moment; but first, let me share an <strong>update about Google’s Safe Browsing API</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective September 11, 2019, the <strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing">Safe Browsing API</a></strong> is limited to non-commercial use only. It is a free service.</li>
<li>If you’re a <strong>non-commercial user</strong>, you can continue to use the Safe Browsing API, and you don’t need to take any action. Also, a<span data-preserver-spaces="true">cademic researchers and NGOs will continue to be eligible to use the Safe Browsing API at no cost.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Commercial users</strong>, like GMass, are required to switch to the <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/web-risk/">Web Risk API</a></strong> by November 11, 2019. This version is a paid service, and if you’re a commercial user, as we are, then you’ll need to switch. Also, you’ll need to apply and be approved to use the API, so don’t wait.</li>
<li>Both APIs are directed at protecting users from malware and phishing, but the new Web Risk API is designed specifically for larger users.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, back to our story …</p>
<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p>At the beginning of last week, my team&nbsp;suddenly had a deluge of complaints from <strong>users reporting that their links had stopped working</strong>, their <strong>sending limits had been reduced</strong>, and they’d <strong>received phishing notifications from Google</strong>. Ouch! Upon investigating, we found that the tracking domains they use in their email campaigns&nbsp;had ended up on the Google’s Safe Browsing blacklist, and when people clicked links in their campaigns, they ended up on this scary bright red Google warning page.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Gmail-Dangerous-Warning-Link-Wordzen-Com-web.png" alt="" width="1685" height="613">There’s the rub. <em>Not only does Google list actual phishing sites, but any sites that re-direct to them as well.</em> That makes it so that any providing click-tracking services, including <strong>URL shorteners</strong> and <strong>email marketing service providers</strong>, have to be extra cautious.</p>
<p>In slogging through our logs we found that a Netflix phisher had managed to send 200 emails through GMass on Sunday, February 17. Here’s the email he sent. Notice that the URL behind the link is highlighted at the bottom. In this case, the URL https://www.gregsimages.com/cgi-bin led to the red screen of death, as did our click-tracked links that redirected to this URL.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Safe-Browsing-Netflix-Email-web.png" alt="" width="1333" height="574"></p>
<h3>The effect of being listed goes beyond just the web</h3>
<p>What happens to your email campaigns when you send a URL that’s on this list? Gmail makes you&nbsp;feel like the devil reincarnate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Your Gmail account&nbsp;becomes <strong>severely limited</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>unable able to send any substantial volume</strong> of emails.</li>
<li>If you do manage to&nbsp;send an email with a blacklisted link,&nbsp;and that link is clicked, you’ll <strong>scare the&nbsp;bejesus out of them</strong> with&nbsp;the red screen of death.</li>
<li>Your <strong>past campaigns are affected</strong> too, if someone pulls up one of those old emails and clicks a link.</li>
<li>If people <strong>reply</strong> to you, the reply will still have the original email at the bottom, with the link that you sent, and Google <strong>will flag the <em>reply to you</em> as a potential scam</strong> too.<br>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Gmail-Dangerous-Warning-web.png" alt="" width="2509" height="1618"></li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously not a good look for an email marketer.</p>
<h3>What was actually affected?</h3>
<p>In our case, when we got the notice that <strong>link.wordzen.com was listed</strong>, I wanted to <strong>isolate which link.wordzen.com URLs were affected</strong>.</p>
<p>Using the public <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search?hl=en">Safe Browsing lookup tool</a>, which is different from the private tool everyone has in their <strong>Search Console</strong>, I found that plugging in just link.wordzen.com gave this result, indicating that some URLs were affected and others weren’t:</p>
<figure id="attachment_4078" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4078"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Safe-Browsing-Lookup-Some-Unsafe-web.png" alt="" width="3168" height="1874"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4078">Just “link.wordzen.com” indicates that SOME pages are unsafe.</figcaption></figure>
<p>But if I plugged in our original click tracking structure, link.wordzen.com/x/c, then the issue was clear that all /x/c links were blacklisted</p>
<figure id="attachment_4079" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4079"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Safe-Browsing-Lookup-Unsafe-web.png" alt="" width="3180" height="1798"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4079">Using our old click-tracking link structure shows that all URL redirects using link.wordzen.com are unsafe.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Curious, though, I wondered what would happen if I changed the URL slightly, so I tried link.wordzen.com/x/d and found that those URLs came back clean</p>
<figure id="attachment_4082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4082"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Link-Wordzen-Com-Safe-web-1.png" alt="" width="3180" height="1204"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4082">Slightly altering the link structure makes the link safe again.</figcaption></figure>
<p>You’ll see below that this discovery led me to change the structure of a click-tracked link.</p>
<h3>Some&nbsp;nonsense associated with the Safe Browsing Program</h3>
<h5><span>1. Despite claims of transparency, it’s anything but.</span></h5>
<p>As soon as your domain has been listed, you will probably want to know the URL that caused the issue. Unfortunately for you, <strong>Google won’t tell you</strong>. In the <strong>Search Console</strong> you might see this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Google-Search-Console-Blacklisted-web-1.png" alt="" width="1240" height="942"></p>
<p>If you received an email notification about the blacklisting, that will have a portion of the URL.</p>
<figure id="attachment_4039" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4039"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Social-Engineering-Email-Notification-web-1.png" alt="" width="1132" height="1241"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-4039">The email notification you receive provides some clue as to the offending URL, while the notice in the Search Console gives you NO worthwhile info.</figcaption></figure>
<p>For my purposes, this did not help at all, because every click-tracked link in the history of GMass starts with /x/c. The important stuff is all <em>after</em> that part, and that’s the part that Google eliminates from its reports. <strong>How this qualifies as transparency is beyond me.</strong></p>
<p><em>So what do you do now?</em> You crawl through your logs and figure out what happened. In my case, I ran all sorts of analyses, starting with a time distribution analysis of all clicks in the last 72 hours, looking for anomalies. I also discovered my new best friend, a tool from Microsoft called <a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Log-Parser-Studio-cd458765">Log Parser Studio</a>, that lets me run SQL queries against my IIS log files, <em>without importing the log files</em> into a database. Slick! That’s how I concluded that the aforementioned Netflix phisher was the culprit.</p>
<h5><span>2. The Safe Browsing API has been broken since day one.</span></h5>
<p>I’m <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/google-safe-browsing-api/pdVIo3qXsGk">not the only one</a>&nbsp;who’s&nbsp;frustrated over&nbsp;the seemingly useless <a href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/v4/">Safe Browsing API</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot showing the listing of link.wordzen.com.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Google-Search-Console-Blacklisted-web.png" alt="" width="1240" height="942"></p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot showing the API result:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Safe-Browsing-API-Fail-web.png" alt="" width="2121" height="969"></p>
<p>So with a useless API, how does one monitor whether new URLs have been listed or old URLs have been marked safe? I used Upwork to quickly a hire a team of <strong>Virtual Assistants in the Philippines</strong> to <strong>manually enter all 1,400</strong> of our customers’ tracking domains into the web lookup tool and to do so <strong>every 12 hours until further notice</strong>.</p>
<p>In case you’re a C# programmer and want to try this yourself, here’s the code:</p>
<pre><span>            string</span><span> apikey = </span>"AIzaSyBnIDLCc*************z4twxdx28"<span>;</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   </span><span>string</span> payload = <span>@"{</span>
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>""client"": {

<p>There is also a <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/dotnet/apis/safebrowsing/v4">.NET client library for the Safe Browsing API</a>, but I chose not to use it because I wanted to be&nbsp;in control of the exact JSON payload request&nbsp;so that I knew that I wasn’t making a mistake.</p>
<h5><span>3. Reviews take a long time to process.</span></h5>
<p>Despite <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/hacked/request_review">Google’s claims</a><strong> that a phishing URL will be reviewed within 24 hours</strong> and a <strong>malware&nbsp;URL&nbsp;within 72 hours</strong>, I found it <strong>took more like 120 hours (5 days)</strong>. After a week of hell though, there’s no sweeter email one can receive than this, clearing your&nbsp;domain off the dreaded blacklist:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://blogcdn.gmass.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Safe-Browsing-Review-Successful-web.png" alt="" width="943" height="786"></p>
<p>You can submit each URL for review, and in our case, we did it for hundreds of our customers too.</p>
<h3>How&nbsp;I worked around the blacklisting of 300 domains</h3>
<p>During the time our customers’ domains were listed, we couldn’t just sit idle&nbsp;waiting for Google, because customers needed to&nbsp;send their email campaigns out. We took a number of counter-measures and you can take these too, should you find yourself in this situation.</p>
<h5><span>1. Removed&nbsp;all affected customer tracking domains from their accounts</span></h5>
<p>The first step we took was to remove all the affected tracking domains from users’ accounts, causing them to fall back to our shared tracking domain, which for paying users, is a clean domain based on Amazon’s AWS domain. That eliminated the issue in future campaigns.</p>
<h5><span>2. Altered structure of click tracking link</span></h5>
<p>I felt a little shady making this change system-wide, but it turned out it worked, and saved me from an ever-growing mob of angry users. The old structure of a click-tracked link looked like:</p>
<pre>http://link.wordzen.com/x/c?c=2724793&amp;l=dedb940f-55dd-4c33-a3cc-f5d8028183ca&amp;r=ed06197e-cf9e-4fea-a371-d5f455968519</pre>
<p>By&nbsp;plugging various combinations of URL structures into the <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search?hl=en">lookup tool</a>, we noticed that the link above was flagged as dangerous, but if we made a simple change, changing the /c to /d, then the URL came back as safe, so we changed the structure of links to use /d instead of /c, like this:</p>
<pre>http://link.wordzen.com/x/d?c=2724793&amp;l=dedb940f-55dd-4c33-a3cc-f5d8028183ca&amp;r=ed06197e-cf9e-4fea-a371-d5f455968519</pre>
<p>Of course for backward compatibility, we made sure that the /c URLs still worked also.</p>
<p>Making this change allowed users to keep using their custom tracking domain, even if their tracking domain was still listed in the Safe Browsing system as a potential phishing domain.</p>
<h5><span>3. Locked down how click-tracking works to prevent future issues</span></h5>
<p>I should have implemented this from day one, but I could have never expected an evildoer to exploit this loophole. You may know that to set up a custom tracking domain, you create a sub-domain off your existing domain and set its CNAME to x.gmtrack.net. So in my …</p></div></article></div>

January 16, 2021 | https://timdaub.github.io/2021/01/16/web-principles/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://timdaub.github.io/2021/01/16/web-principles/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It's now roughly seven or eight years that I'm building dynamic front ends for the web. From <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ascribe.io/">digital art wallets</a> to games (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ipfs.leapdao.org/blog/Planet-A-ccc-ethberlin-recap/">1</a>, <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/videogame">2</a>) and <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/wasm-synth">synthesizers</a>, I've seen it all. And since my process of creation has dramatically changed over the years, today, I'd like to share how I'm developing web apps in 2021.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-build-processes.">I avoid build processes.</h2>
<p>I still remember the debates with colleagues about using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://babeljs.io/">babel</a> a few years ago. Within the front end development world, transpiling had just become a thing, so we ended up babelifying our builds to use ES6. Our argument back then was that one day, we would be able to push our application's directory structure on a web server and since all browsers would then support the augmented ES6 features, our app would just work! Without a build process. WOW! That must have been around 2015. When I look at the source code of these old applications now, our technical visions didn't end up becoming reality.</p>
<p>Now, I try to keep my build process to a minimum. When I need to write a demo app, I particularly like using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-standalone#script-tags"><code>&lt;script type="text/babel"&gt;</code></a>. I love <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/getting-started/#no-build-tools-route">preact's "no build tools route."</a> too. When I have to set up an actual app, I avoid <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rollupjs.org/">rollup</a>. I mainly get frustrated about the myriad ways of configuring them. Some minor thing always ends up being broken, which leads to hours of debugging foreign code. And that's frustrating. Using preact's no build route, finally something like the above is possible:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br><span>2</span><br><span>3</span><br><span>4</span><br><span>5</span><br><span>6</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;script type=<span>"module"</span>&gt;</span><br><span>  </span><br><span>  <span>import</span> { h, Component, render } <span>from</span> <span>'https://unpkg.com/preact?module'</span>;</span><br><span>  <span>const</span> app = h(<span>'h1'</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>'Hello World!'</span>);</span><br><span>  render(app, <span>document</span>.body);</span><br><span>&lt;/script&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>When having to use a build tool, I gravitate towards <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://parceljs.org/">parcel</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/developit/microbundle">microbundle</a> as they come preconfigured. And in particular, parcel is excellent, as it's merely using an HTML file as its entry point. To me, that's promising as it assumes a proper directory structure and properly connected files such that maybe one day I can push my app to the web without that build step.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-transpiling.">I avoid transpiling.</h2>
<p>For the same reasons as pointed out above, I also try to avoid transpiling. It's not because I don't like ESNext features, but more because I want to minimize the risk of getting stuck with the transpiler. Hence, I try to avoid using babel. <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/09/01/typescript/">I also don't use Typescript</a>. To me, JavaScript is productive enough. Additionally, for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/">react</a>-style projects, no transpilers mean I stopped using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>. Instead, I found an excellent library called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/developit/htm">htm</a> that uses JavaScript's template strings. It has a similar syntax to JSX, but it's not breaking ECMAScript standards and hence needs no transpliation.</p>
<h2 id="i-avoid-the-new-and-shiny.">I avoid the <em>new</em> and <em>shiny</em>.</h2>
<p>I even avoid changing the way I work if I don't feel comfortable or inclined. For example, I never switched to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">react hooks</a>. The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html">lifecycle methods</a> that I initially know from iOS Objective-C programming are - in my opinion - a beautiful metaphor for writing front end components. And neither did I have any issues with my sites' performance. I would make the switch if I started to have problems. But I don't. The same goes for up and coming frameworks. Angular V2? <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>? Cool, but why relearn a framework when I'm already productive with the one I use?</p>
<h2 id="i-test-everything.">I test EvErYtHiNg.</h2>
<p>When I started front-end development, testing was complicated. Only a few front end developer colleagues tested their apps properly. I ended up doing a lot of testing by hand. It was frustrating and unproductive. But testing front ends has improved dramatically over the years. Not only have the tools been significantly enhanced.</p>
<p>We, as front-end developers, have now also figured out how to correctly write front end tests. Finally, we're able to distinguish between functional code and presentational code. For functional code, we now write unit tests. For presentational code, we use snapshot-based testing and integration tests. I'm pleased about tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cypress.io/">cypress</a> that is great for integration tests. I also like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/avajs/ava/">ava</a> for unit tests.</p>
<h2 id="i-optimize-for-performance-and-quality.">I optimize for performance and quality.</h2>
<p>I used to be eager about building extensively functional software: the more features, the better. I'm not anymore. Instead, I try to develop software that works well for my users. I strive for quality. So I try to measure my build's size. I take proper care about delivering my application, meaning I turn on compression and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching">caching</a>. I care about optimizing my static assets like pictures. And I like to check my apps by using tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?hl=de">PageSpeed Insights</a> or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">lighthouse</a>.</p>
<h2 id="i-use-my-own-work">I use my own work</h2>
<p>From experience, I learned that I hardly ever get stuck on a algorithmic problem. On the contrary, I get motivated to learn something new and excel in the process. However, I caught my self often spending many hours on debugging other people's code. Mainly when it's third-party libraries that I included via npm. Once, I thought that using npm packages was a JavaScript developer's superpower. Now, I know that it can also be their curse.</p>
<p>Instead of collecting heaps of third-party code, I now prefer following <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://hintjens.com/blog:96">Peter Hintjens' principles for writing good code</a>. I "use my own work." Meaning, I dare to write seemingly complex code myself. I still won't roll my own crypto or write a date library, but I dare to implement parts of a protocol or build an algorithm. It's not to say that I ditch every npm package and go npm-keto-diet. No, instead, I take a more mindful approach towards dependencies and only include them when I truly need them.</p>
<p>I try to do that by leaving my technical vision at the doorstep of my office, so that I can now focus on solving the problems at hand. I try to stop worrying about eventualities far in the future as I view that as speculation. In cases I have past experiences, I use it to form my decision. For unchartered teritory, I move carefully, step by step.</p>
<h2 id="i-use-open-source-to-my-advantage.">I use open source to my advantage.</h2>
<p>I'm building websites since I'm a teenager. And had I open-sourced and maintained a few pieces of code that I need frequently, I'd be more productive now. Unfortunately, I was short-sighted. Surprisingly, I didn't think about still using JavaScript at 29 years of age 😂</p>
<p>I stopped framing open source mainly around certain virtues like free speech, fairness or certain politics. They're still important virtues for me, but I learned that I could use open source also for building a personal toolset.</p>
<p>Extracting a library from a codebase allows me to think about it from a user's perspective. It means I'm able to think about a piece of code's interfaces emphatically. Additionally, there's positive peer pressure. I'm not going to release shit to the world. When my project is public, it's going to have a proper README and some docs. And it's going to be tested. Since everybody can see it, I might as well create something I can be proud of.</p>
<p>Hence, contributing to open source, for me, is about building high-quality software. Being anxious about not being able to monetize this particular piece of code has become less of a concern. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/sindresorhus">sindresohrus</a> inspired me to treat open source packages like my personal toolbox.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>And that's my incomplete list of principles. I'm sure there's more than just these. Anyway, I still find some of these points quite controversial. I'm sure they won't work for everyone as all our contexts differ. But working solo as a freelancer, I've found that these principles contribute to me being content about what I'm doing. Hence, I was eager to share them.</p>
<p>I'm curious to hear other's thoughts and see if they've taken similar paths. Please reach out! Also, don't forget to subscribe to my newsletter!</p>

This computer has no microprocessor.  The CPU is discrete TTL logic.
<p><img alt="Mark 1 FORTH Computer" src="http://www.aholme.co.uk/Mk1/IMG/Rack1_40.jpg" width="900" height="500">
</p><p>I bought my first TTL data book in 1979.
I was learning 6502 machine code at the time and dreamt of building a simple TTL CPU.
I sketched some circuit ideas; but that was as far as it went.
Now, 25 years later, I've finally done it!
Working evenings and weekends, the Mark 1 took a month to design, 4 months to build and a month to program.
Here's the result:</p><p>
<img alt="Recursive factorial demo" src="http://www.aholme.co.uk/Mk1/IMG/Factorial.gif" width="652" height="331">
</p><p>
<b><tt>Myself</tt></b> is a standard way to implement recursion in FORTH.
Even if you're not familiar with FORTH, if I tell you it's a stack-based language, and uses reverse polish notation (RPN), you might be able to figure out how this works.

<h3>µ-Instruction Format</h3>

<p>
The Mark 1 is a micro-programmed machine with a highly encoded "vertical" microcode.
The microinstruction (µ) is only 8-bits wide.
One normally thinks in terms of "horizontal" microcodes, which are wider and less encoded.
Some are very wide indeed.
The Mark 1 is more like a RISC processor.
</p>

<p>The 8-bit µ-instruction (µ) is encoded as follows:</p>


<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td></td>
<td>µ7</td>
<td>µ6</td>
<td>µ5</td>
<td>µ4</td>
<td>µ3</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Conditional skip</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td colspan="2">Test</td>
<td colspan="4">Distance</td>

</tbody></table>

<p>The source and destination fields of the move instructions are coded as follows:</p>

	<table>
	<tbody><tr><td></td><td>Destination</td><td>Source</td></tr>
	<tr><td>000</td><td>W</td><td>W</td></tr>
	<tr><td>001</td><td>IP</td><td>IP</td></tr>
	<tr><td>010</td><td>TOS</td><td>TOS</td></tr>

	<tr><td>100</td><td>Memory[W]</td><td>Memory[W]</td></tr>
	<tr><td>101</td><td>OP</td><td>Memory[IP]</td></tr>
	<tr><td>110</td><td>ALU input A</td><td>Zero</td></tr>
	<tr><td>111</td><td>ALU input B</td><td>ALU output</td></tr>
	</tbody></table>

<small>TOS = Top of parameter stack; R = Top of return stack</small>

<p>The Mark 1 executes 1 µ-instruction per clock cycle (1MHz).</p>

<p>Decoding is done centrally using 74HC138 1-of-8 decoders.
Decoded control signals are distributed via the back plane.
Simple gating is then required at card level to complete the decoding.</p>

<p>The conditional is a skip not a branch.
It inhibits loading of another µ-instruction for a specified number of cycles if the test is true.
The skip distance is decremented to zero at which point normal execution resumes.</p>

<p>The "µPC←OP*16" instruction (1011xxxx) a.k.a. XOP loads the uppermost 8-bits of the program counter (µPC) from the operand register.
It's a form of indirect jump.</p>

<p>The other jump instruction (1001xxxx) has a 4-bit operand and can only reach the first 16 bytes of the µ-ROM.</p>

<p>
The 74181-based ALU requires 8 control signals.
These are decoded from the 4-bit ALU function field in the µ-instruction using a 7x16 diode matrix ROM.
The shaded squares indicate positions where diodes are fitted:</p>

<p>FLAG selects sign or overflow testing.
Sign testing routes the most significant bit of the ALU result to the conditional test multiplexer.
Overflow testing required the addition of a quad-XOR gate.
The 74181 does not generate an overflow signal (the later 382 variant does).
This was not used in the end because FORTH implements signed comparison by testing the sign of the result after subtraction.</p>

<h3>Backplane</h3>

<p>The Mark 1 is housed in a 3U 19"
IEC297 sub-rack with a 64-way DIN 41612 backplane.
The bus layout is shown below.
The "A" row resembles a standard 8-bit microprocessor bus.
The "C" row carries the µ-instruction and various decoded control signals.
The fully-bussed pins (1, 2, 31, &amp; 32) carry power supply and clocks.</p>

<p>The clocks are in quadrature.
CLK1 <strike>rises</strike>falls at the beginning of the machine cycle.
CLK2 is used to generate write-enable signals for the RAM and I/O.</p>

<p>All control signals are active low.</p>

<h3>Microcode sequencer</h3>

<p>The sequencer has a 12-bit micro-program counter (µPC).
The uppermost 8-bits can be loaded from the OP Latch, effecting a jump to one of 256 microcode routines.
Each routine starts on a 16-byte µ-page boundary.</p>

<p><img width="554" height="152" src="http://www.aholme.co.uk/Mk1/IMG/Sequencer.gif" alt="Sequencer block diagram"></p>

<p>Opcodes, the machine language of the macro-machine, are loaded into the OP latch from the data bus under
micro-program control.  They can be fetched from memory using one of the index registers as a program counter.
A simple <i>micro-interpreter</i> consists of the following 3 µ-instructions:</p>
<div><pre>OP←Memory[Index]     Load OP latch from memory
Index←Index+1        Increment "program counter"
µPC←OP*16            Execute microcode routine
</pre></div>
<p>How do these 3 µ-instructions get executed?
One possibility is to append them to the end of every µ-routine.
A slower but more space-efficient option is to append a jump to them.
Mark 1 microcode has a jump specifically for this.</p>

<h3>Virtual machine</h3>
<p>It's possible to customise the the instruction set and thereby create a "virtual machine".</p>
<p>Opcodes can have zero, one, or more operands.  
The µ-routines consume operands by incrementing the program counter.
During development, I used this two-operand POKE instruction to test the UART.
This expects a 16-bit address followed by a data byte:</p>
<div><pre>Poke:    Index.Lo ← Memory [PC]        ; Address LO
         PC ← PC+1
         Index.Hi ← Memory [PC]        ; Address HI
         PC ← PC+1
         Temp ← Memory [PC]            ; Data byte
         PC ← PC+1
         Memory [Index] ← Temp         ; Do the POKE
         Jump Next
</pre></div>
<p>The Mark 1 was designed to support the FORTH virtual machine.
The following FORTH primitives are micro-programmed:</p>

<tt>
EXIT LIT EXECUTE
BRANCH 0BRANCH (LOOP) (DO) U* U/ AND OR XOR LEAVE R&gt; &gt;R R 0= 0&lt; + D+
MINUS DMINUS OVER DROP SWAP DUP @ C@ ! C! (DOES)
</tt>

<h3>Forth model</h3>

<p>My original plan was to build a subroutine-threaded FORTH.  High-level definitions were to be called explicitly, primitives were to be compiled inline:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
    <table>
    <tbody><tr><td><tt>: Foo  DUP SWAP DROP ;</tt></td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>: Bar  OVER Foo ROT ;</tt></td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
</td>
<td>
    <table>
    <tbody><tr><td><tt>Foo:</tt></td><td><tt>DB OP_DUP, OP_SWAP, OP_DROP, OP_EXIT</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>Bar:</tt></td><td><tt>DB OP_OVER, OP_CALL</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><tt>DW Foo</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><tt>DB OP_ROT, OP_EXIT</tt></td></tr>
    </tbody></table>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>I abandoned this idea because most FORTHs use indirect threading and I wanted a full-featured standard FORTH with all the usual compiler facilities.
Many compiling words are tightly coupled to the indirectly threaded model.</p>

<p>Indirectly threaded code is a list of execution tokens.
An execution token is a code field address.
The code field is a pointer to machine code.
This presented a problem on the mark 1 because it has separate macro and micro address spaces.
What should go in the code field?
My solution was to shorten it to 1 byte and store the opcode:</p>

<table>
 <tbody><tr>
  <td>
  <p><br><b>Subroutine-threaded</b><br>&nbsp;</p>
  </td>
  <td>
  <p><br><b>Indirectly-threaded</b><br>&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          <p dir="ltr">Of all possible new year resolutions, one stands out as having the highest potential to radically transform our lives. It affects all parts of life, and properly executing on it lays a foundation that is absolutely necessary to reach our full potential. It’s a simple habit that can maximize the health of our bodies, our minds, make us happier, increase our productivity, and (importantly at this moment) boost our immune system. If we could collectively muster the will to do it, it’d protect the environment and maybe even prevent the next pandemic. I’m talking about consistently eating a whole food, plant based diet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The leading cause of disease and disability in the United States is <a href="https://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/country_profiles/GBD/ihme_gbd_country_report_united_states.pdf">dietary factors</a>. Some of the top <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30041-8/fulltext">dietary problems</a> include getting too little whole grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables. The number one killer in the US is heart disease—and it can be <a href="https://dresselstyn.com/JFP_06307_Article1.pdf">halted and possibly reversed</a> with a whole food plant based diet. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/how-plant-based-food-helps-fight-cancer/art-20457590#:~:text=It's%20true%20plant%2Dbased%20foods,may%20protect%20cells%20from%20damage.">Studies</a> show cancer risk decreasing with higher vegetable and lower meat consumption. It’s now clear that we have more control over whether we get sick than most of us realize. This year, resolve not to die from your own dietary choices.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most people have experienced depression at some point in their lives. It can destroy your productivity and tank your resolutions. Some percentage of depression cases are surely due to the circumstances of people’s lives, but it’s becoming increasingly clear that poor diet can contribute as well. It may be that the brain just doesn’t function as well when we don’t give it the right fuel. In the western world, where nearly everyone eats an unhealthy diet, how much depression could be avoided? How much productivity is being thrown down the drain? We don’t know the answer, but we do know that eating healthy can <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diets-for-improved-mood-and-productivity/">improve mood, depression, and productivity</a>. This year, resolve to keep your brain in a healthy state so that you’re as happy and productive as possible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the midst of a global pandemic, amongst all the preventative measures we’re told to do (maintain six feet distance, wash your hands, don’t congregate, etc.), there’s one critical piece of advice missing—eat healthy. We’ve all heard that certain pre-existing conditions can contribute to risk of dying from COVID-19. But what’s left out of the conversation is that many of these conditions are preventable and caused by diet. But that’s only half the picture. There is <a href="https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/immune-function/">ample evidence </a>that healthy eating boosts the immune system as well. This <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19552829/">study</a> shows that pregnant women eating more fruits and vegetables had a reduction in risk of contracting an upper respiratory tract infection (like COVID). This <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bbb/75/1/75_100490/_pdf">study</a> shows that kale can increase antibody production. There are many more studies in this vein. This means that upping the quality of your diet could help prevent infection in the first place and reduce the severity should you contract it. It could make the difference between life and death. This year, why not reduce your chance of getting sick and maximize your chance of survival?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Viruses are parasites that require hosts to survive. The public health measures we’ve all become so familiar with over the past year revolve around depriving the virus of new <em>human</em> hosts. But viruses are very adaptable and frequently jump between species. In Denmark, a strain of COVID-19 spread through <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/03-december-2020-mink-associated-sars-cov2-denmark/en/">mink farms</a> and crossed over into humans. Swine flu and bird flu had their day as well. Any situation that brings densely packed animal populations and humans into contact provides an opportunity for viruses to make the jump and start another global pandemic. Thus any <em>serious</em> pandemic prevention strategy must address the fact that the packed, filthy conditions of factory farms are an ideal viral breeding ground. It’s not just viruses, factory farms are implicated in the rise of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24043228/">antibiotic resistant bacteria</a> as well. There’s no way around it—more meat production means more risk of viral pandemics and bacteria that we can’t kill with antibiotics. This year, resolve to follow the science and do your part to stop the next pandemic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s only part of the problem with livestock. It’s environmentally destructive, and <em>literally</em> unsustainable at the level we eat in the US. If the entire world ate like an average American, there wouldn’t be <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-land-by-global-diets#:~:text=Livestock%20takes%20up%20nearly%2080,required%20to%20produce%20our%20food.">enough land on the planet</a> to produce that quantity of meat. It accounts for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production#Greenhouse_gas_emissions">14.5% of our greenhouse emissions</a>. It’s the top cause of deforestation in the <a href="https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/cattle-ranching">Amazon</a>. All this destruction, so that we can keep eating things that probably <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat">cause cancer</a>. Instead of growing crops to feed our livestock, let’s cut out the middle man. This year, resolve to do your part to protect the environment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A resolution to eat a whole food plant based diet is a resolution to prevent death and disability. It’s a resolution to keep on living our lives and to optimize our experience in it while simultaneously protecting the planet and public health. This year, resolve to do the right thing for your body, your mind, your planet and your fellow man: adopt a whole food, plant-based diet.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I start each of my <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/">weekly reviews</a> by re-reading one of my favorite essays of life advice—a different one each week. It’s useful for a few different reasons:</p><ul><li><p>It helps me get into the right reflective frame of mind.</p></li><li><p>The best essays are dense enough with useful advice that I find new interesting bits every time I read them.</p></li><li><p>Much good advice is <a href="https://tjcx.me/posts/defense-self-help/" target="_blank">easy to understand, but hard to implement</a>. So to get the most benefit from it, you should find whatever version of it most resonates you and then <em>re-read it frequently</em> to keep yourself on track.</p></li></ul><p>I’ve collected my favorite essays for re-reading below. I’ll keep this updated as I find more great essays, and I’d welcome other contributions—please suggest your own favorites in the comments!</p><hr><p>Paul Graham, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/vb.html" target="_blank">Life is Short</a>. Inspire yourself never to waste time on bullshit again:</p><blockquote><p>Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it’s impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.</p><p>Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know that?</p><p>It has for me. It means arguments of the form “Life is too short for x” have great force. It’s not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. It’s not just a synonym for annoying. If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can.</p><p>When I ask myself what I’ve found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is “bullshit.” I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It’s almost the definition of bullshit that it’s the stuff that life is too short for. And yet bullshit does have a distinctive character. There’s something fake about it. It’s the junk food of experience. [1]</p><p>If you ask yourself what you spend your time on that’s bullshit, you probably already know the answer. Unnecessary meetings, pointless disputes, bureaucracy, posturing, dealing with other people’s mistakes, traffic jams, addictive but unrewarding pastimes.</p></blockquote><p>I’ve found that unless I’m vigilant, the amount of bullshit in my life only ever increases. Rereading <em>Life is Short</em> every so often gives me a kick in the pants to figure out what <em>really</em> matters and how to get the bullshit levels back down.</p><hr><p>Derek Sivers, <a href="https://sivers.org/kimo" target="_blank">There is no speed limit</a>, in which he learns a semester’s worth of music theory in an afternoon:</p><blockquote><p>Within a minute, he started quizzing me. “If the 5-chord with the flat-7 has that tri-tone, then so does another flat-7 chord. Which one?”</p><p>“Uh… the flat-2 chord?”</p><p>“Right! So that’s a substitute chord. Any flat-7 chord can be substituted with the other flat-7 that shares the same tri-tone. So reharmonize all the chords you can in this chart. Go.”</p><p>The pace was intense, and I loved it. Finally, someone was challenging me — keeping me in over my head — encouraging and expecting me to pull myself up quickly. I was learning so fast, it felt like the adrenaline rush you get while playing a video game. He tossed every fact at me and made me prove that I got it.</p><p>In our three-hour lesson that morning, he taught me a full semester of Berklee’s harmony courses.</p></blockquote><p>This was one of the major inspirations for <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/">Be impatient</a>. Every time I reread it, I think of at least one thing where I’m setting myself a speed limit for no reason!</p><hr><p>Sam Altman, <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful" target="_blank">How To Be Successful</a>. Sam might have observed more successful people more closely than anyone else on the planet, and the advice is as good as you’d expect.</p><blockquote><p>Focus is a force multiplier on work.</p><p>Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.</p><p>Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Almost always, the people who say “I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out”, and mean it, go on to succeed. They are persistent long enough to give themselves a chance for luck to go their way.</p><p>… To be willful, you have to be optimistic—hopefully this is a personality trait that can be improved with practice. I have never met a very successful pessimistic person.</p></blockquote><p>There are lots of different points here, so this one especially bears rereading!</p><hr><p>R. W. Hamming, <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dahlin/bookshelf/hamming.html" target="_blank">You and your research</a>. Hamming observed almost as many great scientists as Sam Altman did founders. He had some interesting conclusions:</p><blockquote><p>At first I asked what were the important problems in chemistry, then what important problems they were working on, or problems that might lead to important results. One day I asked, “if what they were working on was not important, and was not likely to lead to important things, they why were they working on them?” After that I had to eat with the engineers!</p><p>About four months later, my friend stopped me in the hall and remarked that my question had bothered him. He had spent the summer thinking about the important problems in his area, and while had had not changed his research he thought it was well worth the effort. I thanked him and kept walking. A few weeks later I noticed that he was made head of the department. Many years later he became a member of the National Academy of Engineering. The one person who could hear the question went on to do important things and all the others—so far as I know—did not do anything worth public attention.</p><p>… Some people work with their doors open in clear view of those who pass by, while others carefully protect themselves from interruptions. Those with the door open get less work done each day, but those with their door closed tend not know what to work on, nor are they apt to hear the clues to the missing piece to one of their “list” problems. I cannot prove that the open door produces the open mind, or the other way around. I only can observe the correlation. I suspect that each reinforces the other, that an open door will more likely lead you and important problems than will a closed door.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There is another trait that took me many years to notice, and that is the ability to tolerate ambiguity. Most people want to believe what they learn is the truth: there are a few people who doubt everything. If you believe too much then you are not likely to find the essentially new view that transforms a field, and if you doubt too much you will not be able to do much at all. It is a fine balance between believing what you learn and at the same time doubting things. Great steps forward usually involve a change of viewpoint to outside the standard ones in the field.</p><p>While you are leaning things you need to think about them and examine them from many sides. By connecting them in many ways with what you already know…. you can later retrieve them in unusual situations. It took me a long time to realize that each time I learned something I should put “hooks” on it. This is another face of the extra effort, the studying more deeply, the going the extra mile, that seems to be characteristic of great scientists.</p></blockquote><p>Hamming is an unusual combination of (a) a great scientist himself, (b) curious and thoughtful about what makes others great, and (c) honest and open about his observations (it seems).</p><hr><p>Anonymous, <a href="https://autotranslucence.wordpress.com/2018/03/30/becoming-a-magician/" target="_blank">Becoming a Magician</a>—on how to become a person that your current self would perceive as magical:</p><blockquote><p>The description was about five or six handwritten pages long, and at the time, it was a manifestation of desperate longing to be somewhere other than where I was, someone who felt free and cared for. At the time I saw that description as basically an impossibility; my life could never be so amazing in reality.</p><p>Fast forward about seven or ten years and I rediscovered the description when I was moving old notebooks and journals from one dusty storage spot to another. As I read through it, I discovered that 90% of the statements I had made in that description were true (or true in spirit). … It was incredible to me, despite all the changes that had happened in my life since when I wrote the passage, that I had basically become the person whose life I had dreamed of living as a teenager.</p><p>That’s pretty fucking cool.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And then came Sanatan Dinda. An Indian visual artist from Kolkata, he didn’t even make the finals the first year he competed, and the next year he placed second with a style that broke half a dozen of the implicit rules of ‘good artwork’ at the competition. … [T]he third year he came he won the entire competition by something like ten percent of the total awarded points over the next artist in second place.</p><p>… The thing that confused me though was this – I could not work out how he did it. Like, I had zero mental model of how he created that piece in the same timeframe we all had; how he came up with it, designed it, practiced it. Even though he placed first and I placed fifth and logically we both existed on a scale of ‘competence at bodypainting’ it seemed like the skills required were completely different.</p></blockquote><p>The exercise they suggest is a really useful activity for weekly (or monthly or yearly) reviews. Highly recommended!</p><hr><p>Dan Luu, <a href="https://danluu.com/p95-skill/" target="_blank">95th percentile isn’t that good</a>. Great for cultivating self-improvement mindset by reminding you how easy (in some sense) it is to make huge improvements at something:</p><blockquote><p>Reaching 95%-ile isn’t very impressive because it’s not that hard to do. I think this is one of my most ridiculable ideas. It doesn’t help that, when stated nakedly, that sounds elitist. But I think it’s just the opposite: most people can become (relatively) good at most things.</p><p>Note that when …</p></blockquote></article></div>

<p>If you want to learn the math involved with the Big O, read  <a target="_blank" href="https://thatcomputerscientist.com/analysing-algorithms-worst-case-running-time">Analysing Algorithms: Worst Case Running Time</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Data Structures and Algorithms is about solving problems efficiently. A bad programmer solves their problems inefficiently and a really bad programmer doesn't even know why their solution is inefficient. So, the question is, <em>How do you rank an algorithm's efficiency?</em></p>
<p>The simple answer to that question is the <strong>Big O Notation</strong>. How does that work? Let me explain!</p>
<p>Say you wrote a function which goes through every number in a list and adds it to a <em>total_sum</em> variable.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610785957976/1d53AER34.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-16 at 2.02.19 PM.png"></p>
<p>If you consider "addition" to be 1 operation then running this function on a list of 10 numbers will cost 10 operations, running it on a list of 20 numbers costs 20 operations  and similarly running it on a list of n numbers costs the <em>length of list</em> (n) operations.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610786373466/WWOOmyjH9.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="Screen Recording 2021-01-16 at 2.01.09 PM.gif"></p>
<p>Now let's assume you wrote another function that would return the first number in a list.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610786595803/WcObNzV40.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-16 at 2.09.39 PM.png"></p>
<p>Now, no matter how large this list is, this function will never cost more than one operation. Fairly, these two algorithms have different <strong>time complexity</strong> or <em>relationship between growth of input size and growth of operations executed</em>. We communicate these time complexities using <strong><em>Big O Notation</em></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big O Notation is a mathematical notation used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Referring to the complexities as <em>'<strong>n</strong>'</em>, common complexities (ranked from good to bad) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constant - <strong>O(1)</strong></li>
<li>Logarithmic <strong>O(log n)</strong></li>
<li>Linear - <strong>O(n)</strong></li>
<li>n log n - <strong>O(n log n)</strong></li>
<li>Quadratic - <strong>O(n²)</strong></li>
<li>Exponential - <strong>O(2ⁿ)</strong></li>
<li>Factorial - <strong>O(n!)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610787546688/SufUcCJVY.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-16 at 2.23.08 PM.png"></p>
<p>Our first algorithm runs in <em>O(n)</em>, meaning its operations grew in a linear relationship with the input size - in this case, the amount of numbers in the list. Our second algorithm is not dependent on the input size at all  - so it runs in constant time. 
Let's take a look at how many operations a program has to execute in function with an input size of <em>n = 5 vs n = 50</em>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td></td><td>n = 5</td><td>n = 50</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(1)</strong></td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(log n)</strong></td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(n)</strong></td><td>5</td><td>50</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(n log n)</strong></td><td>20</td><td>300</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(n²)</strong></td><td>25</td><td>2500</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(2ⁿ)</strong></td><td>32</td><td>1125899906842624</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>O(n!)</strong></td><td>120</td><td>3.0414093e+64</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It might not matter when the input is small, but this gap gets very dramatic as the input size increases. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610788579877/ejJP5RkiF.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60" alt="Screen Recording 2021-01-16 at 2.33.46 PM.gif"></p>
<p>If n were 10000, a function that runs in <em>log(n)</em> would only take 14 operations and a function that runs in <em>n!</em> would set your computer on fire!</p>
<p>For Big O Notation, we <em>drop constants</em> so <em>O(10.n)</em> and <em>O(n/10)</em> are both equivalent to <em>O(n)</em> because the graph is still linear. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610788828910/JYXeRjI-G.png?auto=compress" alt="Screenshot 2021-01-16 at 2.47.52 PM.png"></p>
<p>Big O Notation is also used for <strong>space complexity</strong>, which works the same way - <em>how much space an algorithm uses as n grows</em> or <em>relationship between growth of input size and growth of space needed</em>.</p>
<p>So, yeah! This has been the simplest possible explanation of the Big O Notation from my side and I hope you enjoyed reading this.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-70a48e6cb3dd9bc957fa"><div><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p><p>Jan. 15, 2021</p><h3><strong>NRA Leaves New York to Reincorporate in Texas, Announces New Strategic Plan</strong></h3><h4><em>NRA Plans to Exit New York to Pursue Opportunity, Growth and Progress in Texas; Plan Benefits Association, Its Millions of Members, and All Supporters of the Second Amendment</em></h4><p>Fairfax, VA – The National Rifle Association of America (“NRA”) today announced it will restructure the Association as a Texas nonprofit to exit what it believes is a corrupt political and regulatory environment in New York. The move will enable long-term, sustainable growth and ensure the NRA’s continued success as the nation’s leading advocate for constitutional freedom – free from the toxic political environment of New York. </p><p>The NRA plan, which involves utilizing the protection of the bankruptcy court, has the Association dumping New York and organizing its legal and regulatory matters in an efficient forum. The move comes at a time when the NRA is in its strongest financial condition in years.</p><p>The NRA will continue with the forward advancement of the enterprise – confronting anti-Second Amendment activities, promoting firearm safety and training, and advancing public programs across the United States. There will be no immediate changes to the NRA’s operations or workforce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Association will seek court approval to reincorporate the Association in the State of Texas – home to more than 400,000 NRA members and site of the 2021 NRA Annual Meeting in Houston. </p><p>“This strategic plan represents a pathway to opportunity, growth and progress,” says NRA CEO &amp; EVP Wayne LaPierre. “Obviously, an important part of this plan is ‘dumping New York.’ The NRA is pursuing reincorporating in a state that values the contributions of the NRA, celebrates our law-abiding members, and will join us as a partner in upholding constitutional freedom. This is a transformational moment in the history of the NRA.”</p><p>The restructuring plan aims to streamline costs and expenses, proceed with pending litigation in a coordinated and structured manner, and realize many financial and strategic advantages.</p><p><span><strong>The Path Forward</strong></span></p><p>The NRA will move quickly through the restructuring process. Its day-to-day operations, training programs, and Second Amendment advocacy will continue as usual.</p><p>By exiting New York, where the NRA has been incorporated for approximately 150 years, the NRA abandons a state where elected officials have weaponized the legal and regulatory powers they wield to penalize the Association and its members for purely political purposes.</p><p>In the summer of 2018, then New York Attorney General candidate Letitia James vowed that, if elected, she would use the powers of her office to investigate the “legitimacy” of the NRA. </p><p>Without a shred of evidence to support the claim, she called the Association a “terrorist organization” and a “criminal enterprise.” As promised, she commenced an “investigation” upon being elected to the Office of NYAG and, predictably, filed a lawsuit seeking to dissolve the NRA just prior to the November 2020 national election.</p><p>The NRA filed a lawsuit in August 2020 against the NYAG similar to its lawsuit against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and the New York State Department of Financial Services, filed in 2018. The NRA pursues the defendants for attempting to “blacklist” the organization and its financial partners in violation of their First Amendment rights. The NRA will continue those legal actions. &nbsp;</p><p>“Under this plan, the Association wisely seeks protection from New York officials who it believes have illegally weaponized their powers against the NRA and its members,” says William A. Brewer III, counsel to the NRA in those cases. “The NRA will continue the fight to protect the interests of its members in New York – and all forums where the NRA is unlawfully singled out for its Second Amendment advocacy.”</p><p>With respect to its headquarters, the NRA has formed a committee to study opportunities for relocating segments of its business operations to Texas or other states. The Association&nbsp;will analyze whether a move of its headquarters, now located in Fairfax, Virginia, is in the best interests of its members. In the meantime, the NRA’s general business operations will remain in Fairfax.</p><p>To facilitate its strategic plan and restructuring, the NRA and one of its subsidiaries filed voluntary chapter 11 petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division. Chapter 11 proceedings are routinely utilized by businesses, nonprofits and organizations of all kinds to streamline legal and financial affairs. &nbsp;</p><p>The NRA also announced Marschall Smith will serve as Chief Restructuring Officer. A former Senior Vice President and General Counsel of 3M Company, Smith has more than 35 years of legal and business experience with an emphasis on compliance, corporate finance, and corporate governance.</p><p>“I am honored to join the nation’s oldest and largest civil rights organization during this important time,” Smith says. “Our goal is to work through the restructuring process efficiently and quickly – even as NRA leadership approaches 2021 with renewed energy and an expanding national platform. This plan has no impact on the NRA’s most important goal:&nbsp; serving its membership and protecting the Second Amendment.”</p><p>The NRA will propose a plan that provides for payment in full of all valid creditors’ claims. The Association expects to uphold commitments to employees, vendors, members, and other community stakeholders.</p><p>“The plan allows us to protect the NRA and go forward with a renewed focus on Second Amendment advocacy,” says NRA President Carolyn Meadows. “We will continue to honor the trust placed in us by employees, members and other stakeholders – following a blueprint that allows us to become the strongest NRA ever known.” </p><p><strong>Additional Information:</strong></p><p>Patrick J. Neligan of Neligan LLP, Dallas, Texas, is serving as debtor’s counsel; William (Wit) Davis is counsel to the NRA Board of Directors and its Special Litigation Committee; Brewer, Attorneys &amp; Counselors, Dallas, Texas, serves as special counsel to the NRA.

Approximately five million members strong, NRA continues its mission to uphold Second Amendment rights and is the leader in firearm education and training for law-abiding gun owners, law enforcement and the military.

    <p>Bad days happen. We all get tired, frustrated, annoyed, perturbed.  However, operating poorly on those days can have a major and lasting impact, turning bad days into worse days.</p>

<p>There are two good strategies for dealing with your bad day: reschedule or acknowledge.</p>

<h2 id="reschedule">Reschedule</h2>
<p>If the magnitude of badness is bad enough or if the stakes of the commitment are high enough, you should reschedule. There are very, very few things that you can’t actually reschedule, and trying to power-through important things on a terrible day often compounds problems.</p>

<p>A common example is when you’re scheduled to give a performance assessment. Managers often underestimate how high the stakes are for that meeting - say the wrong thing or seem unenthused or not have an ambitious path forward for your report and the impact can be a lasting negative impression. Furthermore, managers are often loath to reschedule performance assessments - your HR department has deadlines you have to hit, your report is anxiously waiting to have the review. However, if you’re having a very bad day, you should reschedule that meeting. Better to wait a couple days than to perform poorly in a high stakes meeting.</p>

<p>Your intuition will say that because a commitment is very important you should follow through and keep it on schedule, even if you’re having a bad day. However, you should reschedule that commitment because it is very important, and you are having a bad day.</p>

<h2 id="acknowledge">Acknowledge</h2>
<p>For lower stakes commitments and less bad days, keep to your schedule, but you should acknowledge your situation. Your poker face isn’t as good as you think it might be, and if you’re in a leadership position people will read more into your demeanor. You know that you’re frustrated because you got into a fender bender on the way to work; your report just sees a frustrated manager in a 1:1 and isn’t sure if it’s their performance, company performance, or something else causing the issue. Generally people assume the worst.</p>

<p>So just say what’s going on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Before we start this 1:1 I wanted to let you know that I’m a bit tired because I didn’t sleep well last night, so just know it’s not lack of enthusiasm for anything we talk about”</li>
  <li>“I’ve had a bit of a rocky morning unrelated to anything at work, so I’ll jump in and tie break if needed, but I’ll mostly listen today if that’s alright”</li>
</ul>

<p>Some simple disclaimers can help mitigate a meaningful amount of concern, false perceptions, and worry.</p>

<h2 id="other-peoples-bad-days">Other People’s Bad Days</h2>
<p>Other people have bad days too. As a manager or a leader, there are two main things to avoid - punishment and solutioning.</p>

<p>On the punishment front, if someone has a bad day every once and awhile where they aren’t as enthusiastic or productive as normal, that’s the cost of the doing business, not means for a performance ding. If you ever find yourself saying things like “The main focus for the next half is for you to get to 100% every day”, you’re setting everyone up for failure.</p>

<p>On the solutioning front, people often try to fix other people’s bad days. There’s nothing worse than being around someone who requires everyone around them to always be happy. Sometimes people are going to be sad, frustrated, mad, or tired. Let them be. Bad days are to be gotten through, not to be fixed. That doesn’t mean you can’t ask if everything is alright, but you shouldn’t insist that the problems be discussed or solved.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Have bad days. Let others have bad days. Use simple strategies to avoid making bad days worse.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p> The following is a listing of general categories of tables that you find
in databases. Emphasis is placed on the <i>roles</i> of each table type. Note
also that this category listing is simply my own paradigm based on my own
experiences. Other people will surely disagree with me (but I suspect their
disagreements would be mostly on the details). I present this info to help you
get a grasp on database design. Problem solving is easier when you can
<i>break down</i> the problem, and this listing is one approach to breaking
down database tables into different types.



</p><h2> Core Table </h2>

<p> <b>Definition:</b> This is a "main" table in your database. Without these,
there really wouldn't be any reason for the database to exist.

</p><p> <b>How to Identify:</b> You can identify the Core tables because they
contain the <i>most relationships</i> to other tables. They will frequently
have relationships to numerous Lookup and Detail tables. They also typically
contain more fields than any other table in the database (but not always).


</p><h3> Core Table Fields </h3>

<p> A Core table typically contains (at minimum) the following fields, using
certain naming conventions.

</p><ol>

	<li> A <b>primary key</b> that is an AutoNumber. Using an AutoNumber
	ensures that each record will have a unique ID. The name of this field
	will be the same name as the table, only singular plus the suffix "ID",
	i.e. for an "Employees" table, the primary key would be "EmployeeID".

	</li><li> A <b>text field</b> containing the <i>most important information</i>
	in the table. This field should be indexed because the table will be
	sorted by this field (i.e. alphabetically). Additionally, this field will
	be searched / querried on frequently. The name of this field will probably
	be the same name as the table, only singular, i.e. if the table was named
	"Employees", this field would be called "Employee". Note: It is not
	unheard of for this field to be split up, i.e. in an "Employees" table,
	you might have "FirstName", "LastName" instead of just "Employee".

	</li><li> Other fields as necessary, with some conditions. (Read on.)

</li></ol>



<h2> Lookup Table </h2>

<p> <b>Definition:</b> A Lookup table is a "reference" table that contains
categories, types, keywords, tags, or other "classification" labels.
Typically these categories represent some kind of finite scale. Examples
include: priority, severity, frequency, quality, etc. 

</p><p> <b>How to Identify:</b> A Lookup table typically has a single relationship
to a Core table or Detail table and usually contains only 2 or 3 fields. Due
to their nature, they are <i>not</i> sorted alphabetically.

</p><p> <b>Warning on Naming Lookup Tables:</b> Having already described Lookup
tables as containing types, categories, or tags, I strongly discourage you
from using the words "class", "type", "category" or similar to name the table.
Why, you ask? Simple answer: What does the word "type" mean? If I have two
Lookup tables that both list "types" of a Core table record, how exactly do I
distinguish between those two "types"? Here's a guideline to follow: if you
are about to use the word "type" in a Lookup table name, ask yourself "What
'type' of thing is this?" The answer to that question is the name you should
use instead. 


</p><h3> Lookup Table Fields </h3>

<p> A Lookup table typically contains the following fields, using the same
naming conventions as Core tables.

</p><ol>

	<li> A <b>primary key</b> that is a Long Integer (<u>not</u> an
	AutoNumber). The talbe will be sorted by this field such that the
	priorities / severities / frequencies all sort logically from "highest" to
	"lowest". The name will be "Table (singular) + ID". Note: A
	forward-thinking database designer will not number the records
	sequentially (1,2,3,4...) but rather by 10s or 100s, so as to allow easy
	addition of records later on.

	</li><li> A <b>text field</b> containing the category name. Name is "Table
	(singular)".

	</li><li> (Optional) Another, longer <b>text field</b> (or memo field)
	containing a description of this category.

</li></ol>


<h3> More on Adding Core Table Fields </h3>

<p> When you add a new text field to a Core table, ask yourself: "Does this
field represent a 'type' or 'class'?" If so, you should not add a text field,
you should add a Lookup table instead.

</p><p> In order to make your Lookup table work with your Core table, you need to
be able to create a relationship between them. Thus, we need to add another
field to the Core table: a <b>foriegn key</b>. This field should be a Long
Integer to match the type of the primary key in the Lookup tables. They should
have the same name as the primary key field name of the Lookup table.

</p><p> <b>Why do we create relationships based on numbers instead of text?</b>
Valid question. Here's why:

</p><ul>

	<li> Integers consume <i>less space</i> than text fields.

	</li><li> Integers <i>sort faster</i> than text.

	</li><li> It is easier to make typos with text than with integers. Such typos
	can quickly render querries useless.

	</li><li> The VB ADO controls have a very easy method for managing these kind
	of relationships.

</li></ul>



<h2> List Table </h2>

<p> <b>Definition:</b> This is another kind of "reference" table, similar to a
Lookup table, but it contains a longer listing of records and new records will
frequently be added. (Hence "List".) Examples include: Vendors, Shippers,
Suppliers, Reasons, Purposes, Genres, etc. You could think of it as a
"Growable Lookup" table.

</p><p> <b>How to Identify:</b> A List table typically has a single relationship
to a Core table or Detail table but often contains numerous fields. These
typically <i>are</i> be sorted alphabetically. List tables might even have
Lookup and Detail tables related to them!  

</p><p> <b>Warning on Naming:</b> The same warning given earlier regarding naming
Lookup tables applies to List tables as well.


</p><h3> List Table Fields </h3>

<ol>

	<li> A <b>primary key</b> that is an AutoNumber. An AutoNumber is used so
	as to easily allow the addition of new entries.  The name will be "Table
	(singular) + ID".

	</li><li> A <b>text field</b> containing the category name. This field will be
	indexed so it can be quickly sorted and querried on. Name is "Table
	(singular)".

	</li><li> Other fields as needed, following the same rules as Core tables. In
	other words, don't add new fields if you should be adding new Lookup /
	List / Detail tables instead.

</li></ol>

<p> <b>More on Adding Core Table Fields:</b> The same counsel given above on
adding a "type" field to a Core table applies here: don't add a text field
when you should be adding a  List table instead. To make List tables work, you
need to be able to create a relationship between Core and Lookup tables.
Thus, we need to add another foreign key field to the Core table, just as we
did for Lookup tables.

</p><p> <b>Note:</b> Because List tables have the  potential to grow into whole
entities of their own, some people prefer to implement them as Core tables
from the start. It's only a naming difference after all, and a rose is a rose.



</p><h2> Detail Table </h2>

<p> <b>Definition:</b> A Detail table contains specific items that are
subordinate to the records in a Core table. Examples include: Order Details,
Event Logs, Incident Reports, User Comments, and so forth.

</p><p> <b>How to Identify:</b> A Detail table typically has a single relationship
to a Core table, hence it contains a field that is a foreign key to a Core
table. It also typically has a 2-part name, the first part being the same as
the Core table to which it is related. For example, if there is a table called
"Orders", it might have a Detail table called "OrderItems". It is not unheard
of to have a Detail table with Lookup / List fields related to it. Sometimes
Detail tables will contain further Detail tables, but this is rare.


</p><h3> Detail Table Fields </h3>

<ol>

	<li> A <b>primary key</b> that is an AutoNumber. An AutoNumber is used so
	as to easily allow the addition of new detail records.  The name will be
	"Table (singular) + ID".

	</li><li> A <b>foreign key</b> that is a Long Integer. This will reference the
	primary key in a Core table and should have the same name.

	</li><li> Other fields as needed, following the same rules as Core tables. In
	other words, don't add new fields if you should be adding new Lookup /
	List / Detail tables instead.

</li></ol>


<h3> More On Adding Core Table Fields </h3>

<p> Happily, you do not need to add any additional fields to your Core table
to create a relationship to a Detail table. This is because <i>the Detail
records are responsible for maintaining the relationship</i> not the Core
table.

</p><p> That having been said, I have some additional counsel for designing your
Core tables: Add additional fields as needed to your Core tables but only if
you can <i>guarantee</i> that a given record will never require more than one
instance of that field. If you can imagine a case where more than one instance
will be required, make a Detail table instead. You can tell you've made a
mistake, if, for example, in a "Contacts" table you have fields that read
"PhoneNumber", "PhoneNumber1", "PhoneNumber2", etc.



</p><h2> Cross-Reference Table </h2>

<p> <b>Definition:</b> A Cross-Reference table exists only to create a
many-to-many relationship between two other tables. Typically, these two other
tables will be Core tables, but that is not a requirement.

</p><p> <b>How to Identify:</b> You can identify Cross-Reference tables because
they typically contain only 2 fields: 2 foreign keys that reference primary
keys in Core tables. A <i>compound primary key</i> will be made out of these
two foreign keys, so as to disallow duplicate entries of the same two foreign
keys.


</p><h3> Cross-Reference Table Fields </h3>

<ol>

	<li> A <b>foreign key</b> to one table. It will have the same name as the
	primary key in the table it references.

	</li><li> A <b>foreign key</b> to another table. It will have the same name as
	the primary key in the table it references.

	</li><li> Optionally, an additional text / memo field that describes this
	entry. These are rare, though.

</li></ol>


<h3> More on Adding Core Table Fields </h3>

<p> When you add a new foreign key to a Core table that will reference a
Lookup / List table, ask yourself if there is a chance that two of the
categories in that Lookup / List table could describe the Core table record,
you should be adding a Cross-Reference table instead. For example: if I was
making a "Movies" table, and I was about to add a foreign key to reference a
"Genres" List table, I should ask myself: "Is it possible that a movie …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>June, 2017: my partner Eve and I are stuck at the visa-on-arrival desk in the domestic transfer wing of Bole International Airport, Addis Ababa. The rest of the transfer passengers, all Ethiopian, are waltzing past us to form a monster queue at passport control. As soon as I get my precious stamp, I sprint off to hold our place before more passengers sneak in front of us.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Eve finds me, groggy from our redeye and nonplussed about navigating the Ethiopian visa desk on her own. “Why did you have to run off like that?!” Somehow, “so that we could wait at the departure gate instead of in the passport control line” doesn’t seem like a very good reason.</p><p>It was at this moment that I realized I was an unreasonably impatient person.</p><p>(In retrospect, I probably should have been tipped off by my compulsion of doing a mental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method" target="_blank">critical path analysis</a> on any everyday activity taking more than 15 seconds, but I just thought that was normal until I started dating people and noticed they often did things in a sub-optimal order.)</p><hr><p>Now that I’ve confessed to the sin of impatience, I’m going to spend the rest of this post trying to convince you that it’s actually a good thing.</p><p>(The good part is the habit of frequently asking yourself “how could this thing take less calendar time.” I don’t recommend manifesting it in annoying ways like ditching your partner in an Ethiopian airport.)</p><p>Being impatient is the best way to get faster at things. And across a surprising number of domains, being really fast correlates strongly with being effective.</p><p>Obviously, lots of these are non-causal correlations. Still, the sheer number of different datapoints is a surprising convergence:</p><h3 id="e-mail">E-mail</h3><p>It seems trivial, but lots of different people have observed that being slow to respond to emails is a bad sign, or that famous people whom you’d expect to be swamped respond surprisingly quickly.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sriramk/status/1214278840358359040" target="_blank">Sriram Krishnan</a>:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>the most famous, interesting, powerful people all read their own email</p></li><li><p>they’re almost universally good at responding to it quickly</p></li><li><p>they’re always very, very curious.</p></li><li><p>they have very little time. Anything with friction gets done “later”</p></li></ul></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-invest-in-startups" target="_blank">Sam Altman</a>:</p><blockquote><p>people tend to be either slow movers or fast movers and that seems harder to change. Being a fast mover is a big thing; a somewhat trivial example is that I have almost never made money investing in founders who do not respond quickly to important emails.</p></blockquote><h3 id="startups">Startups</h3><p>It’s become common wisdom that launching (and iterating) quickly is a major factor behind whether startups succeed.</p><p><a href="https://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec02/" target="_blank">Sam Altman again</a>:</p><blockquote><p>[Y]ou have to be decisive. Indecisiveness is a startup killer. Mediocre founders spend a lot of time talking about grand plans, but they never make a decision. They’re talking about you know I could do this thing, or I could do that other thing, and they’re going back and forth and they never act. And what you actually need is this bias towards action.</p><p>The best founders work on things that seem small but they move really quickly. But they get things done really quickly. Every time you talk to the best founders they’ve gotten new things done. In fact, this is the one thing that we learned best predicts a success of founders in YC. If every time we talk to a team they’ve gotten new things done, that’s the best predictor we have that a company will be successful.</p></blockquote><p>This propagates even down to the level of how quickly you deploy software changes. <a href="https://twitter.com/schrockn/status/1130569945891258369" target="_blank">Nick Schrock</a> on Facebook / Instagram moving fast and breaking things:</p><blockquote><p>Instagram was even faster operationally than Facebook. They had continuous deployment. Any engineer could deploy at any time (they would run a command called “Yolout” lol). Facebook was on weekly deploys at the time on the web and way slower on mobile.</p><p>IG story definitely lends credibility to the those-who-ship-faster-win argument</p><p>…Worth noting that Facebook learned from this. As the company grew, the release cadence got faster. First daily, then twice daily, and it is now continuous. It’s a remarkable achievement by the release engineering team.</p></blockquote><p>It’s not just Facebook; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations-ebook/dp/B07B9F83WM/" target="_blank"><em>Accelerate</em> found a strong correlation between deploy frequency and performance</a>:</p><blockquote><p>To summarize, in 2017 we found that, when compared to low performers, the high performers have:</p><ul><li><p>46 times more frequent code deployments</p></li><li><p>440 times faster lead time from commit to deploy</p></li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="appstools">Apps/tools</h3><p>The “speed matters a lot” principle applies even to things that are already very fast. Google has found that <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/why-performance-matters" target="_blank">users <em>dramatically</em> prefer faster webpages</a>:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>The BBC found they lost an additional 10% of users for every additional second their site took to load.</p></li><li><p>DoubleClick by Google found 53% of mobile site visits were abandoned if a page took longer than 3 seconds to load.</p></li></ul><p>…</p><ul><li>When AutoAnything reduced page load time by half, they saw a boost of 12-13% in sales.</li></ul></blockquote><p><a href="https://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters" target="_blank">James Somers</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Google famously prioritized speed as a feature. They realized that if search is fast, you’re more likely to search. The reason is that it encourages you to try stuff, get feedback, and try again. When a thought occurs to you, you know Google is already there. There is no delay between thought and action, no opportunity to lose the impulse to find something out. The projected cost of googling is nil. It comes to feel like an extension of your own mind.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/reflections-on-performance/" target="_blank">Nelson Elhage put it best</a>:</p><blockquote><p>What is perhaps less apparent is that <em>having faster tools changes how users use a tool or perform a task.</em> Users almost always have multiple strategies available to pursue a goal — including deciding to work on something else entirely — and they will choose to use faster tools more and more frequently. Fast tools don’t just allow users to accomplish tasks faster; they allow users to accomplish entirely new types of tasks, in entirely new ways. I’ve seen this phenomenon clearly while working on both Sorbet and Livegrep…</p><p>Many individual tests at Stripe would take 10-20s or more…. Because we succeeded at building Sorbet so that it could typecheck the entire codebase in that time window, it became the fastest way many developers could get decent feedback on their code, to check for basic typos, misused APIs, and other low-hanging classes of errors. Since it was their fastest option, we saw users reaching for Sorbet as their first line of checking their code fairly early on in our development and rollout. Getting even mediocre feedback and some confidence fast was much more important than anything that would take minutes.</p><p>Watching users use livegrep, I’ve seen a related upside from its performance…. Because livegrep is so fast, users use it <em>interactively</em> in a way I’ve rarely seen people interact with other search engines: they enter an initial query, and then, if they get too many or too few results, they edit it based on the result list, which gets a new set of results, which they continue to refine or expand until they hit on the results they are seeking.</p></blockquote><h3 id="personal-workflow">Personal workflow</h3><p><a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity" target="_blank">Sam Altman</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I also made an effort to learn to type really fast and the keyboard shortcuts that help with my workflow.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/we-are-typists-first-programmers-second/" target="_blank">Steve Yegge via Jeff Atwood</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I was trying to figure out which is the most important computer science course a CS student could ever take, and eventually realized it’s Typing 101.</p><p>The really great engineers I know, the ones who build great things, they can type.</p></blockquote><p>This matches my experience at Wave, where the best engineers are disproportionately likely to type quickly, know their keyboard shortcuts, and have invested a lot of time making their common tasks efficient.</p><p>Obviously, those aren’t the main things that make them good engineers—but I think they help in more than just the obvious ways.</p><h3 id="negotiations">Negotiations</h3><p>At Wave, when hiring, we’ve noticed that moving someone through the hiring process faster makes them <em>much</em> more likely to accept our offer. If we take a long time to get back to them or schedule the next steps, it both gives them more time to lose interest, and makes it seem like we’re not excited about them. Not a good look!</p><p>This is apparently common trope in sales as well—<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1204077/time-kills-deals" target="_blank">“time kills all deals”</a>.</p><p>Paul Graham on <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html" target="_blank">how the founders of Stripe got time on their side</a>:</p><blockquote><p>At YC we use the term “Collison installation” for the technique they invented. More diffident founders ask “Will you try our beta?” and if the answer is yes, they say “Great, we’ll send you a link.” But the Collison brothers weren’t going to wait. When anyone agreed to try Stripe they’d say “Right then, give me your laptop” and set them up on the spot.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://avc.com/2018/08/strike-when-the-iron-is-hot/" target="_blank">Fred Wilson</a> on the same effect in networking:</p><blockquote><p>That night when I got home I told the Gotham Gal “I met Danny Meyer today and he gave me his card and said I could call him whenever I need a table.” To which she replied “go there for lunch tomorrow.” And I told her “I don’t have a lunch tomorrow.” She said “Get one. He will remember who you are tomorrow but won’t next month.”</p></blockquote><h3 id="combat">Combat</h3><p>One of the most influential military strategy writers, John Boyd, is most famous for the idea of the “OODA loop:” that human action is an iterated process of <em>observing</em> the world, <em>orienting</em> within it, <em>deciding</em> how to respond and finally <em>acting</em> on the decision. Boyd’s claim was that <em>going through the OODA loop faster was a decisive advantage</em>:</p><blockquote><p>In order to win, we should operate at a faster tempo or rhythm than our adversaries—or, better yet, get inside [the] adversary’s Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action time cycle or loop … Such activity will make us appear ambiguous (unpredictable) thereby generate confusion and disorder among our adversaries—since our adversaries will be unable to generate mental images or pictures that agree with the menacing, as well as faster transient rhythm or patterns, they are competing against.</p></blockquote><p>As a recent example, for instance, many states and countries <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/macovid/">waited far too long</a> to lock down when the COVID epidemic hit because <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/03/09/plot-economics/" target="_blank">the virus got inside their OODA loop</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Right now, the perception of agency at all levels is falling.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last night I came across this question on Reddit:</p>
<blockquote>
    <header><h5><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/hkmnue/i_am_just_starting_to_learn_c_and_i_am_confused/">I am just starting to learn C# and i am confused about .NET framework &amp; .NET Core</a></h5></header>
    <p>Hello, I am just starting to learn c# and i am about to start with a course on Udemy by Mosh Hamedani called "C# Basics for Beginners: Learn C# Fundamentals by Coding".
       I can see that he is using .NET Framework but i have read that .NET Core is newer and is the future? I am really not sure where to start and would appreciate if anyone could help me. I would like to learn C# to have a better understanding with OOP and to learn a programming language to help with my University course. Thank you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all congratulations to the author for learning C# which is a great choice of programming language and for putting in the extra effort into better understanding the concepts of OOP (object oriented programming)! I genuinely hope that they'll have a great experience learning .NET and most importantly that they'll enjoy picking up some new skills and have fun along the way! I remember when I started to code (more than 20 years ago) and how much fun it was for me! It is also great to see how many people have replied with really helpful answers and provided some useful guidance to the original thread! It is a true testament to how supportive and welcoming the .NET community is! However, despite these positive observations I'm still a little bit gutted that such a question had to be even asked in the first place. I don't imply any fault on the author themselves - quite contrary - I actually really sympathise with them and can understand the sort of struggles which a new C# or F# developer may face. Questions like these really demonstrate how complex .NET has become over the years. It is a good time to take a step back and reflect!</p>
<h2 id="high-cognitive-entry-barrier">High cognitive entry barrier</h2>
<p>.NET has a high cognitive entry barrier. What I mean by this is that a new developer has to quickly familiarise themselves with rather boring and complex topics way too early in their educational journey. In particular questions around the differences between .NET, .NET Core, Mono, Xamarin, and the relation between C#, F#, VB.NET and what a target framework or a runtime is add very little to almost no benefit to one's initial learning experience. Most newcomers just want to read a tutorial, watch a video or attend a class and then be able to apply their newly learned skills in an easy and uncomplicated way. Ideally educational material such as purchased online courses or books from more than a few months ago should still be relevant today. Unfortunately neither of these are true for .NET. As a matter of fact it's almost given that any content which has been written more than a year ago is largely outdated today. Just think about the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-5/">upcoming release of .NET 5</a> and how it will invalidate most of the lessons taught just a few months ago. Another prominent example is the very short lived <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard">.NET Standard</a>. Once hugely evangelised and now de-facto dead. I personally think Microsoft, the .NET team and to some extent the wider .NET community has failed in making .NET a more beginner friendly language. I say this from a good place in my heart. Programming is an extremely powerful skill which can allow people to uplift themselves from all sorts of backgrounds and the harder we make it for beginners, the more exclusive we make the entry to our profession. I think the success of the next ten years will be defined by how accessible we make .NET to a whole new population of developers and I think there's some real work to be done in order to improve the current situation!</p>
<h2 id="what-about-others">What about others?</h2>
<p>Before you think that the current complexity is normal in programming and nothing endemic to .NET itself then I'm afraid to prove you wrong. <a href="https://www.php.net/">Take a look at PHP</a>. PHP has evolved a lot over the years and while it has introduced more complicated object oriented concepts and improved on its performance, it hasn't lost the beauty of its original simplicity at all. PHP is a great programming language to learn. Beginner content exist like sand on a beach. The online community, forums, Reddits and conferences are second to none. Most importantly, a student could pass on a several years old PHP book to another person and they would still get a lot of value from it. The language might have moved on, but many things which were taught on a beginner level are still 100% accurate today. This is a huge advantage which gets easily forgotten by more advanced developers like myself. Furthermore the distinction between language and the interpreter is not something which a new PHP developer has to understand. A new beginner doesn't have to wrap their head around such relatively unimportant topics to get started. They just know that they've installed PHP and it works.</p>
<p>Another great example (and there are many great examples) is <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. Go is not a new language at all. It's <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2009/11/hey-ho-lets-go.html">been around for more than 10 years</a> and despite huge improvements to the language, the compiler and the standard library it has remained faithful to its original simple design. Similar to PHP a new developer doesn't have to think about complicated nuances between "target frameworks", weird gotchas if they write Go in one IDE or another and they certainly don't have to look up a complicated version matrix to understand the intricate relations between an SDK, the runtime and newly available language features. There is just one version which maps to a well defined list of features, bug fixes and improvements in Go. It's documentation is simple and easy to comprehend. It is a very beginner friendly language.</p>
<h2 id="improving-net">Improving .NET</h2>
<p>Why is .NET so complicated? Well, the answer is perhaps not that easy itself. It's mostly history, legacy baggage, some bad decisions in the past and what I believe an overly eager desire (almost urgency) to change things for changes' sake. I will try to name a few selected issues from my personal observation, describe the problems which I have perceived and try to provide some constructive suggestions which I think could be a good improvement for the future.</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to the <strong>6 Sins of .NET</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#language-spaghetti">Language Spaghetti</a></li>
<li><a href="#version-overflow">Version Overflow</a></li>
<li><a href="#net-everywhere">.NET Everywhere</a></li>
<li><a href="#all-eyez-on-me">All Eyez on Me</a></li>
<li><a href="#architecture-break-down">Architecture Break Down</a></li>
<li><a href="#name-overload">Name Overload</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="language-spaghetti">Language Spaghetti</h3>
<p>If a person sets out to learn C# (like the author from the question above), what do they learn? Is it C# or .NET? The answer is both. C# doesn't exist without .NET and you cannot program .NET without C# (or F# or VB.NET for that matter). This is not a problem in itself, but certainly where some of the issues begin. A new beginner doesn't just learn C# but also has to learn the inner workings of .NET. Things get even more confusing when C# isn't the initial .NET language to learn. Supposedly the loose relationship between .NET languages shouldn't really matter because they compile into IL and become cross compatible. <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/vblang/issues/300">Except when they don't</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/csharp-unmanaged-constraint-leak.png"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/csharp-unmanaged-constraint-leak.png" alt="C# unmanaged constraint language leak"></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/framework-libraries#base-class-libraries">BCL (Base Class Libraries)</a> provide the foundation for all three languages, yet they are only written in C#. That's not really an issue unless entire features were written with only one language in mind and are extremely cumbersome to use from another. For example, F# still doesn't have <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/581">native support for <code>Task</code> and <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, converting between <code>System.Collection.*</code> classes and F# types is a painful undertaking and F# functions and .NET <code>Action&lt;T&gt;</code> objects don't map very well.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing though is when <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/nullable-references">changes to one language</a> force <a href="https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/577">additional complexity on another</a>.</p>
<p>Interop issues between those three languages are a big burden on new developers, particularly when they start with something else but C#. However, as painful as this might be, interop problems are not the only complexity which a new beginner has to face. Try to explain to a new C# user in a meaningful way when they should use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/inheritance">inheritance with standard classes</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/">interfaces</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/abstract-and-sealed-classes-and-class-members">abstract classes</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/default-interface-methods-versions">interfaces with default method implementations</a>. The differences between those options have been so watered down that one cannot explain the distinctions in a single coherent answer anymore.</p>
<p>Take this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2570814/when-to-use-abstract-classes">StackOverflow question</a> for an example. Nothing which has been described in the accepted (and most upvoted) answer below isn't also true for interfaces with default method implementations today:</p>
<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/abstract-class-question-stack-overflow.png"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/abstract-class-question-stack-overflow.png" alt="Abstract class question on StackOverflow"></a></p>
<p>Another great example is the growing variety of C# data types. When is it appropriate to create a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/data/using-web-api-with-entity-framework/part-5">data class</a>, an <a href="https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/all-about-c-sharp-immutable-classes2/">immutable data class</a>, a <a href="http://mustoverride.com/tuples_structs/">mutable struct</a>, an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct#readonly-struct">immutable struct</a>, a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.tuple?view=netcore-3.1">tuple class</a>, the new concept of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-tuples">named tuples</a> or the upcoming <a href="https://www.stevefenton.co.uk/2020/05/csharp-9-record-types/">record type</a>?</p>
<p>Seasoned .NET developers are very opinionated about when to use each of these types and depending on who a new beginner will ask, or which StackOverflow thread they'll read, they will most likely get very different and often contradicting advice. Anyone who doesn't think that this is a massive problem must be in serious denial. Learning a programming language is hard enough on its own. Learning a programming language where two mentors (who you might look up to) give you contradicting advice is even harder.</p>
<p>The irony is that many of the newly added language and framework features are supposed to make .NET easier to learn:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1281856685657616384"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/tweet-dotnet-easier.png" alt="Make .NET easier"></a></p>
<p><em>(BTW, I have been a huge proponent of dropping the <code>.csproj</code> and <code>.sln</code> files for a very long time but previously Microsoft employees defended them as if someone offended their family, so it's nice to finally see some support for that idea too! :))</em></p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I agree with Scott that *this particular feature* will make writing a first hello world app a lot easier than before, however, our friend Joseph Woodward makes a good point that nothing comes for free:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joe_mighty/status/1281899362281566208"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/tweet-dotnet-reboot-3.png" alt="With great power comes great responsibility"></a></p>
<p>And he's not alone with this idea:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/buhakmeh/status/1281985930279223298"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/tweet-dotnet-hard-2.png" alt=".NET is hard"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FransBouma/status/1282059062247555082"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/tweet-dotnet-hard-3.png" alt=".NET is hard"></a></p>
<p>It's not just about learning how to write C#. A huge part of learning .NET is reading other people's code, which is also getting inherently more difficult as a result:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/1amjau/status/1281908190167347200"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dusted-codes/images/blog-posts/2020-07-05/tweet-dotnet-hard-4.png" alt=".NET is hard"></a></p>
<p>Whilst I do like and support the idea of adding more features to C#, I cannot ignore the fact that it also takes its toll.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Tech Lead / Lead Developer / (Whatever it is called in your company) is a very interesting role that combines technical
work and leadership.</p>

<p>I’ve been in that role at a few different companies and I’d like to share my thoughts on what you can do to be effective in that role.</p>

<p>Equally, this article may also help you to decide if you want to try the role.
<!-- more --></p>



<p>Your first and foremost goal as a tech lead is to enable your team. Your team’s success is your success. </p>

<p>Yes, it was partly your technical chops that brought you into this role, but a tech lead is not the person who writes the best
code on the team (at least not just). </p>

<p>But it is the person who enables the entire team. And that means doing whatever it takes to help your team to 
succeed - whether it’s mentoring them technically or buying coffee - you have to do it.</p>

<p>Generally though you work on two fronts - product and technical.</p>

<h2 id="product">Product</h2>

<p>Yes, it is a role of a product manager to define a product vision, build a roadmap, and write user stories. But if user stories are missing details or the team does not know what they’ll be coding next week, it is your responsibility to step and help the team.
Sometimes it means you’ll fill the gaps yourself and tell the team about what you’ve heard in that long product meeting last Thursday.</p>

<p>Or sometimes you have to guide the product team on how to better translate their ideas into something developers can work with. </p>

<p>Shortly, you need to make sure that your team knows not only <strong>how</strong> to build software, but <strong>what</strong> to build.</p>

<h2 id="technical">Technical</h2>

<p>And speaking of the question of how to build, this is where your technical expertise comes in. </p>

<p>You need to make sure that your team knows how to build those fancy features and fix pesky bugs.</p>

<p>So if someone has not worked on a certain part of the codebase, sit with them and walk them through it.</p>

<p>If someone does not know which environment to deploy and where the API keys are, help them with that. </p>

<p>If someone is stuck, drop whatever you’re doing and unblock them. </p>

<h2 id="but-delegate-and-help-your-teammates-grow">But… delegate and help your teammates grow</h2>

<p>Although you’re there to protect your team and help them focus on writing code, you shouldn’t take away all non-coding activities from them. </p>

<p>You don’t have to be the only person who onboards new team members, defines architecture, and fleshes out user stories with product managers. </p>

<p>If you do that, you’ll soon end up being a bottleneck for your team. Moreover, you’ll prevent your team members from growing professionally.</p>

<p>Instead, identify activities which your teammates are interested in and let them run with that.</p>

<p>If you happen to be their line manager, it’s double as important to do that, as it’ll help them with their career growth. And if you’re not line managing your team, you may pair up with their manager and find out what career aspirations your colleagues have and give them a chance to go in that direction.</p>



<p>It’s your job as a tech lead to communicate and provide clarity. The product team may need to know how long some features will take - and you will have to tell a Product Manager that feature XYZ will take longer because the team needs to do essential refactoring.</p>

<p>Equally, your team needs to know that there might be a change in a product direction in two months, hence it is worthwhile to invest time in bringing framework ABC.</p>



<p>I have already mentioned working closely with product managers a few times. Here I want to stress why it is important and a few usual things you have to do.</p>

<p>First of all, you’re the main point of contact for all things technical to the product and other departments (if you are working on B2B software you may also have to interact with sales and professional services). So do expect a lot of questions from them about timelines and feasibility of their ambitious ideas.</p>

<p>But working with the product team is more than just answering their questions, it is also about being proactive. It is up to you to help them to build a roadmap. It is up to you to say that certain features are not possible without doing an essential technical work. It is up to you to say that all feature work should stop and you have to move to a different framework.</p>

<p>Equally, it is for you to say that some features are less complex than they thought before and that you can do them now.</p>

<h2 id="but-then-again-help-your-fellow-engineers-engage-with-product">But… then again help your fellow engineers engage with product</h2>

<p>Yes, you should protect engineers’ time, so don’t invite them to all the meetings. </p>

<p>But every software engineer is still interested to know which features they’ll be coding in six months’ time. Every software engineer has great ideas on how to improve the product.</p>

<p>So make that happen - make sure that the product team talks to engineers about product plans and that they all sit together to flesh out user stories.</p>



<p>A tech lead should trust their team to make the best decisions. If someone wants to introduce a 3rd party library XYZ for doing ABC, then let them do it. If your colleague proposes re-designing a part of the system, let them do it, too.</p>

<h2 id="but-be-prepared-to-ask-question-in-a-helpful-way">But… be prepared to ask question in a helpful way</h2>

<p>Whether it’s choosing a 3rd party library or deciding on architecture, make sure your colleagues have considered alternatives and impact on maintainability, project timelines, performance, security, etc. Feel free to ask questions about that.</p>

<p>Equally be prepared to step in and guide your fellow developers. For instance, if you notice that some tasks are taking much longer than expected, do speak to engineers who are working on them. They may be busy trying to consider every possible edge case that may never happen or do refactoring that should be a separate task. Help your team to avoid such rabbit holes.</p>



<p>As a technical lead you should look ahead and be strategic. More specifically, you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collaboratively establish architecture and coding standards</li>
  <li>Prioritise working on technical debt</li>
  <li>Look into newer version of the tools you use and make sure that you keep your codebase up to date</li>
  <li>See what other technologies are available and how they can help your team</li>
</ul>

<p>And that is impossible without you staying on the bleeding edge of technology. Remember, technical lead does have ‘Technical’ in it. </p>

<p>Yes, it’s a people intensive role, but it is also about technology. And on that note…</p>



<p>A technical lead is expected to code. But how much can vary significantly week by week. Sometimes, you’ll have the luxury of spending 80% of your time coding away new features. Sometimes, it’ll be only 20% of your time.</p>

<p>What is important is to set expectations with your colleagues. No-one would mind if you say that next week you’ll be able to only commit 30% of your time to writing code. But they will certainly be less happy if you forget to mention that. And that includes both other engineers, who may wait for you to redesign an API endpoint, or product managers who expect you to finish that feature that all users want to see.</p>



<p>Often as a tech lead you don’t have line management responsibilities, but it is often you who knows your teammates the best and it is you who can help them to get a promotion, salary increase, bonus, more equity, etc. </p>

<p>So do spend some time with their line manager and pass on feedback. Plus, their line manager can also tell you where you can help your colleagues in their career. You may even want to establish a pattern that you speak to their line manager and pass feedback on before their 1:2:1’s.</p>



<p>Tech lead is a great role. It allows you to write code and gain exposure to leadership, people, and product. But remember it’s not about you, but about helping you team to succeed!</p>

But water-cooling is occasionally used, particularly when overclocking. Like when Porsche transitioned from air-cooled to water-cooled engines in the 911 line of sports cars, this allows for increased performance by better dissipating waste heat. Even the best machines in the world—computers included — are slightly inefficient, and the byproduct of that inefficiency is often heat. Parts start breaking when they get too hot, so it is necessary to pull that heat away if you want to push the limits of performance.

Those computers are equipped with ARM processors that are designed for mobile devices that don’t usually have room for fans. Arm processors are particularly efficient and run on very little power, so the waste heat is minimal. But if you’re constantly maxing out your Raspberry Pi’s processor or if you’re overclocking, then you will want active cooling. A heatsink on the processor combined with a small fan is usually sufficient, but water cooling is even better. It is superior because heat transfers quickly from the heatsink to the water, which is then pumped away to a massive heatsink and fan. That’s probably overkill for a single Raspberry Pi, but it is great for a cluster like this one.</p><p>This cluster contains eight Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (2GB) computers that can work together to process distributed loads. They’re all cooled by an off-the-shelf water cooler system that was modified for this build. That has eight heat blocks that are attached to their respective Pis in series with laser-cut translucent red acrylic mounts. Cooling in series does mean that the last Pi in the chain will get the warmest water, but it should still be effective in this case. Power comes from a beefy power supply via USB. To ensure network throughput and reliability, the Pis are connected via Ethernet to a switch. A 7” touchscreen LCD is connected to the master Raspberry Pi node to display data about the current job and each Pi’s status. All of those components are mounted onto a large wood frame that was painted black. A strip of LEDs behind the frame creates a nice glow effect. Klements doesn’t go into the software side of this project, but the hardware alone is stunning to look at.</p></div></section></div>]]>

        <div>

    
    <h5>Posted on January 13, 2021 by Olivier Goffart and Simon Hausmann</h5>
    
  <p>
    With <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/">SixtyFPS</a>, we are creating a GUI toolkit. We chose
    Rust as the implementation language for our runtime library, and we want to make the same library usable from different
    programming languages. We believe programmers in all languages need to build GUIs - powered by the same runtime library.
    Rust, with its Foreign Function Interface (FFI) is an excellent choice.<br> In
    this article we look at how to expose an idiomatic C++ API from our Rust library.
  </p>

<h3 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h3>

    <p>Initially we chose to start with support for three languages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Rust</b>: Because it's our implementation language.</li>
        <li><b>C++</b>: It's a low level language that we're familiar with, and is still one of the most established languages
            in the embedded device space.</li>
        <li><b>JavaScript / TypeScript</b>: Because it's a very popular dynamic language.</li>
    </ul>


    <p><img src="https://sixtyfps.io/blog/expose-rust-library-to-other-languages/diagrams.png"></p><p>The Rust library (also known as a crate) is split into two parts, the shared implementation crate and a thin idiomatic
        API crate.
    </p>
    <p>For JavaScript we use <a href="https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon">Neon</a> to expose an API. Neon enables us
        to conveniently write JavaScript APIs and create an NPM package.</p>
    <p>The C++ part is a bit more challenging.</p>

<h3 id="expose-idiomatic-cpp-api-through-ffi">Expose an Idiomatic C++ API through Rust FFI</h3>

    <p>We decided to keep the C++ API only in the header files. This is because, unlike with Rust, there's
        no widely adopted C++ equivalent of Cargo, to help with downloading and building dependencies. If we want to ship
        binaries, then we have to maintain ABI compatibility, which is difficult in C++.<br> This way, we can also keep the
        C++ binding as lightweight as possible: for performance and memory footprint.
    </p>
    
    <p>Rust cannot expose a C++ API: structures can only be exported using a C representation (<code>#[repr(C)]</code>) and
        <code>extern "C"</code> functions. This means that we cannot expose Rust features like traits, generics, or
        destructors even if they have a C++ equivalent.
     </p>
     
    <p>The Rust ecosystem provides a few helper crates to make the job easier:</p>
     <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/eqrion/cbindgen"><b>cbindgen</b></a>: This helper crate automatically generates C/C++
            header files based on the <code>repr(C)</code> structure and the <code>extern "C"</code> functions. We use
            cbindgen to generate internal header files only. It's very helpful to avoid manually writing some unsafe error-prone
            boilerplate. 
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/mystor/rust-cpp">The <b>cpp</b> crate</a>: This
            helper crate is useful when calling C++ libraries from Rust, and we make use of that. However it is not suitable for
            exposing a C++ API from Rust. (Note: Olivier Goffart happens to be the maintainer.)
        </li>
                
        <li><a href="https://cxx.rs/">The <b>cxx</b> crate</a>: This would be a safer way than cbindgen to ensure that the
            interface between C++ and Rust is correct. While it could be useful, cbindgen already get us a long way. So
            we don't use it for now.
        </li>
    </ul>

<p>To build the correct shared library we use Cargo. The resulting library exports C mangled symbols. We ship
    a set of C++ header files that provide the C++ API and use the C functions behind the scenes. For convenience,
    we provide a CMake integration that ties together the library linkage and includes path setup. </p>

<h3 id="slices-vectors-strings">Slices, Vectors, and Strings</h3>

    <p>
    In FFI, passing a basic integer works out of the box. But what about more complex data types, like a 
    Rust slice or a string? Well, most classes like Rust's String, Vec, or slices are not <code>#[repr(C)]</code>,
    so we can't use them directly. While we could use these classes with an indirection, every simple call may need to go
    through a non-inline function boundary. So we would need to convert types, which means re-allocating memory.</p>
    <p>So instead of sharing code, we implemented data structures using <code>#[repr(C)]</code> and a stable ABI, so
        that they can be accessed directly from C++ and Rust, or any low-level language.</p>

   <p>For the slice we create a structure that holds a pointer and a size:</p>

<pre><code>#[repr(C)]
pub struct Slice&lt;'a, T&gt; {
    ptr: NonNull&lt;T&gt;,
    len: usize,
    phantom: PhantomData&lt;&amp;'a [T]&gt;,
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>Slice&lt;'a, T&gt;</code> can be dereferenced to <code>&amp;'a [T]</code>.
    In C++, cbindgen generates the following snippet:


</p><pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;
struct Slice {
    T *ptr;
    uintptr_t len;
};
</code></pre>

<p>We tell cbindgen to generate that code in a <code>cbindgen_private</code> namespace, and we wrap it an interface
similar to <code>std::span</code>.</p>

<p>We use strings and vectors to pass data between the engine and the user's code. This results in
    shared ownership where we want to avoid unnecessary copying of data. Our API is property based
    with setters and getters, therefore we implement shared ownership through
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write"></a>Implicit sharing / Copy-on-write. </p>

<p><img src="https://sixtyfps.io/blog/expose-rust-library-to-other-languages/sharedvector.png"></p><pre><code>#[repr(C)]
struct SharedVectorHeader {
    refcount: atomic::AtomicIsize,
    size: usize,
    capacity: usize,
}

#[repr(C)]
pub struct SharedVector&lt;T&gt; {
    inner: NonNull&lt;SharedVectorInner&lt;T&gt;&gt;,
}


/// These functions are called from the C++ constructor
/// and destructor
#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn sixtyfps_shared_vector_allocate(
    size: usize, align: usize) -&gt; *mut u8 { /*...*/ }
#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe extern "C" fn sixtyfps_shared_vector_free(
    ptr: *mut u8, size: usize, align: usize) { /*...*/ }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In Rust, the <code>impl Clone</code> and <code>impl Drop</code> make sure to increment
and decrement the atomic reference count and call the destructors. Similarly, in C++, we implement
copy constructor and destructor for the same purpose. Note that we still need to call the Rust
allocator function via the exposed C interface.</p>

<p>Now we can write a wrapper in C++:
(<a href="https://github.com/sixtyfpsui/sixtyfps/blob/master/api/sixtyfps-cpp/include/sixtyfps_sharedvector.h">full file</a>)
</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt; struct SharedVector {
  SharedVector() : inner(nullptr) {}

  SharedVector(const SharedVector &amp;other)
    : inner(other.inner)
  { if (inner) ++inner-&gt;refcount; }

  ~SharedVector() {
     if (inner &amp;&amp; (--inner-&gt;refcount) == 0) {
        for (auto it = begin(); it &lt; end(); ++it)
            it-&gt;~T();
        cbindgen_private::sixtyfps_shared_vector_free(
            reinterpret_cast&lt;uint8_t *&gt;(inner),
            sizeof(SharedVectorHeader)
                + inner-&gt;capacity * sizeof(T),
            alignof(SharedVectorHeader));
     }
  }
  SharedVector &amp;operator=(const SharedVector &amp;other)
  { /*...*/ }

  const T *begin() const { /* ... */ }
  const T *end() const { /* ... */ }
  void push_back(const T &amp;value) { /* ... */ }
  // ... more vector-like API

private:
  // (SharedVectorHeader is generated by cbindgen)
  cbindgen_private::SharedVectorHeader *inner;
};
</code></pre>


    <p>Right now these types, such as <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedvector">SharedVector</a> and
        <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedstring">SharedString</a>, are within the internal <code>sixtyfps-corelib</code>
        crate, and re-exported for Rust users through the public <code>sixtyfps</code> crate.  If there is demand for it, we may consider moving them into a
        smaller public crate with its own release schedule.</p>


<h3 id="destructors">Destructors</h3>

    <p>It's important to note that <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedvector">SharedVector</a> and
        <a href="https://sixtyfps.io/docs/rust/sixtyfps/struct.sharedstring">SharedString</a> have destructors in C++.
        We can't pass instances by value in <code>extern "C"</code> functions, because the calling conventions are different
        for arguments or return types with C++ destructors; not supported by C. Therefore we can only pass them by pointer
        or reference.
    </p>

    <p>If we want to add a C++ destructor, constructor, or any member functions to types directly exported by cbindgen to our public API, 
        we use 
        <code><a href="https://docs.rs/cbindgen/0.16.0/cbindgen/struct.ExportConfig.html">cbindgen::ExportConfig</a>::body</code>:</p>

<pre><code>cbindgen_config.export.body.insert(
    "MyStruct".to_owned(),
    "    inline MyStruct(); inline ~MyStruct();".to_owned()
  );
</code></pre>

    <p>
    Then we implement <code>MyStruct::MyStruct</code> and <code>MyStruct::~MyStruct</code> in a manually
    written header file, by either doing the memory management directly or calling C helper functions
    implemented in Rust.</p>
     <p>It's important to keep in mind that anything allocated from Rust needs to be freed by Rust. 
    The same applies to allocations in C++: they might not share the same allocator.
    </p>

<h3 id="dynamic-dispatch">Dynamic Dispatch (virtual table) Across the Language Barrier</h3>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Bon_toutou.png/186px-Bon_toutou.png"></p><p>
    Let's start with the classic example of dynamic dispatch in Rust:</p>
<pre><code>pub trait Animal {
  fn speak(&amp;self, loudness: i32) -&gt; String;
}
struct Dog { name: String }
impl Animal for Dog {
  fn speak(&amp;self, loudness: i32) -&gt; String
  { "Waf!".into() }
}
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn do_something_with(
  animal: &amp;dyn Animal
) {
  println!("{}", animal.speak(1));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately the above code does not work. How could we implement a class <code>Cat</code>
in C++ and call the <code>do_something_with</code> function? What if we wanted to implement
<code>do_something_with</code> in C++? The problem is that trait objects (<code>&amp;dyn</code>) are not
valid in FFI - their binary representation is not guaranteed to be stable. If we try to compile the above code,
we get this warning:</p>

<pre><code>warning: `extern` fn uses type `dyn Animal`, which is not FFI-safe
  | extern "C" fn do_something_with(animal: &amp;dyn Animal)
  |                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^ not FFI-safe
  = note: `#[warn(improper_ctypes_definitions)]` on by default
  = note: trait objects have no C equivalent</code></pre>

  <!--https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/trait-object.html-->
<p>Internally, <a href="https://brson.github.io/rust-anthology/1/all-about-trait-objects.html">we know</a> that
a trait object is composed of a pointer to the instance, and a pointer to a virtual table containing
pointers to functions. The layout of this trait object (which pointer comes first) and the layout of the virtual
table is an implementation detail of Rust. So we decided to re-implement them to work accross FFI. Instead of
writing a <code>trait Animal</code>, we write a virtual table by hand:</p>

<pre><code>#[repr(C)]
pub struct AnimalVTable {
    speak: extern "C" fn speak(
        VRef&lt;AnimalVTable&gt;, i32, &amp; mut SharedString);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, our virtual table has only one function. It is <code>#[repr(C)]</code> so that
cbindgen can generate a structure that the C++ code can access. Since we can't use <code>String</code>
we changed the return type to <code>SharedString</code>. We also pass the parameter by mutable reference instead
of just returning it, because it is not allowed to return a type that has a destructor.<br>
Instead of passing a trait object, our functions receive a pointer to the virtual table and
a …</p></div></section></div></div>

things like <a href="https://cheatsheets.xyz/mac/#screen-snip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to screen snip</a> on macOS and <a href="https://cheatsheets.xyz/bash/#kill-process-on-port" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kill a process</a> with
bash, all started adding up.</p><p>I moved them all into <a href="https://github.com/spences10/cheat-sheets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one repository</a> for ease of access for me.
These later were added to <a href="https://cheatsheets.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheat Sheets</a>.xyz</p><h2 id="notion"><a href="#notion" aria-label="notion permalink"></a>Notion</h2><p>Back when Notion was the new hotness and I jumped onto it as soon as a
discovered how flexable it was and more importantly cross platform, so
I could take notes on my phone, work laptop and personal computer yay
🎉</p><p>I used it for stashing ideas for later, todo lists, shopping lists,
kanban boards and the 100s of links that I thought looked interesting
but didn’t have time to read it there and then so stashed them in the
Notion links database (never to be seen again 🤣).</p><p>Downsides, the search wasn’t great, that’s been improved in recent
iterations but was quite annoying when you wanted to find something
quickly.</p><p>The Android version just straight up stopped working, I couldn’t use
it and the general feeling from Notion was meh!</p><p>I learned the hard way about differing Markdown versions with this too
after making a 8k word post in Notion then copy pasting into VSCode to
find all the artifacts for code snippets and word formatting
throughout.</p><p>Getting my data out of Notion was straightforward enough but what I
was left with was a but of a mess. Because of the nesting you were
able to do with pages in pages the export was a mess of files with
hashes appended to them which is going to take a while to untangle.</p><h2 id="roamresearch"><a href="#roamresearch" aria-label="roamresearch permalink"></a>RoamResearch</h2><p>Roam RoamResearch was a different way of logging notes, the default
was to open you on a daily notes view where you’d add your notes and
you could then move these into more long form documents with the help
of the graph behind it which helped you link information with
backlinks (<code>[[example backlink]]</code>) with the intention of helping you
collate information from differing sources.</p><p>The odd bit was that you could only add in a bullet fashion, so if you
want to add a code block it always looked weird inline of a unordered
list.</p><p>It got a bit weird and culty, I always get a bit wary when companies
start referring to their users/employees as tribes, “Roamers”,
“Googlers”, no thanks.</p><p>That along with starting it and staring at the rotating logo for an
age waiting for it to start, not helpful when you want to take a note
quickly.</p><p>Getting my data out of there was a straightforward button click
though.</p><h2 id="obsidian"><a href="#obsidian" aria-label="obsidian permalink"></a>Obsidian</h2><p>Obsidian, the free (or one off licence payment) offering that is a
standalone app, much like Notion (which I know is web based too)
available on macOS, Windows and Linux.</p><p>The idea is that the notes you take are hosted locally on your
machine, no central storage location like with Notion and
RoamResearch.</p><p>With Obsidian you are in direct control of the Markdown, store it
wherever you like.</p><p>This brings up questions about how and where you store your data, I’ve
now added all the exports from Notion and RoamResearch to a git
repository which is on a private GitHub repo.</p><p>This is nice, there’s an import option for Roam exports, you can
configure your daily notes location and it has a super nice graph
view.</p><p>This experience felt a lot like working in VSCode, but it wasn’t
VSCode! 😬</p><p>I’m very comfortable with editing Markdown in VSCode and felt a bit
cheated when I couldn’t select a tab or move lines around.</p><h2 id="foam"><a href="#foam" aria-label="foam permalink"></a>Foam</h2><p>So, Foam! <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foam is a VSCode extension</a> that enables the features of
Obsidian but with the editing power of VSCode, so no brainier, right?</p><p>Foam are the first to admit that <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/#getting-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener">things may be a little rough</a> as
it’s still in preview. But I <em>really</em> like working with my Markdown in
VSCode so I’m prepared for the teething issues.</p><p>There’s a <a href="https://discord.gg/rtdZKgj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super welcoming Discord</a> to join and talk to other users
and the developers.</p><p>With my new liberated data from Notion and RoamResearch I’m in the
process of working through all this data which is easy to visualise
with the VSCode file explorer and built in graph view of Foam.</p><p>The Foam graph view is still a WIP so I’m referring to Obsidian to
check that out for now.</p><p>I’m super excited following the progress of this!</p><a href="#top-of-page" aria-label="back to top navigation"><p>Back to Top</p></a></article><div><p>If you're interested in occasional updates from me about what I'm working on and want useful information you can sign up to my newsletter.</p><p>Important dev related content, directly to your inbox (for free).</p><p><span role="img" aria-label="sparkles">✨ ✨ ✨ ✨ ✨ ✨ ✨</span>I'm giving away sticker packs every Monday, Wednesday and Friday to a randomly chosen newsletter subscriber. 👇</p><p><a href="https://scottspence.com/newsletter">Newsletter signup...</a></p></div></div>]]>

<p>The PETAL Stack in Elixir means:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>P</strong>hoenix</a></li><li><a href="https://elixir-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>E</strong>lixir</a></li><li><a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>T</strong>ailwindCSS</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>A</strong>lpine.js</a></li><li><a href="https://hex.pm/packages/phoenix_live_view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>L</strong>iveView</a></li></ul>



<p>While PETAL is also a pretty sounding name, this technology combination is  extremely powerful and productive for the right kinds of projects.</p>



<p>What kinds of projects? Web applications (or SaaS) with a responsive and reactive UI. This isn’t for building an API first service like Stripe or a mobile application you download in an App Store. This is specifically for building a web application with a responsive and reactive user experience that would otherwise require a SPA (Single Page Application) Javascript front end to enable the user experience you wanted.</p>



<p>If that sounds beneficial to you then read on! If you’re already sold on this approach, jump to the bottom for a collection of resources.</p>



<h2>It’s about the layers</h2>



<p>First, the base foundation of Elixir + Phoenix + LiveView is powerful. It has been the inspiration for other projects like <a href="https://laravel-livewire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laravel LiveWire</a> and <a href="https://hotwire.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rails Hotwire</a>.</p>



<p>What the Elixir + Phoenix + LiveView approach shares with LiveWire and Hotwire, is a removal of many layers that people assumed were required. In order to offer a smooth, responsive UI experience, we must build a Javascript frontend SPA (Single Page App), right? For awhile now, that has been true.</p>



<p>But what if I could build an interactive web application that felt immediate and was very responsive and reactive to the user <em>without</em> building a SPA? If I could do that, then I could eliminate the following layers:</p>



<ul><li>JSON serialization from server to client</li><li>GraphQL types, resolvers, queries and mutations</li><li>REST controllers</li><li>Javascript routers</li><li>Javascript data stores</li><li>JSON serialization from client to server</li></ul>



<p>I choose to go the LiveView route not because Javascript is “bad” or because “I don’t want to use javascript”, but because I can completely <em>eliminate</em> all those layers! Front to back testing <em>also</em> becomes a much easier!</p>



<p>Removing those layers means maybe I don’t need a separate and dedicated front-end team to manage the complexities of our continually changing Javascript build pipeline. This means a smaller team can deliver compelling solutions faster than rival products built by much larger teams.</p>



<p>The removal of entire layers that require design, testing, maintenance and coordination between multiple people and teams brings a <em>huge boost to team productivity</em>!</p>



<h2>Still using javascript</h2>



<p>There are still elements of the UI that need javascript. A clear example is opening a popup menu. Clicking to open or close a menu should not require communication with the server!</p>



<p>This is where <a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alpine.js</a> comes in. Alpine.js was created by Caleb Porzio, the creator of Laravel LiveWire. While creating LiveWire, he realized that some lightweight Javascript was still needed. He liked the Vue.js style so he created Alpine.js specifically to fill that role.</p>



<p>Alpine.js was created with this LiveView/LiveWire approach in mind. Because of that, it pairs really well with Phoenix LiveView.</p>







<p>Alpine.js is a very clean approach that adds just enough javascript to smooth the lines between what should stay client side and letting LiveView do what it does best.</p>



<h2>Making it pretty</h2>



<p>The last part of PETAL we haven’t covered is the <strong>T</strong> for <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TailwindCSS</a>. Tailwind is a new “utility first” approach to CSS. Your first reaction when seeing it is probably going to be, “Yuck! I don’t like this!”. That was my first thought too. You should give it a chance though.</p>



<p>How do I feel about it now? Now I don’t want to style my applications the “old way” again!</p>



<p>There is a separate <a href="https://tailwindui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TailwindUI</a> website that is commercial. You pay for access to pre-built or pre-designed components, sections, layouts, or even whole pages.</p>







<p>The benefits that I see from TailwindCSS and TailwindUI is what it enables individuals and small teams to do. I used to spend hours tweaking my UI CSS and succeeding in making it only marginally less crappy. The benefit I got from TailwindUI (the paid for designed components), is that I could rapidly build something that looked great. Trading my money for time is a good exchange in my book! However, that only describes the benefit of paying for designed components. How’s that different than buying something like Bootstrap designed components and pages?</p>



<p>That’s where the other, less tangible benefits of TailwindCSS come in. I’ll try to explain some here:</p>



<ul><li>It doesn’t take long to get the hang of it. Then I became much more productive when designing <em>new</em> things myself.</li><li>The classes are very focused in what they do. I can “compose” what I want and don’t have to worry about changing a class style and having it mess up something elsewhere in my application.</li><li>Co-locating the CSS styles (by use of classes) feels more natural. I’m not switching files and jumping my focus around when working on the UI.</li><li>Co-locating the CSS styles directly in my markup means that when I delete a component I’m not using, I’m not left with orphaned CSS classes and files.</li><li>It makes it really easy to put different media query breakpoints on your layouts. Tailwind makes it easier to have responsive layouts that better support a variety of screen dimensions.</li></ul>



<h2>PETAL together now!</h2>



<p>With all the PETAL pieces introduced, I can explain the appeal of the fully combined stack. Using this development approach…</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>I can build a compelling, sleek, responsive web application by myself.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>This is huge! </p>



<p>Going back to the early days of Rails with the “15-minute blog” videos. It got people excited that a single developer could build a web application and deliver it by themselves! Then, over time, user expectations shifted to expect experiences that only a SPA could bring. That required ever more technology and layers to enable. Soon it required larger teams of specialized developers to create a competitive web application.</p>



<p>When I use the PETAL Stack, I have a competitive advantage. I can create a service that has an audience willing to pay money, but it’s never going to be the next Twitter, Facebook or Uber. A business could be successful but never to a scale where it supports a large team of developers and designers from the revenue. However, it starts to make business sense when only 1 or 2 people are needed to build and deliver it. Many business ideas can provide more than enough revenue for that!</p>



<p>It doesn’t have to be a smaller business idea though. This technology stack also enables a small team (like 4-5 developers) to create and maintain a service that only much larger teams and companies would otherwise take on. The more people you add to a team the more time is spent on administration, communication, and coordination. Being <em>able</em> to keep a team small becomes an additional competitive advantage!</p>



<div><div><div><p>In episode #24 of the Thinking Elixir Podcast, we talk with Chris McCord, the creator of Phoenix and LiveView about the PETAL stack. He shares his appreciation for the pairing with Alpine.js and TailwindCSS.</p><blockquote data-secret="yTk6gy6S5P"><a href="https://thinkingelixir.com/podcast-episodes/024-liveview-uploads-with-chris-mccord/">#024 LiveView Uploads with Chris McCord</a></blockquote></div></div></div>



<p>There is a lot to love when you build using the PETAL Stack. If it fits the kinds of problems you aim to solve, then it can be your competitive advantage and a powerful enabling force.</p>

<h2>Coming Soon</h2>



<p>I hear you say, “So I get it. As an individual or as a small team, I can be more productive by eliminating the need for those other tech stack layers. Why choose Elixir over Rails Hotwire or Laravel LiveWire?”</p>



<p>This is where Elixir pulls ahead and really differentiates itself!</p>



<p>A look at why the Elixir + Phoenix + LiveView part of the stack is a powerful solution.</p>

<p>One of the concerns I’ve seen aimed at Bitcoin is the claim that it’s a&nbsp;Ponzi scheme. The argument suggests that because the Bitcoin network is contin­u­ally reliant on new people buying in, that eventu­ally it will collapse in price as new buyers are exhausted.</p>



<p>So, this article takes a&nbsp;serious look at the concern by comparing and contrasting Bitcoin to systems that have Ponzi-like charac­ter­is­tics, to see if the claim holds up.</p>



<p>The short version is that Bitcoin does not meet the defin­i­tion of a&nbsp;Ponzi scheme in either narrow or broad scope, but let’s dive in to see why that’s the case.</p>







<h2><strong>Defining a&nbsp;Ponzi Scheme</strong></h2>



<p>To start with tackling the topic of Bitcoin as a&nbsp;Ponzi scheme, we need a&nbsp;defin­i­tion.</p>



<p>Here is how the <a href="https://www.investor.gov/protect-your-investments/fraud/types-fraud/ponzi-scheme">US Securi­ties and Exchange Commis­sion defines one</a>:</p>



<p><em>“A Ponzi scheme is an invest­ment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors. Ponzi scheme organizers often promise to invest your money and generate high returns with little or no risk. But in many Ponzi schemes, the fraud­sters do not invest the money. Instead, they use it to pay those who invested earlier and may keep some for themselves.</em></p>



<p><em>With little or no legit­i­mate earnings, Ponzi schemes require a&nbsp;constant flow of new money to survive. When it becomes hard to recruit new investors, or when large numbers of existing investors cash out, these schemes tend to collapse.</em></p>



<p><em>Ponzi schemes are named after Charles Ponzi, who duped investors in the 1920s with a&nbsp;postage stamp specu­la­tion scheme.”</em></p>



<p>They further go on to list red flags to look out for:</p>



<p><em>“Many Ponzi schemes share common charac­ter­is­tics. Look for these warning signs:</em></p>



<p><strong><em>High returns with little or no risk.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Every invest­ment carries some degree of risk, and invest­ments yielding higher returns typically involve more risk. Be highly suspi­cious of any “guaran­teed” invest­ment oppor­tu­nity.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Overly consis­tent returns.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Invest­ments tend to go up and down over time. Be skeptical about an invest­ment that regularly gener­ates positive returns regard­less of overall market condi­tions.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Unreg­is­tered invest­ments.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Ponzi schemes typically involve invest­ments that are not regis­tered with the SEC or with state regula­tors. Regis­tra­tion is impor­tant because it provides investors with access to infor­ma­tion about the company’s manage­ment, products, services, and finances.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Unlicensed sellers.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Federal and state securi­ties laws require invest­ment profes­sionals and firms to be licensed or regis­tered. Most Ponzi schemes involve unlicensed individ­uals or unreg­is­tered firms.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Secre­tive, complex strate­gies.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Avoid invest­ments if you don’t under­stand them or can’t get complete infor­ma­tion about them.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Issues with paper­work.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Account state­ment errors may be a&nbsp;sign that funds are not being invested as promised.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Diffi­culty receiving payments.</em></strong><em>&nbsp;Be suspi­cious if you don’t receive a&nbsp;payment or have diffi­culty cashing out. Ponzi scheme promoters sometimes try to prevent partic­i­pants from cashing out by offering even higher returns for staying put.”</em></p>



<p>I think that’s a&nbsp;great set of infor­ma­tion to work with. We can see how many of those attrib­utes, if any, Bitcoin has.</p>



<h2><strong>Bitcoin’s Launch Process</strong></h2>



<p>Before we get into comparing Bitcoin point-by-point to the above list, we can start with a&nbsp;recap of how Bitcoin was launched.</p>



<p>In August 2008, someone identi­fying himself as Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin.org.</p>



<p>Two months later in October 2008, Satoshi released the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin white paper</a>. This document explained how the technology would work, including the solution to the double-spending problem. As you can see from the link, it was written in the format and style of an academic research paper, since it was presenting a&nbsp;major technical break­through that provided a&nbsp;solution for well-known computer science challenges related to digital scarcity. It contained no promises of enrich­ment or returns.</p>



<p>Then, three months later in January 2009, Satoshi published the initial Bitcoin software. In the custom genesis block of the blockchain, which contains no spend­able Bitcoin, he provided a&nbsp;time-stamped article headline about bank bailouts from The Times of London, likely to prove that there was no pre-mining and to set the tone for the project. From there, it took him six days to finish things and mine block 1, which contained the first 50 spend­able bitcoins, and he released the Bitcoin source code that day on January 9<sup>th</sup>. By January 10<sup>th</sup>, Hal Finney publicly tweeted that he was running the Bitcoin software as well, and right from the begin­ning, Satoshi was testing the system by sending bitcoins to Hal.</p>



<p>Inter­est­ingly, since Satoshi showed how to do it with the white paper more than two months before launching the open source Bitcoin software himself, techni­cally someone could have used the newfound knowl­edge to launch a&nbsp;version before him. It would have been unlikely, due to Satoshi’s big head start in figuring all of this out and under­standing it at a&nbsp;deep level, but it was techni­cally possible. He gave away the key techno­log­ical break­through before he launched the first version of the project. Between the publi­ca­tion of the white paper and the launch of the software, he answered questions and explained his choices for his white paper to several other cryptog­ra­phers on an <a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/">email list</a> in response to their critiques, almost like an academic thesis defense, and several of them could have been technical enough to “steal” the project from him, if they were less skeptical.</p>



<p>After launch, a&nbsp;set of equip­ment that is widely believed to belong to Satoshi remained a&nbsp;large Bitcoin miner throughout the first year. Mining is neces­sary to keep verifying trans­ac­tions for the network, and bitcoins had no quoted dollar price at that time. He gradu­ally reduced his mining over time, as mining became more distrib­uted across the network. There are nearly 1&nbsp;million bitcoins that are believed to belong to Satoshi that he mined through Bitcoin’s early period and that he has never moved from their initial address. He could have cashed out at any point with billions of dollars in profit, but so far has not, over a&nbsp;decade into the project’s life. It’s not known if he is still alive, but other than some early coins for test trans­ac­tions, the bulk of his coins haven’t moved.</p>



<p>Not long after, he trans­ferred owner­ship of his website domains to others, and ever since, Bitcoin has been self-sustaining among a&nbsp;revolving devel­op­ment commu­nity with no input from Satoshi.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is open source, and is distrib­uted around the world. The blockchain is public, trans­parent, verifi­able, auditable, and analyz­able. Firms can do analytics of the entire blockchain and see which bitcoins are moving or remaining in place in various addresses. An open source full node can be run on a&nbsp;basic home computer, and can audit Bitcoin’s entire money supply and other metrics.</p>



<p>With that in mind, we can then compare Bitcoin to the red flags of being a&nbsp;Ponzi scheme.</p>



<h2><strong>Investment Returns: Not Promised</strong></h2>



<p>Satoshi never promised any invest­ment returns, let alone high invest­ment returns or consis­tent invest­ment returns. In fact, Bitcoin was known for the first decade of its existence as being an extremely high-volatility specu­la­tion. For the first year and a&nbsp;half, Bitcoin had no quotable price, and after that it had a&nbsp;very volatile price.</p>



<p>The online writings from Satoshi still exist, and he barely ever talked about finan­cial gain. He mostly wrote about technical aspects, about freedom, about the problems of the modern banking system, and so forth. Satoshi wrote mostly like a&nbsp;programmer, occasion­ally like an econo­mist, and never like a&nbsp;salesman.</p>



<p>We have to search pretty deeply to find instances where he discussed Bitcoin poten­tially becoming valuable. When he did talk about the poten­tial value or price of a&nbsp;bitcoin, he spoke very matter-of-factly in regards to how to catego­rize it, whether it would be infla­tionary or defla­tionary, and admitted a&nbsp;ton of variance for how the project could turn out. Digging around for Satoshi’s quotes on the price of value of a&nbsp;bitcoin, here’s what I&nbsp;found:</p>



<p><em>“The fact that new coins are produced means the money supply increases by a&nbsp;planned amount, but this does not neces­sarily result in infla­tion. If the supply of money increases at the same rate that the number of people using it increases, prices remain stable. If it does not increase as fast as demand, there will be defla­tion and early holders of money will see its value increase.”</em></p>

January 16, 2021 | https://yiufung.net/post/anki-org/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://yiufung.net/post/anki-org/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>It’s been a while since the last post, one reason is that for the past few
months I’ve been drawn to <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>, the spaced-repetition flashcard program. If you
haven’t checked it out yet, I strongly recommended it. (<a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Why? Read Michael
Nielson’s article</a>)</p>
<p>One question recurred among Anki community is how to generate cards quickly. 3
approaches are common:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Anki’s “Import” function to read csv/tsv</li>
<li>Write Python scripts with <a href="https://github.com/kerrickstaley/genanki">genanki</a> that generate <code>.apkg</code> for import</li>
<li>Use third-party browser plugin that supports <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159">AnkiConnect</a> (e.g. <a href="https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan/">yomichan</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>While these are viable and oftentimes powerful options, for users they usually
don’t come as flexible for customization (change matching of columns &amp; fields,
ad-hoc editing, formula/highlight/table/etc support). Programming experience is
yet another entry barrier for many people.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll try to demonstrate some workflows of creating cards in Emacs
based on <a href="https://github.com/louietan/anki-editor">anki-editor</a>, a package that connects Emacs’s Org-mode and AnkiConnect.
Combining <code>anki-editor</code>'s connectivity, Emacs’s customizability, and Org-mode’s
rich formatting and export support, a few card generation scenarios can be
handled with ease:</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilize a powerful editor for card editing</li>
<li>Capture ideas with least interruption as you encounter interesting content</li>
<li>Customize shortcut keys and workflow, minimize mouse pointing/clicking</li>
<li>etc…</li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Note for Anki users who hear of Org-mode for the first time</strong></span>: Take a look at
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgizHHd7nOo">John Kitchin - org mode is awesome</a> to have a grasp of Org’s capability. (Find a
pencil and mark down the date, it may become commemorable later :)). If you
already knew that Org can do outline-structured editing, has tagging system and
rich export support, you should be able to follow the post fine.</p>
<p><span><strong>Note for setup</strong></span>: Most setup is done in Emacs configuration language, Emacs
Lisp, under Linux. I will point out where I think is relevant to explain the
details, and provide download at the end of article. But as always, YMMV in
other platforms. If you are not sure how to configure, comment below, take a
look at <a href="https://github.com/yiufung/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.el">my init.el</a>, or join the friendly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/">r/emacs</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/orgmode/">r/orgmode</a> and raise your hand.</p>
<h2 id="emacs-org-mode-as-editor-to-anki">Emacs/Org-mode as editor to Anki</h2>
<p>An Anki note is represented as an Org entry with <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Property-syntax.html#Property-syntax">property</a> <code>ANKI_NOTE_TYPE</code>. Each
subheading of the entry corresponds to a <code>field</code> in Anki. <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Tags.html">Tags</a> can be synchronized
to Anki. <code>anki-editor</code> uses property value <code>ANKI_NOTE_ID</code> to synchronized an Org
entry and corresponding Anki note.</p>

</video>

<p>Upon pushing to Anki, <code>anki-editor</code> will export Org tree as Anki-compatible HTML.
However, without a proper CSS file it will still look plain. So we replace it
with <a href="https://github.com/gongzhitaao/orgcss">gongzhitaao/orgcss</a>, a simple stylesheet for Org-exported HTML, to obtain a
proper styling for source code blocks, lists, tables, etc. (Download at the end

<p>Apart from “Basic”, another commonly-used note type is <em>Cloze Deletion</em>.</p>

<li>By default <code>anki-editor-cloze-{dwim,region}</code> always asks for hints and requires
card number input. I don’t use hints much, and usually want card number to
increase, so two helper functions
<code>anki-editor-cloze-region-{auto-incr,dont-incr}</code> are written to skip these
behaviors. (Note: Such kind of customizations are ubiquitous in Emacs
community, where users don’t have to wait for upstream to implement a desired
new feature. This is quite different from Anki community where version updates
frequently break existing add-ons, leaving end-users hands tied, or new
features being delayed due to technical difficulty in understanding the code
base.)</li>
<li>A function is added to <code>org-capture-after-finalize-hook</code> to reset cloze number
to 1 after each capture</li>
<li>By default <code>anki-editor-push-notes</code> will push the whole file. This is slow when
the file contain old entries that didn’t really need to change. In my
workflow, I keep all pending notes under <code>Dispatch Shelf</code> subtree, and push that
whole subtree (with <code>&lt;f9&gt;</code>) when I feel ready. Once they’re pushed, I would
<a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Refile-and-copy.html#Refile-and-copy">refile</a>/relocate them under <code>Exported</code> subtree. <code>anki-editor-push-tree</code> is added
for this purpose.</li>
<li>Assign handy keybindings (<code>&lt;f9&gt;-&lt;f12&gt;</code> in this case) to your liking.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="org-capture-swiftly-create-cards">Org-capture: Swiftly create cards</h2>
<p>Now that we know what a proper Anki note should look like in Org-mode, we can
define a template and use <code>org-capture</code> to create cards swiftly as we came across
different materials on web.</p>

</code></pre></div><ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/fgizHHd7nOo?t=203">What’s org-capture?</a></li>
<li>Note the <code>%x</code> in <code>org-capture-templates</code>: this means we want to fill in content of
X clipboard upon capture. For Cloze note, this would be in <code>Text</code> field. For
Basic note, I usually like to put them in <code>Back</code>, and come up with a good
question for <code>Front</code> field.</li>
<li>The key to be as lazy as possible is to let Emacs not only read explicitly
copied/paste content (via <code>C-c</code> / <code>C-v</code>, the <code>CLIPBOARD</code> selection), but also the
<strong>currently selected text</strong> (the <code>PRIMARY</code> selection). That way, after highlighting
text with mouse I can immediately call <code>org-capture (C-c c)</code> in Emacs. See
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Clipboard">Clipboard - ArchWiki</a> for details.</li>
<li>Header name does not really matter in <code>anki-editor</code>, <code>%H:%M</code> is an arbitrary
choice</li>
<li>I put most notes in a <code>Mega</code> deck following Michael Nielson’s advice (<a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Search
“Use one big deck”</a>). It served me well. If you have many decks/note types, you
may want to create multiple capture templates, or write some elisp functions
to reduce typing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enabling X clipboard support makes Emacs versatile for textual input from any
other applications. For me it’s mainly web articles from Firefox, and sometimes
books in PDF.js … Or, do I really need PDF.js when I can read books in
<a href="https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools"><code>pdf-tools</code></a>, the best PDF reader in Emacs?</p>

<p>Emacs command <code>fill-paragraph (M-q)</code> comes handy for aligning irregular-shaped
text copied from PDF.</p>
<h2 id="org-download-plus-flameshot-add-image-too">org-download + Flameshot: Add image too</h2>
<p>Lastly, it’s also good to use screen crop as note content. Thankfully
<code>anki-editor</code> also supports that, we only need to find a convenient way to
download image in Emacs.</p>

</video>

<p>There are many packages for adding images to Emacs, as well as for screenshots.
I chose the combination of <a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/org-download">abo-abo/org-download</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lupoDharkael/flameshot">Flameshot</a>. While Flameshot
allows me to add preliminary annotation, it’s a little tricky to get it working
properly. Curious minds may search “flameshot” in <a href="https://github.com/yiufung/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.el">my config</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="integrate-with-x-window-manager">Integrate with X Window Manager</h2>
<p>To start <code>org-capture</code> frame in whichever application I’m using, I took a little
elisp function <a href="https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/46460/org-capture-frame-with-no-splits">here</a>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>defun</span> <span>make-orgcapture-frame</span> ()
    <span>"Create a new frame and run org-capture."</span>
    (<span>interactive</span>)
    (<span>make-frame</span> '((<span>name</span> . <span>"org-capture"</span>) (<span>window-system</span> . <span>x</span>)))
    (<span>select-frame-by-name</span> <span>"org-capture"</span>)
    (<span>counsel-org-capture</span>)
    (<span>delete-other-windows</span>)
    )
</code></pre></div><p>Then assign a keybinding in X Window Manager (<code>xmonad</code> in my case) that runs
<code>emacsclient -e '(make-orgcapture-frame)'</code>. Now I may create cards with a key combo anywhere in my system.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This setup has served me well in the past few months. During daytime, as I was
writing code in Emacs or browsing web articles, I may capture code snippets or
interesting information without switching to Anki Desktop to do much clicking.
At nighttime I would polish the notes (fixing typo, adding context/images), push
them in one go and call it a day.</p>
<p>The possibilities don’t end there. Given Org’s capabilities, I’m sure there are
more interesting applications. Here are some I have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/">Org Babel</a> to evaluate code block in place, pushing <strong>both code and output</strong> (plain
text, images, tables) to Anki: <a href="https://github.com/mjago/ob-lilypond"><code>ob-lilypond</code></a>, <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-dot.html"><code>ob-dot</code></a>, <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-R.html">ob-R</a></li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfZ9fCHzkJw">keyboard macro</a> to create cards in bulk, quickly</li>
<li>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental%5Freading">Incremental Reading</a> system may be built from utilities that centered on
plain/PDF/EPUB(<a href="https://github.com/wasamasa/nov.el">nov.el</a>) text processing, and that integrate with <a href="https://github.com/weirdNox/org-noter"><code>org-noter</code></a>
(note taking with <code>pdf-tools</code>), <a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref"><code>org-ref</code></a> (academic paper management),
<code>org-capture</code> (content capture), <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=org-agenda"><code>org-agenda</code></a> (schedule/deadline reminder,
progress tracking)…</li>
<li>An Emacs distribution that is solely designed to smooth out learning curve for
users from Anki community, just as what …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="c-performance-traps-series-introduction">C++ Performance Traps Series Introduction</h2><p>The C++ standard library has many classes and functions that are easy
to use and relatively safe. However, in situations where performance
and efficiency really matter, straightforward use of the standard
library may not always be the best choice. This post is the first in a
series that will catalogue some of those opportunities for
improvement. It is meant to be accessible to people who are <em>not</em> C++
gurus or language lawyers.</p><p>In each post, we will look at a piece of the C++ standard library that
can cause performance problems and how we might be able to do
better. Although the ability to read x86 assembly language is not
required, I will provide links to code samples and their corresponding
generated assembly on <a href="https://godbolt.org/">Compiler Explorer</a> to
explain why I give the advice I give. I will assume a 64-bit system
and focus on x86_64, but most advice should apply to ARM64 as well.</p><h2 id="c-performance-trap-1-constant-size-stdvector">C++ Performance Trap #1: Constant-size <code>std::vector</code></h2><p>Common advice is to <a href="https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rsl-arrays">prefer <code>std::vector</code> to C
arrays</a>. This
is all well and good when we want to grow the <code>vector</code> later. If we
don’t need to do that and performance is critical, we can often do
better for two reasons.</p><h3 id="stdvector-representation"><code>std::vector</code> Representation</h3><p>First of all, <code>std::vector</code> is represented with three pointers: one to
the first element, one just past the last element, and one to the end of the
allocated space, like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> T<span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>VectorRepr</span> {
    T <span>*</span>begin;
    T <span>*</span>end;
    T <span>*</span>capacityEnd;
};
</code></pre></div><p>When the size of the <code>vector</code> won’t change, we will always have <code>end == capacityEnd</code> (or worse, wasted space), so we can eliminate the
third pointer and save space by using a C array with a length (or end pointer) instead,
like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> T<span>&gt;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>MyArray</span> {
    std<span>::</span>unique_ptr<span>&lt;</span>T[]<span>&gt;</span> arr;
    <span>int</span> length;
};
</code></pre></div><p>This can make a big difference in overall memory usage (and thus
<a href="https://ricomariani.medium.com/size-matters-it-may-be-the-only-thing-that-matters-64b473900873">performance</a>)
if this thing is a member of a core data structure.</p><h3 id="stdvector-initialization-overhead"><code>std::vector</code> Initialization Overhead</h3><p>Second, the way we initialize our <code>vector</code> matters. We’ll go through 2
iterations of initializing a <code>vector</code> and then see what we can gain by
using an array instead.</p><p>To give ourselves a concrete example to work with, let’s say that
we’ll take a length <code>N</code> and return a <code>vector</code> containing the first <code>N</code>
squares:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++">std<span>::</span>vector<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> makeSquares(<span>int</span> howMany);
</code></pre></div><p>A straightforward way to write this function is with
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/reserve"><code>reserve</code></a>
and
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/push_back"><code>push_back</code></a>:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++">std<span>::</span>vector<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> makeSquaresPushBack(<span>int</span> howMany) {

looks different: we no longer have the capacity check, and our inner
loop gets <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling">unrolled</a>,
which might be nice if we’re making big <code>vector</code>s. (It would also get
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_vectorization">vectorized</a> if
I hadn’t passed the <code>-fno-vectorize</code> option to make the output easier
to read.) However, we still have an unnecessary call to
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/memmove"><code>memset</code></a> near
the start of the function. This happens because the <code>vector</code>
constructor we used guarantees that elements are default constructed
(which, for <code>int</code>, means initializing to zero): we can’t create a
<code>vector</code> of uninitialized space, even though we know that we are about
to initialize the whole <code>vector</code>.</p><p>Here is how I might write this to create an array instead:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>struct</span> <span>IntArray</span> {

        result.arr[ii] <span>=</span> ii <span>*</span> ii;
    }
    <span>return</span> result;
}
</code></pre></div><p>If we skim <a href="https://godbolt.org/#g:!((g:!((g:!((h:codeEditor,i:(fontScale:14,j:1,lang:c%2B%2B,selection:(endColumn:1,endLineNumber:16,positionColumn:1,positionLineNumber:16,selectionStartColumn:1,selectionStartLineNumber:16,startColumn:1,startLineNumber:16),source:'%23include+%3Cmemory%3E%0A%23include+%3Cvector%3E%0A%0Astruct+IntArray+%7B%0A++++std::unique_ptr%3Cint+%5B%5D%3E+arr%3B%0A++++int+size%3B%0A%7D%3B%0A%0AIntArray+makeSquaresArray(int+howMany)+%7B%0A++++IntArray+result+%3D+%7Bstd::unique_ptr%3Cint%5B%5D%3E%7Bnew+int%5BhowMany%5D%7D,+howMany%7D%3B%0A++++for+(int+ii+%3D+0%3B+ii+%3C+howMany%3B+%2B%2Bii)+%7B%0A++++++++result.arr%5Bii%5D+%3D+ii+*+ii%3B%0A++++%7D%0A++++return+result%3B%0A%7D%0A'),l:'5',n:'0',o:'C%2B%2B+source+%231',t:'0')),k:56.30126771066368,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0'),(g:!((h:compiler,i:(compiler:clang1100,filters:(b:'0',binary:'1',commentOnly:'0',demangle:'0',directives:'0',execute:'1',intel:'1',libraryCode:'1',trim:'1'),fontScale:14,j:1,lang:c%2B%2B,libs:!(),options:'-O3+-std%3Dc%2B%2B17+-fno-vectorize',selection:(endColumn:1,endLineNumber:1,positionColumn:1,positionLineNumber:1,selectionStartColumn:1,selectionStartLineNumber:1,startColumn:1,startLineNumber:1),source:1),l:'5',n:'0',o:'x86-64+clang+11.0.0+(Editor+%231,+Compiler+%231)+C%2B%2B',t:'0')),k:43.69873228933632,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0')),l:'2',n:'0',o:'',t:'0')),version:4">the generated assembly</a>, we can see that it is shorter overall, it does not contain an initial call to <code>memset</code>, and the inner loop is very similar.</p><p>We do have one other trick available to us: if we know that the arrays
are never going to exceed some set size (let’s say we know it’s 7), we
can put them right inside our <code>IntArray</code> object instead of on the
heap:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>struct</span> <span>InlineIntArray</span> {
    std<span>::</span>array<span>&lt;</span><span>int</span>, <span>7</span><span>&gt;</span> arr;
    <span>int</span> size;
};
</code></pre></div><p>Now we save on both the heap allocation to create the array and the
cache miss to access it. However, we have to be right about the upper
bound on the size, and we really want to end up using most of the
space most of the time. Whether this last step is worthwhile in
practice depends on the specific application, so you’ll want to
measure carefully before doing it.</p><h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2><p>By far the top request on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/kyc6f9/c_performance_trap_1_constantsize_stdvector/">the r/cpp
discussion</a>
of this article was
benchmarks. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IHateUsernames111/">u/IHateUsernames111</a>
kindly copied the examples into <a href="https://quick-bench.com/">Quick
Bench</a> (which I learned about today!);
results are
<a href="https://quick-bench.com/q/vUMdQdAFs7W0qHQZSq6cjYFEDEc">here</a>. For the
largest case I was able to run (4096 elements), Quick Bench reports
that the prealloc version is 1.8x faster than push_back, and the array
version is 1.3x faster than prealloc.</p><p>I do want to mention that I didn’t include benchmarks originally
because it is very easy for them to be misleading. For example, I
haven’t verified whether the cost of destroying the <code>vector</code> or array
is included in the benchmark measurement. Whether it should be
included depends on the particular application.</p><h2 id="postscript-what-if-we-used-rust">Postscript: What if we used Rust?</h2><p>I am a big fan of the Rust programming language, so I went ahead and
translated the examples to Rust:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>use</span> std::convert::TryInto;

First, two notes on the translation:</p><ul><li>Rust has <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.with_capacity"><code>Vec::with_capacity</code></a>, which is more convenient than calling <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.new"><code>Vec::new</code></a> followed by <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.reserve"><code>reserve</code></a>.</li><li>It <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html#method.new_uninit">looks like</a> creating an uninitialized <code>Box&lt;[i32]&gt;</code> (i.e., a heap-allocated array) requires both nightly Rust and unsafe code, so I didn’t do it.</li></ul><p>Now, looking at <a href="https://godbolt.org/#g:!((g:!((g:!((h:codeEditor,i:(fontScale:14,j:1,lang:rust,selection:(endColumn:2,endLineNumber:25,positionColumn:2,positionLineNumber:25,selectionStartColumn:2,selectionStartLineNumber:25,startColumn:2,startLineNumber:25),source:'pub+fn+make_squares_push_back(how_many:+i32)+-%3E+Vec%3Ci32%3E+%7B%0A++++let+mut+result+%3D+Vec::with_capacity(how_many+as+usize)%3B%0A++++for+idx+in+0..how_many+%7B%0A++++++++result.push(idx+*+idx)%3B%0A++++%7D%0A++++result%0A%7D%0A%0Apub+fn+make_squares_prealloc(how_many:+i32)+-%3E+Vec%3Ci32%3E+%7B%0A++++let+how_many+:+usize+%3D+how_many+as+usize%3B%0A++++let+mut+result+%3D+Vec::with_capacity(how_many)%3B%0A++++result.resize(how_many,+0)%3B%0A++++for+idx+in+0..how_many+%7B%0A++++++++result%5Bidx%5D+%3D+(idx+*+idx)+as+i32%3B%0A++++%7D%0A++++result%0A%7D%0A%0Apub+fn+make_squares_functional(how_many:+i32)+-%3E+Vec%3Ci32%3E+%7B%0A++++(0..how_many).map(%7Cx%7C+x+*+x).collect()%0A%7D%0A%0Apub+fn+make_squares_functional_array(how_many:+i32)+-%3E+Box%3C%5Bi32%5D%3E+%7B%0A++++(0..how_many).map(%7Cx%7C+x+*+x).collect()%0A%7D'),l:'5',n:'0',o:'Rust+source+%231',t:'0')),k:48.791738101069484,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0'),(g:!((h:compiler,i:(compiler:r1480,filters:(b:'0',binary:'1',commentOnly:'0',demangle:'0',directives:'0',execute:'1',intel:'1',libraryCode:'1',trim:'1'),fontScale:14,j:1,lang:rust,libs:!(),options:'-C+opt-level%3D3+-C+no-vectorize-loops',selection:(endColumn:1,endLineNumber:1,positionColumn:1,positionLineNumber:1,selectionStartColumn:1,selectionStartLineNumber:1,startColumn:1,startLineNumber:1),source:1),l:'5',n:'0',o:'rustc+1.48.0+(Editor+%231,+Compiler+%231)+Rust',t:'0')),k:51.20826189893053,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0')),l:'2',n:'0',o:'',t:'0')),version:4">the assembly</a>:</p><ul><li><code>make_squares_push_back</code> is similar to the C++ version: no unrolling

<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/boxed.rs.html#1332-1336">works</a>
by creating a <code>Vec</code> and then calling <code>into_boxed_slice</code> on it, so we
don’t get the absolute fastest possible code. Perhaps the
<code>FromIterator&lt;I&gt;</code> impl for <code>Box&lt;[I]&gt;</code> will get improved once creating
an uninitialized <code>Box&lt;[T]&gt;</code> doesn’t require nightly Rust?</li></ul></div></div></div>]]>

</blockquote>
<p>From further investigation. This is restriction of Big Sur for downloaded zip file from browser</p>
<ul>
<li>When decompressing the .zip, the application contents didn’t retain the execute bits. Add it back with <code>sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/app</code></li>
<li>Since the application was downloaded by a web browser the quarantine bits are set on the decompressed files. Remove that with <code>sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/app</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It still didn’t work despite the fact that I enabled apps from identified developers and that I also notarized my app.</p>

<p>Nod’s AI Compiler team focusses on the state of art code generation, async partitioning, optimizations and scheduling to overlap communication and compute on various A.I hardware from large datacenter clusters to edge A.I silicon. The basic computation building block for all of that is the venerable Matmul. In this post we focus on the the Matmul performance on the just released Apple M1 Chip since that translates directly to how much you can squeeze out of any A.I hardware.</p>
<p>Typically silicon teams work closely with the optimization teams to create highly optimized SGEMM ( <b>S</b>ingle precision&nbsp;<b>GE</b>neral&nbsp;<b>M</b>atrix&nbsp;<b>M</b>ultiply) and DGEMM (<strong>D</strong>ouble precision <strong>GE</strong>neral <strong>M</strong>atrix <strong>M</strong>ulitply) kernels for each silicon platform. Intel’s <strong>MKL</strong> provides these kernels for the Intel chipsets and Apple’s <strong>Accelerate Framework&nbsp;</strong>provides highly optimized kernels for Apple machines (both Intel and Apple Silicon).</p>
<p>Eigen provides a reasonably easy to use high-level template library of these linear algebra algorithms while also exposing building blocks like <strong>GEBP</strong> (GeneralBlockPanelKernel) “traits” for each SoC.&nbsp; These GEBP traits effectively allow you to use Compiler Intrinsics and custom instructions to target a particular SoC while still wrapping it up in higher level C++ for ease of use. BLIS (a BLAS like library) also follows a similar paradigm where the “inner most” microkernel is highly hand optimized assembly for a particular architecture and&nbsp; forms the foundation of the higher level computations that could be written in more portable code. There is a good read on the concepts used by BLIS <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/flame/pubs/blis2_toms_rev2.pdf">here</a>. However BLIS’s microkernel on ARM/NEON is woefully inadequate (See <a href="https://github.com/flame/blis/issues/421">this bug report</a> when building with clang). There have been other attempts to write the GEBP kernel in portable code (see <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~jingling/papers/cgo17.pdf">this</a>), but I think Eigen is probably the most successful with the backing of the Tensorflow and Android efforts.</p>
<p>Apple’s M1 SoC&nbsp; has received rave reviews on its performance. It includes extension to the ARM Architectural Specification to include a Matrix Co-Processor – commonly referred to as <strong>AMX (Apple Matrix Co-processor)</strong>. The version in the M1 SoC is supposedly a “Version 2” so let’s refer to it as AMX2. Supposedly the AMX2 is tightly coupled with the ARM core (has custom instructions to access it) than the <strong>ANE (Apple Neural Engine)</strong> which is a separate Neural Processing Unit on the SoC – which would behave more like an integrated GPU with higher latencies and higher throughput when compared to the inline AMX2.</p>
<p>Apple has not released the instructions to access the AMX2.&nbsp; This way there is no need to maintain backwards compatibility with compiled software. The only way you should (though not the only way you <em>can</em>) currently access AMX2 on&nbsp; M1 SoC is via the Accelerate Framework.&nbsp; ARM has just started adding support for Architecture ARMv8.7-a in <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/search/query/OxQ0whlSn_CS/#R">LLVM</a> and specifically the support for Accelerators such as AMX <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D91775">here</a> . It includes the ability to add Accelerators such as the AMX but it is unclear if AMX will adhere to that specification. You can find out more about ARMv8.7-a <a href="https://youtu.be/CSUohi1XY78"><strong>here</strong></a></p>
<p>In this post we will evaluate a <strong>simple SGEMM with a size of 1000</strong> using AMX2 and Eigen’s Neon optimized version on the Apple M1.&nbsp; We have done some tests with other ARMv8 SoCs but it is not apples to apples since they were older generation parts or had different toolchain options etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;All tests were done with top of master Clang (12.0.0+) built with OpenMP support (for Eigen’s parallelism) and top of master Eigen. We run 10 iterations of the Matrix multiply as warmup (to initialize any lazy loading libraries or fill the instruction and data caches) and then run the test 20 times and average the run times.&nbsp; We have to use Eigen noalias() to make sure there are no unnecessary copies.</p>
<p>We compile the code with -O3 and validate with <em>“otool -L”</em> that we link against Accelerate when using it and just standard libs otherwise. Also “otool -tv a.out | grep fmla” should show you the NEON FMLA instructions being used as shown below:</p>
<pre><span>nodai@macbook-pro-2 pytorch % otool -tv a.out| grep fmla</span>
<span>00000001000025a8 fmla.2d v0, v2, v1<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>; Latency: 10</span>
<span>0000000100002700 fmla.2d v2, v4, v0<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>; Latency: 10</span>
<span>0000000100002704 fmla.2d v1, v5, v3<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>; Latency: 10</span>
<span>0000000100002a78 fmla.2d v3, v5, v1<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>; Latency: 10</span></pre>

<h3><strong>Results</strong></h3>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>CPU utilization:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For the test matrix size of 1000 there is negligible cpu utilization so we tried increasing the matrix size large enough to see some impact. With AMX2 the CPU utilization delta is negligible but there is likely memory pressure to DMA into the AMX2, however with NEON we can saturate the CPU cores.</p>

<p>But is this the best NEON optimization possible ? Based on this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i3GXUku9e76B7YwPnYiDx-d36ZuL85WRKEnNiIgA8rQ/edit#gid=1050198706">work</a> as part of GEMMLOWP project there should be more room. So we ran the “standalone NEON tests” on the M1. This should give us a good idea on the delta between Eigen’s GEBP and a fully hand optimized NEON kernel by ARM themselves (though for a Cortex-A57 class core).&nbsp; The results are below:</p>

<p>Based on the above we estimate there is another 20% or so we can squeeze out of the NEON implementation.&nbsp; An important point to consider is the overhead of using intrinsics vs full inline assembly – you still have to make a choice between portability and performance.</p>
<p><strong>Single Threaded FP32 Matmul AMX2</strong></p>
<p>After the post was initially written we found there is an environment variable <span>VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREAD</span> that can control single threaded operation of Accelerate. Stay tuned for more controlled studies.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This is a first pass performance test of using AMX2 vs NEON on the <strong>Apple M1 </strong>that<b> shows AMX2 roughly twice as fast as the NEON implementation</b>. There are probably a lot of corner cases to consider and tweaks to be done to the the NEON code especially with the varying size of L2 caches between the different cores.&nbsp; Based on the GEMMLowP work we estimate there is atleast another 20% or so left on the table with NEON. Let us know if we missed anything. Right now the system (Core clocks, core types, scheduler priorities etc) is not in a controlled environment to test it throughly but hopefully this gives us a first order approximation of what performance to expect at the fundamental building block – a Matmul, on the Apple M1.</p>
<p><strong>Future Work:</strong></p>
<p>In our next blog post we will build on a MatMul and share some numbers of the Nod Compiler’s codegen capabilities to automatically generate these GEMM kernels and other common kernels used in Machine Learning and compare the performance to native frameworks like MKL/MKL-DNN, Accelerate / MLCompute and Cudnn/cuBLAS on the GPU.</p>

<h4>Update 1 (12/30): Add first pass ruy numbers and push source code</h4>
<p>Thanks the Benoit Jacob from the Google&nbsp; who has worked on Eigen, Gemmlowp, TFlite, IREE etc we have first pass ruy numbers below on the M1. Stay tuned for more detailed comparisons and numbers.</p>

    <div id="post-body">
        <p>How much does a line of code cost?</p><p>The naive answer is that it costs nothing. Bytes are free -- or as close to free as we can come. But it <em>has</em> to cost something. After all, it took time to type in, right? So that takes us to our first rule of "Code Economics": the cost of a line of code is measured in how much time we spend working with it.</p><p>How much value is in a line of code?</p><p>The naive answer is that the economic value of a line of code is the value of the application (which can be measured various ways) divided by the total line-of-codes (LOC). If you're making $10K per month from a thousand lines of code, each line is bringing in $10.</p><p>But that's obviously not true. We know that the same application can be written using a thousand, ten thousand, or a hundred thousand LOC. The thing the application does for people -- its value -- and the amount of code it takes to write it? They're not related at all. That takes us to the second rule of "Code Economics": a line of code has no value whatsoever. It only has value as part of some deployable application. The application is the smallest unit of economic value. (Actually, it's UX flow, but for our purposes today an application supports one UX flow that the user finds value interacting with.)</p><p>The value of an app is more directly measurable. Yes, sometimes it gets more complicated, like if the business purpose of the app is in-app purchases or referrals, but at some point money comes in and we can trace that money back to the app.</p><p>How about the cost of a line of code? Is it just the time we spend typing it in? That's obviously wrong. You have to design it, even if only in your head. You have to test it. You have to deploy it. In fact, once you start thinking about it, there's no limit to the amount of money you can spend on a line of code. If your app is successful, you might spend the rest of your lifetime maintaining that line of code -- looking at it every now and then, tweaking it, changing how it's used.</p><p>Of course, most lines of code either work fine or they never provide enough value to make anybody bother with them again. (No economic value = no technical debt) But, assuming you know enough to write an app that has value, each line of code in that app has an potentially-infinite cost.</p><p>So value comes in app-sized chunks while costs is related to the tiny pieces we use to make that app -- and to a large degree this is under our control.</p><p>We have a way in finance of dealing with things that have a limited value but a potentially-unlimited downside. We use a budget. I could go out next month and buy $500 worth of sugar-free bubblegum (I love the stuff), but I don't. I have a budget of $10 per month and I stick to it. That's not because bubblegum is such a huge drain on our finances. It's because little things add up. Without a budget, I have no reasonable way for my wife and I to discuss what's important to us. The budget isn't important. The conversation about values it drives is irreplaceable.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/code-budgeting-tablets.png" alt=""></figure><h3 id="so-why-aren-t-we-budgeting-our-code">So why aren't we budgeting our code?</h3><p>So far in our discussion, there's really no reason to pick one set of budget numbers over another. Should we limit our applications to a million lines of code? A hundred? We don't know. We can safely say two things. One, given the same value, more code equals more cost. Two, lines-of-code always grows out-of-control the more we poke at it. This leads to the conclusion in the third rule of Code Economics: the only way to limit the costs of solving a problem using programming is to arbitrarily limit the amount of code humans have to mentally-manipulate solving it.</p><p>In a way, this is all common sense. We've been doing it for years. We just haven't been explicit about it. Shared libraries, frameworks, industry standards, and a dozen other things all exist in an effort to limit the amount of code humans have to mentally-manipulate to solve problems.</p><p>So why haven't we succeeded? Why can't most programmers today do their job using four or five lines of code?</p><p>Because lines-of-code always grows the more we poke at it. When the http protocol first appeared, if you wanted a web page? You brought up a terminal and telnetted a small number of commands. Boom, there's your webpage. Now, there are easily 10, maybe 20 various standards and libraries related to what used to be 10 seconds of work. Fifty years from now there will be 40 standards. Same value, more code. Value stays the same, cost of code continues to increase.</p><p>I'd like to suggest a completely random rule that I just made up: <em><strong>Arbitrarily limit lines of code used to solve a problem and write the app with the goal of never touching it again</strong></em></p><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/2021-01-11_11-17-16-code-budget-1.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>No matter what your tech or stack, in general, costs rise as a function of the amount of code you write and later have to maintain</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/2021-01-11_11-18-51-code-budget-2.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>The application's value to the user, however, remains constant</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/2021-01-11_11-19-37-code-budget-3.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>That means that there is some unknown point at which the amount of money/effort you've spent to provide the value is the same as the value it provides. Afterwards, the costs rise steeply. There is no feedback or mechanism to spot the crossover point</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/2021-01-11_11-19-37-code-budget-4.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Providing some arbitrary limits to the amount of code you're willing to create and maintain, even if it's past the break-even point, is the only way to prevent long-term runaway costs</figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, since I'm making stuff up, how about a 2000-200-20 rule for folks writing microservices? Whatever problem you have to solve using microservices, you have 20 microservices to solve it in. Each of those microservices can be written with no more than 200 lines of unique code.</p><p>But wait, I hear you say. That's never going to work! Okay, so among all of those microservices you can have 2,000 lines of code in a shared library. Anything you could ever touch counts as code.</p><p>I'm not going to defend my made-up rules aside from saying that budgets always seem arbitrary, and it's not right to create a budget so small that the work can't get done. I don't believe I've done that here -- but I might be wrong! Use other budgets if you like. Hell if I care. But use budgets.</p><p>Most programmers probably don't think such a budget is fair, or workable. And I think it's fine. That's fascinating to me and indicates a lack of alignment somewhere in the way we train and socialize programmers.</p><p>I'm also suggesting a new thing that has to happen: a code budgeting discussion. Yes, Daniel, your WhizzBang widget is freaking awesome, but it uses 500 lines of code, and that's 500 lines we can't afford right now.</p><p>Whoa horsey! Wouldn't I love to hear somebody actually say that! Cost control, in a programming team. Imagine that! And what would come next? I have no idea!</p><p>But I could guess.</p><p>Don't some problems require a lot of code? Don't some applications -- most, in fact -- require us to come back to them again and again in order to keep them in alignment with changing user needs?</p><p>Both statements are true. For complex things, we write components. Those components have executing tests that describe them and are used/shared in multiple places. The more they are used/shared, the better they get. That means that components are just another project. It also means that if you don't have multiple teams using your component, you don't have a component. Component creation should be a decision made between teams and involve a completely new project. After all, they have both cost and value.</p><p>What about coming back to tweak the app as the business needs change? Assuming you have a release that is currently demonstrating value -- a big assumption, by the way -- I think you have to timebox it. Three months of verifying that the app got things mostly right. After that? You write a new app, of course. With the budget we're talking about it's not going to be a huge effort, you've already been living in this space, and it's good to rethink things. Code budgets and timelines prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">Second System Syndrome</a>. (I think we went off-the-rails somewhere with Second System Syndrome, but I digress)</p><p>There are parts of this essay that are completely made-up. I tried to point those out. There are also parts that are built on decades of experience both coding solutions and watching teams work. What I've seen over-and-over again is that really cool things happen with smart people and creative constraints. Really stupid stuff happens otherwise, because without constraints it's all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality">bike shedding</a>.</p><p>You need to start budgeting your code.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn.danielbmarkham.com/2021/01/Daniel-Signature.png" alt=""></figure>    </div>

C++ supports object-oriented, generic, and functional programming features.</div>">C++</a>, and recently I stopped to consider my choice of header file extension.</p>
<p>I have spent my career as a C programmer, so many of my habits are simply ossified from my C days. One such habit is using <code>.h</code> for all header file extensions.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, it seems there is still not a fixed approach to C/C++ header file differentiation.  While surveying comments around the internet, I see many developers only use <code>.hpp</code> for C++ headers which also include implementations. Other C++-only headers are left with the <code>.h</code> extension.  Unhelpfully, many IDEs still seem to recommend <code>.h</code> as the default header extension, even if you are using C++.</p>
<p>The problem with allowing <code>.h</code> to represent both C and C++ code without differentiation is that you increase friction for developers:</p>
<ul><li>How can you know that you can’t include a specific library <code>.h</code> file in your C program because it’s really C++?</li>
<li>What if you are trying to adjust your <a aria-describedby="tt" href="https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldmanual-terms/build-system/" data-cmtooltip="<div class=glossaryItemTitle><span class=&quot;dashicons &quot; data-icon=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color:#000;display:inline;vertical-align:baseline;&quot;></span>Build System</div><div class=glossaryItemBody>A reusable and abstract system that is used to compile software and assemble other related components (e.g. documentation, samples, installers) that make up a finished software product.</div>">build system</a> and want to exclude all C++ files from a specific project?</li>
</ul><p>I think it is important to make conventions and language type apparent to developers without requiring manual inspection. In my new framework, I have decided to use <code>.hpp</code> for all headers that are C++-only. <code>.h</code> will be reserved for headers which can be included by either C or C++ sources.  I’m not alone in this convention – at the very least, <a aria-describedby="tt" href="https://embeddedartistry.com/fieldmanual-terms/boost/" data-cmtooltip="<div class=glossaryItemTitle>Boost<span class=&quot;dashicons &quot; data-icon=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;color:#000;display:inline;vertical-align:baseline;&quot;></span></div><div class=glossaryItemBody>“Electrical component which takes an input voltage and reduces it; also, an organization that provides a suite of peer-reviewed C++ libraries.”</div>">Boost</a> uses the same approach. To quote from the <a href="http://www.boost.org/users/faq.html">Boost FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Why do Boost headers have a .hpp suffix rather than .h or none at all?</strong><br>
File extensions communicate the “type” of the file, both to humans and to computer programs. The ‘.h’ extension is used for C header files, and therefore communicates the wrong thing about C++ header files. Using no extension communicates nothing and forces inspection of file contents to determine type. Using ‘.hpp’ unambiguously identifies it as C++ header file, and works well in actual practice. (Rainer Deyke)</p></blockquote>
<p>As an aside, it is helpful to make your C-style headers compatible with C++.  Here are some simple strategies to keep in mind:</p>
<ul><li>protect C-only code with the <code>__cplusplus</code> macro, which is only defined by the C++ compiler</li>
<li>Mark C functions code as <code>extern "C"</code> when compiling C++ code</li>
</ul><p>I hope that you take some time to think about header extensions in your own projects!</p>

<h2>
AWS Lambda - From skeptic to enthusiast
</h2>
<p>
Jan 15 2021
</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Back in 2019, I was having a discussion with a friend about using AWS Lambdas and we could not find a real use case for it. For user facing APIs I felt it would be too slow and may have unpredictable performance &amp; billing for commercial web applications. Maybe it simplified the DevOps pipeline but it was not something I would consider for building an important application, building a CI/CD pipeline is just something you do for real life applications.</p>

<p>There were (or are) other considerations as well, Lambdas sort of take away the convenience of working locally and shipping the same "stack" on to staging and production servers. For me the ideal stack is where I can run the same artifact locally and on production (and staging) with only a couple of environment variables and configuration files changed, like shipping a Docker image or a JAR file with only the environment variables changed at runtime. So all in all, I was never someone who understood or recommended the Lambda stack to anyone.</p>

<p>But things changed in mid 2020, my team needed to build a something of a "monthly statement service" where we would need to generate a PDF of the user's transactions and email it to them. This was something that was not triggered by a user request, nor was some user waiting on it. The "workload" was completely concentrated on one day of the month and we needed to do this in parallel for all the users, since doing it one-by-one for each user would take a lot of time. Being a "veteran" programmer coming from a Java / Ruby / Node background, my first thought was to use <a href="http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/">Quartz</a> / <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-batch">Spring Batch</a> / <a href="https://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a> or <a href="https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull">Bull</a> but then few colleagues convinced me try building this feature with Lambdas.</p>

<p>Given the features we needed, we realized that we could build this as a series of <strong>functions</strong> in a pipeline where SQS would be used to invoke and communicate between Lambda groups. It looked something like this -</p>

<p><img src="https://rockyj.in/images/lambdas.png"></p>

<p>The first <strong>cron lambda</strong> would invoke iteself on the first day of the month, fetch all the users with a remote call. For each user we created a SQS message and pushed it across. The second set of lambdas (which are triggered by SQS) pick up a SQS message and do the necessary work e.g. get data, generate PDF, send email etc.</p>

<p>The benefit of this approach was that we could scale out wherever / whenever needed. If the number of customers grew to 100,000s we could scale the Lambdas so that the statements could still be sent to all users before they opened thier inbox on 10 AM on the first of every month.</p>

<p><strong>Error Handling</strong></p>

<p>Another big benefit of this approach was error handling. Imagine doing this for 100,000 users with a 99+% success rate, there could always be a few hundred users for which the lambdas would fail (e.g. error in fetching data, error in sending emails). We may want to "re-process" these failed jobs, the SQS DLQ (Dead Letter Queue) works well for this feature. All failed jobs (which were triggered by SQS messages) end up in the DLQ, we can just push these failed messages back to the main queue and re-run the failed jobs. The same applies if there was bug, we can fix the bug and re-process the DLQ.</p>

<p><strong>Final words</strong></p>

<p>Since our setup is just a set of "functions" we could run it locally and it was pretty much the same in the AWS Lambda environment. With a small change in configuration we could scale out to 100s of worker Lambdas and finally only pay for usage for the work we did at the end of every month.</p>

<p>We are really happy with the current architecture, so much so that a few other teams have now adopted it for their "asynchronous" loads.</p>

<p>At the end, I would still say that I would not use Lambdas for everything but there are some cases where they fit perfectly. To summarize -</p>

<p><strong>Lambda Pros</strong> -</p>

<ul>
  <li>👍🏾 Great for asynchronous, non-user facing tasks</li>
  <li>👍🏾 Easy to scale out</li>
  <li>👍🏾 Great for cron jobs where load is for a specific time e.g. nightly / weekly / monthly jobs</li>
  <li>👍🏾 DLQs make running failed jobs super easy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Lambda Cons</strong> -</p>

<ul>
  <li>👎🏾 Still not convinced about usage for user facing APIs (e.g RESTful API)</li>
  <li>👎🏾 Team would still need to learn and deploy a new DevOps stack (apart from a container based stack like K8 / Fargate)</li>
  <li>👎🏾 Only Node, Python and JVM language support exists</li>
  <li>👎🏾 Node is not so great for CPU intensive jobs and startup times for JVM are not so good (but if you do not care about latency it's fine)</li>
  <li>👎🏾 You lose on stuff like a warm JVM, JIT, connection pools and other advantages that kick in with time / caching since each request sort of spins up a new container / VM</li>
</ul>

<p>So to conclude, I would not say that I would use Lambdas for every problem but I think I have found a pretty good use case for them and for that it does a great job.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><data value="https://jlelse.blog/posts/email-messenger-delta-chat"></data><div><p>Published on <time datetime="2021-01-14T17:23:36+01:00">January 14, 2021</time> in <a href="https://jlelse.blog/posts">✍️ Posts</a></p></div><div><p>Today I have heard again a discussion about WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and Threema and there was the question to which messenger one would switch from WhatsApp.</p><p>While I find Telegram very pleasant as an everyday messenger, since it offers me the best user experience and also has some features (bots, channels) that other messengers don’t have, <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/03/delta-chat">Delta Chat came to mind again</a>.</p><p>Everyone has an email address, email is decentralized and Delta Chat encrypts messages automatically.</p><blockquote><p>What I really like about this is, that using the existing email infrastructure enables everyone to communicate with each other without the restriction to use the same messenger or client. Anyone can choose any client and can still be connected. Just login with your usual email account. You don’t even need to use one of those messaging optimized clients and stay with your regular email client.</p><p>– <a href="https://jlelse.blog/thoughts/2019/03/delta-chat">Jan-Lukas Else (2019)</a></p></blockquote><p>I installed <a href="https://delta.chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Chat</a> on my smartphone again today. While the app wasn’t quite mature 2 years ago, I have to say it’s pretty decent now. The Android app seems to be based on the Signal interface. But Delta Chat is also available for desktops (Windows, macOS and Linux) and iOS. And the best part - something Signal, Threema and WhatsApp have problems with - Delta Chat can be used from multiple devices without any problems.</p><p>But the most important thing: Delta Chat allows you to communicate even with people who don’t use Delta Chat at all, all you need is an email address! If you write to someone without Delta Chat, they will just get a normal email. I would argue that even beats Matrix or XMPP.</p><p>Conclusion: If you are concerned about security when chatting and would rather use a decentralized messenger (no silo), you are in good hands with email and Delta Chat.</p><p>However, it would be advisable not to use Gmail, Outlook or GMX as email service, but a reasonable email service. I use <a href="https://www.servercow.de/mailcow?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mailcow</a> for example, where just today there was <a href="https://mailcow.email/2021/01/14/back-to-the-future-with-delta-chat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an announcement about Delta Chat</a>.</p></div><p><b>Tags</b>:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/convos/convos.png" alt="The IRC Client: Convos"></p><p>Throughout 2020, in large part due to the lockdown, many people have started to become familiar with internal communication tools. Microsoft Teams, Slack, Telegram, Mattermost, and a few others are the most widely used and recognizable of these tools, but there still seems to be some people using Internet Relay Chat (IRC) ― one of the first online messaging services.</p><p>Many of the widely used international communication tools have been inspired by IRC, which is gradually falling into disuse due to the modern UI and UX and additional features being offered by these more well-known messaging applications.</p><p>Despite IRC being considered archaic, it is still being used today as a meeting place for many online communities. For example, people who are nostalgic for the early days of the Internet and users of, and contributors to, open-source software projects make IRC a place for discussion ― where it is not the identity that defines who you are, but the content.</p><p>In this article, I will illustrate what IRC is and share with you a product that greatly enhances the IRC protocol by adding features that are common to modern messaging applications. If you are searching for a convenient, self-hosted solution to connect to IRC, then this article is for you.</p><p>In the following paragraphs, we will discuss:</p><ul><li>What the IRC communication protocol is;</li><li>Getting a persistent, always-online chat on IRC;</li><li>Convos, an alternative to IRCCloud and its features;</li><li>The installation of Convos on Debian/Ubuntu; and</li><li>Convos configuration.</li></ul><h2 id="the-irc-communication-protocol">The IRC Communication Protocol</h2><p>IRC is a service that facilitates online communication via messages based on the “client-server” model. In a more technical and precise way, IRC can be considered a network protocol (at the application level) that uses a network composed of servers to easily send messages to network participants.</p><p>Developed in 1988 by Jarkko Oikkarinen, a Finnish student who wanted to create a communication system that would enable real time discussions for a network at his university, IRC quickly expanded to the point where more than 200,000 users were connected every day.</p><p>To start exchanging messages, the user must first connect to the IRC network via a client (e.g., <a href="https://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin</a>, mIRC), which then connects to the server closest to the user in order to ensure high-speed performance. There are several networks, such as <a href="https://freenode.net/">Freenode</a>, <a href="https://www.swiftirc.net/">Swift IRC</a>, <a href="http://www.ircnet.org/">IRCNet</a>, and <a href="https://www.quakenet.org/">QuakeNet</a>.</p><p>Within IRC, you log in with a nickname (ASCII characters). This allows you to be recognized by the network to which you have connected. To initial a conversation, there are two different ways: start <strong>a private chat</strong> with another user (query) or connect to a <strong>channel</strong>.</p><p>A channel is a dedicated place to chat with a group of users, without writing to each one separately. It might sound strange nowadays, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s, this was viewed as revolutionary and a game changer with regard to how people connected over the Internet. A channel is typically administered by users, called operators, with special privileges and the ability to turn people away and invite them, make the channel private (invisible to the network), set a password, and much more.</p><p>From a technical point of view, an IRC network, currently described by the standard <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfc/rfc1459.txt">RFC 1459</a>, is composed of several nodes maintained by a centralized entity. When a user with a special client connects to one of the servers, the whole network must be informed about the presence of this client, replicating across all servers the following: nickname, name of the host from which the client has access to the Internet, and the name of the server to which this host is connected.</p><p>Regarding the nickname, you might wonder if another person could impersonate your nickname. The solution to this problem is to register your nickname with a password, so that (in the future) the server can ask you to identify yourself with the password. Here you can read about <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC/Instructions">How to register your nickname on Freenode</a>.</p><p>As alluded to above, from a historical point of view, IRC represents a consolidated communication protocol that is still used today as a discussion environment for people who are nostalgic for the early days of the Internet and users of, and contributors to, open-source software projects. In a way, this has influenced the basic UI and UX of IRC. Today, this appreciation has gone well beyond these users, as IRC has inspired our modern day messaging applications. As an example, Slack is a sexier version of IRC ― dressed up with better UI and UX and having a few modernized features. At their core, though, IRC and today’s messaging applications are no different, as groups are the channels, queries are the private chats, and operators are the administrators.</p><p>If you would like to discover all the commands to better manage your own channel, I suggest you to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_commands">the list of commands available on IRC</a>.</p><p>For a long time, IRC has been a gathering place for many communities, including Firefox, Bitcoin, Gnome, and many others. IRC has also been the site of many historic “jokes'' on the Internet. It would be remiss of me not to mention some of these most notable moments: <a href="http://bash.org/?244321">Hunter2</a>, <a href="http://bash.org/?5273">the guy who lost a device in his apartment</a>, and the timeless <a href="http://bash.org/?400459">“does anyone speak python here?"</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/team_chat.png"><figcaption><h4>IRC will never die (gently provided by XKCD)</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Arguably the biggest disadvantage of IRC is that you cannot always be connected to a specific server, unless you leave the client on all the time. Unlike normal messaging clients, you will not receive messages if you are not present on the IRC network. In fact, the remote nodes of IRC do not store any messages!</p><p>One of the solutions for this problem is to buy a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server">VPS</a> and manage the connection to IRC via a text client with a command line interface. However, this can be inconvenient on mobile devices and, specifically, for a person unfamiliar with the command line. To get around this problem, there is a free self-hosted alternative called Convos that allows you to connect via a web interface to IRC, but that’s not all!</p><h2 id="convoschat-the-solution-to-always-being-connected">Convos.chat: The Solution to Always Being Connected</h2><p><a href="https://convos.chat/">Convos</a> is an open-source, self-hosted client for connecting to IRC maintained by <a href="https://thorsen.pm/">Jan Henning Thorsen</a> and <a href="https://marcus.means.no/">Marcus</a>. The backend was developed with <a href="https://mojolicious.org/">Mojolicious</a>, a Perl framework, while the front-end used the Javascript framework <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>.</p><p>Developed in 2014, Convos has evolved into a very interesting project, despite being maintained by only one person. Among its main features, we find the persistent IRC connection that eliminates the risk of missing some important discussions! The user is connected as long as the Convos daemon is active and each message is stored in a log accessible only to the owner of the server.</p><p>Convos is one of the simplest ways to use IRC and it is always online, so initiating and staying in a discussion has never been easier. Its simple interface allows you to send messages on IRC from any device, be it a smartphone or a fridge ― you just need a browser. You can also choose a theme from those available or <a href="https://convos.chat/blog/2020/6/14/create-your-own-theme-detailed-walkthrough">write your own</a>. Another advantage of Convos is its self-hosted nature. There is no centralized third-party server (like with <a href="https://irccloud.com/">IRCCloud</a>) that stores your messages. With Convos, no one besides you will see your IRC messages and logs.</p><figure><img src="https://serhack.me/images/convos/screenshot.jpg"><figcaption><h4>Convos User Interface</h4></figcaption></figure><p>If you need to upload a file, but do not want to share it with third parties, Convos allows you to upload a file of any extension to your server. Drag and drop the file and Convos will do the rest, creating a unique link for you to share in order to access the file. Want to delete it? You can do it without any problem!</p><p><img src="https://serhack.me/images/convos/drag_and_drop.gif" alt="Drag and Drop per Convos"></p><p>For text files, it gets even better. All messages that will have more than four “line breaks” will be uploaded to a personalized pastebin.</p><p>As we are all well aware, in 2020, having an <a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html">Emoji</a> available is a must! Just type <code>:emoji_name</code> to see the list of emojis available on Convos. Note that all <a href="https://unicode.org/">Unicode</a> characters are also compatible, so across smartphones there will be no problems. You can also add links and make <strong>bold</strong> and/or <em>italicize</em> your posts with <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">Markdown</a>.</p><p>Given that IRCCloud is a service (with similar features) that is both <strong>centralized</strong> and <strong>expensive</strong>, <a href="https://convos.chat/">Convos</a> is the leading free alternative. Over the past few years, IRCCloud’s infrastructure has suffered several periods of downtime, which has impacted many (if not all) its users. Unlike IRCCloud, the expenses and stability of running a private server for Convos is more cost-efficient and reliable, especially when compared to the pricing model (per user/per month) and the fragile nature of the IRCCloud infrastructure.</p><h3 id="how-to-start-chatting-with-convos">How to Start Chatting with Convos</h3><p>Installation and configuration of Convos is very simple and does not require any special knowledge of shell scripting. The developers have prepared a very convenient way to run script, so that you will be able to install the Web client quickly.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@nodo#: curl https://convos.chat/install.sh | sh -</code></pre></div><p>Here is the <a href="https://convos.chat/install.sh">Script code</a>, if you want to view it. If the script did not show any problems, we can proceed by starting the Convos daemon:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">root@nodo#: ./convos/script/convos daemon</code></pre></div><p>Launch your browser and enter <code>http://localhost:3000</code> to start chatting. There are no additional steps. You only have to choose the IRC network (e.g. Freenode) and Convos will do the rest!</p><p>Since you will be the first user, by default you will be set up as the Convos administrator. This will allow you to manage users, reset passwords as needed or create new ones, and set some <a href="https://convos.chat/doc/config#global-config-settings">global environment variables</a> as the default Convos connection.</p><p>You can change the listening port or IP address via the <a href="https://convos.chat/doc/config#listen"><code>--listen</code></a> flag; although, it is strongly recommended to run Convos behind a proxy server.</p><p>If you want to run Convos through a proxy server, I recommend you read the guide <a href="https://convos.chat/doc/reverse-proxy">“How to Run Convos Behind Your Favourite Server”</a>. A reverse proxy is a particular application that acts as an intermediary, in this case, between the client (the user) and the Convos daemon. It is useful if you want to have features such as SSL management, load balancing, compression, and …</p></div></div>

They can literally do anything on behalf of you and your business, such as teaching, guiding, assisting, helping broadcast, reminding, connecting, integrating with other platforms, and taking users’ commands. With high-end technological engines of deep learning, machine learning, and NLP, it is possible to let a bot understand human context or tone easily and offer solutions in the meantime.</p>

<p>For the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.tomlooman.com/stanford-cs193u/" target="_blank">Stanford University Fall 2020 Curriculum</a>, I built a small game project using mainly C++ mixed with some Blueprint in Unreal Engine. For those interested, the entire Computer Science course (CS193U) was provided through Zoom lectures and has been recorded. I’m working on getting this published and meanwhile, this project is already <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike" target="_blank">open-source through GitHub</a> to be taken apart by anyone! </p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="900" height="490" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tomlooman.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/actionroguelike_ue4_combatsample.jpg?resize=900%2C490&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.tomlooman.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/actionroguelike_ue4_combatsample.jpg?resize=900%2C490&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/www.tomlooman.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/actionroguelike_ue4_combatsample.jpg?resize=768%2C418&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.tomlooman.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/actionroguelike_ue4_combatsample.jpg?w=1222&amp;ssl=1 1222w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.tomlooman.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/actionroguelike_ue4_combatsample.jpg?resize=900%2C490&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/www.tomlooman.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/actionroguelike_ue4_combatsample.jpg?resize=768%2C418&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.tomlooman.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/actionroguelike_ue4_combatsample.jpg?w=1222&amp;ssl=1 1222w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tomlooman.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/actionroguelike_ue4_combatsample.jpg?resize=900%2C490&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div><p><strong>Check out the project file <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike" target="_blank">right here</a></strong> <strong>on GitHub!</strong></p><h2>Description</h2>
<p>The game was built with a wide set of features to cover a variety of useful coding concepts to students including AI, multiplayer programming, save games, async asset loading, etc. Check out the non-exhaustive list of features below, I’m sure there is more that I forgot to include or that will drip in at a later time.</p>
<p>Those interested in a GAS (<a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/InteractiveExperiences/GameplayAbilitySystem/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gameplay Ability System</a>) style design might be keen to check out how we handled Abilities (<a href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike/blob/master/Source/ActionRoguelike/Public/SAction.h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Action.h</a>) and Buffs/Debuffs (<a href="https://github.com/tomlooman/ActionRoguelike/blob/master/Source/ActionRoguelike/Public/SActionEffect.h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ActionEffect.h</a>) as this shares many similarities with GAS design, albeit its much simpler.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there isn’t a whole lot that makes this a real ‘roguelike’ with things like permadeath or proper RNG. But, I hope to extend this project later on with more relevant features to have a proper game loop to earn the name ‘Action Roguelike’.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Below I’ve listed some of the more relevant features included in the project. I think these code samples can be invaluable in getting an idea on how to use them in the Unreal Engine eco-system. Especially things like Asset Manager have limited public examples, which is one of the benefits of this open-source project.</p>

<p>There is still a decent chunk of features I would like to add, including adding a proper game loop, items/abilities, Steamworks, etc. Whether these will actually see the light of day depends on many factors – including the final shape of the existing course recordings.</p>

	<p>TL;DR: this is mostly a text version of a presentation I’ve done a couple times (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8OQfB6JSf8">English</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld8UFU-DB1U">Portuguese</a>) on the history of building DigitalOcean’s API gateway. How we made it easier for folks to build new microservices instead of continuing to add code to our monoliths, the successes, failures and lessons learned.</p>

<p>First, where were we?</p>

<p>DigitalOcean had 3 monoliths back in 2016 when we started (all 3 are still alive today, albeit much smaller than they were before). Why were there 3? There is a shared library that contains most of the logic that all 3 applications use, so in reality we had one “monolith library” that was reused at all 3, most logic changes were made into this library and then it would be upgraded at every single app separately. The library still exists today and continues to be updated every once in a while.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, as more and more changes started to happen, with the company growing incredibly fast both in terms of business and hiring, this wasn’t ideal. Many times someone would change this core library, deploy one of the apps (the control pane you see when you sign in), but not the JSON API. So you could end up with a new feature visible at the control panel but not at the API. There would always be a time when this library version wouldn’t match across all applications, as we were not deploying them all at once every single time, so there was always space for there to be a mismatch of features available.</p>

<p>This also meant that the test suite was growing by leaps and bounds, getting slower, making running the test suite and deployments a pain. There was growing interest in doing something about this, but we couldn’t just migrate everything out. There was also a lot of interest in NOT doing Ruby anymore. There was a growing body of Golang code all over the place and people wanted to use it for their new services instead of building it all inside the old monoliths.</p>

<p>There was a catch here though, how could they possibly do all the things the Rails apps were doing, like authentication, rate limiting, authorization, feature flipping, routing, error handling and all the shared logic, in a new language, without repeating the same thing across all new projects?</p>

<p>We needed something that would be language agnostic and could be run side by side with the existing monoliths. At this point we knew a library ( like Twitter’s Finagle) wasn’t an option. Our solution had to work with the old Ruby code and the new Golang stuff (and JS, maybe Python. It was all up in the air back then). We wouldn’t be able to build a library with all the shared features needed in multiple languages.This is where the API gateway comes in.</p>



<p>The microservices.io patterns list has a great definition for the <a href="https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html">API gateway</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Implement an API gateway that is the single entry point for all clients. The API gateway handles requests in one of two ways. Some requests are simply proxied/routed to the appropriate service. It handles other requests by fanning out to multiple services. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It took us multiple meetings and discussions between Joonas Bergius, Nan Zhong, Joe Friedl, me and even Phil Calçado, who was the engineering lead (not sure if this was actually the title but he was the boss), to come to the realization that we were going to build an API gateway.</p>

<p>What came out of the brainstorms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was going to be a pure HTTP proxy, no GRPC, GraphQL or other special protocols;</li>
  <li>We would not change request or response bodies, so there wouldn’t be any protocol translation. Applications would be responsible for parsing the input and producing valid outputs, in the format the client was expecting;</li>
  <li>We’d augment the requests and responses with extra information encoded as HTTP headers, including user information, rate limiting details, tracing metadata, features enabled, so all downstream applications would have to do was looking at the headers, not special exchange format.</li>
  <li>Route configuration would be self-service, teams would call a service with their route configuration and the proxy would automatically pick up changes and update it’s routing table. It would perform basic health checking and remove destinations that weren’t reachable, but otherwise would take any request and forward it to the registered services.</li>
  <li>It would also include filters that could be run before or after a request was processed, these filters would include authentication, rate limiting, feature flipping and all the other shared pieces teams would need to be available to build apps out of the monoliths.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does it look a lot like Java’s Servlet API or Ruby’s Rack? Of course, those were the main inspirations for the design. Going for a simple, well known, design would make us move faster as there would be less stuff to do and we could always complicate it in the future. This was one of the best decisions we made and this is still the way it works nowadays.</p>

<p>Why didn’t we pick something that existed? Fair question. There really weren’t many options back then and the ones that did exist did not make it easy to integrate custom code. Our very first challenge was to decrypt and parse Rails sessions to authenticate users, and there was plenty of complex code to decrypt, unmarshal (from Ruby’s serialization format) and make sense of session data.</p>

<p>Nginx, that was one of the options when we started, only offered integration through Lua scripts, so we’d have to write this session decrypting and parsing logic in Lua scripts we’d bundle with our custom Nginx install and that did not feel like a great solution. It was hard to test the scripts, no one had any experience with Lua and the whole setup wasn’t robust, these scripts were seen mostly as doing small changes in the request flow, not for building complex logic.</p>

<p>So, we started building our own API gateway in Golang.</p>



<p>Once we had the basic proxy built, we placed it in front of some of the traffic, to make sure it could proxy correctly. The first two “filters” we built were the authentication filters, for Rails sessions and OAuth tokens. To roll these out, we started by “doing” the filter work for both monoliths but not acting on them, we’d check if the output we came to in our implementation was the same the monoliths decided on and if the response was also the same; if our own service said a request should be denied but the monoliths responded with an OK or the other way around, we’d log that and work on figuring out why it didn’t work.</p>

<p>As we built these filters, another pattern emerged, instead of having all this code inside the API gateway itself, we thought it would be faster to separate the code into a separate service. The initial goal was mostly to make it reusable by other teams if needed and make it easier for us to deploy smaller changes as deploying the gateway itself was a complicated and slow process (due to the way our internal K8s clusters networking was setup back then, we couldn’t run the gateway on them, so it ran on droplets). After that, almost all filters were just glue code to call an external service that actually knew how to get the job done.</p>

<p><img src="https://mauricio.github.io/images/api-gateway.png" alt="API Gateway simple architecture diagram" title="API Gateway simple architecture diagram"></p>

<p>While it was a response to environmental constraints and not really something we planned, this design made the gateway itself smaller and more reliable. A lot of the logic would live in these microservices instead of the gateway and updates to them had a much smaller blast radius when something went awry.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nanzhong">@nanzhong</a> finally switched it to serve all traffic sometime in November 2016, a couple months after our announcement, including full support for authentication with the Rails session and OAuth tokens.</p>



<p>So far we had only done work internally. We weren’t exposing any of this to other teams yet, as we wanted to verify it was all behaving as expected before letting people register their services. The first integrations were bumpy and the experience for the teams we were integrating with was hard.</p>

<p>We lacked documentation and good examples. Teams had to come to us frequently to make sure their services were really up, their configurations were valid, how routing would work (what options are available? Can I use wildcards? Can I use URL parameters? In what order are routes matched?) and how they should integrate route registration into their workflows. This led to a lot of manual labor on our end helping people do stuff they could be doing themselves had we done the work to make it easier to onboard them. The lesson here was clear, if you’re working on infrastructure, make sure you can stay out of the way when people are doing their work, you want them to work on their time and not be an impediment for their work.</p>

<p>We also lacked best practices for what the backend services should look like. Multiple teams were being formed of new developers that didn’t have a lot of experience with building applications with Golang and we did not provide guidance here on how they should set up their applications and what configurations were important.</p>

<p>One recurrent issue we had at the beginning was that <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#Server">Golang’s http.Server</a> class assumes all timeouts are infinite unless you set them (ReadTimeout, ReadHeaderTimeout, WriteTimeout, WriteIdleTimeout) and this would lead to services getting a broken connection from the client (the API gateway) and wouldn’t know what it was until we checked their configs and noticed they just didn’t set a value (while we did have a max timeout for all requests on our end, so we’d close a connection that took too long).</p>

<p>Providing better guidance here for basic options and configurations that teams should be doing in all their apps would have saved a lot of time and effort for everyone.</p>

<p>Next, when registering routes, teams would talk directly to the key-value store we were using to store the routing table (Consul) and as you can imagine this wasn’t ideal. There was very little validation in place and it was super simple for people to register routes that wouldn’t load or that wouldn’t really route anything due to being incomplete. …</p></div></div>

		<p>I thought I should make a running post on cryptography ciphers (algorithms) and such. For instance, in my <a title="Notes on TLS/SSL, RSA, DSA, EDH, ECDHE, and so on …" href="http://rakhesh.com/infrastructure/notes-on-tlsssl-rsa-dsa-edh-ecdhe-and-so-on/">previous post</a> I mentioned AES, EDH, etc. but that’s just the tip of the ice-berg as there are so many&nbsp;algorithms each&nbsp;suited for different tasks. As I come across these I’ll add them to this post as a quick reference to myself.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Symmetric key&nbsp;algorithms&nbsp;(Private&nbsp;key cryptography)</h2>
<p>Both parties share a private key (kept secret between them).</p>
<p>Symmetric key algorithms are what you use for encryption. F0r example: encryption of traffic between a server and client, as well as&nbsp;encryption of&nbsp;data on a disk.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>DES – Data Encryption Standard – designed at IBM
<ul>
<li>DES is a standard. The actual algorithm used is also called DES or sometimes DEA (Digital Encryption Algorithm).&nbsp;</li>
<li>DES is now considered insecure (mainly due to a small key size of 56-bits).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Triple DES (3DES) applies the DES algorithm&nbsp;thrice and thus has better practical security. It has 3 keys of 56-bits each (applied to each pass of DES/ DEA).&nbsp;</li>
<li>DES-X is another variant.&nbsp;</li>
<li>DES is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher" target="_blank">block cipher</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IDEA – International Data Encryption Algorithm
<ul>
<li>Considered to be a good and secure algorithm.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Patented but free for non-commercial use.&nbsp;</li>
<li>IDEA&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher" target="_blank">block cipher</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AES – Advanced Encryption Standard – is the successor to DES
<ul>
<li>AES is based on the&nbsp;Rijndael cipher. There was a competition to choose the cipher that will become the AES. The&nbsp;Rijndael cipher won the competition. However, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnfa/archive/2006/10/09/the-differences-between-rijndael-and-aes.aspx" target="_blank">there are some differences</a> between&nbsp;Rijndael and its implementation in AES.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Most CPUs now include hardware AES support making it very fast.</li>
<li>Supported&nbsp;by TrueCrypt, SSH.&nbsp;</li>
<li>AES and Rjindael are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher" target="_blank">block ciphers</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>AES can operate in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1220751/how-to-choose-an-aes-encryption-mode-cbc-ecb-ctr-ocb-cfb" target="_blank">many modes</a>.
<ul>
<li>AES-GCM (AES operating in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)) is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5288" target="_blank">preferred</a>&nbsp;(check <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/staying-on-top-of-tls-attacks/" target="_blank">this blog post</a> too). It is fast and secure and works similar to stream ciphers. Can achieve high speeds on low hardware too. Only supported on TLS 1.2 and above.&nbsp;</li>
<li>AES-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Cipher-block_chaining_.28CBC.29" target="_blank">CBC</a> is what older clients commonly use. AES-CBC mode is susceptible to attacks such as <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/new-ssl-vulnerabilities-cloudflare-users-prot" target="_blank">Lucky13</a> and <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/taming-beast-better-ssl-now-available-across" target="_blank">BEAST</a>.</li>
<li>See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/22958889/2610230" target="_blank">this answer</a> for an excellent overview of the various modes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Blowfish – designed by&nbsp;Bruce Schneier&nbsp;as an alternative to DES; no issues so far, but can be attacked if the key is weak, better to use Twofish or Threefish.
<ul>
<li>Patent free. In public domain.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Supported by SSH.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.docstore.mik.ua/orelly/networking_2ndEd/ssh/ch03_09.htm" target="_blank">Much faster</a> than DES and IDEA but not as fast as RC4.</li>
<li>Uses variable size keys of 32 to 448 bits. Considered secure. Designed for fast&nbsp;CPUs, now&nbsp;slower / old er CPUs.</li>
<li>Blowfish&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher" target="_blank">block cipher</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Twofish –&nbsp;designed by&nbsp;Bruce Schneier and others as a successor to Blowfish
<ul>
<li>Was one of the finalists in the AES competition</li>
<li>Most CPUs now include hardware AES support making it very fast than Twofish.</li>
<li>Patent free. In public domain.</li>
<li>Uses&nbsp;keys of size 128, 192, or 256 bits. Designed to be more flexible than Blowfish (in terms of hardware requirements).&nbsp;</li>
<li>Supported&nbsp;by TrueCrypt, SSH.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Twofish&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher" target="_blank">block cipher</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Threefish – designed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Bruce Schneier and others
<ul>
<li>Threefish&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher" target="_blank">block cipher</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Serpent – designed by&nbsp;Ross Anderson, Eli Biham, and Lars Knudsen
<ul>
<li>Was one of the&nbsp;finalists in the AES competition</li>
<li>Patent free. In public domain.</li>
<li>Has a more conservative approach to security than other AES competition finalists.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Supported&nbsp;by TrueCrypt.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Serpent&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher" target="_blank">block cipher</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MARS – designed by Don Coppersmith (who was involved in DES) and others at IBM
<ul>
<li>Was one of the&nbsp;finalists in the AES competition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RC6 – Rivest Cipher 6 or Ron’s Code 6 – designed by Ron Rivest and others
<ul>
<li>Was one of the&nbsp;finalists in the AES competition</li>
<li>Proprietary algorithm. Patented by RSA Security.&nbsp;</li>
<li>RC5 is a predecessor of RC6. Other siblings include RC2 and RC4.&nbsp;</li>
<li>More on RC5 and RC6 at <a href="http://www.emc.com/emc-plus/rsa-labs/standards-initiatives/rc5-and-rc6.htm" target="_blank">this RSA link</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>RC5 and RC6 are&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher" target="_blank">block ciphers</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RC4 – Rivest Cipher 4, or Ron’s Code 4 – also known as ARC4 or ARCFOUR (Alleged RC4).
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.docstore.mik.ua/orelly/networking_2ndEd/ssh/ch03_09.htm" target="_blank">Used to be</a> an unpatented trade-secret for&nbsp;RSA Data Security Inc (RSADSI). Then someone posted the source code online, anonymously, and it got into the public domain.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Very fast, but less studied than other algorithms.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>RC4 is good if the key is never reused. Then its considered secure by many.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In practice RC4 is not recommended. TLS 1.1 and above&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Cipher" target="_blank">forbid RC4</a>&nbsp;(also <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-prohibiting-rc4-01" target="_blank">this RFC</a>). <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/killing-rc4-the-long-goodbye/" target="_blank">CloudFlare recommends against it</a>&nbsp;(check <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/staying-on-top-of-tls-attacks/" target="_blank">this blog post</a> too). <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2013/11/12/security-advisory-2868725-recommendation-to-disable-rc4.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft recommends against it</a>. Current recommendations overall are to use TLS 1.2 (which forbids RC4) and use <a href="http://www.heliontech.com/aes_gcm.htm" target="_blank">AES-GCM</a>.</li>
<li>See this <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/03/attack-of-week-rc4-is-kind-of-broken-in.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RC4 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher" target="_blank">stream cipher</a>. It’s the most widely used stream cipher.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Recently <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/02/attack-of-week-tls-timing-oracles.html" target="_blank">block ciphers were found to have issues</a>&nbsp;(e.g. <a href="http://www.net-security.org/article.php?id=1638" target="_blank">BEAST</a>, <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/02/attack-of-week-tls-timing-oracles.html" target="_blank">Lucky13</a>)&nbsp;because of which RC4 rose in importance. Now such attacks are mitigated (use GCM mode for instance) and RC4 is strongly recommended against.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Asymmetric key algorithms (Public key cryptography)</h2>
<p>Each party has&nbsp;a private key (kept secret) and a public key (known to all). These are used in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public keys are used for encrypting, Private keys are used for decrypting.&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>For example: to send something encrypted to a party use its public key and send the encrypted data. Since only that party has the corresponding private key, only that party can decrypt it. (No point encrypting it with your private key as anyone can then decrypt with your public key!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Private keys are used for signing, Public keys are used for verifying.&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>For example: to digitally sign something, encrypt it with your private key (usually a hash is made and the hash encrypted). Anyone can decrypt this data (or decrypt the hash &amp; data and perform a hash themselves to verify&nbsp;your hash and their hash match) and verify that since it was signed by your private key the data belongs to you.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These algorithms are usually used to digitally sign data and/ or exchange a secret key which can be used with a symmetric key algorithm to encrypt further data. They are often not used for encrypting the conversation either because they can’t (DSA, Diffie-Hellman) or because the yield is low and there are speed constraints (RSA). Most of these algorithms make use of&nbsp;hashing functions (see below) for <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/9265" target="_blank">internal purposes</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>RSA – short for the surnames of its designers&nbsp;Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman
<ul>
<li>Not used to encrypt data directly because of <a href="http://www.paradigm.ac.uk/workbook/metadata/authenticity-signatures.html" target="_blank">speed&nbsp;constraints</a> and also because its yield is small (see <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/9265" target="_blank">this post</a> for a good explanation; also <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc962021.aspx" target="_blank">this TechNet</a> article).
<ul>
<li>Usually RSA is used to&nbsp;share a secret key and then a symmetric key algorithm is used for the actual encryption.&nbsp;</li>
<li>RSA can be used for digital signing but is slower. DSA (see below) is preferred. However, RSA signatures are <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/5105" target="_blank">faster to verify</a>.&nbsp;To sign data <a href="http://www.paradigm.ac.uk/workbook/metadata/authenticity-signatures.html" target="_blank">a hash is made of it and the hash encrypted</a> with the private key. (Note: RSA <em>requires</em> that <a href="http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/12768/why-hash-the-message-before-signing-it-digital-signature-with-rsa" target="_blank">a hash be made</a> rather than encrypt the data itself). &nbsp;</li>
<li>RSA does not&nbsp;require the use of any particular hash function.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Public and Private keys are based on two large prime numbers which must be kept secret. RSA’s security is based on the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization" target="_blank">factorization of large integers</a> is difficult. (The public and private keys are large integers which are&nbsp;derived from&nbsp;the two large prime numbers).</li>
<li>PKCS#1 is a standard for implementing&nbsp;the RSA algorithm. The RSA algorithm can be attacked if certain criteria are met so the PKCS#1 defines things such that these criteria are not met. See <a href="http://rdist.root.org/2009/10/06/why-rsa-encryption-padding-is-critical/" target="_blank">this post</a> for more info.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Was originally patented by the RSA but has since (circa 2000) expired.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-keygen" target="_blank">SSH v1</a> only uses RSA keys (for identity verification).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DSA – Digital Signature Algorithm – designed by the NSA as part of the Digital Signature Standard (DSS)
<ul>
<li>Used for digital signing. Does not do encryption. (But implementations can do encryption using RSA or ElGamal encryption)&nbsp;</li>
<li>DSA is <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/5105" target="_blank">fast at signing but slow at verifying</a>.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>It <a href="http://www.paradigm.ac.uk/workbook/metadata/authenticity-signatures.html" target="_blank">mandates the use of SHA hashes</a> when computing digital signatures.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Unlike RSA which makes a hash of the data and then encrypts it to sign the message – and this data plus encrypted hash is what’s used to verify the signature – DSA has a different process. DSA&nbsp;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc962021.aspx" target="_blank">generates a digital signature composed of two 160-bit numbers</a> directly from the private key and a hash of the data to be signed. The corresponding public key can be used to verify the signature. The verifying is slow.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A note about speed:&nbsp;DSA is faster at signing, slow at verifying. RSA is&nbsp;faster at verifying, slow at signing.&nbsp;The&nbsp;significance of this is different from what you may think. Signing can be used to sign data, it can also be used for authentication. For instance, when using SSH you sign some data with your private&nbsp;key and send to the server. The server verifies the signature and if it&nbsp;succeeds you are authenticated. In such a situation it doesn’t matter that DSA verification is slow because it usually happens on a powerful server. DSA signing, which happens on a relatively slower computer/ phone/ tablet is a much faster process and so less intensive on the processor. In such a&nbsp;scenario DSA is preferred! Remember: <em>where</em> the slow/ fast activity occurs also matters.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DSA can be used <a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/a/5105" target="_blank">only for signing</a>. So DSA&nbsp;has to use something like Diffie-Hellman to generate another key for encrypting&nbsp;the conversation.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>This is a good thing as it allows for Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Forward Secrecy =&gt; the shared key used for encrypting conversation between two parties is not related to their public/ private key.</li>
<li>Perfect Forward Secrecy =&gt; in addition to the above, the shared keys are generated for each conversation and are independent of each other.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, because&nbsp;DSA can be&nbsp;used only for digital signatures and not encryption, it&nbsp;is usually <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc962021.aspx" target="_blank">not subject to export or import restrictions</a>. Therefore it can be used more widely.</li>

<p>I was trying to get a development VM working (Windows host, Linux guest). I’d just binned WSL2 as it was causing me a bit of jip, and had been happily coding all day with Remote SSH into my shiny new Ubuntu VM via VS Code. I was, however, having a few problems. The frontend I was working on was using Auth0 for authentication, and that wasn’t happy on a non-localhost domain, with no HTTPS. Webpack to the rescue… give me a dev cert… done and working. Until the frontend tries to make a request to the backend – blocked due to mixed HTTP/HTTPS.</p>
<p>I was going round the houses finding the best solution for getting a system in place to allow both DNS (host file?… lightweight DNS proxy?!), and SSL termination on the VM (nginx, caddy, traefik?!).</p>
<p>After spending a very long time investigating the latest and greatest, I randomly refreshed an old localhost:8081 tab running in Chrome (the site I was working on was running here) and to my surprise, the whole thing loaded, from the Ubuntu VM. To check I wasn’t crackers I checked the logs there, and it was the VM serving my requests. How?! Whaaaaaattt????!!!!!</p>
<p>I could understand this if I’d had a few gins, but no, maybe tired eyes? After some digging, I discovered that if a program outputs a localhost:port style URL into the terminal in VS Code whilst you are using the Remote SSH feature, and you click it, it will automagically setup a port forward.</p>

<p>What a handy little feature! One worth knowing about for those juxtaposed between Windows and Linux, or just taking advantage of the remote features of VS code. Don’t do what I did and go round the houses, this is a great solution to many problems.</p>

It’s so often the rags to riches, starving artist or the struggling entrepreneur that catches the headlines. Outside the world of start-up mythology however it’s more commonly risk aversion that keeps the world of business ticking over. 

<!-- -->Professor Ralph O’Swarm studied risk attitudes in 100 executives and found that they “do not portray the risk-takers we hear so much of in industrial folklore.”, “They quash new ideas in favor of marginal improvements, cost-cutting, and “safe” investments.” </span><a href="https://hbr.org/2020/03/your-company-is-too-risk-averse" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>hbr.org</span></u></a></span></p><blockquote id="viewer-9tlfe"><span><em><span>In current practice, however, executives in large corporations are reluctant to propose and advocate for risky projects. They quash new ideas in favor of marginal improvements, cost-cutting, and “safe” investments.</span></em></span></blockquote><p id="viewer-bnfgd"><span><span>So why aren’t more businesses making every effort to embed ethics into their organisations and products? At a very rudimentary level embedding ethics into your work will keep you a step ahead of compliance regulation and reduces the risk of negative PR from unethical business practices. Is it because it’s difficult to perceive the potential monetary value of ethics? Or the value lost by not incorporating ethics? 

At Hattusia although we believe that the value of ethics extends far beyond the bottom line on a balance sheet; it does have financial value. We created the Hattusia ROI calculator to look at exactly this. What is the risk of not embedding ethics into your work and what is the potential financial reward? </span></span></p><p id="viewer-5q5uq"><span><span>The following are three examples of (fictional) businesses within three different industries that we’ve put through the Hattusia ROI Calculator. The calculator factors:

✔️ possible market share increases due to ethical innovations</span></span></p><p id="viewer-9kk91"><span><span>✔️ potential market size growth due to your ethical building principles becoming a standard within your industry</span></span></p><p id="viewer-duobf"><span><span>
❌ reputation risk in losing market share because of the negative responses to your product</span></span></p><p id="viewer-80j51"><span><span>❌ regulatory risk of your products or industry receiving bans due to new regulation</span></span></p><p id="viewer-28pg8"><span><span>❌ risk of non-compliance as you may have to make significant changes to your product to comply with new regulation </span></span></p><h2 id="viewer-817r2"><span><strong><span>Seasonal Stay Fever (SSF)</span></strong></span></h2><div id="viewer-d6e3u"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img" aria-label="Seasonal Stay Fever"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.hattusia.com/post/how-ethics-can-increase-revenue-in-tech-businesses" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/575efd_59b89f2aef1e40c2856d8d1007dc126a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_784%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/575efd_59b89f2aef1e40c2856d8d1007dc126a~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg" alt="Seasonal Stay Fever"></p></div><p><span dir="auto">Photo by Robert Bye on Unsplash</span></p></div></div></div><blockquote id="viewer-5vncb"><span><span>SSF will be a platform that uses information like your holiday budget, past holidays, and family size to match you with the perfect Staycation. </span></span></blockquote><p id="viewer-e5djk"><span><span>The biggest potential ethical risk with SSF will come through their use of data.

<span>We’ve seen the potential financial impact that can be caused by not embedding ethical practice into your products as Amazon and IBM have had to remove facial recognition products from the market due to a growing mistrust over the quality of the technology and its applications. As well as the costs of product withdrawals this lack of trust can also be a major barrier to future revenue. Just recently Deliveroo lost a court case over their use of what was deemed a discriminatory algorithm. </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9e4e/court-rules-deliveroo-used-discriminatory-algorithm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><span>vice.com</span></u></a><span> </span></span></p><blockquote id="viewer-deo8q"><span><span><em>“If you can demonstrate that you are a trustworthy designer of technology, that will lead to economic value because more people will want to do business with you”. </em></span></span></blockquote><p id="viewer-1hr18"><span><span>- Will Griffin, Chief Ethics Officer at Hypergiant </span>

<span>The examples above have shown the potential financial reward of embedding tech ethics into your organisation. The Hattusia Ethics ROI calculator is designed to play a part in building your case for tech ethics but it is important to paint a holistic picture about why ethics is vital for modern business. </span></span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

Back in&nbsp;2011, he produced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um63OQz3bjo">an animated video explaining how the digital currency works</a>. For his efforts, a bitcoin enthusiast awarded him&nbsp;7,002 bitcoins.</p>  <p>Later that year, he lost&nbsp;the password to his&nbsp;IronKey, the USB hard drive that contains the digital wallet that holds his bitcoins. Since then, the currency's value has skyrocketed, and Thomas' holdings&nbsp;are worth $220 million US ($321 million Cdn.)&nbsp;</p>  <p>The IronKey&nbsp;gives users 10 password guesses before it encrypts its contents permanently, and Thomas' bitcoin is lost forever. He has two guesses left.</p>  <p>Here is part of his conversation with <em>As It Happens </em>host Carol Off.&nbsp;</p>  <p><strong>Stefan, how is it possible that one measly little password stands between you and hundreds of millions of dollars?</strong></p>  <p>Yeah, it's a really good question, isn't it?</p>  <p><strong>OK, this happens, right? We all know we lose our passwords. And so a little thing comes up when we're going to our bank or whatever [that says], "Did you forget your password?" And then you push it and then you go through a business of changing your password. So that's not available to you?</strong></p>  <p>No. Bitcoin is a decentralized system. And so if you hold your bitcoins, like I did, in a completely independent wallet — so not with an exchange, not with a bank, not with any kind of institution, but yourself — then it's just like cash. It's like gold. If you lose it, you lose it. There's no recovery process for that.</p>  <p>Since then, a lot of people have come up with all kinds of clever solutions like, you know, metal wallets where you can put down your secret keys and things like that. But most of that didn't exist back then. Back then, you had to kind of come up with your own solution. And apparently I didn't do a very good job of that.</p>    <blockquote><span><span><svg version="1.1" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" width="30px" height="25px" viewBox="0 0 52.157 39.117" enable-background="new 0 0 52.157 39.117" space="preserve"><g><g><path fill="000000" d="M22.692,10.113c-5.199,1.4-8.398,4.4-8.398,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.6,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.4,3.4,3.4,6.602   c0,3.799-3.4,6.799-7.4,6.799c-4.6,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z M45.692,10.113   c-5.199,1.4-8.399,4.4-8.399,8.801c0,2.4,2,3,3.601,4.199c2.2,1.602,3.399,3.4,3.399,6.602c0,3.799-3.399,6.799-7.399,6.799   c-4.601,0-8.8-3.199-8.8-10.6c0-13.6,7-20,17.599-21.799V10.113z"></path></g></g><g display="none"><g display="inline"> <path fill="000000" d="M6.648,29.759c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.399-3.4-3.399-6.6   c0-3.801,3.399-6.801,7.399-6.801c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z M29.648,29.759   c5.199-1.4,8.398-4.4,8.398-8.801c0-2.398-2-3-3.599-4.199c-2.2-1.6-3.401-3.4-3.401-6.6c0-3.801,3.401-6.801,7.401-6.801   c4.599,0,8.8,3.201,8.8,10.6c0,13.6-7,20-17.6,21.801V29.759z"></path></g></g></svg>I tried everything.

How many people do you think are not able to access their fortunes?</strong></p>  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html">In The New York Times article about this</a>, they had an estimate, which was something like [$140 billion US ($178,258,500 Cdn) is] locked up in these wallets. And so you can imagine it's probably hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, who are in my situation.</p>  <p><strong>But I think they said it was 20 per cent of all the bitcoin accounts are owned by people who can't access them [according</strong> <strong>to the cryptocurrency data firm Chainalysis].</strong></p>  <p>Yeah, I think a good chunk of that, especially, like, some of the larger ones, were very early wallets. So, you know, at the time, it might have been less money.</p>  <p>In my case, it was $140,000 ($179,000 Cdn), which for me was a huge amount — like an incomprehensible amount, even then. But of course, you know, once you can't access it and the price goes up, the number just gets bigger and bigger.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898812.1541775662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/98129739.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898812.1541775662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/98129739.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898812.1541775662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/98129739.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898812.1541775662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/98129739.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898812.1541775662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/98129739.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.4898812.1541775662!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/98129739.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A visual representation of the cryptocurrency bitcoin <!-- --> <!-- -->(Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p><strong>So what is it like for you? I mean, how many sleepless nights do you have thinking about the fact that you have $200 million that you can't get at?</strong></p>  <p>After I realized I lost the coins, I was completely destroyed. Like, when I think back to that, it's hard to even wrap my head around how I felt that those couple of weeks.</p>  <p>And I tried everything. I would stay up all night trying different ideas for how to recover it, or just,&nbsp;like, staring at the ceiling for hours. You know, just what you imagine you would do if you lost that sort of money.</p>  <p>And then after a couple of weeks of that, I got to a point where I started to realize that the chances of recovery were not very good. And we'll get into, you know, what that last little glimmer of hope is in a moment.</p>  <p>So I sort of had to make a decision, right? Like, either I let this define the rest of my life and I keep thinking back to it and I just, you know, like you said,&nbsp;lose sleep for the rest of my life, or&nbsp;I just, you know, face the fact that this money is gone, these bitcoins are gone, and I move forward and I get back to work. And I chose the latter.</p>  <p><strong>OK, so what's the last glimmer of hope?</strong></p>  <p>The famous USB stick with the 10 tries.</p>  <p>There is a way to take a scanning electron microscope and take apart the physical chip and literally go into the the silicon chip and take away layer by layer, like a few atoms thick, and then read out the actual memory cells. And then with that technique, you should be able to bypass that limit of 10 tries, and then you can have a supercomputer try, you know, billions of passwords per second.</p>  <p>Now, the problem is that, first of all, that requires a specialized laboratory. It's very expensive. Only a few people in the world can do it. And even then, it's kind&nbsp;of high risk. It&nbsp;could just fail, and then the chip is destroyed and you don't get a second try.</p>  <p>Back then, it definitely wasn't worth it. I think now it probably is worth it. But it still requires a lot of organizing and logistics, and even then it's not guaranteed.</p>  <p>Now that this has been in the news, I'm getting lots and lots of people reaching out, some of whom are the types of people who have access to that kind of equipment and the kind of expertise needed. And so I'm talking to them to see, you know, if we should attempt a recovery and, like, what it would cost, etcetera.</p>    <p><strong>So what happens? I mean, hundreds of millions of dollars are now sort of locked up ... Where does it go? Who gets it? </strong></p>  <p>Because I'm not selling those Bitcoins, that means that there's a little bit less supply in the market ... and so potentially the price is infinitesimally higher, right?&nbsp;</p>  <p>Other holders, in theory, profit. Although you have to imagine, like because of this risk, maybe there are people that maybe don't invest in bitcoin because they're worried about this. And so maybe that kind of makes up for it and kind of that reduces the price. So, again, that's probably almost a better question for an economist to opine on.</p>  <p><strong>There are those who are saying that this now just belies the value of investing in this kind of bitcoin. For all the advantages it has, that you don't have to deal with institutions and governments, that obviously it has its pitfalls. And so are you one of those? Are you one of the people who think that maybe this kind of currency is not a good idea?</strong></p>  <p>This experience has definitely changed my opinion about bitcoin in terms of I was one of those people that was very excited about, you know, everyone can be their own bank and that sort of thing.</p>  <p>I know there's lots of bitcoin experts listening right now saying that, "This could never happen to me!" But for me personally, like, I kind of was very humbled by that experience.</p>  <p>Nowadays, my belief is that I think it's really nice that we live in a free country where we can have the choice and we can hold our own bitcoins if we want to. And I think that's a right that I would fight for preserving. There have been some discussions in the U.S. about maybe not allowing that in the future, and I think that's something I'm absolutely against.</p>  <p>But at the same time, I think that as a practical matter, for most people, it's probably better to hold their bitcoins with a custodian, like an institution that specializes in securing and storing bitcoins.</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written by Sheena Goodyear.

        <hr>
<p>If you work with databases you are probably familiar with B-Tree indexes. They are used to enforce unique and primary-key constraints, and are the default index type in most database engines. If you work with text, geography or other complex types in PostgreSQL, you may have dipped your toes into GIN or GIST indexes. If you manage a read intensive database (or just follow this blog), you may also be familiar with BRIN indexes.</p>
<p>There is another type of index you are probably not using, and may have never even heard of. It is wildly unpopular, and until a few PostgreSQL versions ago it was highly discouraged and borderline unusable, but under some circumstances it can out-perform even a B-Tree index.</p>
<p><strong>In this article we re-introduce the Hash index in PostgreSQL!</strong></p>

<h2 id="hash-index"><a href="#hash-index">Hash Index</a></h2>
<p>Just like the name suggests, Hash indexes in PostgreSQL use a form of the hash table data structure. Hash table is a common data structure in many programming languages. For example, a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesmapping" rel="noopener">Dict</a> in Python, a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html" rel="noopener">HashMap</a> in Java or the new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map" rel="noopener">Map</a> type in JavaScript.</p>
<p>To understand how you can benefit from Hash indexes, it's best to understand how they work.</p>
<h3 id="hash-function"><a href="#hash-function">Hash Function</a></h3>
<p>Hash indexes use a <em>hash function</em>. PostgreSQL's hash function maps any database value to a 32-bit integer, the <em>hash code</em> (about 4 billion possible hash codes). A good hash function can be computed quickly and "jumbles" the input uniformly across its entire range.</p>
<p>The hash codes are divided to a limited number of <em>buckets</em>. The buckets map the hash codes to the actual table rows.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A simple hash function for an integer type is modulo: divide a number by another number, and the remainder is the hash code. For example, to divide values across 3 buckets you can use the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>bucket</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>generate_series</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>
<span> n  │ bucket</span>
<span>────┼────────</span>
<span>  1 │      1</span>
<span>  2 │      2</span>
<span>  3 │      0</span>
<span>  4 │      1</span>
<span>  5 │      2</span>
<span>  6 │      0</span>
<span>  7 │      1</span>
<span>  8 │      2</span>
<span>  9 │      0</span>
<span> 10 │      1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When a new value is added to the index, PostgreSQL applies the hash function to the value and puts the hash code and a pointer to the tuple in the appropriate bucket. In the example above using the hash function <code>mod(3)</code>, if you insert the value <code>5</code> the index entry will be added to bucket <code>2</code>, because <code>5 % 3 = 2</code>.</p>
<p>When you query a value using a Hash index, PostgreSQL does the opposite. It takes the value and applies the hash function to determine which bucket may hold matching tuples. Once the bucket is identified, PostgreSQL will fetch the tuples referenced in that bucket and match them against your query.</p>
<h3 id="hash-collision"><a href="#hash-collision">Hash Collision</a></h3>
<p>You may have noticed that multiple values can map to the same bucket; this is called a <em>collision</em>. For example, the hash function <code>mod(3)</code> returned the hash code <code>2</code> for the values <code>2</code>, <code>5</code> and <code>8</code>.</p>
<p>What PostgreSQL actually does, is to first use a hash function to produce an integer hash code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>hashtext</span><span>(</span><span>'text'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hashchar</span><span>(</span><span>'c'</span><span>),</span>
    <span>hash_array</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>]),</span>
    <span>jsonb_hash</span><span>(</span><span>'{"me": "haki"}'</span><span>::</span><span>jsonb</span><span>),</span>
    <span>timestamp_hash</span><span>(</span><span>now</span><span>()</span><span>::</span><span>timestamp</span><span>);</span>

<span>─[ RECORD 1 ]──┬────────────</span>
<span>hashtext       │ -451854347</span>
<span>hashchar       │ 203891234</span>
<span>hash_array     │ -325393530</span>
<span>jsonb_hash     │ -1784498999</span>
<span>timestamp_hash │ 1082344883</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It then uses <code>mod(n_buckets)</code> to determine which bucket the tuple should be put in. This can cause multiple values to end up in the same bucket. This is why even after the bucket is identified, the database still needs to sift through the hash codes in the bucket and recheck the condition to filter only the matching tuples.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index overflow pages</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As rows are added to the index, it's possible for a bucket's primary page to fill up. In this case, additional rows are written to overflow pages. The overflow pages contain index entries that did not fit in the bucket's primary page.</p>
<h3 id="index-split"><a href="#index-split">Index Split</a></h3>
<p>At some point, the database can decide it needs to split a bucket into two buckets. PostgreSQL uses special hash functions that ensure values in a bucket can be split into exactly two buckets. When a bucket is split, additional storage is allocated to the index.</p>

<figcaption>Hash Index split</figcaption>

<p>Luckily, PostgreSQL does all the heavy lifting for you, so you don't have to decide what hash function to use, or how many buckets there are.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the internals of Hash indexes in PostgreSQL, check out the <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/hash/README" rel="noopener">readme on "Hash Indexing"</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="hash-index-in-postgresql"><a href="#hash-index-in-postgresql">Hash Index in PostgreSQL</a></h2>
<p>Hash indexes were discouraged prior to PostgreSQL 10. If you read the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/indexes-types.html" rel="noopener">index type documentation for PostgreSQL 9.6</a> you'll find a nasty warning about Hash indexes. According to the warning, Hash indexes are not written to the WAL so they cannot be maintained in replicas, and they are not automatically available after a crash, so you need to manually rebuild them.</p>
<p>Starting at PostgreSQL 10 these limitations were resolved, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/release-10.html#id-1.11.6.20.5.3.3" rel="noopener">Hash indexes are no longer discouraged</a>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-hash-indexes"><a href="#creating-hash-indexes">Creating Hash Indexes</a></h3>
<p>Now that you know how Hash indexes work in PostgreSQL, you are ready to see them in action. To illustrate, we'll create an imaginary URL shortening service.</p>
<p>A URL shortener service, such as "bit.ly" or the late "goo.gl", provides a short random URL that points to a longer URL. For example, you can have the short url <code>https://short.url/hb9837</code> point to the longer URL <code>https://hakibenita.com/automating-the-boring-stuff-in-django-using-the-check-framework</code>. We'll call the <code>hb9837</code> part of the short URL the <code>key</code>.</p>
<p>To implement your URL shortening service, create a table to store the mapping between the keys and the full URLs:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>
    <span>key</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span>
    <span>url</span> <span>text</span> <span>not</span> <span>null</span>
<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The table includes an auto incrementing primary key <code>id</code>, a text field for <code>key</code>, and a <code>url</code> field containing the full URL.</p>
<p>Next, create a B-Tree and a Hash index on both fields:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>UNIQUE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_key_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>key</span><span>);</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_hash_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>hash</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>shorturl_url_btree_index</span> <span>ON</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>USING</span> <span>btree</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You might have noticed that the B-Tree on <code>key</code> is a unique index, but the Hash index is not. This is because Hash indexes currently cannot be used to enforce unique constraints.</p>
<h3 id="hash-index-size"><a href="#hash-index-size">Hash Index Size</a></h3>
<p>The first thing you want to do is to compare the size of a Hash index to the size of a similar B-Tree index:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>EXTENSION</span> <span>"uuid-ossp"</span><span>;</span>

<span>DO</span> <span>$$</span>
<span>BEGIN</span>
    <span>FOR</span> <span>i</span> <span>IN</span> <span>0..1000000</span> <span>loop</span>
        <span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>shorturl</span> <span>(</span><span>key</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>uuid_generate_v4</span><span>(),</span>
        <span>'https://www.supercool-url.com/'</span> <span>||</span> <span>round</span><span>(</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>10</span> <span>^</span> <span>6</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>text</span>
    <span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>mod</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>,</span> <span>10000</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span> <span>THEN</span>

    <span>END</span> <span>IF</span><span>;</span>
    <span>END</span> <span>LOOP</span><span>;</span>
<span>END</span><span>;</span>
<span>$$</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To get a better sense of how both indexes behave, keep track of the size of the indexes as rows are inserted to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate 1,000,000 short urls one by one</li>
<li>Every 10,000 rows log the size of all four indexes</li>
<li>Use <code>uuid_generate_v4</code> from the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/uuid-ossp.html" rel="noopener">uuid-ossp</a> package to generate UUIDs as keys</li>
<li>Generate a long URL from a 6-digit domain so it's not unique, but almost unique</li>
</ul>
<p>Running the script on PostgreSQL 13 and plotting the results gives the following chart:</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/01-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The chart provides several interesting observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Hash index is smaller than the B-Tree index</strong>: Almost all along the way, the Hash index on both fields is smaller than the size of the corresponding B-Tree index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index grows in increments</strong>: Unlike the B-Tree index that seems to grow linearlly as rows are inserted to the table, the Hash index grows in sudden increments. These sudden increments are caused when a split is triggered to allocate space for more buckets. When that space runs out, another split is triggered and so on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the size of the indexed value</strong>: A Hash index stores the hash codes of the index field values. A B-Tree on the other hand, stores the actual value of the indexed field in its leaves, so the size of the indexed value affects the size of a B-Tree index, but not the size of a Hash index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hash index size is not affected by the selectivity of the indexed value</strong>: The selectivity of the URL field is different than that of the key field, which is almost unique, but the Hash index on both fields is the same size. A size of a B-Tree index on the other hand, can vary based on the selectivity of the data (see note below about "B-Tree deduplication").</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>B-Tree deduplication</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 13 introduced a new <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/btree-implementation.html#BTREE-DEDUPLICATION" rel="noopener">B-Tree deduplication</a> mechanism that reduces the size of a B-Tree indexes with many duplicate values. In the chart above, the size of the B-Tree index on the <code>url</code> field is smaller than the size of the index on the <code>key</code> field because it has fewer unique values.</p>
<figure><img alt="Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/02-postgresql-hash-index.png"><figcaption>Hash vs. B-Tree index size on PostgreSQL 12</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you run the same script with deduplication disabled, or on PostgreSQL versions prior to 13, you'll see that the size of the index is the same (as long as values are the same size).</p>
</div>
<p>The script you ran before imitates a workload of an OLTP-like system, where single rows are constantly being added to the table. This is the size of the indexes after the script finished:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>\di+</span> <span>shorturl*</span>
<span>          Name           │ Type  │ Table    │Size</span>
<span>─────────────────────────┼───────┼──────────┼────────</span>
<span>shorturl_key_btree_index │ index │ shorturl │ 73 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_key_hash_index  │ index │ shorturl │ 37 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_url_btree_index │ index │ shorturl │ 53 MB</span>
<span>shorturl_url_hash_index  │ index │ shorturl │ 36 MB</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I use Debian Bullseye on a Lenovo T14 AMD. This laptop is great and works very well with a recent Linux kernel (5.10).
It has 3 network interfaces: a wireless one, a wired one with a normal ethernet port, and a second wired one, with a prioprietary port, for Lenovo docks, I don’t use.</p><p>The interfaces are named <code>wlp3s0</code>, <code>enp2s0f0</code> and <code>enp5s0</code> in Debian. Yes, it turns out nowadways network interfaces are not simply named wlanX for wifi and ethX for ethernet as they conveniently used to.
There are good reasons for this change: depending on which interface was detected first during each boot, they could change name randomly. For example what was <code>eth0</code> on a boot could become <code>eth1</code> on the next one, which is problematic, as interface names can be used in some configuration files.</p><p>The solution is to give each interface some unique predictable names, based on the “BIOS device name” of the interface. This is great, but really annoying in practice, as I always forget how the interfaces are named, and which of the wired interfaces is the one I use 😕</p><h2 id="renaming-network-interfaces">Renaming network interfaces</h2><p>Thanksfully, it is possible to rename interfaces. On Debian, this is done using systemd configuration, as apparently nowadays udev is part of systemd.</p><p>First, we need to find the “path id” of the device, that is to say a unique identifier of the device, based on the PCI domain, the number of the bus and the device position on the bus.
It can be done using the command <code>udevadm</code>. For my wireless interface <code>wlp3s0</code> the command looks like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">$ sudo udevadm test-builtin path_id /sys/class/net/wlp3s0 2&gt;/dev/null 
ID_PATH<span>=</span>pci-0000:03:00.0
ID_PATH_TAG<span>=</span>pci-0000_03_00_0
</code></pre></div><p>In this case the <code>path_id</code> is <code>pci-0000:03:00.0</code>. I can then create a <code>.link</code> file to choose the name of the interface;</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">$ sudoedit /etc/systemd/network/10-rename-wlp3s0.link 
$ cat /etc/systemd/network/10-rename-wlp3s0.link 
<span>[</span>Match<span>]</span>
Path<span>=</span>pci-0000:03:00.0
<span>[</span>Link<span>]</span>
Name<span>=</span>wlan0
</code></pre></div><p>I did this for all the interfaces I wanted to rename, then rebooted and checked the result:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="shell">$ ip addr
