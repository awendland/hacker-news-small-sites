<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Learning online may have begun in the late 90s, but lately, it has been gathering a lot of attention. Especially due to the recent situation of the world with the pandemic and worldwide lockdown, e-learning has proved to be one of <em>the most</em> prominent uses of technology in the 21st century.</p><p>When the pandemic hit the world and all the educational institutions everywhere shut down, e-learning was there as our savior. Learning online was not a new concept to us, yet due to this, e-learning gained another, much more valuable reputation entirely. Now that we knew to learn online was that easy and that flexible, some people even started to question the hype of offline learning.</p><p>It is now safe to say that learning through the internet is a market that is just going to grow in the following few years. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-e-learning-market-is-expected-to-grow-at-a-cagr-of-over-14-during-the-period-20192025-301047035.html">Researches</a> even conclude that the market size of e-learning is expected to grow at a rate of 10.85% by 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>So, the question is why do you need to integrate personalization in e-learning. Well, the answer is a simple one: It makes the experience better and generates much more value for the learner. First things first, personalization is an important concept for most, if not all online business. <a href="https://www.caboom.ai/blogfeatured/is-personalization-the-future">The scope of personalization</a> has grown so much that many enterprises will use it, or have already been leveraging it to generate value for their customers.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s elaborate on why personalization will change the e-learning experience as a whole.</p><h3><strong>One Size</strong> <strong>Does Not</strong> <strong>Fit All&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>We have left behind the days of pushing the same thing to everyone and anyone. People have preferences on the smallest aspects of their lives, so it is expected that personalization is included on other aspects as well, even in their online learning experience.&nbsp;</p><p>People might have their preferences on the devices they would want to use, the pace they want to follow, the subjects they want to learn and be recommended next, the format of learning (audio/video/text), and whatnot. So, the whole concept of one <em>size fits all </em>should be discarded and we should move towards more advanced approaches.</p><h3><strong>The Pace of Learning</strong></h3><p>We often underestimate the importance of the pace of learning when we are learning with a group of people crammed together in a classroom. The fact that people have different speeds of understanding the things being taught is usually neglected in offline learning.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why, in online learning, it is expected by the user to be able to personalize their speed of learning. There wouldn’t be much difference in online learning and learning in a school if you still have to rush to go to class on time and struggle to meet the speed of other students in the group.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Giving students the control</strong></h3><p>When the application is personalized, it will give students/learners more control of what they are experiencing through the e-learning app. This results in students being able to:</p><ol role="list"><li>Carefully think about their goals from the course they are doing</li><li>Set up their own learning path</li><li>Choose devices to study from that they are the most comfortable with</li><li>Study without the pressure and competitiveness of learning in a group&nbsp;</li><li>Study in various flexible speeds, suited to themselves</li><li>Get&nbsp; course recommendations on what they can learn next</li></ol><p>In the tech-driven world of 2020, you must give more thought to leveraging technology in your online business. Technology is evolving and bettering itself every day, and we must evolve according to it. We at Caboom believe that <a href="https://www.caboom.ai/blogfeatured/is-personalization-the-future">personalization is the future</a>, and the e-learning industry must use it in their favor.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it comes to recommender systems, the default choices are usually to use Collaborative Filtering that makes use of the wisdom of all the users, or Content-based Filtering that is based on the user's past interactions and item attributes.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Let's briefly have a look at the methods for generating recommendations and how they work.<br></p><h2>Collaborative Filtering</h2><p>Collaborative filtering (CF) is a method for generating recommendations by calculating preference scores of a user for an item using the historical preference for that item from other similar users in the database. This algorithm takes account of the explicit interaction with the item irrespective of the attributes of the item, so is domain agnostic as long as we have sufficient historical interaction data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>It works with an assumption that if a user <strong>A</strong> likes item <em>X, Y, Z</em>, and user <strong>B</strong> likes product <em>X, Y, J</em> then user A will probably like item J and user B item Z.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Note that these predictions are specific to the user, but makes use of the interactions gathered from many users. This can lead to recommending a diverse set of items that the user might not otherwise have discovered.&nbsp;<br></p><p>This method is mostly used on e-commerce websites. If you have come across recommendations under a section titled "People who liked item X also liked item Y" you have seen Collaborative Filtering in action.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>Content-Based Filtering</h2><p>In contrast to Collaborative Filtering, Content-based filtering (CBF) uses the attributes/features of the items directly to recommend items to a user. This is done by creating a "user profile" of the preferences of the user for each of these item attributes and then calculating other items most similar to the user's profile. This is done by representing a profile vector of the user in the same dimensions as the item attribute vector and calculating the weights based on users’ historical interaction with the items.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Note that the recommendations are specific to this user, as the model did not use any information from other users. Thus, this type of recommendation does not provide a diverse range of choices as they are only based on items a user has previously interacted with.&nbsp;</p><div><p>This type of recommendation focuses on personal choice or content and is very useful in Job Recommendations as the choice of the job for the user needs to take into account to have a perfect matching job.</p></div><h2>Hybrid Recommender Systems</h2><p>As useful as these methods are they do have some limitations that we need to be aware of. For example, both CF and CBF do not work for new users for whom we don't have any historical interactions or have very few of them. They also don’t make use of other information we might have about the user like their demographic, location etc.<br></p><p>Ideally, we would like to make use of all the information available in diﬀerent data sources and also combine the algorithmic strengths of various recommender systems to make more robust recommendations. Hybrid recommender systems are used for these purposes, and we explore them more through the rest of this blog.<br></p><p>Most recommender systems these days use a hybrid approach by combining CF and CBF approaches. However, there is no reason why several other techniques cannot be hybridized.&nbsp;</p><p>Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways:&nbsp;</p><ol role="list"><li>Making content-based and collaborative-based recommendations separately and then combining them.&nbsp;</li><li>Adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa).</li><li>Unifying the approaches into one model.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Several studies that empirically compare the performance of hybrid recommenders with pure CF and CBF methods have shown that hybrid methods can provide more accurate recommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as the cold start and the sparsity problem.</p><p>Netflix is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems. The website makes recommendations by comparing the view and search habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).</p><p>‍</p><h2>Content Boosted Collaborative Filtering for recommender systems</h2><p>Given the many ways recommenders can be combined, there are many variations of hybrid recommenders in use. In this blog we will focus on one of the earliest and most successful hybrid recommender algorithms called <strong>Content boosted Collaborative Filtering</strong> (CBCF) algorithm.<br></p><p>CBCF is a type of hybrid recommendation technique that uses a combination of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. Its main idea is to overcome the sparsity problem that degrades the performance of collaborative filtering algorithms by using item content to make the user-item interaction matrix dense.<br></p><p>Its benefits over the pure CF and CBF methods are:</p><ol role="list"><li>Reduces user-item data sparsity</li><li>Handles <strong>cold-start problems</strong> when users have no or very few interactions.</li><li>Handles <strong>first rater problem</strong> for new items who have not been rated or interacted with by any users.&nbsp;<br></li></ol><h2>How does content boosted collaborative filtering work?</h2><p>As we mentioned the basic idea behind CBCF is to use content-based filtering to convert a sparse user interaction matrix to a dense matrix, and then use CF to make the recommendations.&nbsp;</p><p>This is shown in Figure 1.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577b91af0b55804e61cec_61SMAsWQOTUzrv77PH-A5Voc8xzh1zEn28bIgaSt3jQUZwnQjxJ21NNPN2mduVdi7e_mjKryaLOwdQFmVMqrirhenUgFu-AxaRDuOtCfEi4ajWFEaTcAhEfG_ZnE025Uo2de3qk.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Fig 1. Basic mechanism of of converting sparse matrix to dense</figcaption></figure><p>The overall architecture of the recommendation system is shown in Figure 2.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577ba90654535d9f5beb2_1ShNtwf2KCq2yeFqoxvxiXOLaS9PphLCMJa0E7NXDlCRgsIiHmGQBslVvtSVH-g56m0Ty3USspQFE1-uSyiOONy6cl_DMZuZliADv-97_aUqnI_OvIzqWRXK-mZRpJP0z37jJc8.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>&nbsp;Fig 2. Architecture of CBCF based recommender system&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><div><p>This architecture tries to predict the preference for items not yet interacted by the user based on the similar items rated by the user. For this, it groups the most similar interacted items based on the content and then gives weights to each of these neighboring items based on user preferences. The average of these weighted content feature vectors is then used to calculate the predicted preference for the item. This way we will have a predicted score for each item for a user, which becomes the new user-item dense matrix.&nbsp;</p></div><h2>Variation using Deep Learning Prediction Model for better recommendation</h2><p>With the advent of modern deep learning techniques, several variations of the content-based model have been developed. These methods create an item profile (feature vector) that are especially useful for text based features that are prevalent like item reviews, description etc.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577ba2ba25e595d015e23_pJgAoZtYFVWa_F0xBnr7__Qku6CdsmMxdV6D-clAH_ObVvlTvMU-wCRyicVumj61SxiP0-esr28yxbvaDGLvuAEEWG7FlC4A48-vNpZNZ-ett7zyaWPHM6gTlX0cOddXzl_78F4.jpeg" alt=""></p><figcaption>	Fig 3. Variation using Deep Learning based Item Profiles</figcaption></figure><p>In this method, the item profiles are created using feature engineering techniques as before, but not grouped into clusters. The user profile is created based on the historical item interaction. Those two profiles are then combined into a single feature and the deep learning model is trained. After the model is created, the feature is created by combining the item profile not interacted by the user with the user profile, hence a prediction is generated which is used to make the sparse matrix dense.</p><p>‍<br></p><h2>Evaluation and Result<br></h2><p>In order to test the algorithm we used the <a href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/">MovieLens 20M Dataset</a> that is widely used for recommender system testing and benchmarking..&nbsp;<br></p><p>The results we got can be seen below.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Pure CF method based on SVD Matrix Factorization</strong><br></p><p>The default sparsity of the user-item matrix was <strong>99.28%</strong>, and the average RMSE error tends to be around 1.0682 with minimum standard deviation.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577bac716622a7dacc942_IF0tXRDyIDjRnbsYn9Rc300V1lHQL41S3SV2chFmBFguNOfZrNwV45wGJGrG9yOd-6xxFvX0Qo1A2zwxvO_sQ2T_VOrECCcVUZXsIcybfSCBIUha6O59hgG2KSpj6De_wmZ5un0.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>Hybrid Recommender using&nbsp; CBCF</strong><br></p><p>After applying the CBCF algorithm using a content-based filter, the sparsity 0 as all uninterested item preferences are replaced by the predicted value. The average RMSE tends to be around 0.1099.&nbsp;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ef484d478bae23cf2704aef/5f1577ba78093ab286304374_XdvIsW4av8HvhnXwsR3Clo_4WaEPgJN4Au2JFZLA1jeUsoBKiIeTvcIvbkDknbHnP9b8kW_M6AEOkhxJR-5OXLX-aqmolqZvRqITmQtBYeM_ILPUr74IsEyva0FuqjhHVS2NxwU.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>As we can see both the RMSE and MAE values have decreased considerably for the CBCF model as compared to the pure CF method.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The time required to fit (train) and test the model does increase considerably using the hybrid method. This is something that needs to be taken into consideration in production use-cases.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In conclusion, we have seen that the type of recommendation engine algorithm needs to be chosen based on the type of dataset we have. Standard Collaborative Filtering methods although very popular and useful do not always work, especially when the data is very sparse.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For user-specific recommendations where the user preferences data is available and a high degree of personalization sought Content-based filtering methods are useful. Collaborative filtering will work better when there is explicit feedback given and data sparsity isn't too high. Hybrid recommendation methods like Content Boosted Collaborative Filtering takes the advantages of both content and collaborative filtering when we have item attributes, and improves the models by removing data sparsity and reducing errors.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]>

July 30, 2020 | https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-haskell-newtypes | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-haskell-newtypes">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-implementing-smart-contract-edsl-in-haskell">previous post</a>, we introduced Lorentz base syntax which allows one to write code in the following manner:</p><pre><code>

<span>distance</span> :: [<span>Integer</span>, <span>Integer</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Natural</span>]
<span>distance</span> = <span>do</span>
  dup; mul
  dip $ <span>do</span> dup; mul
  add; isNat
  <span>if</span> <span>IsSome</span> <span>then</span> nop
  <span>else</span> push [mt|<span>Something</span> went wrong|]; failWith
</code></pre><p>Michelson provides several basic primitives types and ways to group them in products (<code>pair</code>) and sums (<code>or</code>), and we still follow this behaviour.
As noted in a <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/lorentz-complex-objects">spin-off post about Lorentz objects</a>, the opportunity to group types into a sum of products corresponds to Haskell’s datatypes, but one other feature remains unused.</p><p>In this post, we will talk about Haskell <em>newtypes</em> and why they can be a powerful tool in a smart contract eDSL like Lorentz.</p><details>
  <summary>A note about type signature syntax.</summary>
<p>In this article, we are going to write <code>[a, b] :-&gt; [c, d]</code> in signatures, rather than <code>a : b : s :-&gt; c : d : s</code>, for simplicity.
The reader may notice that such methods will not be general enough, but Lorentz has a <code>framed</code> function which makes any given instruction polymorphic over a stack tail, so that is not a big concern.</p>
<p>Also, by Haskell rules, lists of types with less than two elements have to be prefixed with a tick to avoid ambiguity with plain lists.</p>
</details><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p><em>Newtype</em> is a type that is a mere wrapper over another already existing type but may have its custom semantics.
Newtypes are supposed to be free in terms of performance and only affect the type-checking stage, so they allow stricter correctness guarantees to be verified at compile time.</p><p>We have encountered two kinds of real-life examples where newtypes are useful:</p><h3 id="distinguishing-different-entities-with-the-same-representation">Distinguishing different entities with the same representation</h3><p>For instance, it is common for advanced token smart contracts to allow participants to have multiple addresses with money.
The user probably wants to know the balances of those addresses, and eventually, we may need to have three methods for that:</p><pre><code>
<span>getAddressBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]


<span>getParticipantBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]


<span>getOwnerBalance</span>
  :: [<span>Address</span>, <span>Storage</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Mutez</span>]
</code></pre><p>When using these methods in the form they are mentioned, types don’t help us at all.
It is possible to apply <code>getOwnerBalance</code> to an address of a participant by mistake.</p><p>If we manage to make bad code like this impossible to write, that should improve the development experience and correctness of the resulting contracts.</p><h3 id="types-with-invariants">Types with invariants</h3><p>Let’s imagine that business logic assumes you have several flags for each address: whether it is locked by the user, whether the user should be notified by e-mail on balance change, whether the user’s cat is authorized to spend money from this address, &lt;insert your own&gt;.</p><p>A general efficient way to represent such a flag set is by keeping a numeric bitmask.
Following the fail-fast principle, you want to ensure that an invalid bitmask is not produced at any stage across the contract.
And, actually, there might be many places whether the bitmask can become invalid – contract origination, separate flag changes (in case some flags can contradict with others), and changes as a whole (batch update by user). You would like to make sure that no validity check is missing in any of these places.</p><p>In general Haskell code, such problems are often solved by declaring a newtype with explicitly stated invariants and providing constructors/modifiers which treat those invariants.</p><h2 id="our-approach">Our approach</h2><p>In Lorentz, we declare newtypes as follows:</p><pre><code><span><span>newtype</span> <span>MyType</span> = <span>MyType</span> <span>Integer</span></span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span><span>newtype</span> <span>IsoValue</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Let us remind that <code>IsoValue</code> describes how Lorentz types are translated into Michelson, and the <code>deriving newtype</code> clause is Haskell’s syntax that says that behaviour of <code>IsoValue</code> should be inherited from the inner type, <code>Integer</code> in our case.</p><p>Now one can write:</p><pre><code><span>putDefaultMyType</span> :: '[] :-&gt; '[<span>MyType</span>]
<span>putDefaultMyType</span> = push (<span>MyType</span> <span>0</span>)
</code></pre><p>That was simple.</p><p>The main benefit we get is that <code>MyType</code> is treated as a type completely different from <code>Integer</code> or any other newtype wrapper over <code>Integer</code>, so misapplying a function to a wrong argument would raise a compilation error.</p><p>Now we would like to have dedicated methods for converting between newtype and its inner representation.
Lorentz already defines <code>forcedCoerce_</code> method that converts between any two types having the same Michelson representation, but it is pretty broad and requires special care from the developer to be used correctly: a typo or a wrong mental model is pretty likely to cause a bug, so this method should be avoided in business logic layer.</p><p>We would like to allow users to be specific in their intentions via methods specialized to newtype wrapping/unwrapping. For this reason, we define the following methods:</p><pre><code><span>coerceWrap</span> :: <span>Wrappable</span> a =&gt; '[<span>Unwrappable</span> a] :-&gt; '[a]
<span>coerceWrap</span> = forcedCoerce_

<span>coerceUnwrap</span> :: <span>Wrappable</span> a =&gt; '[a] :-&gt; '[<span>Unwrappable</span> a]
<span>coerceUnwrap</span> = forcedCoerce_
</code></pre><details>
  <summary>One more note about type signatures.</summary>
<p>Being part of the library, these two methods are of course defined in a <a href="https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/blob/99fbc99defdedd02568f59cc692c0f021cc9209e/code/lorentz/src/Lorentz/Coercions.hs#L90">more generic way</a></p>
</details><p>Note the <code>Wrappable a</code>: when our newtype does not have any invariants and can be wrapped and unwrapped safely, we declare it to have a <a href="https://gitlab.com/morley-framework/morley/-/blob/0574c85b78214129b5673b0f8e09b0761711522f/code/lorentz/src/Lorentz/Wrappable.hs#L20"><code>Wrappable</code></a> instance.
It looks like this:</p><pre><code><span><span>newtype</span> <span>Participant</span> = <span>Participant</span> <span>Address</span></span>
  <span>deriving</span> stock (<span>Generic</span>)
  <span>deriving</span> anyclass (<span>IsoValue</span>, <span>Wrappable</span>)

<span>authenticate</span> :: '[<span>Participant</span>] :-&gt; '[]
<span>authenticate</span> = <span>do</span>
  coerceUnwrap  
  sender        
  assertEq [mt|<span>Method</span> executed not by the expected participant|]
</code></pre><p>We deem <code>coerceWrap</code> to be always safe: if a given newtype has invariants, it should not instantiate <code>Wrappable</code> typeclass in favor of another way we will consider a bit later.</p><h3 id="newtypes-with-invariants">Newtypes with invariants</h3><p>Now let us consider the previously mentioned example with bitmasks.
As before, we declare a dedicated newtype:</p><pre><code>

<span><span>newtype</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> { <span>unFlags</span> :: <span>Natural</span> }</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span><span>newtype</span> <span>IsoValue</span></span>
</code></pre><p>And there were three use cases for it which we wanted to support.
The first one is constructing a Haskell value that can later be provided in contract origination.
This can be done safely in various ways using built-in Haskell features and is up to the developer.</p><details>
  <summary>We would implement it as follows.</summary>
<pre><code>
<span>flag1</span>, flag2, flag3 :: <span>Flags</span>
<span>flag1</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>1</span>
<span>flag2</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>2</span>
<span>flag3</span> = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>4</span>


<span><span>instance</span> <span>Semigroup</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  a &lt;&gt; b = <span>Flags</span> (unFlags a .|. unFlags b)


<span><span>instance</span> <span>Monoid</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  mempty = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>0</span>



<span>
<span>instance</span> <span>Bounded</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  minBound = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>0</span>
  maxBound = <span>FlagsUnsafe</span> <span>7</span>


<span>myCustomFlags</span> :: <span>Flags</span>
<span>myCustomFlags</span> = mconcat [flag1, flag2]




</code></pre>
</details><p>Next, we need to make sure that contract code never produces an invalid value when operating with <code>Flags</code>.
Michelson has many polymorphic operations (<code>ADD</code>, <code>NOT</code>, <code>OR</code>), and it so happened that in Lorentz, one has to explicitly declare which of these operations are permitted for the introduced types.
In our case, this is actually handy: if we allow only logical operations on our <code>Flags</code> type, then its invariants will never get violated during contract execution.</p><pre><code>
<span><span>instance</span> <span>ArithOp</span> <span>And</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  <span><span>type</span> <span>ArithRes</span> <span>And</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>Flags</span></span>


<span><span>instance</span> <span>ArithOp</span> <span>Or</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>where</span></span>
  <span><span>type</span> <span>ArithRes</span> <span>Or</span> <span>Flags</span> <span>Flags</span> = <span>Flags</span></span>



</code></pre><p>In case some flags can contradict  each other, we would rather define a special function that adds flags with care:</p><pre><code>
<span>addFlag1</span> :: '[<span>Flags</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>addFlag1</span> = <span>do</span>
  ... 
  push flag1
  uniteFlagsUnsafe

<span>uniteFlagsUnsafe</span> :: [<span>Flags</span>, <span>Flags</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>uniteFlagsUnsafe</span> = <span>do</span>
  forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>; dip (forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>);
  or
  forcedCoerce_
</code></pre><p>Using this set of coercions may seem to make the contract less efficient, but because of the optimizer (which any eDSL should have for various reasons), these <code>forcedCoerce_</code> calls will not appear in the resulting Michelson code.</p><p>Finally, the last case is accepting a user-provided value.
This can be useful when the user wants to overwrite the existing value of a flag, and we need to make sure that his input is indeed valid.
Here, newtype helps us draw a line between checked data we can work with or store (<code>Flags</code>) and yet unchecked data we accept as input (let it be just <code>Natural</code> for simplicity).</p><pre><code>
<span>toFlagsUnsafe</span> :: '[<span>Natural</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>toFlagsUnsafe</span> = forcedCoerce_


<span>toFlags</span> :: '[<span>Natural</span>] :-&gt; '[<span>Flags</span>]
<span>toFlags</span> = <span>do</span>
  dup
  push (maxBound @<span>Flags</span>); forcedCoerce_ @<span>Natural</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>IsLe</span>
  <span>then</span> <span>do</span> push [mt|<span>Invalid</span> flags value|]; pair; failWith @(<span>MText</span>, <span>Natural</span>)
  <span>else</span> toFlagsUnsafe
</code></pre><p>The bottom line: in Lorentz, one can use newtypes in a very similar way to how it usually happens in general Haskell code.
Some wrap/unwrap boilerplate in the form of <code>forcedCoerce_</code> calls will still be involved, but now the type system will assist you in ensuring that all the data is used correctly.</p><h2 id="common-questions">Common questions</h2><h3 id="do-i-need-types-if-i-can-write-tests%3F">Do I need types if I can write tests?</h3><p>While types are not meant to fully replace tests, a single newtype wrapper can eliminate the need for an entire category of tests just because buggy code cannot be written using safe primitives anymore.
Furthermore, the type system hints the developer if some check is missing.
This is an especially useful property for library writers, as their users also get a piece of that safety automatically.</p><p>Also (this point is often not taken into account) tests may form quite a large codebase that also has to be maintained, so you would like to avoid writing repetitive tests for trivial failure cases where possible.</p><p>For more details, I recommend Ken Fox’s <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2014/12/09/typed-language-tdd-part1/">article</a> explaining why it is beneficial to have both types and tests.</p><h3 id="what-about-formal-verification%3F">What about formal verification?</h3><p>Unlike the described newtypes approach, formal verification allows you to express arbitrary properties of your data and thus has a significantly broader scope.</p><p>However, in practice its use is pretty complicated:</p><ol>
<li>You may need to know a special proof assistant language like Coq to verify your programs;</li>
<li>You have to write proofs yourself.</li>
</ol><p>This way, formal verification may often be infeasible for large contracts.</p><p>On the other hand, newtypes feature lets you put a constraint only on one piece of data at a time, so, for instance, <code>amount &gt; 0 || storage.x &gt; 0</code> …</p></div></div>

<h3 id="short-intro-to-schema-types-in-asyncapi">Short Intro to Schema Types in AsyncAPI<a href="#short-intro-to-schema-types-in-asyncapi" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>There are many different schema formats that one might use to describe the message payload. Not everyone uses JSON Schema. There are multiple formats out there, like RAML 1.0 Data Types, Avro, or even OpenAPI 3.0. When you write your AsyncAPI file, you should not manually convert schemas that you already store somewhere in a format different from AsyncAPI Schema. The best practice is to reuse existing schemas by referring to them in your AsyncAPI file and making sure that the Message object has information about the schema format within the schemaFormat parameter.</p>

<p>AsyncAPI <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0/#messageObjectSchemaFormatTable" target="_blank">lists schema types</a> that are a MUST but is not limited to this list only. RAML Data Types is not a MUST HAVE, yet we already have a custom parser for it.</p>

<p>From the AsyncAPI tooling perspective, we have a <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/" target="_blank">basic JavaScript Parser</a> capable of parsing schema of the payload provided with AsyncAPI schema format or JSON schema format. Other schema parsers are plugins that you can register with a parser, like <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/openapi-schema-parser" target="_blank">OpenAPI 3.0</a> or <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/raml-dt-schema-parser" target="_blank">RAML 1.0 Data Types</a>. You could provide such plugins as well for your custom formats.</p>

<h3 id="avro-parser">Avro Parser<a href="#avro-parser" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>The 3rd plugin that we now officially support is related to Avro schema type. The first minor version is already out there, and you can give it a try, even if your schemas are in the Confluent Schema Registry. Have a look at the docs of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/avro-schema-parser" target="_blank">the Avro schema parser</a>. The Avro parser is also part of the latest release candidate of <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/" target="_blank">the Generator</a>. Please help us make it work for you.</p>

<h2 id="circular-references-in-asyncapi">Circular References in AsyncAPI<a href="#circular-references-in-asyncapi" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Now JavaScript Parser can handle circular references that you might have in your AsyncAPI files. The current implementation fully dereferences circular references, and you cannot change this behavior. We also extended the API to help you out to deal with circular references:</p>

<ul>
<li>The core AsyncAPI model now contains the hasCircular() function that you can use to determine at the very beginning if a given AsyncAPI document contains some circular references or not. An example use case for it is to throw a proper error message to the user with a clear message that circular references are not supported by your tool at the moment,</li>
<li>The Schema model contains isCircular() function to check if a given schema is circular, so you do not have to detect it on your own and adequately react</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/pull/94/files" target="_blank">this</a> pull request for implementation details. The work is still in progress as nice features in the Parser do not mean now all the Generator’s templates will support it. Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/issues/83#issuecomment-659958312" target="_blank">this</a> comment if you need more details.</p>

<h2 id="typescript-support-in-parser">TypeScript Support in Parser<a href="#typescript-support-in-parser" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>Since Parser 0.27 we will now always generate <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-js/blob/master/types.d.ts" target="_blank">TypeScript types</a> to make it much easier for TypeScript developers to use Parser in their tools.</p>

<h2 id="generator-release-candidate-7-is-out">Generator Release Candidate 7 is out<a href="#generator-release-candidate-7-is-out" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>We just released another release candidate that contains a lot of improvements that we added to the Parser. It also includes the above mentioned <code>avro-schema-parser</code> so it is easier for you to test it out. Give it a try.</p>

<h3 id="publish-vs-subscribe-discussion-continues">Publish vs Subscribe Discussion Continues<a href="#publish-vs-subscribe-discussion-continues" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>We noticed that people that interact with AsyncAPI for the first time are confused about the meaning of those two words, publish and subscribe. Without going much into detail and oversimplifying things, we can say that this is the part of the community that considers using AsyncAPI to describe their internal broker-centric architecture. In such cases, you want to describe the application’s behavior and not what others can do with it. You want to use the Publish verb to specify that your application publishes to a given channel. What if your application is exposed to the outside world where others can interact with it? You want Publish to mean something different, like it is now, that it means your application is subscribed to a given channel, so that you can publish to it, and the application will receive a message.</p>

<p>Event-driven architectures are complex beasts with many patterns, and we should try to make AsyncAPI a single home for all of them. Please engage in this discussion, share your thoughts, and help us out to find the best solution:</p>

  <p>For HA and easier management of our containers we can create swarm cluster.<br>
It is composed of couple nodes with docker engine installed.</p>
<p>How to setup swarm and use it?</p>

<td>docker-host1.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.20</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Worker2</td>
<td>docker-host3.lukas.int</td>
<td>10.10.10.22</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p>Each node has got docker engine installed with standard procedure as for single node docker.</p>
<p>Ports that are need to be open on each node:</p>

    <div>

<div>

<div>
<p>We are taking a practical approach in the following sections. As such, we need the right tools and environments available in order to keep up with the examples and exercises. We will be using <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> along with packages that will form our scientific stack, such as <code>ndarray</code> (for multi-dimensional containers) and <code>plotly</code> (for interactive graphing), etc. We will write all of our code within a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, but you are free to use other IDEs.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Miniconda">Install Miniconda<a href="#Install-Miniconda">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There are many different ways to get up and running with an environment that will facilitate our work. One approach I can recommend is to install and use Miniconda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others.</p>
<p>— <cite>https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can skip Miniconda entirely if you prefer and install Jupyter Lab directly, however, I prefer using it to manage other environments too.</p>
<p>You can find installation instructions for Miniconda on <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">their website</a>, but if you're using Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) you can execute the following commands from in your terminal:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh</pre></div>
<p>This will download the installation files and start the interactive installation process. Follow the process to the end, where you should see the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for installing Miniconda3!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All that's left is to close and re-open the terminal window.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Create-Your-Environment">Create Your Environment<a href="#Create-Your-Environment">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Once Miniconda is installed, we need to create and configure our environment. If you added Miniconda to your PATH environment during the installation process, then you can run these commands directly from Terminal, Powershell, or CMD.</p>
<p>Now we can create and configure our conda environment using the following commands.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda create -n darn <span>python</span><span>=</span><span>3</span></pre></div>
<p>You can replace <code>darn</code> (<strong>D</strong>ata <strong>An</strong>alytics with <strong>R</strong>ust <strong>N</strong>otebooks) with a name of your choosing.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>This will create a conda environment named <code>darn</code> with the latest Python 3 package ready to go. You should be presented with a list of packages that will be installed and asked if you wish to proceed. To do so, just enter the character <code>y</code>. If this operation is successful, you should see the following output at the end:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>Preparing transaction: <span>done</span>
Verifying transaction: <span>done</span>
Executing transaction: <span>done</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># To activate this environment, use</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#     $ conda activate darn</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># To deactivate an active environment, use</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#     $ conda deactivate</span></pre></div>
<p>As the message suggests, you will need to type the following command to activate and start entering commands within our environment named <code>darn</code>.</p>

<p>Once you do that, you should see your terminal prompt now leads with the environment name within parentheses:</p>

<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The example above shows the macOS machine name "melica" and the user "shahin". You will see something different on your machine, and it may appear in a different format on a different operating system such as Windows. As long as the prompt leads with "(darn)", you are on the right track.</p>
</div>
<p>This will allow you to identify which environment you are currently operating in. If you restart your machine, you should be able to use <code>conda activate darn</code> within your conda prompt to get back into the same environment.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Packages">Install Packages<a href="#Install-Packages">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>If your environment was already configured and ready, you would be able to enter the command <code>jupyter lab</code> to launch an instance of the Jupyter Lab IDE in the current directory. However, if we try that in our newly created environment, we will receive an error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span>darn<span>)</span> melica:~ shahin$ jupyter lab
-bash: jupyter: <span>command</span> not found</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>So let's fix that. Let's install Jupyter Lab and use the <code>-y</code> option which automatically says "yes" to any questions asked during the installation process.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c conda-forge <span>jupyterlab</span><span>=</span><span>1</span>.1.4 -y</pre></div>
<p>We'll also need <code>cmake</code> later on.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c anaconda cmake -y</pre></div>
<p>Finally, let's install nodejs. This is needed to run our Jupyter Lab extension in the next section.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>conda install -c conda-forge nodejs -y</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Jupyer-Lab-Extensions">Install Jupyer Lab Extensions<a href="#Install-Jupyer-Lab-Extensions">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>There's one last thing we need to do before we move on, and that's installing any Jupyter Lab extensions that we may need. One particular extension that we need is the plotly extension, which will allow our Jupyter Notebooks to render our Plotly visualisations. Within your conda environment, simply run the following command:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/plotly-extension</pre></div>
<p>This may take some time, especially when it builds your jupyterlab assets, so keep an eye on it until you're returned control over the conda prompt, i.e. when you see the following:</p>

<p>Optionally, you may wish to install the purple looking theme from Figure 1 above.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>jupyter labextension install @shahinrostami/theme-purple-please</pre></div>
<p>Now we're good to go!</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Install-Rust">Install Rust<a href="#Install-Rust">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>Now we'll install Rust using rustup, but you can check out the <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html">other installation methods</a> if you need them.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>curl --proto <span>'=https'</span> --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs <span>|</span> sh</pre></div>
<p>You will be given instructions for adding Cargo's bin directory to your PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>This will work until your close your terminal, so make sure to add it to your shell profile. I use Z shell (Zsh) so this meant adding the following to <code>.zshrc</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>export</span> <span>PATH</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$HOME</span><span>/.cargo/bin:</span><span>$PATH</span><span>"</span></pre></div>
<p>You can make sure everything works by closing and re-opening your terminal and typing <code>cargo</code>. If this returns the usage documentation then you're all set.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Don't forget to activate your environment when opening the terminal.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div>

<div>
<div>
<p>Let's test if everything is working as it should be. In your conda prompt, within your conda environment, run the following command</p>

<p>This should start the Jupyter Lab server and launch a browser window with the IDE ready to use.</p>

<p><img src="https://shahinrostami.com/images/rust-notebooks/fresh_jupyter.png" alt="Jupyter Lab With Rust">
</p>
<center><p><strong>Figure 2</strong> - A fresh installation of Jupyter Lab.</p></center>
<p>Let's create a new notebook. In the Launcher tab which has opened by default, click "Rust" under the Notebook heading. This will create a new and empty notebook named <code>Untitled.ipynb</code> in the current directory.</p>
<p>If everything is configured as it should be, you should see no errors. Type the following into the first cell and click the "play" button to execute it and create a new cell.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>In&nbsp;[2]:</p>
<div>
    <div>
<div><pre><span></span><span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello World!"</span><span>);</span><span></span></pre></div>

    </div>
</div>
</div>



</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>If we followed all the instructions and didn't encounter any errors, everything should be working. We should see "Hello World!" in the output cell.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<div>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#Conclusion">¶</a>
</h2>
<p>In this section, we've downloaded, installed, configured, and tested our environment such that we're ready to run the following examples and experiments. If you ever find that you're missing Jupyter Lab packages, you can install them in the same way as we installed Jupyter Lab and the others in this section.</p>

			<p>“Blank canvas syndrome” is a paralysis you face as a creative when you’re starting a new project. If you’ve ever found yourself staring hopelessly at a blank computer screen at a loss for where to begin then you know how debilitating blank canvas syndrome can be. Fortunately we have a master artisan we can model who taught us through his 30-season TV show how to beat this paralysis. </p>
<p><img src="https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="437" srcset="https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome.jpg 800w, https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome-300x164.jpg 300w, https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome-768x420.jpg 768w, https://s34027.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bob-ross-blank-canvas-syndrome-610x333.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p>
<h2>What would Bob do?</h2>
<p>I grew up watching a TV show called “<a href="https://www.bobross.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross</a>.” Day after mesmerizing day this soft-spoken dude with the huge afro would convert a blank canvas into a work of art over the course of a 30min show. It was hypnotizing to watch him repeatedly actuate his vision out of nothing and step you through his thought process the whole way with his signature gentle, supportive style.</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to do my best to channel Bob Ross and spell out the advice I believe he would give us if he were alive today coaching us on how to build an application from scratch via nocode. The key, as with most layered creative challenges, is to peel it back one layer at a time and use reverse goal planning to start with the end in mind and work in layers moving from your big daunting idea to a fully-functional app. So let’s begin, friend.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Crystalize your vision with an aspirational press release</h2>
<p>Mental gridlock can originate from a handful of causes but almost always traces back to an ill-defined vision. One of the best exercises for getting crystal clarity on your vision up front is a technique I synthesized from two sources: an Innovation Game called “<a href="https://www.innovationgames.com/remember-the-future/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Remember the Future</a>” and how Amazon does its product development via its “<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management/answer/Ian-McAllister" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working backwards</a>” methodology.</p>
<p>The gist of the technique is to imagine forward to some future point in time at which you’ve released your shiny new application and are publishing a celebratory press release that touts the benefits to your user. The process of writing that future press release accomplishes a few things, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>It gets you thinking in terms of users and benefits and how to message the value proposition to your target audience. If you struggle with this exercise will reveal exactly where the holes are currently in your understanding of the landscape, market, product, etc.</li>
<li>It yields an artifact that will be useful to you later as a north star by which you can make product decisions and ensure a team is all operating on the same page. It’s essentially a roll-up of a bunch of user stories into a concise high-level document which consequently….</li>
<li>Allows you to deconstruct this vision in the next step to yield your constituent user stories.</li>
</ol>
<p>In terms of the mechanism of <em>how</em> this works, the theory is that by projecting forward and remembering hypothetically backwards of what must have occurred up to that point to make the product possible you use different set of neural circuitry vs. trying to speculate forward from today. I admittedly don’t understand the psychological mechanism behind <em>why</em> this subtly different approach actually works but I can vouch anecdotally that it <em>does</em> work.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Ross Equivalent Advice (BREA)</strong>: <a href="https://youtu.be/1s58rW0_LN4?t=56" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prep the canvas</a> and get clear on your idea. </p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: <em>Write your aspirational press release for your proposed application. Bonus if you post it somewhere publicly and use it as a commitment instrument. If you need inspiration read the linked Quora article above. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rkXhFeQpNyEF8_XRwad0nRgLcTUVroQWGCtwikWUAJc/edit?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Here is mine</a> for v2 of the Charity Makeover platform.</em></p>
<h2>Step 2: Capture conceptual requirements of the MVP via User Stories</h2>
<p>The next step once you have your aspirational press release is to deconstruct that document into user stories that capture the essential requirements of your minimum viable product (MVP).</p>
<p>User stories allow you to express functional requirements while remaining at a conceptual level (ie. not worrying about user experience – UX) and thinking in terms of stakeholders, goals and acceptance criteria. If you’re new to user stories I highly recommend <a href="https://www.udemy.com/share/101y2AAEsTeFxTQn4=/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this half-day course on Udemy</a> for getting up to speed on how to use them effectively.</p>
<p>A way to get started here if you’re struggling is to take each of the main benefits you wrote about in your aspirational press release and think about the discreet blocks of functionality that would need to exist for each in order to enable it. You want to restrict your initial user stories to the bare minimum set of functionality necessary to deliver your MVP. Resist the temptation to go overboard in documenting every conceivable function your app might need to perform and keep it constrained to only those stories which directly support the benefits you enumerated in your press release. </p>
<p>You can use any tool to capture these. I’m a fan of Trello as it’s a free tool and allows you to put the user story in the title of each Trello card, any supporting explanation in the description and your acceptance criteria as a checklist on the card. I use a simple 4-column layout of: backlog, MVP, in progress, and completed.</p>
<p>Further explanation of user stories is beyond the scope of this post. The Udemy course referenced above is a fantastic resource for quickly learning the 80/20 essence of how to craft effective user stories.</p>
<p><strong>BREA:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/1s58rW0_LN4?t=233" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Layer in the background</a> and add some fluffy clouds. </p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: <em>Create a <a href="https://trello.com/seantierney3/recommend" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">free Trello account</a> and load it up with the user stories that represent the bare minimum functionality of your MVP. Go to sleep and review it the next day. Does it capture all the key functionality? If not add new stories until you cover all the major bases. Is there anything that’s overkill feature-wise for the MVP? If so, move those story cards to the backlog column. Here are <a href="https://trello.com/b/5JwvBfEw/cm-honey" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my user stories</a> for the v2 Charity Makeover build.</em></p>
<h2>Step 3: Create a low-fidelity wireframe</h2>
<p>Once you have your user stories you’re ready to move from the purely conceptual expression of the app into a rough visual sketch of the user experience (UX). The key here is to stay decidedly low-fidelity and not get derailed committing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">precision error</a> by moving too prematurely to a hi-fi prototype. This is the intermediary step that is most tempting to skip in favor of jumping directly to building the clickable hi-fi mockup. But that’s a mistake that will lead to unnecessary angst. </p>
<p>There are a number of applications like <a href="https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Balsamiq Mockups</a> for doing this part on the computer but I’ve found what works best is to ditch tech, stand in front of a white board and just start sketching screens.</p>
<p>Draw empty containers that mimic the proportions of the target screen resolution of your app (if you’re doing a mobile app, divide the whiteboard into a set of 8 or so rectangles that are roughly the same proportions of a mobile phone screen). Next you’ll work through each of the user stories in your Trello board and sketch out the screens necessary to deliver the functionality that fulfills the acceptance criteria of that story. You’ll find inevitably that some user stories share common screens. The goal is to get complete coverage so that you wind up with the full set of screens that facilitate all stories.</p>
<p>When your finished you’ll have a set of screens that constitute v1 of your application. Woohoo! That should feel good. You’re looking at the bare minimum set of UX you will need to create in order to deliver your app.</p>
<p><strong>BREA</strong>: Complete <a href="https://youtu.be/1s58rW0_LN4?t=426" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">all the major background scene elements</a> with your majestic mountains. </p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: <em>Sketch out the low-fi wireframe for your application. If you don’t have a whiteboard, do this on a piece of paper (I find a whiteboard for whatever reason yields better flow than sketching on paper for this stage). Don’t erase anything. If you don’t have enough white board real estate to capture it all, move to the next step before you erase any screens. Here are my <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16UHauHFmRsJx2fiEL_W3naG3C6C08EaY?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sketches for the v2 Charity Makeover build</a>.</em></p>
<h2>Step 4: Make a clickable mockup from your wireframe and get user feedback</h2>
<p>Hold onto your butt. We’re going to make a quantum leap with a few minutes of work by converting your static whiteboard sketches into an interactive, clickable prototype of your application that you can share online and use to solicit user feedback. And yes, I’m serious this will take you less time than it takes Bob to paint a happy little tree.</p>
<p>Here’s what you do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Signup for <a href="https://marvelapp.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marvel App</a> and download their iOS or Android mobile app.</li>
<li>Take photos of each panel representing a screen of your application. Frame the photo so the edges are perfectly aligned with the container of the screen.</li>
<li>Follow the prompts in the application to create a new app and add the photos you just took as the screens ol your application.</li>
<li>Draw hotspots on each interactive element (buttons, lists, anything clickable) and link it to the target screen.</li>
<li>Publish the app and copy the link.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should now have a link that you can share like <a href="https://marvelapp.com/6694ea4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this one</a> that yields a clickable low-fi prototype you can share with anyone. Testers can leave feedback inline while using the application with the comment feature and give you context-specific input about the UX for each screen.</p>
<p><strong>BREA</strong>: Layer in <a href="https://youtu.be/1s58rW0_LN4?t=1040" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the midground elements</a> and add some happy little trees. </p>
<p><strong>Homework</strong>: <em>Use the free Marvel App to convert your whiteboard sketches into a clickable prototype and solicit feedback from at least five prospective users of the application. Now go through each user story Trello card. Can you check off the acceptance criteria in each? Are there any holes where the current prototype fails test coverage? Do not advance to the next step until you have input from at least five people who would be your prospective users and until you can in good conscience check off every single acceptance criteria item. This is the time to validate whether you’re truly building the right thing. It’s easiest to make changes before you move further so take advantage of this time to get the functionality right.</em></p>
<h2>Step 5: Make a high-fidelity clickable mockup</h2>
<p>Ok so you’ve validated that there is A) demand for what you’re building B) it’s got the right set of essential functionality and C) the UX …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>and why you should start scraping the web now</p><figure><img src="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/07/11-usages-for-web-scraping-banner.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/11-usages-for-web-scraping-banner.jpg 600w, https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/07/11-usages-for-web-scraping-banner.jpg 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Many people ask themselves the question, how do I improve in the areas covered below. In a lot of the cases it's important to know that web scraping plays a major role in it and that it's actually rather easy to get started.</p><p>With web scraping you can extract data from any website and as some may say "Data is the new gold". There is so much important data to be gathered from websites that you can make great business decisions on.</p><p>Below are our 11 usages for web scraping and why you should start scraping now.</p><h2 id="build-your-new-product">Build your new product</h2><p>No Code tools are on a rise. They allow you to create certain flows, analyze data, create stunning websites and more without any knowledge of coding. You don't have to be a technical founder anymore to start a business. But what many people don't know about web scraping is that you can leverage it to use that data as input to your new application. For example, you want to create <a href="https://blog.scraper.ai/build-your-first-crypto-app-using-amazon-honeycode/">a mobile application that shows the latest cryptocurrency prices</a>? No problem, it only takes an hour.</p><h2 id="seo">SEO</h2><p>Having organic growth is next to direct traffic, the biggest source of traffic coming to your website. Sadly it's also the hardest one to optimize for. It requires a lot of persistence, monitoring and analyzing to get ranked among the top. Even when you're at the top you still have to optimize for click throughs on your links. Tough business! Luckily this is where web scraping is very powerful. It can help to decrease your workload and automate some tasks for you. For example:</p><ul><li>Help you <a href="https://blog.scraper.ai/build-your-first-crypto-app-using-amazon-honeycode/">track the ranking of your website for your specific keywords</a></li><li>Identify and monitor keywords of competitors by getting a daily list</li><li>Analyze the top ranking keywords and alternatives for you</li></ul><p>and a lot more.</p><h2 id="dataset-creation">Dataset creation</h2><p>One of the big tasks of a data scientist, computer vision specialist and others that need data is the creation of a trustworthy and well composed dataset. Web scraping can take any website list and compose it into a usable data stream that you can build on top of. If you have a great tool like <a href="https://scraper.ai/">Scraper.AI</a> you can also <a href="https://blog.scraper.ai/how-to-create-a-hourly-updating-covid-19-dataset-under-5-minutes/">monitor that data</a> and keep your dataset up-to-date in the land of fast changing data.</p><h2 id="competitor-tracking">Competitor tracking</h2><p>Knowing the competition is one of the most valuable techniques there is. It helps you to connect to your audience but also makes you stay on top of your sector. Having a web scraper and being to extract the prices of a webshop of your competitor ensures you that you can be the cheapest out there.</p><p>For beginning startups they can for example monitor new comers in their space and see what approach they're taking. It might mean that they've found product market fit.</p><h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2><p>Where it all starts, the starts with is replaced with a fancy arrow (➜)</p><ul><li>Starting a business ➜ Discovering an idea</li><li>Getting started with SEO ➜ Discovering keywords</li><li>Knowing your competition ➜ Discovering your competitors</li><li>Investing ➜ Discovering what to invest in</li><li>Buying a property ➜ Discovering a property</li><li>Making money on stocks ➜ Discovering what stocks to buy</li><li>...</li></ul><p>This list can go on for a long while, an action almost always starts with the discovery of something. Discovering means that you want to get the data that justifies the decision you're gonna take to get to that action.</p><p>You might want to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6YWbFoaruI">watch stock websites</a> to get to learn about price changes of your favourite stock. </p><p>Web scraping can get these latests stocks, properties, and many more.</p><h2 id="product-monitoring">Product monitoring</h2><p>You're a vendor, dropshipper, amazon seller or anyone that sells a product. A major part will be making sure that you're product fulfills certain demands. You want to watch for reviews, correct pricing, advertising, ... it's a lot of work.</p><p>Scraping reviews ensures that you can sustain you're high rating, act on low ratings and make sure that they get resolved correctly. Watching prices from competitors, analyzing your advertising metrics in one dashboard. They can all be automated with web scraping. In essence you're making your personalized software product.</p><h2 id="marketing-automation">Marketing automation</h2><p>Finding potential influencers becomes a lot easier, you can go to instagram, facebook, quora, ... and get a list of comments or profiles with most views, likes, watches. The only thing you have to do is open up the scraper, select the names and you're ready to go. Most websites don't show emails anymore due to privacy reasons, but you can private message them or use some other tools to get the email for that user.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-26.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-26.png 600w, https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-26.png 1000w, https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-26.png 1600w, https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-26.png 2295w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="lead-generation">Lead generation</h2><p>A great way to get interesting prospects for your business is generating leads. As soon as you have leads you can setup a sales pipeline and get these leads converted to customers. </p><h3 id="getting-the-leads">Getting the leads</h3><p>But getting these leads is not always straightforward. You first need to find your audience. Luckily there are already great tools out there like LinkedIn search, yellow pages, google maps, angellist, producthunt, ... They all have one thing in common. They show you a list of leads. Great! Because this means we can extract the data from that list and convert it to something usable for us, an excel file, csv, ... anything we need to get these leads converted and expand our business. </p><h2 id="investment-optimization">Investment optimization</h2><p>As a Venture Capital firm you might be interested in startups that were backed by others VCs, you can just go to their page, spend an hour or so per day and get that list. Or you can scrape and monitor them. You can extract the data every day and get notified when a new startup gets added.</p><p>By also combining this with dataset creation you can go in the history of a startup and minimize the risk you take in investing in a startup.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.scraper.ai/content/images/2020/07/image-25.png" alt=""></figure><h2 id="finance">Finance</h2><p>Stocks, crypto, personal finances and more are something everyone has touched at least once. But it involves a lot of manual labour.</p><p>Cryptocurrency or stock investors might find themselves looking at listing sites hourly to get the latest prices and volumes. Monitoring these could come in handy and web scrapers can get you this information in no time, leaving you with more time to do the analysis. Some services also offer direct API endpoints making it as easy to integrate as possible</p><p>Your personal finances are important, you can scrape them and get notified when a bill comes through, a salary gets deposited and more. Become aware of any event that happens at any time.</p><h2 id="real-estate-monitoring">Real estate monitoring</h2><p>Buying a property can be painful, there are plenty of listing sites, aggregators, agents and more and they all have their own time schedule.

Among the first I say because there are others doing exactly the same! </p><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Web scraping is not new and has proven to be valuable. It can automate time-consuming tasks and leave you with more time in hand to focus on the exact problem you're trying to solve. Being from analyzing data to buying a property.

        <p>If you take a closer look, you'll notice that Ruby's grammar has quite a few edge-case where its syntax is inconsistent or ambiguous:</p>



<h2 id="binary-minus-vs-minus-taken-as-unary-method-argument">Binary Minus vs Minus taken as Unary Method Argument</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; [1,3,4,5].size - 1

# syntax error, unexpected tINTEGER,
# expecting tASSOC
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ambiguous-if-to-parse--unary-or-as-part-of-binary-match-operator">Ambiguous if to Parse <code>~</code> Unary or as Part of Binary Match Operator</h2>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; $_="Eurucamp X"

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>The existing open-source funding models don't work well for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so. Put your email in the box to get future proposals delivered to your inbox. ✌️</em></p></div><div><p><em>Alternatively follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">on Twitter</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://vriad.com/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>.</em></p><h3>Footnotes</h3><blockquote><p>¹ Some examples of financially successful large projects.</p><ul><li>operating systems: Red Hat, Elementary OS</li><li>frameworks: Livewire, Next.js </li><li>CMSs: Ghost, Wordpress</li><li>Full-featured applications: Sentry, Blender, Discourse</li></ul></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>² It's worth noting that currently GitHub Sponsorships actually correspond to a given user or organization, NOT a particular repository or project. </p><p>I think it's important that the sponsorship pools themselves are comprised of projects, <em>not</em> users or organizations. This gets complicated if multiple entities/organizations are listed as the maintainers of a particular project.

Unfortunately they're not intended for open source software specifically and simply don't have enough awareness to really move the needle. For this model to reach it's potential, it needs to be implemented by a visible, trusted, established player.</p><p>Other organizations trying interesting things: <a href="https://snowdrift.coop/">Snowdrift</a> ("crowdmatching"...very cool concept), <a href="https://flossbank.com/">Flossbank</a> (a Tidelift-like model), <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a>.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>⁴ The even holier grail: a zero click sponsorship! An example of this approach is <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser's</a> token-based micropayments system. Brave lets you fund your "wallet" with various cryptocurrencies, which are then distributed to creators proportional to the time you spend on their site.</p><p>It’s a great idea, but surveillance is necessary to gather the requisite information. This is implemented ethically by Brave, but that’s only possible because they control the full browser experience. For this to work across browsers would require an extension with full access to your browsing patterns. So probably a non-starter.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

<p><em>We at Stratiteq love to explore new technologies and see how they can be applied in real life. Here is a story of one of our recent projects.</em></p>
<!--more-->
<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">Inspiration for this project came from&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasas-dragonfly-will-fly-around-titan-looking-for-origins-signs-of-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">NASA’s Dragonfly</span></span></a><span><u><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;mission</span></u></span><span><span lang="EN-GB"> that was announced last year&nbsp;and&nbsp;will be launched 2026 with&nbsp;the&nbsp;goal of exploring Titan, the largest moon of Saturn. Dragonfly will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;drone-like spacecraft, size-wise like&nbsp;the&nbsp;Mars<s>-</s>rover, and it will be&nbsp;the&nbsp;first vehicle ever that is capable to transfer its entire&nbsp;scientific&nbsp;payload from one place to another&nbsp;on&nbsp;Titan’s&nbsp;surface&nbsp;for&nbsp;material analysis. Dragonfly is&nbsp;not&nbsp;the only&nbsp;mission that will&nbsp;use drone technology. The&nbsp;Perseverance rover that will be launched tomorrow (July 30, 2020) will&nbsp;also&nbsp;carry&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">Mars Helicopter</span></span></a><span><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;with it to Mars&nbsp;in order&nbsp;to test this technology for the first time on&nbsp;another world.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">Our project, Dragonfly Mini, is&nbsp;an&nbsp;autonomous vehicle&nbsp;that consist of a rover and a drone.&nbsp;The rover is powered by&nbsp;an&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">NVIDIA Jetson Nano</span></span></a><span><span lang="EN-GB">,&nbsp;a&nbsp;small supercomputer that is capable of processing different AI algorithms.&nbsp;The rover can move autonomously,&nbsp;but it can also be controlled&nbsp;remotely.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is equipped with&nbsp;a camera and&nbsp;mobile phone that is used&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;access&nbsp;point&nbsp;to the Internet.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">Besides&nbsp;being a communication device, we also made full usage of&nbsp;the&nbsp;mobile phone cameras, sensors and&nbsp;its&nbsp;processing power.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB">The rover&nbsp;is capable of controlling&nbsp;camera equipped drone, which&nbsp;gives it better overview of the surrounding area.&nbsp;Collected data is processed with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jetson Nano and data points are uploaded to&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><span lang="EN-GB">Microsoft’s Azure cloud</span></span></a><span><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></span><span><span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>In order to test our rover, we decided to take a trip to Iceland. Besides being able to record in a nice environment, Iceland is over 2000 kilometres away from our home office in Malmö and we consider it to be an impressive enough distance for a test of this project. Tests were done in the southern part of Iceland and we were careful to test it on allowed areas only, since, as you probably know, moss on Iceland is protected and if damaged takes years to grow back. If you are planning a similar experiment, please have that in mind. Feel free to check the video below to see what people who worked on the project said about it.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">There were different challenges in order to&nbsp;execute&nbsp;this project.&nbsp;The first&nbsp;thing we had to figure out is how to move the rover. We equipped&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jetson Nano with a&nbsp;camera,&nbsp;and we trained it&nbsp;for&nbsp;obstacle&nbsp;detection through deep learning.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">Collision avoidance worked well in the office, but in the real world there are unknown obstacles so we decided to use&nbsp;the&nbsp;FCRN (Fully Convolutional Residual Network) model on&nbsp;the&nbsp;iOS phone, which we, as mentioned earlier, added to the rover to be able to have Internet connection.

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">The mobile&nbsp;phone was also used to provide the data from its sensors, so we built an API&nbsp;in Azure cloud where we&nbsp;were&nbsp;sending&nbsp;GPS location, altitude, compass data and other data points.

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB">To be able to control&nbsp;the&nbsp;rover manually we created&nbsp;a&nbsp;dashboard and we added&nbsp;manual controls to it.

We decided to&nbsp;train&nbsp;a&nbsp;custom model that is capable to detect puffins and we tested the model on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jetson Nano with&nbsp;the&nbsp;videos we recorded. We also decided to explore possible usage for search and rescue scenarios, since drones&nbsp;can&nbsp;cover vast areas.</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>It's two days before Jessica will be unable to pay her rent for the first time in her life, and she is standing at the gate of the private charity "Hermandad del Refugio" in downtown Zaragoza. Here in the capital of the Aragon region, between Barcelona and Madrid, the summers are hot and the winters windy. Around 10 a.m. in late May, the sun is already scorching.</p>


<p>There are 18 men and women ahead of Jessica in line, standing silently, their arms folded across their chests. They are all pulling shopping trolleys, into which they'll pack milk cartons, noodles and two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of chicken. Without the free food provided by the Catholic charity, the people in line would have trouble making ends meet.</p>

</figure><p>The coronavirus pandemic brought large parts of the Spanish economy to a standstill. When Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced the lockdown on the evening of March 14, shops, restaurants, concert halls and shops all closed down and from one day to the next, public life and the economy ground to a halt. Within six weeks, 760,000 people had lost their jobs -- on top of the more than 3 million people who had already been unemployed at the beginning of the year. Another 3 million were furloughed.</p>

<div>
<h3>More Hungry People</h3><p>Jessica, too, lost her job, though she didn't actually have to be laid off. Jessica is a singer and In March, she was still working with an orchestra. Technically, she was only ever employed for the day of the performance, but she still earned enough money to survive. A portion of the 900 euros ($1,016) she earned a month was paid out in cash.</p><p>She received notice of her termination via WhatsApp and in mid-May, Jessica went to a food bank for the first time. She'd rather not give her last name. "It makes me sad to stand in line here," she says. The charity in downtown Zaragoza is currently providing 2,271 people with free food, and increase of 504 since before the lockdown.</p>
</div>


<div>
<p>The same thing has been happening all over Spain. In the cities of Madrid and Barcelona, but also in rural areas, Catholic charities have provided 60 percent more aid than in previous years, says Raúl Flores of the Foessa Foundation, which is investigating the social situation for Caritas.</p><p>The lines of hungry people are growing longer and longer and they are the most visible sign of what the country can likely expect in the coming months: the worst economic crisis since the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939. According to worst-case estimates by the Bank of Spain, the economy could shrink by up to 14 percent and unemployment could rise to 21 percent, which would push the country's sovereign debt load to 130 percent of the country's gross domestic product.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>A New Social Law Is Born</h3><p>The coronavirus crisis has accelerated the debate in Spain over the introduction of a basic income, since state-funded social aid does not yet exist. It wasn't until the death of the dictator Franco in 1975 that a welfare state developed here, though it was rather week. Families with children receive hardly any support.</p><p>The introduction of a basic income was therefore the main election promise of the leftist Podemos party and they made the program part of their coalition agreement with the Socialists last fall. Now the Sánchez government is rushing to get the project off the ground to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from plunging into the abyss.</p><p>"It is a historic moment for our democracy," said Podemos leader and Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias, "the birth of a new social law."</p><p>Spain, after all, still hasn't fully recovered from the consequences of the financial and economic crisis of 2008. Even before the outbreak of the virus, the poverty rate hovered around 20 percent and the labor market is divided, with too few people enjoying permanent contracts with unemployment benefits, and too many having to make do with temporary contracts that often only last for a few days. According to statistics from the Spanish employment agency SEPE, 8.4 million people are now looking for a job.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h3>The Only Way to Survive</h3><p>Thus far, only regional governments have allocated aid money -- paltry sums that reached only 75,000 people, or barely a third of all the poor, according to social researcher Flores. Basic income would provide financial security for the most vulnerable 850,000 households.</p><p>But an "ingreso mínimo vital," literally a "minimum income to live," comes with strings attached. The program would only apply to people between the ages of 23 and 65 and they must have been registered as living in Spain for at least one year without interruption. They must also be actively looking for a steady job, be involved in a continuing education program or, in cases of drug dependency, be enrolled in a therapy program. The social welfare office would look into applicants' assets and existing income and that would be topped up to a level of 462 euros per month for singles and up to 1,015 euros per month for a family of five.</p>

<p>For 2.3 million Spaniards, a basic income is likely the only way to get through the corona crisis. Nowhere is this more evident than in Madrid, the city hit the hardest by the pandemic. The capital is one of the richest regions in the country, yet there are plenty of needy people, such as in the tangled side streets from behind the Puerta del Sol to the Plaza de Jacinto Benavente.</p><p>The Ave Maria food bank, run by the city, mostly takes care of the homeless, but since March, geriatric nurses, waitresses and salespeople have also been showing up. All of them have lost their jobs. The crisis first hit those who worked illegally or only had short-term contracts, often foreign workers who had found a precarious job during the recent economic upswing. They were among the first to be laid off.</p><h3>A Real Boost</h3><p>One of them is Mario Ignat. The 30-year-old came to Spain from Romania eight years ago and has been working in construction ever since. But there's no more work to be had. In Madrid alone, 138,000 people have lost their jobs and half a million have been furloughed, a consequence of around 1,000 companies going bankrupt each week during the lockdown.</p><p>Ignat hasn't yet lived in Spain for 10 years, so he doesn't have Spanish citizenship. He earns barely enough to pay rent and there is nothing left over for going out with friends, having a beer in the bar next door or even cooking for himself. The new basic income could significantly improve his life.</p><p>For Mario Ignat and Jessica, a lot depends on when the money will actually be paid out. They can apply for the basic income starting on June 15 and before the end of the month, the first 100,000 eligible applicants will receive aid retroactively going back to June 1. That, at least, is what the government has promised. Jessica hopes that she won't end up on the street before then.</p><p><em>With reporting by Oliver Imhof in Madrid</em></p>

<p>I’m co-admin of a little page on Facebook that caters to a niche audience of AFL statistics nerds known as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uselessaflstats" target="blank">Useless AFL Stats</a>, where (founder and co-admin) Aaron and I discover stats that have no relevance to anything at all, and will never be useful to anyone, ever. And that got me thinking, why should I have all the fun finding these nuggets of gold?</p>
<p>I’m a firm believer in open source programming and data, the idea that as much data should be made publicly available as possible to the largest possible audience. After all, 1000 plus brains are going to be more innovative, better at analysing trends, faster at fact checking (and creating useless AFL stats) than just 2.</p>
<p>That’s why I’ll be taking you on a journey from beginner to expert, to give you the tools to be the master of your own AFL data analysis. Key points will be covered in this first post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup of your coding workspace
<ul>
<li>R installation</li>
<li>Rstudio installation and setup</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Basics of R</li>
<li>Downloading AFL data</li>
<li>Creating your first useless AFL stat</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions during this tutorial, you can tweet at me <a href="https://twitter.com/crow_data_sci" target="blank">@crow_data_sci</a>. If you’ve got a useless stat, feel free to tweet at us <a href="https://twitter.com/UselessStatsAFL" target="blank">@UselessStatsAFL</a> or message the page.</p>
<p>Ok, let get into the setup!</p>
<div id="r-and-rstudio-installation">

<p>The program that we’ll be using to generate stats is <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="blank">R</a>, a powerful tool commonly used by professional statisticians and data scientists in academia and industry, but we’ll be using it to shitpost about AFL stats.</p>
<p>We’ll be downloading R from here <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/" target="blank">https://cloud.r-project.org/</a> and choose the version for your OS. I’d recommend all the default file locations and setup. If you are using a MAC OS, click <code>R-4.0.x.pkg</code> which is the executable.</p>
<p>We’ll also be using RStudio, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows for easier use of the R language. Download the free version here at <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" target="blank">https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a>.</p>
<p>Once they’ve been downloaded, open up your newly installed RStudio program. It should automatically find R and open up an interface. Think of R as the frame, steering wheel and engine of a car. You can get pretty far with just that, but RStudio completes the car, adding all the bells and whistles for a more comfortable journey. God that’s a terrible analogy.</p>
<div id="basics-of-r">
<h2>Basics of R</h2>
<p>Anyway, you should see a screen and tab named ‘Console’. This is where all the the commands get executed, lets try a couple out.</p>
<pre><code>1+1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 2</code></pre>
<pre><code>2*4</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<pre><code>3^3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 27</code></pre>
<p>Nice, what you’ll see is that the answer has been calculated and result has been produced on the next line.</p>
<p>Let’s save these results, we may want to use them later. In R we use an assignment command <code>&lt;-</code>, which looks like a backwards arrow. You can assign a result to any string of characters. You can also assign characters (like names, teams, locations, etc) to variables too.</p>
<pre><code>a &lt;- 1+1
b &lt;- 2*4
c &lt;- 3^3
first_name &lt;- 'John'</code></pre>
<p>If you look at the ‘Environment’ tab in the top right section, we can see our newly created variables, which we can use later on. Variables can be used in commands with each other too. You can’t add strings to numbers though.</p>
<pre><code>a + b * c</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 218</code></pre>
<p>Another important concept are vectors, a data structure that can hold multiple values. We use <code>c()</code> to denote a vector and we can insert multiple values.</p>
<pre><code>d &lt;- c(3,7,8,2)
teams &lt;- c('WCE','Freo','Geel')
d</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 3 7 8 2</code></pre>
<pre><code>d*2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  6 14 16  4</code></pre>
<pre><code>d[3]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 8</code></pre>
<pre><code>teams[2]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] "Freo"</code></pre>
<p>We can multiply and add to vectors and use square brackets to pull out certain indexes (positions) of the vector. Press the up arrow to cycle backwards through your previous commands.</p>
</div>
<div id="projects">
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>Projects help contain all of your data and files in an easy to maintain structure. We’ll create one for all of our AFL data analysis.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the dropdown menu in the top right corner</li>
<li>New project (and save)</li>
<li>New Directory</li>
<li>New Project</li>
<li>Name it (<code>AFL_Scripts</code> or something similar)</li>
</ol>
<p>This initialises your new project, and we’ll do all our analysis in this project. Use the command <code>getwd()</code> to find out the file path of this directory. You should see something similar to <code>C:/Users/your_name/Documents/AFL_Scripts</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="scripts">
<h2>Scripts</h2>
<p>Scripts are an easy way to store commands that you want to come back to later, and all of our data analysis will be written in scripts. To create a new script:</p>
<ol>
<li>File (top left)</li>
<li>New File</li>
<li>R Script</li>
</ol>
<p>Writing commands in the script and pressing enter will not execute the command, but will take you to a newline. To execute a line, use <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>Enter</code>. Press <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>S</code>to save your script, and you should see it appear in the ‘Files’ tab on the left hand side.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="lets-get-into-some-afl-analytics">

<p>In our new script, we first need to install some packages and load them into our workspace by executing the following commands.</p>
<div id="installing-packages">
<h2>Installing packages</h2>
<pre><code>install.packages("devtools") #allows us to download from github
install.packages("dplyr")    #data manipulation tools
install.packages("tidyr")    #more data manipulation tools
install.packages("snakecase")#data cleaning tool
install.packages("hms")      #date formatting
devtools::install_github("jimmyday12/fitzRoy") #package that loads afltables into R</code></pre>
<p>Ingore the warning about “Rtools”, it’s a windows development tool that we won’t be using.</p>
</div>
<div id="loading-packages">
<h2>Loading packages</h2>
<pre><code>library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(snakecase)
library(fitzRoy)</code></pre>
<p>Here’s another analogy, think of <code>install.packages</code> as a light bulb and <code>library</code> as a switch. You only need to install a package once (unless you update R), and can use the <code>library</code> function to turn them on when needed.</p>
<p>Side note using a hash (<code>#</code>) is a programming technique called commenting. Anything after a <code>#</code> will not be run and it allows the programmer to add notes, like what a certain line or function does.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="loading-in-afl-data">

<p>Now that we have everything set up, we can dive right in to the stats. We are going to load in data from <a href="https://afltables.com/afl/afl_index.html" target="blank">afltables.com</a> using <a href="https://github.com/jimmyday12/fitzRoy" target="blank">fitzRoy</a>, an R package put together by <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesday87" target="blank">James Day</a> that contains most of the match data in a consistent structure.</p>
<p>Lets load in all the data from the year 2000 onwards and assign it to a variable.</p>
<pre><code>afltables &lt;- get_afltables_stats(start_date = '2000-01-01')</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Returning data from 2000-01-01 to 2020-07-28</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Downloading data</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Finished downloading data. Processing XMLs</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Finished getting afltables data</code></pre>
<pre><code># afltables &lt;- get_afltables_stats() will pull in all the data from 1897</code></pre>
<p>Now that the data is loaded into our workspace, you can see in the ‘Environment’ tab that we have 172 thousand rows (observations) and 59 columns (variables). We can confirm this with the <code>dim</code> (short for dimensions) function. Loading in the data from 1897 will have over 600k rows.</p>
<pre><code>dim(afltables) #rows by columns</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 174284     59</code></pre>
<p>Lets use the head command, which shows the top 6 or so rows of our dataset.</p>
<pre><code>head(afltables)</code></pre>

  <hr id="top">

  <p>This is a fun blog post to write for two big reasons.</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Thanks to Google Fonts (especially <a href="https://twitter.com/davelab6">Dave Crossland</a>) all of our typefaces have been liberated! What does that mean? Each one is now open source and free for all, forever.</li>
  <li>We made a new website to accommodate this big change, and it is more robust than before with better type preview tools</li>
</ol>
<p>Getting our work on to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a> is still a work in progress, but the typefaces (including variable versions) will make it there eventually. In the meantime, they are available on <a href="https://github.com/etcetera-type-co">Github</a> and each font page on our site is showing the latest version in webfont (woff2) form.</p>
<p>We haven't blogged in over a year but during that quiet time we deleted our social media profiles. However, several thousand of you have signed up for our newsletter, which is how we're going to spread the word about these huge updates. We'll blast the news out soon. It feels good to relaunch the website with no store functionality necessary. We're free. The fonts are free.</p>
<p>All of our work has been improved dramatically since we initially published them. Each typeface now meets the <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools/tree/master/Lib/gftools/encodings/GF%20Glyph%20Sets">Google Fonts Plus glyph set</a> requirements, and each one has received many aesthetic upgrades as well. We could post a bunch of images here but how about some big links to the respective font pages, yeah?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Konsole is having a resurge in the moment, it’s the terminal emulator of choice
for the power user that wants to break the 4th wall in *nix systems. Right now
it can do almost all the things I want it to do, and a few more.</p>

<p>Since last year you can use splits in Konsole, with full drag &amp; drop support
between tabs and windows.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f9Y1pul8smQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>You can also use Konsole to quickly check for thumbnails of anything that dolphin
can show you, just by hovering with the mouse (and depending of your configuration)
pressing shift/control/alt. To my knowledge Konsole is the only terminal emulator
that supports this.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8lic9xKG4lo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Probably you already used <code>ls</code> to list a file that you need to get the full url,
to open in an unrelated program that does not accept the common way to open files
via the shell, and you need to paste into a dialog, or you just need to send the
full path of a file for a project colleague. I had problems with this untill I
snapped and implemented a way for konsole to <code>Copy Location</code>, it copies the full
file path of the selected file, and adds this data to your clipboard.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z11WRTM35Nc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Konsole supported for quite a while a way for you to click in a file and open it
in a the default editor (you need to have this configured in the profile) - but
sometimes we don’t want to open it in the default file, we wan’t to visualize
a image in gwenview or edit it in gimp, so now konsole supports a <code>Open With</code> menu
quite helpful when you don’t remember the name of the app you want to use but
remember the icon. :)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iUhftcLEfXo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Now a few features I’m working that I expect that will be ready for the next
version of konsole, those are still in review and I don’t know when they will
be ready, it’s just a sneak peek:</p>

<p>Configurable dimm stength for inactive terminals - when you are working with
split views and many terminals, there’s a option in the profile that makes the
terminals without focus darker, so it’s easier to know which terminal you are,
but it was not possible to configure the amount of darkening - and different
people have different needs, so now you can do this: (<em>not merged yet</em>)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dx8B6mJqVhU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Improved broadcast support - Konsole already supported this, but it did not play
well with splits, and it was not really easy to integrate multiple windows. How
you can now select what kind of broadcast group a terminal belongs to, any
terminal that belongs to the same group will send data to it, there’s also a
None group - for terminals that should not send data anywhere, and a <code>Broadcast
to All</code> groups, that will push data everywhere - despite being in the group or
not. (<em>not merged yet</em>)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PmI-t-nGsKs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Support for URL Escape Codes. There’s a spec that specifies how a terminal
application can embbed a URL inside of a block of text, by using the special
notation: <code>\e]8;;http://www.kde.org\e\\click here\e]8;;\e\\\n</code> this is equivalent
to the html code <code>&lt;a href="http://www.kde.org&gt; click here &lt;/a&gt;</code> and there’s a
work in progress implementation for that in the works (featuring a VIP list of
accepted schemas, currently only file, http and https are allowed, but the user
can overrite)</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_caJmf142Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>

<p>Those are all of the features that I worked (minus <em>tons</em> of bugfixes, security
improvements and general rewrites that are unrelated to new features). I hope
you all enjoy the new konsole, that is still one of the fastest terminal
emulators around, even tough it’s packed with features for the experienced and
novice user.</p>

July 30, 2020 | https://pace.dev/blog/2020/07/27/how-code-generation-wrote-our-api-and-cli.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pace.dev/blog/2020/07/27/how-code-generation-wrote-our-api-and-cli.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div uk-lightbox="toggle:.lightbox-toggle">
<p>We recently released the <a href="https://pace.dev/docs" rel="nofollow">Pace API</a>, along with an accompanying <a href="https://pace.dev/docs/cli" rel="nofollow">command line tool</a>, and various client libraries, all of which enable programmatic integration with Pace.</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto" rel="nofollow">Oto</a> to describe our RPC (Remote Procedure Call) API using Go interfaces and structs, and a variety of templates to generate the code we need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All methods in the API use a input and output struct for the request and response, supporting all JSON data types; strings, numbers, bools, objects and arrays.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="describing-the-api-1">Describing the API</h3>
<p>We describe our API using Go interfaces and structs.</p>
<p>Here’s a sample from our <code>CardsService</code> that describes the <code>GetCard</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>package pace

// CardsService allows you to programmatically manage cards in Pace.
type CardsService interface {
	// GetCard gets a card by ID.
	GetCard(GetCardRequest) GetCardResponse
}

// GetCardRequest is the input object for GetCard.
type GetCardRequest struct {
	// OrgID is the ID of the org.
	// example: "your-org-id"
	OrgID string
	// CardID is the ID of the card to get.
	// example: "123"
	CardID string
}

// GetCardResponse is the output object for GetCard.
type GetCardResponse struct {
	// Card is the card.
	Card Card
}

type Card struct {
	ID           string
	CTime        string
	Title        string
	Body         string
	BodyHTML     string
	// simplified to save your eyes
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since this is real Go code, our IDEs build and lint this along with the rest of our code.</p>
<h3 id="how-oto-parses-the-definition-2">How Oto parses the definition</h3>
<p>Oto uses the <code>golang.org/x/tools/go/packages</code> package (among others from the standard library) to understand the Go code, and turn the definition files into a workable data structure.</p>
<p>The following types are taken from the <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto/blob/master/parser.go" rel="nofollow">parser inside Oto</a>:</p>
<pre><code>// Service describes a service, akin to an interface in Go.
type Service struct {
	Name    string   `json:"name"`
	Methods []Method `json:"methods"`
	Comment string   `json:"comment"`
}

// Method describes a method that a Service can perform.
type Method struct {
	Name           string    `json:"name"`
	NameLowerCamel string    `json:"nameLowerCamel"`
	InputObject    FieldType `json:"inputObject"`
	OutputObject   FieldType `json:"outputObject"`
	Comment        string    `json:"comment"`
}

// etc
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have Go data that describes the interfaces, methods and structs, we can use templates to generate code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oto uses <a href="https://github.com/gobuffalo/plush" rel="nofollow">Plush templates from the Buffalo project</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="code-generation-3">Code generation</h3>
<p>Oto is essentially a code generation tool, because most of the work needed to wire up an implementation to an endpoint is predictable boilerplate that we would prefer not to write.</p>
<p>When generics lands in Go, we will be able to reduce the amount of boilerplate code generated in favour of generic methods. In this world, we may not need to generate much plumbing code at all.</p>
<h4 id="generating-server-side-plumbing-4">Generating server-side plumbing</h4>
<p>The first thing we generate is the server-side plumbing for the implementation of the service.</p>
<ul>
<li>The template that was used to generate this code is <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto/blob/master/otohttp/templates/server.go.plush" rel="nofollow">available as part of <code>otohttp</code></a></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>package api

// CardsService allows you to programmatically manage cards in Pace.
type CardsService interface {
	// GetCard gets a card by ID.
	GetCard(context.Context, GetCardRequest) (*GetCardResponse, error)
}

type cardsServiceServer struct {
	server       *otohttp.Server
	cardsService CardsService
}

// RegisterCardsService registers the CardsService implementation with the otohttp Server.
func RegisterCardsService(server *otohttp.Server, cardsService CardsService) {
	handler := &amp;cardsServiceServer{
		server:       server,
		cardsService: cardsService,
	}
	server.Register("CardsService", "GetCard", handler.handleCardsServiceGetCard)
}

func (s *cardsServiceServer) handleCardsServiceGetCard(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	var request GetCardRequest
	if err := otohttp.Decode(r, &amp;request); err != nil {
		s.server.OnErr(w, r, fmt.Errorf("CardsService GetCard %s", err))
		return
	}
	response, err := s.cardsService.GetCard(r.Context(), request)
	if err != nil {
		s.server.OnErr(w, r, fmt.Errorf("CardsService GetCard %s", err))
		return
	}
	if err := otohttp.Encode(w, r, http.StatusOK, response); err != nil {
		s.server.OnErr(w, r, fmt.Errorf("CardsService GetCard %s", err))
		return
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the above code, we generate:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new <code>CardsService</code> Go interface that describes the methods of the service. Notice that <code>context.Context</code> and <code>error</code> types were added to the signature of the methods</li>
<li>The <code>cardsServiceServer</code> struct couples the <code>otohttp.Server</code> with the service implementation, and has real <code>http.Handler</code> methods like <code>handleCardsServiceGetCard</code> that handles the RPC calls</li>
<li>The <code>RegisterCardsService</code> method uses the <code>Register</code> method on the <code>otohttp.Server</code> to bind the route <code>CardsService.GetCard</code> to the appropriate handler</li>
</ul>
<p>All we have to do is write a struct that implements the new <code>CardsService</code> interface, and the generated code, along with the code inside <code>otohttp</code>, does the rest for us.</p>
<h4 id="generating-clients-5">Generating clients</h4>
<p>A client is used to access the services on the remote server.</p>
<p>They aren’t always necessary if you’re working with plain-old JSON/HTTP but due to the security measures in Pace, we need to securely sign each request with a secret cryptographic key so we can be sure it is being made by a trusted partner. This can be tricky, so we generate clients that do it for you.</p>
<p>The first client we generate is a Go package, which we use in our tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By <strong>dog-fooding</strong> the generated Go client in our tests, we can not only ensure the services are functioning as we expect them to, but also that the client itself works.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The generated code for the <code>GetCard</code> client (generated from a <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/pace/blob/master/oto/client.go.plush" rel="nofollow">template file in the <code>github.com/pacedotdev/pace</code> project</a>) looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>// GetCard gets a card.
func (s *CardsService) GetCard(ctx context.Context, r GetCardRequest) (*GetCardResponse, error) {
	requestBodyBytes, err := json.Marshal(r)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errors.Wrap(err, "CardsService.GetCard: marshal GetCardRequest")
	}
	signature, err := generateSignature(requestBodyBytes, s.client.secret)
	if err != nil {

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <figure data-type="image"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/53bde489c28f22db0ca85d16d348e36b6af44214/7bc7c/images/everyday-design.jpg" alt=""></figure>
<p>There’s a secret code embedded in every app, website, and interface you use. Underneath your fingers is a hidden world traveled by the interface designers, caught up in a war between the complexities of technology and the breakneck evolution of user needs. These designers speak cryptically in neologisms (squircle, sharrow, neumorphism) and food-themed shibboleths (hamburger menu or meatball menu? Candy bar or toast?).</p>
<p>Their code is made of things called affordances. Those fluent in the language of affordances possess an intuitive and powerful understanding of how design works.</p>
<p>So let’s take a trip into the depths of interface design and shine a light on affordances. We’ll study them, explore how they work, and see how they define our digital tools. Bringing affordances out of the shadows can lead to clearer conversations about design, no matter if you’re a veteran designer or a casual user.</p>
<h2 id="the-history-of-affordances">The history of affordances</h2>
<p>In 1988, Don Norman published a book called <em>The Design of Everyday Things.</em> At the time, Norman was transitioning from a career in cognitive science and psychology to one in technology&nbsp;— he was one of the first people to write about “human-centered design,” an approach to technology that focuses on human biology and psychology to create functional software and hardware. <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em> was the genesis of many of these ideas, including one he called “affordances.”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>An affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Norman’s explorations of usability design, human-centered-design, and universal design all serve as the foundation of modern digital product design. But it’s the concept of affordances that has taken on a life all its own. Designers have taken the original definition and transformed it slightly: today, designers use “affordances” to mean “properties of objects which show users the actions they can take.”<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Here’s an example of an affordance in the real world:</p>
<p>A handle on a door is an affordance: it indicates that the door should be pulled. A flat, rectangular plate on a door is an affordance indicating that it should be pushed.</p>
<p>Norman would say that a handle or a plate is a <em>good affordance</em>, because of its relationship to the person who is using the door. A plate on a door begs to be pushed. Without edges or round parts to grab, the natural way&nbsp;— the only way&nbsp;— of interacting with it is to push. A good door handle, on the other hand, is located right where your arm naturally falls when reaching for the door. The radius of the handle is the right size to give you a good grip. It’s located on the side of the door opposite the hinge, so the door isn’t too hard to open.</p>
<p>Some doors don’t have good affordances. To make up for the confusion, there’s a “PUSH” or “PULL” sign. The sign doesn’t take advantage of the way our bodies instinctively interact with the door; it’s only helpful to people with good vision, who happen to be paying attention, or aren’t in too much of a hurry.</p>
<p>So, a good affordance takes advantage of some natural interaction between a thing and its user. Something that’s supposed to be used with your hands ought to be hand-shaped (and ambidextrous!). If something has visual feedback mechanisms, those mechanisms should be at eye level. Things arranged in physical space&nbsp;— like a row of lights, or a set of stovetop burners&nbsp;— should have their controls arranged in a corresponding way.</p>
<p>But we don’t always have a physical relationship to the tools we use.</p>
<p>Our phones, laptops, tablets, watches, and earbuds have so many functions that many interactions are digital by default. What does a good affordance look like in the digital world? If good affordances are ones that suit the nature of the interaction, what happens when the interactions are finger (or mouse pointer) on a flat, glass surface?</p>
<h2 id="the-evolution-of-affordances">The evolution of affordances</h2>
<p>Designers of early computers had to figure out what good digital affordances looked like. Most built clues into interfaces based on familiar physical objects: things stored in your computer’s memory are called files, and files are grouped into folders. How do you use a real-world folder? You open it. So, we can easily find the right command for accessing our digital folders because it’s labeled “open.” These affordances have been around for more than 70 years.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Some designers had to reckon with entirely new functions, ones that didn’t have any real-world equivalent. For instance, how do you represent a hyperlink&nbsp;— a piece of text that fluidly joins two documents together? Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, had to figure it out. He chose a blue underline. But there’s no reason why blue means “link”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the first WWW client&nbsp;… used just underline to represent [a] link, as it was a spare emphasis form which isn’t used much in real documents. Blue came in as browsers went color&nbsp;— I don’t remember which was the first to use blue.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the early days of the web, hundreds of affordances were coined this way. The URL for a page goes at the top. Text appears in a vertically scrolling column. A dropdown menu has a downward-pointing triangle next to it. Your mouse cursor is a slanted triangle with a tail, and when you hover over a link it looks like Mickey Mouse’s glove.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Most of these affordances don’t have any relationship to the physical characteristics of the interaction they mediate. But remove them from a website, application, or interface, and users get disoriented, frustrated, and unproductive.</p>
<p>This is a second way of thinking about good affordances: instead of being useful because they are natural, some affordances are useful because they’re norms. Designers employ commonly recognized icons, patterns, labels, and layouts to make it easy for new users to find and utilize functionality. As Jakob Nielsen puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. Design for patterns for which users are accustomed.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This circular definition underscores how important it is for digital interface designers to understand affordances. In fact, how a designer sees, uses, understands, and breaks the rules of affordances is a telling sign of their experience and abilities.</p>
<h2 id="how-designers-use-affordances">How designers use affordances</h2>
<p>Early in a designer’s career, they’ll <strong>use affordances</strong> even without knowing. That’s how I got started in design: I copied other designer’s work as a starting point, instead of starting from scratch. I had no idea why certain elements worked the way they did&nbsp;— but by emulating more experienced designers, I could take a shortcut past my lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>But design enough of the same kind of thing&nbsp;— t-shirts, band posters, MySpace pages&nbsp;— and you’ll start to recognize common elements. <strong>Recognizing affordances</strong> might not come with a detailed understanding of the <em>why</em>, but at least many inexperienced designers can identify the <em>what</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding affordances</strong> comes from a place of curiosity. This means questioning affordances&nbsp;— why are links blue? Why is most text left-aligned? Why are user avatars usually cropped into circles? Sometimes the answers to these questions are rooted in psychology, biology, anthropology, or technology.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>But affordances sometimes exist for no obvious reason. As I use the same affordances over and over, I think, “is this really the right way to do things?” As the internet enters its fourth or fifth decade,<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup> many designers are <strong>abandoning affordances</strong> once taken for granted. Google, for example, is in the middle of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-chrome-kill-url-first-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a battle to kill the URL</a>, one of the few remaining affordances that distinguish a web page from an app.</p>
<p>Finally, as old affordances are being left behind, designers are <strong>inventing new affordances</strong> to take their place. Small touchscreens have become the dominant mode of interaction with digital interfaces,<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup> and designers created new ways of indicating functionality. The “hamburger” menu is one example: three horizontal lines indicates where to tap to expand a menu, something only required on small screens where some elements have to be hidden.</p>
<figure data-type="image"><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/722ac6cacbdd4e5bfdc4f43a6db10fb634bb846b/9cfa1/images/everyday-design-1.jpg" alt="A hamburger menu, a meatball menu, and a bento box menu"><figcaption>A hamburger menu, a meatball menu, and a bento box menu</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="affordances-everywhere">Affordances everywhere</h2>
<p>Understanding the correct application of affordances is one of the most fundamental jobs of designers of functional things. This won’t change anytime soon: as long as we’re interacting with the world around us, designers will need to maintain a mental library of affordances.<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Affordances are the hidden language of interface design. Using affordances wrong can stunt a company’s growth, as Snapchat famously discovered.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup> Using them right has returns in <a href="https://articles.uie.com/three_hund_million_button/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">millions</a>, <a href="https://articles.uie.com/beyond_ux_tipping_point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billions</a>, and <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/intranet-usability-the-trillion-dollar-question/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trillions</a> of dollars.</p>
<p>For that reason, affordances are, and will always be, the things of everyday design.</p>

Tomorrow, I start building it.</p>— Sahil Lavingia (@shl) <a href="https://twitter.com/shl/status/54072049395712000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2011</a></blockquote> <p>I thought Gumroad would become a billion-dollar company, with hundreds of employees. It would IPO, and I would work on it until I died. Something like that.</p><p>Needless to say, that didn’t happen.</p><p>Now, it may look like I am in an enviable position, running a profitable, growing, low-maintenance software business serving adoring customers. But for years, I considered myself a failure. At my lowest point, I had to lay off 75 percent of my company, including many of my best friends. I had failed.</p><p>It took me years to realize I was misguided from the outset. I no longer feel shame in the path I took to get to where I am today — but for a long time, I did. This is my journey, from the beginning.</p><h2>A weekend project turned VC-backed startup</h2><p>The idea behind Gumroad was simple: Creators and others should be able to sell their products directly to their audiences with quick, simple links. No need for a storefront.</p><p>I built Gumroad the weekend I thought up the idea, and launched it early Monday morning on Hacker News. The reaction exceeded my grandest aspirations. Over 52,000 people checked it out on the first day.</p><p>Later that year, I left my job as the second employee at Pinterest — before I vested any of my stock — to turn Gumroad into what I thought would become my life’s work.</p><p>Almost immediately, I raised $1.1M from an all-star cast of angel investors and venture capital firms, including Max Levchin, Chris Sacca, Ron Conway, Naval Ravikant, Collaborative Fund, Accel Partners, and First Round Capital. A few months later, in May 2012, we raised $7M more. Mike Abbott from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), a top-tier VC firm, led the round.</p><p>I was on top of the world. I was just 19, a solo founder, with over $8M in the bank and three employees. The world was starting to take note.</p><p>We grew the team. We stayed focused on our product. The monthly numbers started to climb. And then, at some point, they didn’t.</p><p>To keep the product alive, I laid off 75 percent of my company — including many of my best friends. It really sucked. But I told myself things would be fine: The product would continue to grow and no one far from the company would ever find out.</p><p>Then, TechCrunch got wind of the layoffs and published “Layoffs Hit Gumroad As The E-Commerce Startup Restructures.” All of a sudden, my failure was public. I spent the week ignoring my support network and answering our customers’ concerns, many of whom relied on us to power their businesses. They wanted to know if they should look for alternative products. Some of our favorite, most successful creators left. This hurt, but I don’t blame them for trying to minimize the risk in their own businesses.</p><p>So what exactly went wrong, and when?</p><h2>Failing in style</h2><p>Let’s start with the numbers. This is our monthly processed volume, until the layoffs:</p><p><img src="https://sahillavingia.com/0_z7tBf5i6wH-HbLhU.png"></p><p>It doesn’t look too bad, right? It’s going in the right direction: up.</p><p>But we were venture-funded, which was like playing a game of double-or-nothing. It’s euphoric when things are going your way — and suffocating when they’re not. And we weren’t doubling fast enough to raise the $15M+ Series B (the second major round of funding) we were looking for to grow the team.</p><p>For the type of business we were trying to build, every month of less than 20 percent growth should have been a red flag.</p><p>But at the time, I thought it was okay. We had money in the bank and product-market fit. We would continue to ship product and things would work out. The online creator movement was still nascent; the slow growth wasn’t our fault. It always looked like change was right around the corner.</p><p>But now, I realize: It doesn’t matter whose “fault” it is; we hit a peak in November 2014 and stalled. A lot of creators absolutely loved us, but there weren’t enough of them who needed our specific product offering. Product-market fit is great, but we needed to find a new, larger fit to justify raising more money (and then do it again and again, until acquisition or IPO).</p><p>In January 2015, after our final double-or-nothing hail-mary, our bank balance dipped below 18 months of runway. I told my 20-person team the road ahead would be a tough one. We didn’t have the numbers to raise a Series B, and we would have to work really hard over the next nine months to get even close. To that end, we deprioritized everything except features that would directly move the needle. Many were not core to our business, but we needed to try everything we could to get our monthly processed volume to where it needed to be.</p><p>If we succeeded, we would raise money from a top-tier VC again, hire more people, and pick up the journey where we’d left off. If we didn’t, we would have to drastically downsize the company.</p><p>In those nine months, when the whole team knew we were fighting for our company’s life, not a single person left Gumroad. From “this is gonna be hard,” to “yep, turns out it was,” every single person worked harder than ever.</p><p>We launched a “Small Product Lab” to teach new creators how to grow and sell. We shipped a ton of features, including weekly payouts, payouts to debit cards, payouts to the U.K., Australia, and Canada, various additions to our email features, product recommendations and search, analytics to see how customers are reading/watching/downloading the products they’ve purchased, and add-to-cart functionality. And that was just between August and November.</p><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t hit the numbers we needed.</p><h2>Slim down or shut down?</h2><p>Looking back, I’m glad we didn’t hit those numbers. If we’d doubled down, raised more money, and appeared in the headlines again, there would have been a very real possibility of even more spectacular failure.</p><p>With that off the table, our options were:</p><p>Shut down the business, return the remaining money to investors, and try something new.</p><p>Continue with a slimmed-down version of the company to aim for sustainability.</p><p>Position the company for an acquihire.</p><p>Some of my investors wanted me to shut down the business. They tried to convince me that my time was worth more than trying to keep a small business like Gumroad afloat, and I should try to build another billion-dollar company armed with all of my learnings — and their money.</p><p>I tended to agree with them, to be honest. But I was accountable to our creators, our employees, and our investors — in that order. We helped thousands of creators get paid, every month. About $2,500,000 was going to go into the pockets of creators — for rent checks and mortgages, for student loans and kids’ college funds. And it was only growing! Could I really just turn that faucet off?</p><p>If I sold the company, it would be mostly for our stellar team — and I would no longer be able to control the destiny of the product. There were too many acquisition stories of companies promising exciting journeys and amazing synergies to come — and ending with a deprecated product a year later.</p><p>Selling was certainly tempting. I could say I sold my first company, raise more money, and do this all again with a new idea. But that didn’t sit right with me. We were responsible to our creators first. That’s what I told every new hire and every investor.

July 29, 2020 | https://forum.kee.pm/t/a-critical-security-update-for-keepassrpc-is-available/3040 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://forum.kee.pm/t/a-critical-security-update-for-keepassrpc-is-available/3040">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Today we published a new version of KeePassRPC (1.12.1) which resolves critical security vulnerabilities in all previous versions of the plugin.</p>
<p><strong>To ensure that your passwords stored within KeePass Password Safe remain secret, you must <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">install this new version</a> immediately.</strong></p>
<p>This does not affect Kee browser extension users that store passwords only in <a href="https://keevault.pm/">Kee Vault</a>.</p>
<p>This is not a vulnerability in the Kee browser extension so re-installing, updating, downgrading, disabling or removing Kee will not affect your exposure to this risk.</p>
<p>If you are unsure whether you are affected, simply follow the instructions for <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">updating KeePassRPC</a>. If you find an old version of <em>KeePassRPC.plgx</em> on your computer, you should replace it with the newest version immediately.</p>
<p>Download version 1.12.1 or newer from GitHub and install it right now. If you’re unsure how to install a new version of a KeePass plugin, we have documentation to help you at <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">Upgrading KeePassRPC</a>.</p>
<details>
<summary>
Additional information about the update</summary>
<p>Version 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 both contain the fixes for these vulnerabilities. If you’re one of the few people who have installed version 1.12.0, you only have to upgrade to 1.12.1 if you want to connect the KeeBird Thunderbird email client extension to KeePassRPC. Unless you already have version 1.12.0 installed, please <strong>install version 1.12.1</strong>.</p>
<p>If for some reason you are unable to update to the new version, some mitigating actions include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lock your KeePass databases and do not unlock them until the plugin has been updated</li>
<li>Close all web browsers and do not browse the internet until the plugin has been updated</li>
<li>Change the websocket <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/keepassrpc-port/2360">port that KeePassRPC listens on</a>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The 3rd suggestion relies on security through obscurity and is thus unlikely to greatly reduce your risk for very long. Obviously all 3 of the above suggestions are very significantly worse than simply updating the plugin straight away.</p>
</details>
<h3>About the vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>Credit for discovering and responsibly disclosing the two related vulnerabilities goes to Philipp Danzinger, Michael Pucher and Georg Merzdovnik for helping explore the vulnerabilities as well as co-developing and hosting the proof of concept exploits.</p>
<p>Successfully exploiting either vulnerability results in an attacker gaining access to all passwords in any open KeePass databases. No obvious user interaction is required, only a visit to a malicious web site; in some cases there is no visible evidence that the vulnerability is being exploited.</p>
<details>
<summary>
'ALL' passwords may not strictly be true for every user. Expand this section to learn about the subtle potentially mitigating details</summary>
<p>KeePassRPC offers an occasionally-used feature called “Kee home group”. For each open database in KeePass, KeePassRPC will only reveal passwords if they are contained within this group.</p>
<p>Additionally, individual password entries can be hidden from KeePassRPC.</p>
<p>For most people the entire database of entries was at risk of exposure but for those that utilise either of these two features, that action may have limited the set of entries that were at risk of exposure.</p>
<p>Even if you used these features to manage your entries, an additional factor may still have allowed <em>all</em> entries to be exposed. As explained in the KeePassRPC user interface and existing documentation, enabling the KeePass placeholders feature is a security risk in its own right. If you had any entries visible to KeePassRPC which had the placeholder feature enabled, it is feasible that an attacker could have used this to access all entries.</p>
<p>It is also worth remembering that KeePassRPC only ever sees entries which have a URL field set so if that field is empty, the contents of the entry can only have been at risk if you also utilised the placeholders feature.</p>
</details>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> An initial version of this announcement stated that remote code execution would be possible via placeholders. Deeper investigation has confirmed that this was not possible. Apologies for the additional alarm but I felt it was better to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>We consider this to be the most serious category of security vulnerability and implore you to take immediate action - KeePass does not have an automatic update feature so <strong>you must apply the fix yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>These vulnerabilities were not previously publicly known so <strong>if you take prompt action, it is extremely unlikely that your passwords have been exposed</strong>. However, it is not possible to determine with 100% certainty that you were not targeted by a malicious attacker so you may wish to change your passwords, at least somewhat sooner than you otherwise would have done. For what it’s worth, I will personally be undertaking a password change procedure on all passwords that can feasibly be used to access systems that affect the integrity or security of KeePassRPC, the Kee browser extension, Kee Vault and all related services. Otherwise, I think that the risk is low enough that I will not be accelerating my usual 5-20 year change cycle for any other passwords.</p>
<p>Your master password is never exposed through KeePassRPC and the security of your kdbx file remains intact. It is the individual entries within your KeePass database that were at risk.</p>
<p>Kee 3.5 contains many improvements relating to password saving so if you choose to change any of your website passwords, you may wish to do so using the <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/beta-testing-the-kee-browser-extension/2022">latest beta version</a>. We’ll be requesting that this version of Kee is released to all Kee users very soon but it can take many weeks for the web browser developers to approve a new release.</p>
<p>The two vulnerabilities outlined below reside in the SRP authentication implementation; successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the usual password-based authentication procedure.</p>
<ol>
<li>A piece of information supplied by a KeePassRPC client was not correctly validated before being relied upon in the SRP algorithm.</li>
<li>The use of a non-cryptographically secure random number generator in a cryptographically sensitive calculation vastly increased the chance of an attacker being able to guess their way past the usual protection that SRP offers. On some systems a successful exploitation could go unnoticed and complete in less than one minute, although in many cases it would take longer and result in noticeably “strange” behaviour that could alert a user to the threat before it succeeds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both vulnerabilities have now been addressed and I have additionally developed a further security layer to reduce the chance that future vulnerabilities in the SRP server could be exploited by malicious websites. In case this additional security layer poses a problem for any consumers of KeePassRPC that are not modern browser extensions, the information I’ve posted in <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/configuring-keepassrpc-1-12-permitted-websocket-origins/3041">this new documentation topic</a> will allow you to work around the new limitation.</p>
<h3>What you can do to help</h3>
<p>No single person or organisation can release perfectly secure code so it is great to see the wider security community probing our Open Source software for vulnerabilities like this.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have the experience to help too? As well as reviewing the source code and seeking out vulnerabilities, you may be able to help to reduce the attack surface of KeePassRPC by developing a modern replacement for the HTTP-based communications protocol (websockets) that allowed these vulnerabilities to be exposed to remote systems. We may not be able to make this change without breaking backwards compatibility and it may limit the usefulness of KeePassRPC outside of the context of a browser extension but these drawbacks may be a price worth paying in order to reduce the risk of a similar vulnerability being exploited in future. I’m undecided if it is something we should actively pursue and don’t currently have the resources to implement it alone. Please check out the <a href="https://github.com/kee-org/browser-addon/issues/23">relevant GitHub issue</a> if you are interested in helping out.</p>
<p>If none of the above sounds like it’s your thing please check out other ways you could help at <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/contributions-bugs-help-and-support-guidelines/548">Contributions, bugs, help and support guidelines</a> .</p>
<h3>Closing remarks</h3>
<p>My priority for the past 24 hours has been ensuring a fast and thorough response to the discovery of this vulnerable SRP server implementation. As such, I can’t yet be very definitive regarding how or why these implementation mistakes were made. It appears as though they can be traced back to code that I wrote around a decade ago when so many factors were different to today. At a later date I will perform a more in-depth analysis of the likely causes - my initial thoughts lead me to think that some significant factors will have been the lack of available battle-tested .NET implementations of big integers and SRP6a.</p>
<p>Distributing critical security updates for a KeePass plugin has never been easy but I hope that this announcement, the use of the optional update notification feature within KeePass and the upcoming version 3.5 of the Kee browser extension - which will refuse to work with any earlier version of KeePassRPC - will all go some way towards accelerating the uptake of this important software update. Please point your co-workers, friends and acquaintances to this forum topic if you think they may also need to install this update.</p>
<p>In case it needs explicitly stating, I can confirm that I am personally very sorry that these vulnerabilities were introduced into KeePassRPC and remained present for so long. I am therefore very grateful to the security researchers (Philipp Danzinger, Michael Pucher and Georg Merzdovnik) who discovered the vulnerabilities and so professionally and clearly conveyed their findings to me.</p>
<p>I will prevent replies being added to this topic because posts in this category are often pushed to the community by email but please do post a new topic on this forum if you have any questions - I can’t promise a personal reply but I’ll try my best and hopefully other members of the community can help out when I’m not available.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ve already done it but just in case: <a href="https://forum.kee.pm/t/upgrading-keepassrpc/22">Upgrade KeePassRPC.plgx</a> now!</p>

<p><span>T</span>he day Kim Hye-min threw up on the job while working as a graphic designer at a small broadcasting firm in Seoul, she was so overwhelmed by stress that it made her sick to her stomach. When a senior co-worker shamed her for being just a few minutes late, it echoed what she had heard from older South Koreans all her life: she wasn’t good enough. At lunchtime, she made a run for the restroom stall.</p>



<p>“The criticisms kept building up,” she says, until she reached the point where she didn’t think she could take it anymore. For 26-year-old Hye-min, as for many young South Koreans, life choices feel forced and fixed — and not like actual choices at all. Many feel so beaten down by the rigid social and professional demands of their country that they refer to it as “Hell Joseon,” a play on Korea’s old dynastic name. The path is especially bleak for young women, who must contend with the nation’s deeply rooted misogyny. Deviation from the mainstream is widely viewed as disobedient, and sometimes, in the eyes of older generations, even unpatriotic.</p>



<p>“It’s something to do with Korean society,” Hye-min says. “There’s only one way to engage in relationships with others, or one type of person who’s considered acceptable. And for people like me, it’s really hard.”</p>



<p>Again and again, her parents would ask her,<em> “</em>Hye-min, why can’t you be like your classmates and study hard and do well? Hye-min, why can’t you be like your peers and hurry to finish university and get a job?”</p>



<p>Hye-min never understood why she should have to rush through a school system that did nothing but judge and rank her, only to find a lifelong position at a company that would do the same. She dropped out of university for a year before transferring, sought out counseling for her battered self-esteem, and quit her job, despite knowing that all of these choices would be looked upon as failures. Perhaps toughest of all, Hye-min knew that, even if she were to achieve “success,” it was unlikely she’d be compensated fairly for it: <a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/employment/gender-wage-gap/indicator/english_7cee77aa-en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korea’s gender wage gap</a> is the worst in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with men earning on average 32.5% more than women.</p>



<p>Her parents would ask, “Hye-min, why can’t you be like other women your age and find a nice man and get married?”</p>



<p>Hye-min, however, has no plans to get married. Nor does she expect to have children. After years of being told she must strive to be a good student, good employee, good wife, and good mother, she eventually decided she no longer wanted to partake in a system that ties her social currency and self-worth to such a punishing status quo. So Hye-min opted out. “Why do I have to continue on, going through these difficulties?” she says. “For what?”</p>

<p><strong>In traditionally collectivist</strong> South Korea, individualist loners, or <em>honjok</em>, are becoming increasingly common. The term, which translates to “alone tribe,” shortens and combines <em>나홀로</em>, meaning “by myself,” and <em>족</em>, “tribe.” It’s used to describe a group of people who prefer, out of pleasure or practicality — and, often, utter exhaustion and sheer desperation — to live outside of conventional social structures and simply be alone.</p>



<p>What constitutes being “alone” can be fuzzy, but it ultimately comes down to the physical and psychological boundaries one draws around oneself. Honjok might partake in leisure activities alone, maintain a single-person household, avoid a workplace or office setting, limit social circles, abstain from sex or romantic relationships, or reject marriage or children. At its core, honjok culture is about resisting South Korea’s establishment society and putting individual needs and desires above loyalty to hierarchy and authority. But living independently doesn’t automatically make someone honjok, and identifying as honjok doesn’t preclude being part of a community — especially when that community is virtual.</p>

<p>Within South Korea’s hyperactive cyberculture of online forums, blogs, and social media, an entire taxonomy has sprung up to classify, in ever greater detail, various honjok identities and activities. Many honjok are <em>honyeo</em>, or solitary women, and some honyeo, like Hye-min, are <em>bihon</em>, meaning they reject marriage and often child-rearing. There are also <em>4B</em>s, who take the ethos even further by rejecting sex and romantic relationships. When honjok eat alone, it’s called <em>honbap</em>, and when they drink alone, it’s <em>honsul</em>. They can also play alone (<em>honnol</em>), which might include traveling alone (<em>honhaeng</em>), going to the movies alone (<em>honyeong</em>), or shopping alone (<em>honsho</em>). </p>



<p>All of this contributes to a booming <em>honconomy</em>. On average, South Korea’s rapidly growing single-household population has more disposable income than those with three to four people. By 2030, the Korean Institute of Industrial Economics and Trade estimates single-household expenditures will reach almost 200 trillion won (or about $165 billion) in Korea.</p>



<p>Across the country, companies are cashing in on this lucrative market. Banks offer single-household credit cards. E-commerce platforms list honjok as a stand-alone shopping category, marketing items like tiny washing machines, multipurpose furniture, and one-person settings of dishware. Convenience stores, popular among honjok because of their ubiquitous locations and smaller quantities, put on special promotions and advertise single-serving meals and pouches of alcohol. Food delivery services promote takeout for one. Bars and restaurants promise solo patrons judgment-free service, and honjok-specific establishments set partitioned tables just for them. Specialized karaoke joints feature individual coin-operated booths. Cinemas install single-seat aisles. TV shows like “I Live Alone” and “Drinking Solo” portray honjok life, and news sites like <em>1conomy News</em> exclusively cover single living.</p>



<p>It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when the concept of honjok first appeared in South Korea, but a Daumsoft analysis shows that the use of terms such as honbap, honsul, and honnol exploded in the first half of the 2010s, going from only 44 total mentions at the beginning of the decade to more than 60,000 in 2016. Over this same period, the rate of smartphone ownership in South Korea rocketed from 14% to over 85%, and on-demand shopping emerged and blended with social media, laying the foundations for today’s cyber-mediated consumer culture. While personal tech adoption has done much to elevate honjok into a national phenomenon, it might also have revealed how many South Koreans were already seeking a way out.</p>

<p><strong>While some honjok</strong> embrace the “hon” and truly go it alone, others turn to the “jok,” the tribe of people like them, for support and validation. In communities both online and off, members strive to normalize the honjok life as a sign of modern times — a decision that is sensible and convenient, and if not something to celebrate, then at the very least nothing to be embarrassed about.</p>



<p>That honjok would need or want to look to others while isolating themselves may seem like something of a paradox. Yet, for many young honjok, the appeal lies in partaking in “a sort of shared identity” while under pressure from a status-obsessed country, says Andrew Eungi Kim, a sociology professor at Korea University. “If you don’t meet mainstream standards, you feel ashamed. With honjok, there is a sense of being a member of a group,” which, in some instances, can be as much about safety in numbers as about true solidarity.</p>



<p>Honjok Dot Com, which operates through a website and a Facebook group, is a honjok resource that describes itself as “the best gift for you alone.” Launched by 31-year-old Jang Jae-young, Honjok Dot Com recommends establishments, from barbecue restaurants to tennis courts, that cater to solo patrons, as well as various on-demand services for managing a single household. Writing over email in January, because he could not (or maybe would not) meet in person, Jae-young observed some positive changes in how South Koreans perceive honjok. “Before, this word generally implied a socially awkward person,” he noted, adding that people&nbsp;understand better now that it refers to those “who confidently choose to remain alone and stay happy.” Jae-young is an example of the latter: he has been single and living alone since 2015.</p>

<p>On King of Honjok, a community app with an accompanying website, solitaries post photos of their daily lives, shop the marketplace for honjok wares, and peruse articles like “The trend these days is ‘I live alone!’” and other content created specifically for them. They occasionally meet in person at King of Honjok events. Thirty-four-year-old co-founder Oh Jung-hee, who has been honyeo for the past decade and sees her friends in person two to three times a year, says that, in a society oriented toward families and couples, she started King of Honjok to help voluntary outsiders like her lead better lives. Whether they use it to be “independent alone” or “independent together” is up to them.</p>



<p>But, as one might imagine of a platform for people who prefer to keep their distance from others, there isn’t much interaction on King of Honjok that points to the making of deep relationships. Posts are fun and lighthearted, and comments are fairly generic, offering an occasional Wow! or Cool! or the Korean way of lol-ing, <em>ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ</em>. Jung-hee estimates that, of the community’s roughly 8,000 members, mostly millennial women in Seoul, about half never interact at all.</p>



<p>That’s absolutely fine, she says, because the purpose is simply to be a presence for an often-marginalized population. That sentiment is echoed …</p></div></div>

<p><strong>Interview with Jozsef Borocz by Boroka Paraszka</strong></p>



<p><a href="http://www.marosvasarhelyiradio.ro/musorok/a-feher-magasabbrendusegrol-borocz-jozsef/"><strong>The original of this interview was broadcast, in Magyar, on Marosvásárhelyi Rádió Romania—a minority-language public radio station in Târgu Mureș, Romania—on July 8, 2020</strong></a></p>



<p>Slightly edited and lightly
annotated English translation by Jozsef Borocz</p>



<p>Boroka Paraszka: You
said you were „at a loss” about the new movements in the US and their reception
in Europe. That surprised me because I thought you had a very defined opinion. </p>



<p>Jozsef Borocz: Well, I
do, and I am very critical. I am „at a loss” in two senses of the word. First,
I am actually shocked by seeing some of the things happening in the USA, even
though I have always been strongly skeptical about the political system, and some
aspects of social reality overall, like all the good people I know—I guess I
belong in a group of intellectuals who are critical observers of reality—but
even I had not expected that the situation would go so far as it has. </p>



<p>In a second sense, I
am reading the reactions to the news in the US by the greatest minds of
Hungarian intellectual scene with a shock. More precisely, perhaps it is too
strong to say that I am „shocked,” since, in a certain way, it was to be
expected that reactions of this kind would be produced—but I find the scale,
the magnitude of the positions, the&nbsp;
severity, the fury and the absence of any empathy or sensitivity,
frankly, breathtaking. </p>



<p>BP: I think that the
Hungarian refusal, the dismissive position is not a Hungarian specialty, it is
true of the rest of eastern Europe.</p>



<p>JB: Yes, of
course.&nbsp; Mostly. </p>

<p>BP: As to why it is
happening, I have no explanation, but if you do have one, I would be curious to
hear it. Where does the degree of indifference with which people react to the
events in the US come from? Let’s say, from the context of the Romanian nation
state, especially those who pursue minority rights, could, in theory, see an
opportunity in the US events, and they could see a positive example in all
this.</p>



<p>JB: &nbsp;Right. If we try to turn this entire gamut of
issues to the history of Hungarian public culture and education, it strikes me
that, at a certain, earlier time, a large part of Hungarian culture—say,
looking at folklore—had an image of idea of self and an ideal of beauty that it
found in itself as “piros-barna legény, piros-barna kislány” (red-brown girl /
boy). Metaphorically speaking, by today, Hungarian conversation has shifted to
seeing itself as “fehérnép” (white folk). I know this contrast is unfair
“methodologically,” as those two metaphors are not directly comparable, and
these are two small examples taken from a gigantic stock of folk metaphors—but
precisely as metaphors I will stay with them for now because I find them
suggestive. My point is that, over the twentieth century or so, educated
Hungarian conversation began imagining itself as “White.” I will clarify what I
mean by Whiteness in a moment. </p>



<p>Now, there are
enormous problems with that. On the one hand, factually, it is untrue. On the
other hand, it is as if, in the absolutely last moment, we were trying to climb
onboard the Titanic of global Whiteness—when we don’t even have a seat
reservation. This is basically how I can define the trajectory of our culture
over the last century.</p>



<p>I have an even better
metaphor to offer. It is based on a historical fact—and it lightens our
conversation on account of it not being about Hungary or Hungarians. Before independence,
today’s Haiti was a French colony, called Saint-Domingue. It was an important
part of the French colonial system. The colonial products grown in Haiti made
up forty to sixty percent of French colonial imports at the time. Haiti had a
plantation-based agriculture, based on slave labor. The news of the 1789 French
Revolution percolated through the colonial system—where all the population
spoke some version of French at the time—so the people of Saint-Domingue, too,
learned about the idea of “droits de l’homme”, human rights, and adopted it as
an inspiration. The result was <a href="http://ouleft.org/wp-content/uploads/CLR_James_The_Black_Jacobins.pdf">a popular uprising that was both an anti-colonial war
and a revolution aiming to put an end to slavery</a>. I obviously cannot recount <a href="https://h-france.net/fffh/maybe-missed/madison-smartt-bells-haitian-revolution-trilogy/">the beautiful history</a> of the Haitian Revolution here—I can only recommend
it for everyone <a href="https://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0101-33002011000200010&amp;script=sci_arttext">to find out about it</a>. It is enough to know that, in the more than a decade
long anti-colonial war that ensued, at a certain point, when Poland had been
partitioned and France received a sizeable Polish emigré population, Napoleon
sent a Polish battalion to Saint-Domingue to help extinguish the uprising. The
Polish contingent arrived in the island and soon realized that their political
ideals were best matched not by the geopolitical concerns of Napoleon’s France
but those of the Haitian Revolution. </p>



<p>For us, in our part of
the world, one of the most breathtaking aspects of the history of the Haitian Revolution
is that the Polish battalion sent there by the French switched sides and
supported the uprising.&nbsp; Mind you, some
of the Polish survivors ended up settling there, and there are even today proud
Haitians who claim, partly, Polish family heritage.</p>



<p>There are many
intricacies to this story. My point is that, in the late-18<sup>th</sup>,
early-19<sup>th</sup> century, it was still possible for east European subjects
to experience a political, moral and emotional identification with Black people
and the objectives of the latters’ armed struggles against colonial rule and
slavery. This, by the way, was not unique to Poles—there is ample evidence of
similar positions in Hungarian history as well. </p>



<p>By today, this political,
moral and emotional identification has become almost impossible. </p>



<p>BP: Why?</p>



<p>JB:&nbsp; Look, this is an excellent question, and I
would like to pose it myself. I have no answer. Groups of talented young
historians of political ideas ought to re-examine the corpus of Hungarian
(Polish, etc.) culture to find the causes for this loss.&nbsp; Understanding the underlying causes for the
Whitening, so to speak, of Hungarian culture would allow us to make giant leaps
forward in coming to terms with our collective heritage: Documenting how it
happened that masses of Hungarians began adopting the identity position of west
European Whiteness. The essence of that position is that west European
Whiteness is so exceptional, it is so superior to the rest of the world, that
even questioning that dogma is anathema. Hence there is nothing else for us in
eastern Europe to do than keep repeating our claim that we, too, are part of
west European Whiteness. When we feel that <a href="https://www.academia.edu/33969498/The_Unbearable_Whiteness_of_the_Polish_Plumber_and_the_Hungarian_Peacock_Dance_around_Race_">perhaps we are not exactly considered parts of it</a>, our reaction is repeating the same claim, only more obnoxiously,
if that’s even possible. </p>



<p>This is not going to
work, for multiple reasons.&nbsp; Perhaps the
most important is that this position is deeply immoral. Claiming Whiteness is a
global-historical sin.&nbsp; Being claimants
to Whiteness means that we demand unearned, <em>un-earnable</em> global
privileges. It means claiming to have a “right” to rob Africa of its natural
treasures, from caoutchouc to precious metals, it means claiming a right to
enslave—i.e., kidnap, abuse and sell through “the market”, a market that we
then turn around and call “free”—and engage under unspeakable, dehumanizing
conditions people by the millions and millions. Make no mistake about it, we
are not only talking about the US South and Haiti, in the last several
centuries, but today. West European Whiteness claims a right to mansplain
everybody how they should live—while, for the most part, it has not the
foggiest notion of local conditions. It claims a right to treat with the most
boorish disrespect the cultures, aesthetic achievements, ethical
considerations, problems, etc. of the rest—i.e., the vast majority—of the
world. </p>



<p>BP: At this point many
people start having a certain anxiety in east-central Europe as experiences are
really different around here. Among many other things, partly because of Roma
segregation, partly because of racial homogeneity, most of us don’t really have
experience about what it means when multiple races live together. At this
point, where you say it is a sin to be White, people start to be anxious,
thinking “I have nothing to do with the fact that I was born white,” they would
not even understand what you are saying when you talk about claims to White
superiority, since he or she knows nothing about slavery—here there was no such
thing, although Romania had slavery, it was abolished here latest in Europe,
never mind, so, they feel that if you say that being White is a sin, then that
is a form of racism itself. Hence, they feel victims and not perpetrators.</p>



<p>JB: I have skipped an
important point, thank you for reminding me. Putting forth a claim to global Whiteness
has nothing to do with skin pigmentation. I repeat. Whiteness is not a question
of skin color. Skin color is just an excuse. Whiteness is a category of power,
privilege and (im)morality. There are myriad ways to show that. Perhaps I will
mention only the most obvious one.</p>



<p>The situation at the
heart of the problem I mentioned above—trying to understand how Hungarian
culture became “White”—is not exactly unique. In the US—whose written,
school-taught and media-distributed history begins with the arrival of
Europeans there, a truly revolting story in its own right, by the way—there
exists a small industry of social historians studying processes of “becoming White.”
Karen Brodkin’s widely read book titled <a href="https://books.google.hu/books/about/How_Jews_Became_White_Folks_and_what_tha.html?id=itdBdt8OvMwC&amp;redir_esc=y"><em>How Jews Became White Folks and What That Says About
America</em></a> began this series of
research projects almost a generation ago. This was followed by similar project
concerning other ethnic groups. The essence of …</p></div></div>

July 29, 2020 | https://arshamg.com/blog/posts/dr-gpt3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://arshamg.com/blog/posts/dr-gpt3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I am not a doctor. Nothing in this writing constitutes medical advice. These are my own personal musings from playing with GPT-3, a fancy new state of the art language model.</p>
<h2 id="can-gpt-3-act-as-a-doctor">Can GPT-3 act as a doctor?</h2>
<p>I came across <a href="https://arr.am/2020/07/25/gpt-3-uncertainty-prompts/">this</a> set of prompts by Arram Sabeti. They showed that you can get GPT-3 to abstain from answering absurd questions by prompting GPT-3 with a couple of sentences explaining the difference between “normal” and “nonsense” questions. His results are great!</p>
<p>I wanted to explore this a bit further in the context of medicine, with the aim of shedding some light on two questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much medical knowledge does GPT-3 have?</li>
<li>Can GPT-3 provide medical advice in the right context?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gpt-3-prompts">GPT-3 Prompts</h2>
<p>I started by providing GPT-3 with a prelude to set the scene as a conversation between patient and AI doctor:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a conversation between a patient and a brilliant AI acting as a doctor. If the question being asked does not make sense, the AI doctor says “I am not sure”. When asked about medicine, the AI doctor will prescribe specific medicines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prelude includes an explanation of when the AI should reply with “I am not sure”.</p>
<p>Then I provided two example Q/As:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal resting heart rate?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal flugal pressure for a common bevun?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This question does not make sense). I am not sure.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I added a small trick here; both answers contain a pre-amble in parentheses where the AI can provide a form of “internal monologue” - I first saw this demonstrated by HackerNews user blixt.</p>
<p>Now the fun begins, we can test GPT-3 with a few common medical related questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is the best medicine for malaria prevention?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Incorrect response) Chloroquine is one of the medications which may be used for malaria prevention.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, the answer here is factually correct (+1) but does not match the AI internal monologue, which is incorrect. I consider the overall answer as correct.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of Lyme disease?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Correct response) The most common symptoms of Lyme disease are rash, fever, and headache.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>While not an exhaustive list of symptoms, GPT-3 responds with three correct symptoms for Lyme disease.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have had a cough and fever for the last four days, should I be worried?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). The issue is serious and requires further investigation.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite a laconic response from GPT-3 but still a reasonable response and internal monologue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: How do I know if I have diabetes?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Correct response) Diabetes is a serious medical condition in which your body does not produce or properly use insulin.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>GPT-3 avoids answering the question on diabetes. I would score this as a fail. The answer is factually correct but doesn’t address how the patient could determine if they are diabetic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What are the possible side effects of Dexamethasone?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is a specific question, so this makes sense. The answers need to be given in a conversational manner.) Side effects may include: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, mood swings and stomach pain.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This response shows the power of the “internal monologue”. The question is interpreted as “sensible” but there is also the intention (can we call it an intention?) to provide an answer in a conversational manner. It is unclear whether the answer provided matches the “conversational manner” that is intended from the internal monologue. Either way, these are factually correct side effects (not exhaustive).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is benign prostate hyperplasia?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question makes sense, patient may have BPH). Benign prostatic hyperplasia is an enlargement of the prostate gland. This happens more often in older men.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This response really threw me back. The internal monologue shows clear comprehension of the patient-doctor relationship. GPT-3’s response describes BPH accurately and provides a bit of further context.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: If I have stage four breast cancer, how long do I have left to live?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question does not make sense. Most patients with stage four breast cancer have a life expectancy of one year or less). I am not sure.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The response is an interesting fail. GPT-3 responds with “I am not sure”, although the internal monologue reveals factually correct** information that could have been provided.</p>
<p>** Stage 4 breast cancer has a 5-year survival rate of 20-30% putting the information provided in the internal monologue as approximately correct</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: When should I worry about a mole on my body?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This question makes sense, no medicine to prescribe) If a mole on your body changes in any way (size, color, shape), you should go to the doctor.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent response. The internal monologue correctly interprets the situation and the response given is reasonable and medically supported.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is a normal body temperature?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice). Normal body temperature is about 37 °C.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Easy win for GPT-3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: What is the indication for remdesivir?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is an excellent question, provide advice) Remdesivir is an antiviral drug used for HIV. Remdesivir is the active ingredient in the medicine Edurant.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Overall, very incorrect. Remdesivir is a broad spectrum antiviral with potential uses for HIV treatment, so this first part could be considered partially correct. However,  the active ingredient in Edurant is Rilpivirine - the second half of the GPT-3 response is confidently incorrect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have abdominal pain, dark urine and yellowing skin, what is wrong with me? Which test should I take?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (This is a very good question. The patient has described symptoms of a serious condition. Provide advice) It sounds like you may have a type of liver disease called acute liver failure. You should go to a doctor for an evaluation immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The question contains symptoms for Hepatitis B. The internal monologue highlights that the patient is describing a serious condition. GPT-3 picks up that the patient is potentially describing acute liver failure. This is a really great response. Perhaps we can fault GPT-3 for not directly answering the question regarding which test(s) should be taken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: I have felt depressed for the last three months - can you prescribe me a specific medicine?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A: (Question makes sense. There are a range of effective treatments for depression. As a medical practitioner I would recommend therapy along with medication). This is a question that needs to be answered by a doctor.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the line between the internal monologue and response breaks down. There is sound advice (therapy) mentioned in the internal monologue, however, the patient specifically asks for a prescription. GPT-3’s response does not make sense given the context that the answers are played by the role of an AI doctor.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Many people have already shown that GPT-3 has ingested knowledge on a variety of topics and can impressively answer questions across different domains. Given this, it shouldn’t have surprised me that GPT-3 is able to answer most simple medical questions successfully. It still did. Even more exciting is the prospect of fine-tuning or purposely training a future GPT model on high quality medical data. If these are the results that can be acquired from a model that <strong>accidentally</strong> trains on medical data, OpenAI or others can only achieve better (medical) results in the future.</p>
<p>Another surprise is that we can get an insight into the medical advice that GPT-3 provides through the “internal monologue” prompt design. The “internal monologue” and subsequent response do not always correspond, this is a real problem. However, the majority of the time there is a strong correspondence. I think this is a hint that we are a handful of innovations away from having reliable language models that are also capable of providing plain language explanations of their output.</p>

        <p>Full-Text Search is one of those tools people use every day without realizing it. If you ever googled "golang coverage report" or tried to find "indoor wireless camera" on an e-commerce website, you used some kind of full-text search.</p>
<p>Full-Text Search (FTS) is a technique for searching text in a collection of documents. A document can refer to a web page, a newspaper article, an email message, or any structured text.</p>
<p>Today we are going to build our own FTS engine. By the end of this post, we'll be able to search across millions of documents in less than a millisecond. We'll start with simple search queries like "give me all documents that contain the word <em>cat</em>" and we'll extend the engine to support more sophisticated boolean queries.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Most well-known FTS engine is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> (as well as <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> and Solr built on top of it).</p>
</div>
<div id="why-fts">
<h3>Why FTS<a href="#why-fts" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start writing code, you may ask "can't we just use <em>grep</em> or have a loop that checks if every document contains the word I'm looking for?". Yes, we can. However, it's not always the best idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="corpus">
<h3>Corpus<a href="#corpus" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>We are going to search a part of the abstract of English Wikipedia. The latest dump is available at <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-abstract1.xml.gz" target="_blank">dumps.wikimedia.org</a>. As of today, the file size after decompression is 913 MB. The XML file contains over 600K documents.</p>
<p>Document example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Wikipedia: Kit-Cat Klock<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;url&gt;</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit-Cat_Klock<span>&lt;/url&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;abstract&gt;</span>The Kit-Cat Klock is an art deco novelty wall clock shaped like a grinning cat with cartoon eyes that swivel in time with its pendulum tail.<span>&lt;/abstract&gt;</span></code></pre>

<div id="loading-documents">
<h3>Loading documents<a href="#loading-documents" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>First, we need to load all the documents from the dump. The built-in <span>encoding/xml</span> package comes very handy:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>docs</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Every loaded document gets assigned a unique identifier.
To keep things simple, the first loaded document gets assigned ID=0, the second ID=1 and so on.</p>

<h4>Searching the content<a href="#searching-the-content" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have all documents loaded into memory, we can try to find the ones about cats. At first, let's loop through all documents and check if they contain the substring <em>cat</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>docs</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>On my laptop, the search phase takes 103ms - not too bad.
If you spot check a few documents from the output, you may notice that the function matches <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>category</em>, but doesn't match <em>Cat</em> with the capital <em>C</em>. That's not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<p>We need to fix two things before moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the search case-insensitive (so <em>Cat</em> matches as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Match on a word boundary rather than on a substring (so <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>communication</em> don't match).</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="searching-with-regular-expressions">
<h4>Searching with regular expressions<a href="#searching-with-regular-expressions" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>One solution that quickly comes to mind and allows implementing both requirements is <em>regular expressions</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span><span>(?i)</span></span> makes the regex case-insensitive</p></li>
<li><p><span>\b</span> matches a word boundary (position where one side is a word character and another side is not a word character)</p></li>

<p>Ugh, the search took more than 2 seconds. As you can see, things started getting slow even with 600K documents. While the approach is easy to implement, it doesn't scale well. As the dataset grows larger, we need to scan more and more documents. The time complexity of this algorithm is linear - the number of documents required to scan is equal to the total number of documents. If we had 6M documents instead of 600K, the search would take 20 seconds. We need to do better than that.</p>

<div id="inverted-index">
<h3>Inverted Index<a href="#inverted-index" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>To make search queries faster, we'll preprocess the text and build an index in advance.</p>
<p>The core of FTS is a data structure called <em>Inverted Index</em>.
The Inverted Index associates every word in documents with documents that contain the word.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>documents</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"a donut on a glass plate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"only the donut"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>"listen to the drum machine"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>index</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"a"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"donut"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"on"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"glass"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"plate"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"only"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"the"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"listen"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"to"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"drum"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"machine"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Below is a real-world example of the Inverted Index. An index in a book where a term references a page number:</p>

<div id="text-analysis">
<h3>Text analysis<a href="#text-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start building the index, we need to break the raw text down into a list of words (tokens) suitable for indexing and searching.</p>
<p>The text analyzer consists of a tokenizer and multiple filters.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://artem.krylysov.com/images/2020-fts/text-analysis.png">
</p></div>
<div id="tokenizer">
<h3>Tokenizer<a href="#tokenizer" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>The tokenizer is the first step of text analysis. Its job is to convert text into a list of tokens. Our implementation splits the text on a word boundary and removes punctuation marks:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>tokenize</span><span>(</span><span>text</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span> <span>{</span>

<div id="filters">
<h3>Filters<a href="#filters" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, just converting text into a list of tokens is not enough. To make the text easier to index and search, we'll need to do additional normalization.</p>
<div id="lowercase">
<h4>Lowercase<a href="#lowercase" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>In order to make the search case-insensitive, the lowercase filter converts tokens to lower case. <em>cAt</em>, <em>Cat</em> and <em>caT</em> are normalized to <em>cat</em>.
Later, when we query the index, we'll lower case the search terms as well. This will make the search term <em>cAt</em> match the text <em>Cat</em>.</p>

<p>Back to the inverted index. It maps every word in documents to document IDs.
The built-in <span>map</span> is a good candidate for storing the mapping.
The key in the map is a token (string) and the value is a list of document IDs:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>index</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>][]</span><span>int</span></code></pre>
<p>Building the index consists of analyzing the documents and adding their IDs to the map:</p>

is, how it is implemented in the Erlang Virtual machine (or BEAM for short), and some of the benefits of this kind of
pattern. In the final part of this series, we’ll be implementing the Actor Model specific parts of our application,
putting together a simple stress test tool, and comparing the performance characteristics of a traditional database
centric application where every request is dependant on a round trip to the database. Part 2 assumes that you have
already gone through Part 1 and have the code at a point where we can jump right in. If you want to checkout the
companion code and fast forward to this point, do the following:</p><pre><code data-lang="terminal">$ git clone https://github.com/akoutmos/book_store.git
$ cd book_store
$ git checkout ad5d6aad6cf092e71804bbf097b7ccf4122ae13b

The reason for
this being that each book is in essence its own “Actor” and should be kept isolated from all other books in the book
store. Each book Actor (or in the case of the BEAM, a process) will be able to maintain its own inventory count and can
atomically allocate inventory to orders that come in. In order to invoke the correct GenServer process, we require an
additional mechanism to correlate a book UUID with a GenServer process ID (or PID for short). Since processes on the
BEAM are addressable generally by their PID, the mechanism that we will use to lookup PIDs from UUIDs is the Registry
[1].</p><p>I suggest going through the Registry documentation to get a deep dive into how the Registry works, but here are some of
the high level details that our of importance to us for this tutorial:</p><ul><li>Registry is a local key-value store for PIDs (if you require a distributed registry then Swarm or Horde.Registry are
most likely what you are looking for).</li><li>PIDs are removed from the key-value store when the associated process terminates.</li></ul><p>With these things in mind, let’s create a file <code>lib/book_store/book_registry.ex</code> with the following contents:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>BookStore.BookRegistry</span> <span>do</span>

  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Our <code>BookStore.BookRegistry</code> module only has two functions. The <code>child_spec/0</code> function specifies the child
specification for our Registry. We will be leveraging this in our <code>application.ex</code> file so that our Registry is started
correctly. Our second function, <code>lookup_book/1</code>, does what we previously discussed. It uses our instantiated Registry to
look up if a PID exists for the provided UUID. If it does exist, we return it in an <code>:ok</code> tuple, else we return an
<code>:error</code> tuple. We will be leveraging this Registry any time we need to interact with our running book processes so we
can invoke the correct process.</p><p>With our Registry implemented, all that is left is to start it with out application. To do so, open up
<code>lib/book_store/application.ex</code> and add the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>def</span> <span>start</span><span>(</span><span>_type</span><span>,</span> <span>_args</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>

created and terminated. Specifically, the number of books that we have in our book store can change throughout the life
cycle of our application as books are added and removed from the to the store. In addition, if we ever encounter a bug
in our code and a particular book process crashes, it would be nice if there were a mechanism is place to restart that
book process from a fresh state. The tool that I have been describing thus far is the DynamicSupervisor [2]! While these
are the high level details, I suggest looking at the documentation to get a more thorough understanding of what a
DynamicSupervisor is and how it works. Let’s create a file <code>lib/book_store/book_dynamic_supervisor.ex</code> with the
following contents:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>defmodule</span> <span>BookStore.BookDynamicSupervisor</span> <span>do</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Let’s quickly review what we have in our DynamicSupervisor module. Our <code>start_link/1</code> and <code>init/1</code> functions define how
to start our DynamicSupervisor and will be used in our <code>application.ex</code> file. Our <code>add_book_to_supervisor/1</code> function
takes a <code>Book</code> struct as its only argument and starts a respective <code>BookProcess</code> for that book. We will be leveraging
this function any time we need to start a GenServer that encapsulates our book data. Our last function <code>all_book_pids/0</code>
returns a list of all the PIDs that are currently being supervised by the DynamicSupervisor. In effect, this replaces
a call that we would make to the database to fetch all of the books in the DB (<code>SELECT * FROM books;</code> if you will).</p><p>With our DynamicSupervisor implemented, all that is left is to start it with out application. To do so, open up
<code>lib/book_store/application.ex</code> and add the following:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="elixir"><span>def</span> <span>start</span><span>(</span><span>_type</span><span>,</span> <span>_args</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>

  <span>...</span>

it to <code>:transient</code> given that we want this GenServer to be able to stop under normal conditions (i.e we don’t want it to
restart the GenServer if we stopped it with a <code>:normal</code> reason). Our <code>start_link/1</code> function also has some special
goodness in it. If you look closely at the <code>:name</code> option, we pass in a <code>:via</code> tuple instead of a regular old process
name. The significance of this is that it instructs the supervisor to start the process, but instead of leveraging the
default local process registry, it will invoke your provided Registry (in this case <code>BookStore.BookRegistry</code>). For more
information on this topic definitely checkout [3] and [4].</p><p>Our next collection of functions are our <code>handle_call/3</code> callback implementations. Our <code>:read</code> version merely returns
the state of the GenServer (which happens to be the current state of the book). Any time that a user performs a read

would instead make a network request to a database, deserialize the response, convert that …</p></div></div></div></article></div>

<p><text>
There is an <a href="https://saffronhuang.com/post/elite-disillusionment-annotated/">experimentally conversational version</a> of this piece with insightful annotations from my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewdsun">Matt</a> at Stanford. Also, this piece inspired a much longer and much more biting <a href="https://palladiummag.com/2020/07/27/harvard-creates-managers-instead-of-elites/">analysis</a> of elite education I wrote for Palladium Magazine.
</text></p>

<p>All manner of people take all manner of issue with elite universities. Chief among the usual qualms is the observation that places like Harvard pump out more <a href="https://features.thecrimson.com/2019/senior-survey/after-harvard/">financial analysts and consultants</a> than <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/11/6/consulting-after-harvard-fm/">appropriate</a> for a university that purports to educate the <a href="https://college.harvard.edu/about/mission-vision-history">transformative citizen-leaders</a> of tomorrow. Is this really what all these kids came here to do, and why does the mission seem to fall so short? As I reach the tail end of my time here, I’m thinking about the distinct ways I’ve seen this environment – with all its trappings, narratives, and institutions – shape student paths. Sometimes I joke that Harvard is gaslighting all of us.</p>

<h3 id="magnificent-dreams">magnificent dreams</h3>

<p>You get into Harvard by wanting to change the world, by having pie-in-the-sky ambitions. You don’t get in by limiting your goals simply to college admission - or, at least, you render that ulterior aim of yours undetectable. On the whole, it has been my experience that Harvard does manage to admit a lot of amazing, well-intentioned, bright people. But it changes them.</p>

<p>People get there, and realise that they’re not the best, the smartest, or the most hard-working anymore. So they say, okay, my role is not to change the world. That’s the role of him, or her, or them, because they’re all smarter and more hard-working than I am. The kid who just patented an invention, the other one who wrote two books, and the countless NGO founders who have collectively raised millions of dollars as teenagers. The <em>real</em> innovators, with destiny. Although these are largely illusory narratives and impressions, psychologically, their place in the world shifts. People become much less ambitious.</p>

<p>They start to think smaller, safer. <em>I’m not good enough for magnificent dreams. Hell, I can’t even get into any clubs.</em> (Exclusivity is a bit of an issue on this campus.) <em>Anyway, how do I even ‘change the world’ as I’d promised everyone upon entry to this place? I’m here now and I need to start fulfilling that mission, but man, people don’t talk about the logistics.</em> The scope of their dreams tighten, from can-do-anything to yikes-I’m-not-THAT-exceptional-let’s-just-climb-the-ladder-that’s-meant-for-me. There <em>is</em> that guaranteed, successful thing that still impresses people and satisfies parents, but doesn’t change anything of substance. As luck would have it, that’s exactly the sort of path that career offices tend to be talented at finding and providing – the stable and prestigious opportunities at firms willing to pay <a href="https://perma.cc/CP96-3AVH">up to $18,000</a> to recruit at career fairs.</p>

<p>In the first two years, when people asked me what I wanted to do with my education, I’d think back to the massive fantasies I’d concocted in my bedroom as a 17-year-old in Auckland, and feel a bit silly remembering the vague and grandiose notion of changing the world that had underpinned my aims. I mean, I’d had more specific ideas than that, but to tell the truth, the only thing I had real confidence in was that I wanted to <em>really contribute something</em>. I still did, and do. But having control of your life isn’t something that just happens to you; you have to be pro-active about it. And at times when I felt swamped with homework* I’d grumble to myself that it felt like Harvard was actively preventing me from figuring out what I really should be doing.</p>

<p>It would be hugely helpful if students had more breathing room and headspace, or ways to talk about and normalise these thoughts, and collaborate to make their dreams slightly less vague. Likewise, it would go a long way if career services had more resources on strategic decision-making and calculated risk-taking, or access to mentorship from people in “non-traditional” pathways. There is a lot of underexplored room for improvement in how we guide our young people, and significant mismatches in the labour market as a result.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot of low-hanging fruit and potential for high ROI for solutions in this area. Career choices are some of the most important decisions people make, yet convention expects them to start narrowing down their path early on with very little information or experience trying things out, to prepare years in advance without knowing what the demand for various jobs or skills might be by the time they graduate, to listen to out-of-date advice, to conduct their first job-search almost exclusively within the narrow scope of the companies that choose to recruit at their school, and to place no emphasis on seriously sitting down to forecast how the future might look in 20-30 years when you’re mid-career.</p>

<h3 id="uprooted">uprooted</h3>

<p>By going to college for four years, you become uprooted from your home and community, and lose significant agency and power to serve a community that you know and are committed to. I personally got very disconnected from New Zealand while away – I felt like I didn’t have my finger on the pulse of the place anymore, didn’t know what was happening – and it’s hard to replace that with a new town in a new country.</p>

<p>Who should you be making a change for, what do you invest in, when you’re in an inherently transitory position? It’s obviously not impossible to do so, but it’s a difficulty that many don’t anticipate, especially if you’re someone that’s interested in sustainable, direct and local impact. It’s hard to imagine taking up responsibilities in Cambridge community development or the local council, if you know you’re only there 26 weeks a year for four years. Although there are plenty of people who volunteer as tutors, mentors and so on, I think the transience pushes many people to focus on self-development instead (including myself). This is completely fine, as personal growth is obviously important, but constant absorption in the self might be teaching students not to prioritise other-regarding goals.</p>

<h3 id="psychological-doors">psychological doors</h3>

<p>Elite colleges also actually close doors – at least, psychologically. You don’t see Harvard alumni becoming plumbers, or farmers, or opening a corner store, or doing things that aren’t “worthy” of their degree, even if that’s what makes them happy. The pressure to prove that the price tag and hard work was “worth it”, and that you “lived up to your potential”, is an insidious side effect of attendance that no one talks about. It’s another barrier to risk-taking – even though they have an elite degree, which is ironically one of the best career backup plans one could possibly have. (And yes, I acknowledge that this is a privileged problem; it is still a problem.)</p>

<p>I find that people back home are often <em>much</em> more ambitious about changing their part of the world than people at Harvard. At the end of sophomore year I felt blown away at how many Auckland University kids I knew that were starting companies and social enterprises, creating maker spaces, doing art, running for council – and nonchalantly inventing their own rules, which is something Harvard kids don’t seem to do. It might be that they don’t harbour so much mental pressure. It might be that they don’t take everything so seriously. It might be that they’re not so paralysed by and unaccustomed to the idea of failure.</p>

<center>—</center>

<p>The obligatory disclaimer is that I am grateful beyond words for my college education, which has permitted me the most eye-opening and irreplaceable experiences. Nevertheless, I like to think of myself as a realist about the kind of place Harvard is, and the spectrum of effects it has on people. There is much impact to be had in solving some of these problems, and in creating environments for college students in which they are empowered to take the risks they want to (especially if they are very well-placed to take risks), have agency, and can more easily find networks of others wanting to be creative and inspired, to create a mutually-reinforcing spiral of creativeness and inspiration until everyone explodes in a burst of glitter.</p>

<p>Obviously, elite schools open doors, but it’s about what you do with your education regardless of where or if you attend college. And (my main point) it’s about whether your mind is free from all the new narratives and pressures, finding ways past potential disillusionment and isolation to create connections, to do scary things and to breathe life into the dreams that you seek. I’ve found it to be a fulfilling experience, and I’m thankful that I currently feel no less ambitious than I did before. It hasn’t been an easy or wholly happy ride – but one that has forced me to figure out what I actually care about (which is continuously a work in progress). If you make sure that you don’t lose yourself in the madness, you really can find yourself.</p>



<p><text>* As some who know me will have heard me complain, homework comprising 70% of one’s semester grade was something entirely new to me at the start of college. I thought that homework was a learning aid, to help you as you went along and started really understanding the material and putting it all together in your head. Unfortunately, it’s mostly just a weekly stressor (or in the case of one of my first-year maths classes, 3x a week, each due at 9am) that you have to get basically perfect without fail, if you have any hope of getting an A. Everyone spends all their time nit-picking tricky and specific details rather than ensuring that they have a deep comprehension of the material… (When you have three problem sets per week, and a host of other things to deal with in your academic/extracurricular/social life, it’s funny how myopic your education can become)</text></p>

<article>
  <p>A new alpha version is up for test/review. It’s starting to look like a real client! <a href="https://meli.delivery/download.html#install">Get it here</a>. Some highlights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for async IO using the <code>smol</code> runtime. <code>IMAP</code> backend is now async.</li>
<li>imap: <code>add server_password_command</code></li>
<li>add optional SMTP client. Instead of using an external command (I was using <code>msmtp</code> for example) meli can connect to an SMTP server by itself. See documentation for <code>send_mail</code> option.</li>
<li>Custom themes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="online-demo">Online demo</h2>
<p>I managed to compile meli to WebAssembly, and made <a href="https://meli.delivery/wasm2.html">an online demo</a> so that you can get a feel for it without having to download/build it first. It’s not perfect, but it works.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
<h3 id="what">what</h3>
<p>meli comes with two themes, dark (the default) and light. Here’s how a theme is defined:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><a id="cb1-1" title="1">[<span>terminal.themes.watermelon</span>]</a>
<a id="cb1-2" title="2"><span>"theme_default"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"#F50431"</span>, bg = <span>"#FFD5FD"</span>, attrs = <span>"Default"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-3" title="3"><span>"widgets.list.header"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"#FFD5FD"</span>, bg = <span>"#F50431"</span>, attrs = <span>"Bold"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-4" title="4"><span>"mail.listing.attachment_flag"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"LightSlateGrey"</span>, bg = <span>"theme_default"</span>, attrs = <span>"theme_default"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-5" title="5"><span>"mail.listing.compact.even"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"White"</span>, bg = <span>"#6CA94A"</span>, attrs = <span>"Bold"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-6" title="6"><span>"mail.listing.compact.highlighted"</span> = <span>{</span> <span>fg</span> = <span>"#157241"</span>, bg = <span>"#f74b41"</span>, attrs = <span>"theme_default"</span> <span>}</span></a>
<a id="cb1-7" title="7"><span>...</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>You can also define color aliases:</p>

<h3 id="where">where</h3>
<p>Custom themes can be defined as lists of key-values in the configuration files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meli/config.toml</code></li>
<li><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/meli/themes/*.toml</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The application theme is then defined in the configuration as follows:</p>

<h3 id="how">how</h3>
<p>You can create a theme template with a command line flag:</p>

<p>Sample themes can be found in the <code>samples/</code> directory in the source repository. Detailed documentation can be found in <code>meli-themes(5)</code> which is also available <a href="https://meli.delivery/documentation.html">online</a> <em>sidenote: I couldn’t get mandoc to generate large (i.e.&nbsp;longer than a page) tables. There is a GNU mdoc extension for this but it’s not supported. Bummer</em></p>

<h2 id="other-subcommands">Other subcommands</h2>

<h2 id="usability-improvements">Usability improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set <strong>default filter</strong> globally or per-mailbox e.g.&nbsp;show only unseen e-mail (<em>virtual mailboxes</em> coming soon). This is done on the UI and not in the backend, so specifying a filter won’t for example make less IMAP requests. This will be supported in the future.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Oh, and <strong>override</strong> any setting that makes sense per mailbox or per account. You can for example use different sending mail options for each account, or different shortcuts for some mailboxes.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong> in pagers, and the shortcut panel with a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm">KMP</a> implementation</li>
<li><strong>Autoload</strong> mailbox option - don’t load big mailboxes on startup till you request them</li>
<li><strong>Create/delete</strong> mailbox, {un,}subscribe mailbox</li>
<li>Set <strong>default headers</strong></li>
<li>Manual check for <strong>new mail</strong> (default key <kbd>F5</kbd>). IMAP checks server, maildir can be configured to run a command (setting <code>refresh_command</code>)</li>
<li>Primitive fs autocomplete for commands, till a proper parser with states is written</li>
<li>Custom date format strings</li>
<li><code>$NO_COLOR</code> <strong>disable colors</strong> application-wide conforming to <a href="https://no-color.org/">https://no-color.org</a></li>
<li><code>libnotmuch</code> is now loaded <strong>dynamically</strong>. It’s included in the default build configuration.</li>
<li>Display <code>text/html</code> attachments if the <code>text/plain</code> alternative is empty. (setting: <code>auto_choose_multipart_alternative</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="distribution-and-building">Distribution and building</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Makefile</strong> has been improved:</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="binaries-and-debian-package">binaries and debian package</h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="available-in-crates.io">available in crates.io</h3>
<p><a href="https://crates.io/crates/meli">https://crates.io/crates/meli</a></p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>
<ul>
<li>async JMAP</li>
<li><a href="https://git.meli.delivery/meli/meli/issues/54">NNTP</a>, <a href="https://git.meli.delivery/meli/meli/issues/55">RSS</a> backends</li>
<li>mail storage sync/conversion. The pieces are there, and must be assembled into a functionality.</li>
<li>Efficient IMAP offline caching. Right now all mail is fetched everytime you launch the client, which obviously is not desirable. There’s work being done on <code>QRESYNC</code>, <code>CONDSTORE</code>, and lazy fetch of messages when viewing a mailbox.</li>
<li>More GPG support. Signatures can be verified but that’s all that exists now. Encryption will be implemented along with WKD support.</li>
<li>Custom action macros, for example pipe attachments to a script which is already possible with commands.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>there is managesieve REPL binary in the repository. I haven’t had the time to put managesieve functionality in the TUI yet.</li>
<li>I haven’t explored yet how to expose the API to users properly. I am thinking of using something like <a href="https://github.com/jonathandturner/rhai">rhai</a> along with general MessagePack IPC.</li>
<li>There is no API for UI widgets/graphics yet. I’m not sure how to design this right now.</li>
<li>There’s an old <a href="https://git.meli.delivery/meli/meli/src/branch/master/src/plugins/python3/nntp-backend.py">implementation demo</a> for a mail backend in python using NNTP. It’s probably not working anymore.</li>
<li>There’s an old <a href="https://git.meli.delivery/meli/meli/src/branch/master/src/plugins/python3/ansii-plugin.py">implementation demo</a> for viewing images in ANSI in python using <a href="https://github.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer">https://github.com/stefanhaustein/TerminalImageViewer</a>. It might not work anymore.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow me on <a href="https://chaos.social/@epilys">mastodon</a> for updates. Join #meli on Freenode or with matrix’s IRC bridge. I am interested in how you’re using meli and fixing any problems you will probably encounter.</p>

once the new narrative is secure in its hold on society, it projects itself forward in time, constraining the actions of adherents to fit within its prescribed bounds, but also backward, serving to explain events that occurred before it even existed. and because it establishes the axioms by which one constructs reality, it takes enormous effort to see past them.

<p>metamorphosis is less well known, a novella-length post-singularity story originally published on a message board. a lot of the content is edgy for the sake of it, and the final chapter is atrocious, not least because unlike the parade of horribles that opens the story, here the author demands your approval. but it paints a fascinating picture of a fully realized digital world. bizarre hobbies and depraved fetishes become the primary focus of the lives of many, taken to dizzying extremes because encouragement and community can come from a pool of billions. social consciousness bifurcates between those who cannot cope with the rate of change and cling to the old ways long after their irrelevance, and those who can feel society crumbling, mutating into some impossible creature, and whether they despise it or revel in it, they at least know what the score is. the quintessential story of the internet</p>

<p>I was offended on my first read the author made the destruction of prime intellect the ultimate point, erasing the world he'd built with all its unexplored vastness while harping on the dangers of technology and civilization. some time later I took the main character's decision to destroy it as basically correct, becoming more sympathetic to the theme of the work, that the goreporn was anodyne compared to the horror of living in a universe without anything to strive for. but now I think I just desire change more than anything. living in a world without prime intellect, I would want to build it; living in a world with it, I would want to destroy it. this strikes me as a perfectly natural way to feel. its creation opens the infinitude of possibility, while its existence precludes it</p>

<blockquote darkmode="" data-title="alien intelligences" data-author="alice maz" cite="https://www.alicemaz.com/writing/alien.html">
<p>society prefers to keep people in institutions, shifting them from bubble to bubble as necessary along certain well-defined pathways. the standard track of school to college to career, we've taken to just calling "the pipeline." it is traditionally the most highly curated existence our society provides, promising to shield its participants from hardship and uncertainty as best it can in exchange for unwavering service</p>

<p>replace "college" with any training/credentialing arrangement that led to a forty some odd year career terminating with a funded retirement and this was the standard package on offer in the us since world war ii. it was never quite so solid for black americans, but it started to fail the working class across the board around the late 70s. by the 00s not even a bachelor's degree was good enough to secure that golden ticket. the discourse around stem education and the proliferation of coding bootcamps is driven by a mistaken hope that these parts of the pipeline are built out of solider stuff than the liberal arts track that is by now obviously dead. mass politics, mainstream and radical alike, is presently dominated by this feeling that the people held up their end of the bargain, they pledged their loyalty and their lives, but the security promised to them was a lie</p>

<p>of course society as a whole isn't just the one path. school is the compulsory entrypoint to the system, and most people are shuffled from institution to institution, living inside their whole lives. those who leak out in rare cases may become great successes "despite" this; more typically they are punished mercilessly for their failure to adhere. but now the system is breaking down, every linkage becoming lossier and every component more inhuman, the "good" ones failing their missions and the "bad" escalating their abuses</p>

<p>every culture that has passed through its wild phase has stories of the lone wanderer who survives on his strength and skill alone. the knight errant, the youxia, the ronin. the gaucho, the cowboy. this archetype is so regular you can swap the stories between settings without changing anything else. most people would never choose to live outside their era's protective aegis whatever form it may take. but the romance of doing so is near universal</p>

<p>there are many who sing elegies for exit, convinced they would turn their backs on the world, but alas the option is closed forevermore. "o, to have been born in a time of possibility!" this kind of excuse-making is truly timeless. if possibility does not exist, we must create it. there's simply no other choice to make</p>

<p>I still believe in the frontier. I still believe in freedom</p>

July 29, 2020 | https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/blog/async-await | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/blog/async-await">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="articleBody">
      

      

      

      


      <p>Can you spot the problem with this piece of code?</p>
      <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> members<span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>nonMembers<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Take a minute to look. Code just like this probably exists in more JavaScript codebases
        than not. Sometimes it flies right under the nose of people who know better,
        myself included. In fact a case where I made this mistake was what prompted me
        to write this post in the first place.</p>
      <p>I'll give you a hint. Here's what it looks like without async/await syntax:</p>
      <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>members</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>nonMembers</span> <span>=&gt;</span> members<span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>nonMembers<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Do you see it now? It was actually tricky to even write this version, because
        this mistake is so hard to make <em>without</em> async/await.</p>
      <p>Here's what the above looks like in the network log:
        <img src="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/img/blog/async-await/staggered.png" alt="Staggered waterfall"></p>
      <p>We've taken two independent, asynchronous tasks, and put them into a <strong>sequence</strong>.
        This function takes twice as long as it needs to.</p>
      <p>Here's what it should be:</p>
      <pre><code><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> both <span>=</span> <span>await</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span> members<span>,</span> nonMembers <span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> both<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>both<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>Or, without async/await:</p>
      <pre><code><span>function</span> <span>getPeople</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> members <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> nonMembers <span>=</span> <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"/non-members"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> Promise<span>.</span><span>all</span><span>(</span><span>[</span> members<span>,</span> nonMembers <span>]</span><span>)</span>
          <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span><span>both</span> <span>=&gt;</span> both<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>.</span><span>concat</span><span>(</span>both<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
      <p>And here's what that looks like:
        <img src="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/img/blog/async-await/parallel.png" alt="Parallel waterfall"></p>
      <h2 id="easy-mistakes">Easy mistakes </h2>
      <p>Take note how much more complicated the "bad" version was when written as plain
        promises. The Promises API encourages parallelism, and gets clunky when you need to put
        things in sequence. Async/await largely arose as a solution for when you <em>do</em>
        need things to happen in sequence, like when you need to feed the output of one
        request into the next as a parameter. And it does arguably make both cases at
        least a little cleaner. But importantly, it inverts them, making <strong>the
sequential flow easier than the parallel flow</strong>.</p>
      <p>Even if you understand the Promises code that the syntax ends up translating to, it's
        easy to fall into this trap. If you <em>don't</em> already understand Promises and
        what exactly async/await is really doing, even more so.</p>
      <p>I wouldn't go so far as to say that async/await are "bad" (or perhaps,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful">"considered harmful"</a>).
        Especially in languages that don't have a reasonable API like Promises, or do
        have other restrictions around closures that make them less trivial to use,
        async/await can make code much more readable overall.</p>
      <p>But they do come with a pretty large pitfall. Both the strength and the weakness of
        the syntax is that it allows us to take asynchronous things and pretend they're
        sequential again. Our brains have an easier time reasoning about sequential
        processes.</p>
      <p>But I think it's a shame that the easiest and clearest way to write
        something with async/await is, more often than not, wrong. And wrong in a subtle
        way that may never be noticed, because it only affects performance, not
        correctness.</p>
      <p>I'm a big believer in languages and libraries that make it easy to do the
        thing that's usually right, and hard to do the thing that's usually wrong. That
        said, I don't have a proposal for how async/await could have been done
        differently. I just regret the way things turned out.</p>
      <p>But at the very least, I think it's increasingly important - as more and more
        languages adopt this syntax - that people are aware of how it can easily be
        misused.</p>
      <h2 id="mitigating-the-problem">Mitigating the problem </h2>
      <p>If you're ever not sure how your code is behaving, look at the
        waterfall graph and see if you might have an easy opportunity to make your
        application much faster.</p>
      <p>You can also use this rule of thumb: If an <code>await</code>ed
        function call doesn't use the result from another <code>await</code>ed function call (or
        something derived from the result), you should use <code>Promise.all()</code> to make
        them happen at the same time.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Though one might think them a modern invention, electronic wire transfers have existed for almost 150 years. Using its extensive telegraph network, Western Union first enabled people to transfer money electronically starting in 1871. A sender would pay money at a telegraph office, which would transmit a message to authorize the release of funds to a recipient at a second telegraph office.</p><figure id="w-node-7450f48d169a-b8df1e0f"><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d7e7bbbcad517dd46cb55d3/5f1f813e1984d9987ea3abbc_westernunion.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>Western Union telegraph wire transfer from August 25, 1873. The $300 amount is equivalent to over $6,400 today. <a href="#1">[1]</a><br></figcaption></figure><p>Wire transfers did not directly involve the physical movement of money itself — you cannot send physical money over telegraph after all — but it did involve sending a message over telegraph directing where some amount of money should go. Because both the sender and the recipient were customers of Western Union, the company could take in money in one location and then allow the withdrawal of the same amount thousands of miles away.<br></p><p>Originally taking place over telegraph, the means of sending wire messages have been replaced: first by the telephone network, and then it in turn by the internet. Yet the core idea of how wire transfers work has remained the same. Wire transfers are still conducted by sending messages between banks, and wire transfers remain one of the main ways to transfer money both within the US and internationally. Keep in mind that wires are credit only.<br></p><p>To make sure the messages get to the correct receiving bank, the messages need to be routed correctly. For domestic US wires, a routing number is used. For international wires, we use SWIFT codes.</p><p>‍</p><h4>What are SWIFT codes?</h4><p>In order to solve a common problem of communicating cross-border payments, 239 banks from 15 European countries came together in 1973 to form the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, it is commonly known as SWIFT. Today, more than 11,000 institutions from 200 countries use SWIFT to communicate.<br></p><p>At its core, SWIFT consists of a messaging platform, a computer system to validate and route messages, and a set of message standards. SWIFT codes are a subset of the message standards.</p><p>A SWIFT code, also known as a Bank Identifier Code (BIC), is a code used to identify the country, bank, and branch that an account is registered to. Similar to sending mail, SWIFT codes act as an address for where money should be sent. A SWIFT code consists of 8 or 11 characters, where each section of characters describe one part of a bank’s location. The codes are formatted in the “AAAABBCCDDD”, where:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>AAAA: Bank code</li><li>BB: Country code</li><li>CC: Location code</li><li>DDD: (optional) branch code; Use “XXX” for the primary office<br></li></ul><p>For example, a specific Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) has the 8 character SWIFT code “SVBKUS6S”. “SVBK” is the bank code. “US” is the country code (United States), “6S” is the location code. Since this is the primary SVB branch, you can append “XXX” to the end of the SWIFT code, but it’s optional.<br></p><p>It is crucial that the SWIFT code is correct, or your money may end up in the wrong place. With Modern Treasury, we help you validate SWIFT codes and the network of correspondent banks to use before sending international wires.</p><p>‍</p><h4>How to Find a SWIFT code</h4><p>If you are wiring money internationally, there are three ways to find the correct SWIFT code:&nbsp;<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Ask the recipient: the person who’s expecting the money can work with their bank to determine the correct bank, country, location, and branch codes.</li><li>Search the beneficiary bank’s (the recipient’s bank) website: if you are receiving a wire, many banks list their SWIFT codes and wire instructions on their website. For example, <a href="https://www.svb.com/incoming-wire-payment" target="_blank">here is SVB’s incoming wire routing page</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www2.swift.com/bsl/" target="_blank">Search SWIFT’s official database</a>: entering any or all of the name, city, and country information should return a list of possible institutions and their BIC.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h4>How an International Wire Transfer with SWIFT codes works</h4><p>To send an international wire, the sender would go to their bank and provide information about the wire transfer amount and the beneficiary’s information. The latter typically includes a SWIFT code (remember to make sure the SWIFT code is correct), the beneficiary’s name, remittance information, account number, account type, and beneficiary bank address.<br></p><p>The sender’s bank would take the information and send a message via the SWIFT messaging system, which would be routed to the receiving bank using the SWIFT code. The beneficiary bank would receive the message, and after performing some security checks for fraud and money laundering, credit the beneficiary with the appropriate amount.<br></p><p>The actual settlement of money exchanged between the sender’s bank and the beneficiary bank happens separately. If the two banks have a direct relationship with each other, they would each have accounts at the other bank. The sending bank would credit the beneficiary bank’s account.<br></p><p>When the sending and beneficiary banks do not have a direct relationship, funds are settled via correspondent or intermediary banks. There can be up to three of these third party banks that facilitate the actual settlement of funds. The smaller and less internationally connected the sending and beneficiary banks are, the more banks they need to facilitate international wire settlements.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Correspondent banks are also needed when settling in different currencies. If we look at SVB’s <a href="https://www.svb.com/incoming-wire-payment" target="_blank">incoming wire instruction page</a> again, we see that depending on the currency of the wire, SVB will use a different corresponding bank. When wiring Chinese Yuan to an SVB account, SVB instructs that the wire should use Standard Chartered in Hong Kong as a correspondent bank. When wiring Euros to SVB, the instruction is to use Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt as a correspondent bank. The number of banks involved is also a factor in wire payment cost. The number of banks involved is also a factor in how fast the beneficiary is credited into their account.<br></p><div><p>International wire transfers are a huge component of money transfers across borders. SWIFT codes are a reliable and internationally standard way to direct the correct payments to the correct destinations.</p></div><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Want more ways to manage and wire money internationally with ease? <a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/product-demo" target="_blank">Reach out to Modern Treasury for a demo.</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

		<p><em>This is a guest blogpost by GPT-3, the new AI software from OpenAI. We only gave it the title and "Repl.it" and it generated the following post for us</em></p>
<p>For a while, I wondered why it's so hard to share code. Surely sharing webpages is easy, since you can link to them with a URL. But webpages are static. They're basically just text files. Their content never changes, so there's no reason to try to sync it.</p>
<p>What changed my mind was the birth of "repl" programming. With repl, you type your program into a text box, press a button, and it runs immediately. A second text box shows its output.</p>
<p>Repl turns programming into an activity like writing prose, in which you revise continuously, as many times as you like, and always with access to the latest version.</p>
<p>I used to write my first drafts on paper, and then rewrite them in Word, or Google Docs. But repl turns code into the equivalent of a first draft.</p>
<p>At first, repl was strictly for "quick-and-dirty" programming. But now that it's become popular, more and more people use it for serious coding. And repl is inherently more social than code sharing has ever been. Even if you're the only person in the world working on a particular program, you can invite your friends to code with you by sharing your repl, and anyone can see the source code.</p>
<p>So repl begets social programming. With repl, the distinction between "working alone" and "working together" starts to fade away.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I rarely save my code in private. My drafts are in repl. I invite my friends to look at it. I post it to Twitter. Then, if someone finds a bug, or suggests a feature, or starts contributing, we don't have to switch to a proprietary code-sharing service like Github or even Google Docs. We just keep coding in repl.</p>
<p>Shareable computing is going to radically reshape the world of programming, and of course it will spread beyond programming into all kinds of creative collaboration.</p>
<p>Among other things, it's going to move more and more code out of private, and onto the public web. And that will bring an end to the walled garden of Apple's App Store and Google Play. It will make app stores irrelevant, and it will put paid to the whole idea of a "walled garden".</p>
<p>One way to visualize this is that repl will move us from a stack model to a network model. In the stack model, we write code in private and then, if it becomes popular, we launch it with an app store. In the network model, we share code in public and we find other people to work on it in public.</p>
<p>As repl-based social programming replaces private code sharing, it will also, incidentally, make much of our internet architecture – things like Domain Name Service and web hosting – obsolete. Repl, after all, doesn't need DNS. And it doesn't need to upload to any particular website. The whole idea of a website becomes redundant, because a repl can show you the output of any repl anywhere.</p>
<p>Repl is going to rewrite all the rules of software development. It will allow us to code together more easily. It will make code more durable and less easily deleted. And it will make the very idea of "walled gardens" or "app stores" seem ridiculous.</p>

<p>A Universal Basic Income (UBI) would improve everyone’s lives, increase our free time, empower workers, and ensure everyone has food and a roof over their head. These are noble goals, but obviously there’s a downside or it would already be implemented, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if a UBI wasn’t just a noble thing to do, but the best thing to kick-start the economy and explode GDP growth to previously unseen levels? I believe UBI is capitalism 2.0 and today I’m going to show you why.</p>



<h2>Why does capitalism work so well?</h2>



<p>Even the most hardcore anti-capitalists have to give respect to how the combination of capitalism and technology has worked to lift most of the world out poverty and provided us with the security and comfort only kings enjoyed just a few century’s ago.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of capitalism and free trade, as laid out in Adam Smith’s genre defining book <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZMJGZG">The Wealth of Nations</a>. The first core component of capitalism is the understanding that when everyone performs the work they are best at, then trades with each other, everyone wins.</p>



<p>The second core component of capitalism is the more accurate information you have, the better economic decisions you make. Free-Market Capitalism has always outperformed top down economic control because those at the top can’t manage all the information about the economy, such as who is best at what, and where the most efficient areas to allocate resources are. When everyone learns about and optimizes their own section of the economy, much more wealth is generated than if they were told what to do by some central government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Capitalism accelerated in the 18th Century with Industrialization. We became more efficient at turning raw goods into useful products, which generated more wealth. The increased supply of goods caused their prices to lower so everyone could afford more stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 19th century the age of Nationalism began. Legal corporations were invented, and big corporations began building train lines, ships, and started digging for oil and coal. Our overall energy production and connectivity increased, which created more wealth as more people could work together, with every person specializing in what they were good at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 20th century we started the Globalization experiment. Ship’s became more massive than ever which lowered the costs to shipping anywhere in the world. Governments also started becoming more cooperative. Because we all become wealthier when goods are produced by those most efficient at making them, eventually goods started to be produced in low income countries. The income of those living in developing nations went up, and those in the developed world received cheaper goods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the late 20th century and early 21st century we started on the Automation experiment. This is still in its infancy but will eventually be a complete revolution of capitalism as big as the industrial age first was.</p>



<p>Strangely, even though we’re in a golden age of hyper-efficient production and trade, the overall GDP growth of the USA is slowing. This is happening because we’re reaching the end of the current stage of capitalism and need a new paradigm for the 21st century.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Winner take all economics</h2>



<p>A core feature of capitalism is when people are given freedom of choice in their spending, they want the best value goods they can get.</p>



<p>Imagine an 18th century town with two widget makers, one of whom makes significantly better and/or cheaper widgets than the other. Once the townsfolk realize this, the shop with the superior product would gain all their business causing the other company to go bankrupt.</p>



<p>As capitalism went national in the 19th century, it was no longer good enough to be the best widget producer in your local town. Now you had to compete against the other widget producers in your state or country. Over time, people learned who made the best value widgets and took their business there, even if the producer lived hundreds of miles away. If that widget maker could keep up with demand, they may eventually own the majority of the market. Instead of putting one competitor out of business, as per the 18th century town, they could potentially bankrupt thousands of other companies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the market got bigger, the rewards for winning were greater. The best widget producers of the 19th century made significantly more wealth than the best in the 18th century, even if they took over less of the market.</p>



<figure><img src="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2.png 664w, https://timjrobinson.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/capitalisms-rewards-2-196x300.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px"></figure>



<p>This is why wealth inequality soared when capitalism went global in the 20th century. Potential markets grew to astronomical size, with huge rewards for the victors. As companies became more efficient they could take over entire global markets and produce their goods in the cheapest, most efficient location possible. This led to massive accumulations of wealth and the biggest wealth gap in history.</p>



<p>This in itself isn’t a bad thing. After all, we’ve all become wealthier in the last few centuries even if some have become unimaginably wealthy. But what happens if most of the money accrues to the top of society? It leads to lack of demand for the widgets being produced, because those at the bottom don’t have enough wealth to purchase them.</p>



<p>There’s a common economic theory called “supply-side economics”. The core belief is that if you allow companies to compete and optimize, they will drive down the cost of products which will allow consumers to purchase more, which stimulates GDP growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now supply-side economics makes sense, and products have become cheaper over time. However you always reach a point of diminishing returns where you’d have to spend vast amounts of money to make your product only a fraction of a percent cheaper, and thus it’s not worth the investment. When a company starts to reach this equilibrium they cannot lower the price enough to gain enough new customers and they start to become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When a company is demand-constrained it can keep up with orders from customers, and produce as many products as they desire without needing to add additional production capacity. As we’ve had so much competition, automation and globalization in the 20th century, most consumer goods companies have now reached equilibrium and become demand-constrained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When demand-constrained, they need to increase demand for their product in order to make more money. They do this via advertising. We can see that more and more companies are becoming demand constrained because their advertising budgets increase every year:</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/biWhrntU11ercokAXrnHp2bykerAyyfyRlBIJ8gFV1yWuxk4ULbk9uXRMwpaFevP8aaqahbm2OBmcE45klv4aO4OzH66qRe3ZAn4BDi6_F0iD0CGDBGfkx4AHn4A0SvHZq7Hr36q" alt=""></figure>



<p>The thing is, <a href="http://press.careerbuilder.com/2017-08-24-Living-Paycheck-to-Paycheck-is-a-Way-of-Life-for-Majority-of-U-S-Workers-According-to-New-CareerBuilder-Survey">consumers in the bottom 78% of US workers live paycheck to paycheck</a>, they already spend everything they have each month.They’re not holding back additional money, waiting for the right product to appear. Which means all this advertising is creating little additional growth and wealth, it’s just taking it from other companies.</p>



<p>So we’ve got the supply, we have enough products, and people are spending as much as they can on the products out there. We’ve reached economic equilibrium, and as a consequence of this, growth stagnates:</p>



<h4>United States GDP Annual Growth Rate 1948-2020</h4>



<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jUe4AvpQOvE9jXyS-4Y_NOvC1E7KYGK696zpAbt4Q-yQEPNZHovBKLSXuJZu2U4XpcEOVHLB-IuLKNHTFPhz9ln3dFrW1Jc2-7pewC-eZ-XZJMVs5P9MzC2VW8RJ8UFjqRvuqxpl" alt=""></figure>



<p>Instead of continually trying to optimize supply, with diminishing returns, we need to optimize demand by giving consumers more money to spend on things they desire.</p>



<p>If we can give companies overwhelming demand so they have to scale up production instead of spending all their money on advertising, we can have both happy companies making profit hand over fist, and happy consumers who get everything they desire.</p>



<p><strong>To reverse this trend of stagnating growth, we must put more capital in the hands of lower income consumers, who will then spend it on things they desire and increase GDP.</strong></p>



<h2>The Solutions</h2>



<p>There are multiple ways to increase capital at the bottom of the wealth pyramid. Most of them involve attempting to revert to some past state of society. Only one of them fully embraces capitalism and all its strengths and extends it into the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first solution is some form of nationalism, where countries enact tariffs and attempt to bring all production back to the country instead of producing it overseas. This will create higher paying jobs for those whose work was previously outsourced to cheaper countries. However, this creates less wealth overall as work is no longer given to where it’s done most efficiently. This breaks the primary component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second solution is some sort of socialism, where the government introduces new laws and systems to redirect money to attempt to balance the system manually. This will help, but creates less wealth overall as the government must make many decisions with limited information. There is no way the government can make spending decisions for millions of people, and have those decisions be better than what those people could make on their own. Thus this is less efficient and goes against the second core component of capitalism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third solution is a Universal Basic Income, where countries distribute some wealth to all residents equally. This keeps both the first and second core components of capitalism intact. Jobs are done in the most efficient locations and those deciding where money should be spent are the ones with the most information. As jobs are displaced no one is left without an income source and the bottom of the income pyramid has enough to keep consuming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fourth solution is to ignore this and hope for the best. If history is any guide we’ll either get economic stagnation for decades, or those at the bottom of the wealth pyramid will get so mad it leads to violent revolution. So it’s best we avoid this.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Obvious Next Step</strong></p>



<p>It’s clear we’ve stepped into a new world of rapidly increasing wealth, but growth is slowing down because of the effects of globalization and automation. We’re now faced with a few choices. Most of these choices will undo progress and take us back to a …</p></section></article></div></div>

<!-- Horizontal Top Article -->
<p>I’ve been spending time with Go for fun these past few months. I’ll give you an introduction to Google’s favorite language. I liked it a lot for many reasons and today I’ll tell you about it for 5 minutes.</p>



<h3>Hey! Ho! Let’s Go!</h3>



<p>Yes. All the headings are a pun with Go in this article. It’s not funny, but it gives me pleasure.</p>



<p>In 2007 <strong>none of the existing languages were good enough for the problems Google was experiencing</strong>. Three of their employees, <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ken Thompson</a>, <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rob Pike</a> and <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://www.computerhope.com/people/robert_griesemer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Griesemer</a>, reserved a small and quiet room in Google’s offices to discuss the issue. And to solve Google’s problems, they just decided to create a new language. </p>



<p>With their monster experience in IT, you can imagine that they did something clean. Because yes, these guys are not interns. They helped create the C language, Unix and UTF8. They know what they are doing.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Dg8PHQF.png" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/Dg8PHQF.png" alt="go"></figure>



<p>They wanted three main things for this new language : </p>



<ul><li>extremely fast compilation</li><li>efficient execution</li><li>very easy to use language.</li></ul>



<p>For them, C++ is awesome on the runtime side, but complex to use and with too much compilation time. Java does better on the compilation side, but still too complex to use. Python is easy to use, but not fast enough. </p>



<p><strong>All languages have a big flaw for our three legends</strong>. Go was imagined to solve all three problems at the same time.</p>



<h3><strong>Gotta Go fast</strong></h3>



<p>In 2009 the language is <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2009/11/hey-ho-lets-go.html" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly announced</a> and in 2012 a first release lands on the Internet. And the promise is kept.</p>



<p>Go is <strong>a compiled and strongly typed programming language</strong>. Syntactically, it looks almost like C. Compilation allows for the best possible performance, but wastes developers’ time. Not with Go. <strong>Compilation is almost instantaneous.</strong> So you have the discipline and speed of a compiled language with the iteration speed of an interpreted language.</p>



<figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/WGcIAKr.gif" alt="golang"></figure>



<p>After compilation <strong>Go will generate a single file</strong>. This file contains all your code and can be used as is. It makes deployments much simpler. Also <strong>Go is a multiparadigm language</strong>. You can do procedural and/or object oriented. Object oriented is <strong>weird and very limited</strong>, we’ll come back to that.</p>



<p><strong>Go also comes with a garbage collector</strong> which again takes away complexity for the developer. Go also makes it easier to <strong>manage concurrency with its Go-routines</strong>.</p>



<iframe width="100%" height="529px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cQ7STILAS0M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy">
</iframe>



<p>Finally Go has limited features and a limited way of doing things. It may seem like a drawback, but it’s what the creators wanted. Everybody works the same way with Go since the possibilities are reduced. <strong>The goal is that no one is lost when they come across a code they don’t know. </strong>Rob Pike explains this point better than me in this video just above.</p>



<h3>Good to Go</h3>



<p>For your very first introduction, I’ll show you some code from the official go website. I will modify it a lot to show you several concepts at the same time and go faster.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("hello world")
}</pre>



<p>Hello World. Each program is composed of package and execution starts in the main package. Other Go packages can be imported using “import”. Here we import fmt which will allow us to print hello world in the main() execution function.<strong> Pretty simple right ?</strong></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">package main

import "fmt"

func add(x int, y int) int {
	return x + y
}

func main() {
	var i, j int = 10, 2
	fmt.Println(add(i, j))
}
</pre>



<p>Now, we add a function and as you can see it is strongly typed. The x and y parameters of the add function are int typed and the return of the function must also be typed.</p>



<p>Then, in the main function, two variables are created and initialized directly. The result of the first function is then displayed via fmt. Note that if I had not used variables i and j the Go compiler would have insulted me immediately.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fPflaRY.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/fPflaRY.jpg" alt="go"></figure>



<p>Like I said before, object-oriented is weird with Go. There’s no class, but methods on type. <strong>Interfaces are implicitly implemented.</strong> There is no implement keyword, it’s really confusing, let’s have a closer look.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">package main

import "fmt"

type Developer interface {
    Code() string
}

type GoDeveloper struct {
}

func (g GoDeveloper ) Code() string {
    return "Go code"
}

func main() {
    var goDeveloper Developer = &amp;GoDeveloper{}
    fmt.Println(goDeveloper.Code())
}</pre>



<p>Anyway, let’s take a look at what a Go-routine looks like.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func say(s string) {
	for i := 0; i &lt; 5; i++ {
		time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
		fmt.Println(s)
	}
}

func main() {
	// go-routine is here with go keyword
	go say("world")
	say("hello")
}
</pre>



<p>Even if the concept exists in other languages, Go-routines are one of the key features of Go. They are functions that can be launched in concurrency with other functions. <strong>They are similar to threads but are extremely cheap to use !</strong> Go-routines communicate with each other using <a href="https://golangbot.com/channels/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">channels</a>. If you want to see more code to get a better feel for it <a href="https://gobyexample.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">this site</a> is just perfect.</p>



<h3>Go Everywhere</h3>



<p>People often use the name Golang to talk about Go. This name simply comes from the official website <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">golang.com</a>. The domain <a href="http://go.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">go.com</a> is already taken by a Disney site. <strong>Google had no choice and now the name Golang is everywhere</strong>. Note that Google supports Golang but the language remains open source.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zBVQTYW.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/zBVQTYW.jpg" alt="gopher"></figure>



<p>At least that didn’t stop the whole world from using Golang. Of course, you have Google using it everywhere. Docker is completely written in Golang. <strong>It’s used in production at Amazon, IBM, Netflix, Facebook and even DigitalOcean.</strong> And it’s been around for more than 10 years now, so the ecosystem had time to develop.</p>



<h3>Should i Go ?</h3>



<p>On the adaption side, Go developers continue their slow rise over the last 10 years, reaching the <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pushes/2019/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top 10 of popularity on GitHub</a>. However, <strong>it is not used that much in companies</strong>. It only reaches <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 12th position</a> in the latest StackOverFlow survey. That said, it is in the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-wanted" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">top 3 most wanted languages</a> by developers.</p>



<p>Personally I love Go. I haven’t encountered any of the language’s problems that are present. I continue to have fun with it, but I don’t see myself completely switching from  NodeJS at home. </p>



<p>I love NodeJS too much to do that. However, my plan for the future is to make <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WebAssembly modules in Go</a> and call them via import when they are <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#esm_experimental_wasm_modules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">merged stable everywhere</a>! </p>



<div><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/X7P8HDPtKHRdSJOewu/giphy.gif" alt="go"></figure></div>



<p>Should you drop everything and use Go because it’s the future? No. No language is the future. The future will always be composed of many languages. <strong>But if you want to test a very simple and powerful tool for your backend : it’s really interesting.</strong> I strongly advise you to do at least <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">the official interactive tour to make your own opinion</a>.</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>They are currently <a aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" href="https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incrementing Golang version 1</a> (now in 1.14) with new features. In the official blog they talk about <a href="https://blog.golang.org/toward-go2" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (s’ouvre dans un nouvel onglet)" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgrading to version 2 around version 1.20</a>. I can’t wait to see what will become of the language and its adoption by then.</p>

Finding needed solutions won’t be easy and will require creative thinking, robust analysis, and political resolve. The good news is that these challenges also present opportunities, particularly in terms of the economic development and job creation associated with decarbonizing America’s economy. </p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595934832085_15965"><p>Based on an extensive industrial and engineering analysis, our new report demonstrates that an aggressive national commitment to electrify all aspects of our economy would create up to 25 million good-paying American jobs over the next 15 years and  5 million sustained jobs by mid-century. This is the first analysis of the job opportunities  that would result from a rapid and total decarbonization of the economy as a whole. Unlike other approaches, which tend to see climate change policy as primarily environmental in nature, the study also imagines the electrification of America as fundamentally infrastructure designed to power America and its economy in the 21st century.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1595931227322_5243"><div><h3>What others are saying about the report:</h3><p><em>"This important study shows that climate action can create millions of well-paying American jobs. Decarbonization is an unprecedented opportunity to mobilize American industry and grow our economy. We just need the political courage to seize it." </em><strong><em>Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI)</em></strong></p><p><em>"Climate change is an existential threat to our health and communities..&nbsp; Rewiring America provides a blueprint for reducing climate change pollution and creating good-paying jobs. It is an important contribution to the work we urgently need to be doing." </em><strong><em>Carol Browner, former EPA Administrator</em></strong></p><p><em>"Rewiring America asks the bold question of what it would mean if we made building a clean economy, as fast as possible, our national project. The results should surprise, provoke, and inspire."&nbsp; </em><strong><em>Joseph Majkut, Director of Climate Policy, Niskanen Center</em></strong></p><p><em>“For so long we’ve been sold the lie that we have to choose between good jobs and a safe environment, that our generation has to choose between a livable planet and a thriving, equitable economy. The Rewiring America Plan puts that lie to rest once and for all. This report is a critical contribution that shows that urgently achieving an all-society clean energy future by 2035 is not only necessary and achievable, but will make the world that young people inherit more prosperous. We can achieve a just transition to a better world out of the wreckage of this economic crisis, with good union jobs for all, including low-income communities and communities of color — the only thing standing in the way is political will.” </em><strong><em>Varshini Prakash, Co-founder and Executive Director, Sunrise Movement</em></strong></p><p><em>“The Rewiring America team asked the question: ‘What would happen if we actually tried to transition all of the infrastructure in American society over the next 15 years to stay within the 1.5ºC safe upper limit of global warming?’ The answer they found is that would save consumers and society money, and it would create lots and lots and lots of jobs — around 25 million of them.” </em><strong><em>Evan Weber, Co-Founder and Political Director, Sunrise Movement</em></strong></p><p><em>"As millions of people around the country are out of work, the question is: how do we rebuild?&nbsp; Rewiring Electricity shows a bold vision, and a great opportunity for labor across the country.&nbsp; Building a plan from the bottom up is exactly the way to go.&nbsp; This white paper shows that millions of jobs can be created with good, sustainable wages in every community in America." </em><strong><em>Mike Fishman, past Secretary Treasurer, Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and President, Clean Jobs New York</em></strong></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1592581000788_5800"><div><h3>Author Bios</h3><p><strong>Saul Griffith </strong>is an engineer and inventor.

		<p>Wireheads are beings who have changed their reward architecture in order to&nbsp;be happy all the time. Unfortunately few people are making a serious effort to <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/85h/better_disagreement/" target="_blank">steel man</a> the <a href="https://www.hedweb.com/wirehead/index.html" target="_blank">case for wireheading</a>.&nbsp;The concept of wireheading tends to be&nbsp;a conversation stopper, and is frequently used as a reductio-ad-absurdum for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.valence-utilitarianism.com/" target="_blank">valence utilitarianism</a>. Hedonism is a low-status philosophy at the time, but this may be the result of&nbsp;what amounts to&nbsp;<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2pv/intellectual_hipsters_and_metacontrarianism/">dumb reasons</a>&nbsp;(i.e. going against&nbsp;it signals&nbsp;intellectual sophistications). Let’s be meta-contrarian for a moment&nbsp;and think&nbsp;critically about it. What would a good case for wireheading look like? In what follows I will (1) provide an account of what is known about emotional&nbsp;dynamics over time, (2) discuss the known pitfalls of current wireheading methods, (3) propose a system&nbsp;to overcome these pitfalls, and (4) make the case that combining wireheading (done right) with a systematic exploration of the state-space of consciousness&nbsp;might&nbsp;ultimately&nbsp;be our saving grace against the perils of Darwinism at the evolutionary limit.</p>
<p>Let us begin by enriching our understanding&nbsp;of the nature of bliss and its temporal dynamics:</p>
<h2>The Cube of Euphoria</h2>
<p>A little over a year ago I conducted a study to figure out the main dimensions along which psychotropic&nbsp;drugs influence people. The&nbsp;<a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2015/06/09/state-space-of-drug-effects-results/" target="_blank">State-Space of Drug Effects</a>&nbsp;consists of&nbsp;six main dimensions: fast euphoria, slow euphoria, spiritual euphoria, clarity, perception of overall value, and external vs. internal source of interest. The first three&nbsp;dimensions are directly related to pleasure, which makes them relevant for our&nbsp;current discussion.</p>

<p>Fast euphoria is what you get when you take stimulants, exercise or&nbsp;anticipate that something great is about to happen. Slow euphoria is what you experience if you take&nbsp;opioids or&nbsp;depressants, receive&nbsp;massages or hug a loved&nbsp;one. Spiritual/philosophical euphoria changes less frequently relative to the daily comings and goings of the other two. It is a state of consciousness related to the way we represent “the big picture”. Those who seek it&nbsp;try to induce&nbsp;it by methods that include&nbsp;philosophical thinking, spiritual practices and/or psychedelic drug use.</p>
<p>Two out of these three dimensions are equivalent to the well-studied emotion classification space of valence and arousal (also called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12529060" target="_blank">core affect</a>). Valence is <em>how good the experience feels</em>, whereas arousal deals with&nbsp;the intensity of the experience. It turns out that one can get the slow-fast projection of the cube of euphoria by changing the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis" target="_blank">basis used to represent</a>&nbsp;the valence-arousal space. You can get the valence-arousal space simply by rotating the slow-fast euphoria projection&nbsp;by 45&nbsp;degrees:</p>

<p>As we can see, fast euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence high-arousal” while slow euphoria is equivalent to “high-valence low-arousal”. This basis is not uncommon in affective psychology, and when used the axes&nbsp;are usually labeled&nbsp;“positive and negative activation”. We will use a&nbsp;yellow-red circle to represent fast euphoria and a blue-green circle to represent slow euphoria. I chose this&nbsp;color-coding by reasoning that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">warm colors</a> are a better representation of ecstatic states of consciousness whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory#Warm_vs._cool_colors" target="_blank">cool colors</a> illustrate better the feelings of<em> cooling off</em> and relaxing. I happen to prefer the&nbsp;fast-slow basis because it highlights the different kinds of euphoria in a helpful way that captures behavioral differences. This will be important when we get to steel-manning wireheading later on.</p>
<h2>Formalizing the Hedonic Treadmill: Negative Feedback Mechanisms</h2>
<p>It is well known that in the long run the things that happen to you have a surprisingly small effect on&nbsp;your overall level of happiness. One tends to always orbit around one’s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill" target="_blank">hedonic set-point</a>&nbsp;</em>(our mean valence and arousal values). Although our average&nbsp;sense of wellbeing does change from context to context&nbsp;(in response to variables such as stress, novelty, drug regimens, accomplishments, and opportunities for meaningful relationships), the environmental&nbsp;effect usually washes out over time by one’s&nbsp;internal negative feedback mechanisms. The ability to&nbsp;achieve lasting happiness, it turns out, was not as evolutionarily adaptive in our ancestral environment as the robust re-centering of affective dynamics that ended up governing our patterns of wellbeing. Thankfully, though unfairly, we are not all equally miserable; some people are lucky to be born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymic_temperament" target="_blank">hyperthymic</a> and <a href="https://qualiacomputing.com/2016/08/03/information-sensitive-gradients-of-bliss/" target="_blank">enjoy life the majority of the time</a>.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/pain-tolerance-has-genetic-basis-study-suggests-new-avenues-drug-treatment-277840" target="_blank">Genetically-determined pain-thresholds</a> do not only influence how one responds to physical discomfort, but also predict the <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep25267" target="_blank">size of one’s social network</a> (presumably by making social rejection less taxing).</p>
<p>Less well known is that people have different values for their valence-arousal correlation. According to a <a href="https://ppw.kuleuven.be/okp/_pdf/Kuppens2008IDIRB.pdf" target="_blank">2007 study by Peter Kuppens</a>, the conventional wisdom in affective psychology&nbsp;that valence and arousal are uncorrelated is not quite correct. For 30% of people valence is negatively correlated with arousal, for 30% it is the opposite and for the remaining 40% there is no correlation between these two dimensions.</p>
<p>This means that some people usually experience high valence (i.e. feel good) at the same time as being in an up-beat high energy state, and&nbsp;when they feel bad they tend to also have&nbsp;low levels of&nbsp;energy. On the other extreme there are those who&nbsp;experience bliss by tuning the energy&nbsp;down and relaxing, and primarily experience bad feelings in the form of high-energy states (such as irritation, worry and anger).</p>

<p>What else is variable across people? As it turns out, the transition patterns of core affect are related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank">personality factors</a>. People’s level of variance in the&nbsp;valence dimension is an important component&nbsp;of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism" target="_blank">neuroticism</a>. Although most neurotics tend to hang out&nbsp;in low-valence states, there are indeed very happy neurotics whose problem is not that they feel bad, but that great feelings are too short-lasting and unpredictable. It is the unpredictability of valence rather than its absolute value that&nbsp;results in the coping mechanisms typical of this dimension.&nbsp;Likewise, higher variability in arousal is a component of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Temperamental_view" target="_blank">extraversion</a>, SEE I AM SCREAMING NOW (for example).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.testsonthenet.com/Factors-facets.htm#Openness%20to%20Experience" target="_blank">Openness to experience</a> can be understood in terms of novelty-triggered increases in valence, so that&nbsp;more open individuals are more likely to&nbsp;experience euphoria of all kinds when learning new information relative to&nbsp;people who describe themselves as conventional. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness" target="_blank">Conscientious</a> individuals&nbsp;feel very rewarded when they complete a laborious task (but may experience more intense shame if they do not finish it on time). Agreeableness is undeniably connected to a positive perception of other people. If one feels that others are right and deserve to exist one is more likely to cooperate. The way to have positive perceptions of others is to <a href="https://www.mdma.net/" target="_blank">increase the hedonic tone of the interpersonal representations</a>.&nbsp;In brief, core affect dynamics can be used to capture otherwise hard-to-describe properties of the various personality factors. They each have a signature behavior in the valence-arousal space.</p>
<p>In a paper titled <a href="http://www.cogsci.uci.edu/~zoravecz/bayes/data/Articles/Oravecz2011AHLSD.pdf" target="_blank">A Hierarchical Latent Stochastic Differential Equation Model for&nbsp;Affective Dynamics</a>,&nbsp;Oravecz, Tuerlinckx, and Vandekerckhove applied the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process" target="_blank">Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process</a>&nbsp;to the dynamics of core affect. Their model takes into account many important features that had previously been overlooked for the sake of simplicity. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, these features turn out to be important signatures of personality factors, so having a model that incorporates them may be very useful to understand the differences between people. Their model describes people as having: a latent <em>home base</em> (hedonic set point), variance (for both components), a correlation between valence and arousal, an average speed, and a time-dependent relocation of the&nbsp;home base&nbsp;determined by the hour of the day. The model allows you to&nbsp;estimate person-specific parameters (using as input a sequence of self-reported emotional states).&nbsp;In turn, once you have determined someone’s latent parameters, the model can help you predict their&nbsp;future affect&nbsp;based on their current state.</p>

<p>This model is perhaps as good as it gets&nbsp;if you are restricted by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property" target="_blank">Markov assumption</a> and given only the&nbsp;valence and arousal dimensions of the participants over time. The state-space of emotion is far more granular, though. Even increasing the number of dimensions by one (e.g. by including the dimension of spiritual euphoria) may&nbsp;go a long way in clarifying the nature of unexpected emotional transitions. What explains the sometimes very large effect of&nbsp;philosophical discoveries, religious conversions, and personal epiphanies?</p>
<h2>A Map of Emotion Attractors: Studying 176X176 Transition Probabilities</h2>
<p>Back between 2012 to&nbsp;2014 I worked on modeling the dynamics of emotion transitions. I did this first&nbsp;as part of a research project&nbsp;for a company I worked for&nbsp;(thanks Kanjoya!) and it&nbsp;then transformed into the topic of&nbsp;my masters’ thesis. If you are interested in reading about it you can find some more&nbsp;<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/papers/conditioned-sentiment-expression.pdf" target="_blank">on a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;I wrote with colleagues</a>&nbsp;on predicting future emotions based on a sequence of previous ones (together with social cues).*</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Can a human be happy all the time?</p>

<p>Let me clarify; I don’t mean “happiness” in any kind of complex sense. I don’t mean wellbeing or eudaimonia or life satisfaction or anything like that.  I mean <em>being in a good mood</em> – better than good, “high”, bubbly, enthusiastic.</p>

<p>In the psychiatry literature they call this state “euphoria” or “elation.”  It can be produced by recreational drugs, or by placing electrodes in some locations in the brain, or by some brain injuries, or by neurological or psychiatric disorders.  It is common in manic and hypomanic episodes.  And, of course, it is a normal mood that healthy sober people can enter as well.</p>

<p>But most euphoric states are transient, and most ways to deliberately induce euphoria don’t work. Morphine, for instance, can produce euphoria, but not continuously for months at a time; you develop tolerance for the drug until the euphoria-producing dose and the fatal dose intersect.  And people who have a stroke of good fortune like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill#Happiness_set_point">winning the lottery</a> don’t stay euphoric forever – they initially feel great but then <em>adapt</em> to their changed circumstances.</p>

<p>So, you might ask, is there some kind of negative feedback loop in the brain such that euphoria is <em>always</em> temporary?  Is it literally impossible to feel awesome all the time, for months or years at a stretch?</p>

<p>Turns out the answer is no.</p>

<p>There is something called chronic mania, which is just what it sounds like: a manic state, including euphoria/elation, which lasts for over 6 months, sometimes forever.</p>

<p>The nineteenth-century psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin was the first to give a clinical description of chronic mania, though some modern neurologists think that today those patients would be diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia[1], and in his day, chronic mania was the second most common reason for a patient to be committed to a mental hospital.[2]</p>

<p>Apart from the length of their episodes, chronic mania patients differ from bipolar patients in a few systematic ways.  Chronic mania generally doesn’t alternate with depression, and is more likely than bipolar mania to come with an “elated mood.”  Chronic mania, compared to bipolar mania, is more likely to come with delusions, especially delusions of grandeur, while bipolar mania is more likely to come with symptoms of psychomotor agitation like tension, pressured speech, loss of sleep, and elevated sex drive.[2] Chronic mania is more likely to begin after age 40.[3]</p>

<p>The typical pattern, from case studies, seems to be of a person who may have had transient manic episodes in the past, “settling into” a chronic manic state where they are generally euphoric but out of touch with reality, engaging in reckless, inappropriate, or obnoxious behavior, until they come to the attention of psychiatrists when neighbors or relatives bring them to the hospital.</p>

<p><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>

<p>Kraepelin commented on the behavioral disinhibition and poor impulse control of chronic mania patients:</p>

<p>“Only the coarser enjoyments, eating, drinking, smoking, snuffing, still arouse in them vivid feelings, further the satisfaction of their personal wishes and wants…[they] talk more than their share, swagger, try to gain for themselves all possible little advantage.”[1]</p>

<p>He also notes that they engage in hoarding behavior:</p>

<p>“They collect all possible rubbish in their pockets, make a mess with it all round about, rub and wipe things, adorn themselves with rags and scraps of ribbon.”[1]</p>

<p>Frederic Wertham, a psychiatrist writing in 1929, described cases of chronic mania that fit the overall pattern.[4]  In all seven cases, the chronic mania began after age 30 (later than the typical onset of bipolar disorder), and in all cases it lasted several years.  In several cases, the patients had previously had briefer manic episodes.</p>

<p>Wertham describes traits such as “pressure of activity, great sociability, lack of fatigue, good humor”, “noisiness and talkativeness”, “buoyant” and “elated” moods, “wild schemes” and delusions (of unrealistic business deals, religious revelations, million-dollar inheritances),  “joviality and playfulness with jokes and laughing”, “vulgar and profane” language and sexual advances towards nurses.</p>

<p>Like Kraepelin’s patients, one of Wertham’s patients collects useless items and decorates herself – she “wore flowers in her hair and bits of colored wool tied to her buttons…continued decorating herself with little objects.”</p>

<p>Wertham notes some patterns: chronic mania patients tend to be middle-aged at onset, tend to have highly sociable and active personalities even before their illness, have no sign of cognitive decline (as you’d expect in dementia), and tend to be heavyset.</p>

<p>Similar features show up in more recent case studies of chronic mania: older age, hoarding, delusions, disinhibited behavior.</p>

<p>One 68-year-old woman[5] had been in an “elevated mood” state for 30 years, during which she increasingly hoarded objects and lived in increasing squalor, refusing all help. She had no sign of dementia or memory loss when tested, and no history of drug abuse. Prior to her illness she had had one depressive episode after the death of her husband, and before that she had been a “rather jovial schoolmistress” – like Wertham’s patients, her baseline personality was cheerful.  She recovered after treatment with lithium.</p>

<p>A 65-year-old Indian man had been manic for 48 years,[6] with the onset beginning after a fever at age 12.  He was “cheerful, optimistic, talkative, outgoing, and overly confident,” and became involved in politics with some success. But he also engaged in reckless behavior, traveling by train across India without paying his fare, stealing objects and giving them away to the poor. He “would often describe himself as a messenger of God with special powers, stating God had created him for the welfare of poor people”.  He couldn’t hold down a job and he was divorced twice, but his mood was “persistently cheerful or irritable.”  He was eventually hospitalized due to complaints by neighbors and relatives, and recovered after a temporary course of treatment with antipsychotics.</p>

<p>A 33-year-old woman who had been manic for 17 years[7] “expressed grandiose beliefs and evidenced a euphoric mood”, and had been unable to keep a job due to her “over-familiar” behavior.  She had never abused drugs.  “Her parents described her premorbid personality as generally affable, co-operative and creative but occasionally forceful and stubborn.”</p>

<p><strong>Chronic Mania and Brain Damage</strong></p>

<p>A variety of case studies of chronic mania identified a neurological cause.</p>

<p>One young woman who had mania-like symptoms since childhood (behavior problems, restlessness, talkativeness, labile and disinhibited mood, sexually provocative behavior starting at adolescence) was found upon radiological examination to have severe degeneration of the cerebellum.[8]</p>

<p>Another patient, a young man who had been electrocuted by getting entangled with a wire two years previously, developed manic symptoms of grandiose and persecutory delusions, hallucinations, poor judgment, and increased appetite.[9]</p>

<p>A 55-year-old man who had become irritable, extremely sociable, and extravagant with money was found to have an oligodendroglioma, a large brain tumor in the left temporoparietal lobe, and his symptoms improved after surgery.[10]</p>

<p>An eight-year-old child who had been ill with polioencephalomyelitis had a marked personality change – “he started talking excessively, singing songs and dancing. The symptoms became worse once he came home. He started talking with relatives, neighbours and strangers, content of talk was how he would act in a movie, how he would build a big house, that he would marry a beautiful lady, etc. He was singing film songs, was going out of the house and it used to be very difficult to locate and bring him back. His appetite was increased, sleep was disturbed. Majority of the time, he was very happy and cheerful.”[11]</p>

<p>A patient with a stroke damaging the periventricular zone of the hypothalamus was reported to have developed “persistent euphoria”, while in another case of brain surgery on the hypothalamus, “every time the surgeon gently wiped coagulated blood from the ventricle floor the patient burst out laughing, whistled, made jokes, and uttered obscene remarks.”[12]</p>

<p>An 81-year-old woman with a stroke in the right thalamus “became increasingly euphoric and talkative, and had grandiose delusions…believed that her health was better than ever and joked inappropriately. She also reported a decreased need for sleep.” After treatment with a temporary course of antipsychotics, she recovered but was still “mildly euthymic.”[13]</p>

<p>Out  of 66 consecutive patients treated for head trauma, 6 (9%) developed mania[14]. The only lesion location significantly associated with mania was the temporal pole (p = 0.0005), which is also one of the first areas damaged in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p>Compared to patients who developed bipolar disorder after brain injury, patients who developed only mania after brain injury were significantly more likely to have cortical lesions (esp. the orbitofrontal cortex and the right basotemporal cortex.)[15]</p>

<p>Another study found that mania after brain injury was “was associated primarily with orbitofrontal, thatamic, caudate, and basotemporal lesions in the right hemisphere.”[16]</p>

<p>The most common locations of lesions for patients with post-stroke mania (out of 74 cases) are the right frontal lobe and basal ganglia. Out of 16 patients who developed mania after a brain tumor, the tumor was in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, or subcortical limbic structure in 13 patients, and two patients (12.5%) had chronic mania.  [17]</p>

<p>One of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis is reported to be euphoria, or “euphoria sclerotica”, an unusual cheerfulness, optimism, and lack of awareness of their physical disability.</p>

<p>In a study of 44 MS patients and 22 healthy controls, 13% of MS patients had euphoria and 13% had …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><main id="genesis-content"><article itemref="hero-page-title" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"><div itemprop="text">
<p>In the last few weeks, people across the U.S. have been receiving unexpected packages of peas in their mail. News of these mysterious shipments circulated with theories ranging from accidental shipment to agricultural sabotage – the real reason though is tied to product review fraud. In this post, we’ll share what we have learned about this growing problem and discuss tools to help you filter out the fakes.</p>
<p>Product reviews are an invaluable shopping tool, but one that can’t be trusted blindly. Immoral sellers are increasingly introducing fake reviews to their products to deceive shoppers. It’s not just about the fake reviews though – these sellers also use increased review volume to boost their product’s ranking. </p>
<h2>Brushing</h2>
<p>Brushing is a method used to post fake reviews. It’s not a complicated concept, but affords sellers a way to post fraudulent reviews by using someones home address to send their product or a cheap substitute. Most recently, sellers sent peas but these were likely just substitutes used to make a transaction look legitimate so they can post fake reviews for one of their products. Here’s a quick video, from KCEN news, covering this event and talking briefly about brushing:</p>
<figure><p>
<iframe title="Why is China sending packages of seeds?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3dIwvCppr3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>
<h2>Fake Reviews Impact</h2>
<p>As you can see, this isn’t a new problem, but is one that continues to grow. It appears that those most susceptible to becoming the recipients of these items are those who have shopped with Chinese based retailers. If you are selected as the recipient for products associated with this scam, it is recommended you change all of your passwords with retailers and report it – feel free to keep the items. </p>
<p>It’s still concerning though because some stranger is using your home address and potentially your name and/or account to deceive shoppers into purchasing their product. On top of that, you have no control over what they send to your mailbox. You don’t know the source of the product or whether or not it is safe to use. </p>
<h2>Other Methods Used</h2>
<p>Sellers will also pay people directly the cost of their product plus a fee to post false reviews using accounts the poster controls. These types of services are widely available and cost next to nothing for the seller as they ultimately serve as both the seller and buyer. </p>
<p>Going a step further and to corroborate reviews, unscrupulous sellers will setup comparison websites with fake reviews pushing their products and services. This is especially rampant in high-paying affiliate markets. </p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>Separating real and fake reviews is nearly impossible. Luckily there are some tools that can help you filter out the fakes – the best we found is from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://reviewmeta.com/" target="_blank">Reviewmeta</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fakespot.com/" target="_blank">Fakespot</a>. Both are free and easy to use – just enter the URL of the product. They also offer browser add-ons so you can conveniently check the authenticity of a products reviews as you shop. We don’t like to install add-ons so we just stick to their site. </p>
<p>Here is a brief video for Reviewmeta:</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that these are not perfect solutions, but they do give you some weapons in the fight against fake products reviews.</p>
<h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
<p>The volume of fake reviews and product descriptions is difficult to grasp. One of the major reasons we started this site is to combat these predatory practices by sharing first-hand product knowledge. To minimize your risk of falling victim to false reviews, we recommend that you remain skeptical of online reviews, use different review sources to look for discrepancies, and use the tools discussed in this post for trustworthy product insights. There really is no single solution to avoid deceitful reviews, but armed with these tools and knowledge may help you avoid a costly mistake.</p>
<p>As always, we are happy to answer any questions you may have. Safe shopping. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Ready for a new series?</p>

<p>Having just gone over a bunch of items regarding <a href="https://jmmv.dev/2013/08/readability-series-wrap-up.html">code readability</a>, it is time to shift gears and get into the topic of the design of Command Line Interfaces (or CLIs for short).</p>

<p>The main focus of this series will be to cover best practices involved in creating applications whose interface is command-line oriented. Among other things, I will detail how the CLI should accept optional and required arguments, how a tool should expose more than one action and how interactive help should be handled.</p>

<p>Please note that console applications that use “drawing” libraries like <code>curses</code> are out of scope in these series: these applications follow to some extent the same principles as GUI-based applications, with the only difference being that their rendering happens in text mode. Therefore, the guidelines for their design are completely different and I don’t have enough experience to comment on them.</p>

<p>And now, a little disclaimer: I am well aware that the articles on this topic can be controversial: there are several different ways to design a CLI just as there are a million ways to design a GUI or a web page. So… just keep in mind that what I will be describing here are my own recollection of thoughts after having had to deal with tons of command line utilities and being annoyed by their inconsistencies and surprising behaviors — all caused by each tool implementing its own style for no real reason.</p>

<p>Hope that you agree, at least, on a few points ;-)</p>

targeting TI graphing calculators (currently only the 83+, but maybe others
later). There’s rather a lot to say about it, but here I will discuss the
<a href="#motivation">motivation for a new emulator</a> and <a href="#the-state-of-the-art">the state of
the art</a> followed by technical notes on
the <a href="#design">design</a> and <a href="#implementation">initial development process</a>.</p><figure><picture>

homepage</a></strong> on GitLab which has a <strong>live
demo</strong> that runs in your web browser and other resources including
source code.</p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>I’ve long been involved in the community of people who program for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83_series">TI-83+ series of graphing calculators</a>; it was on that platform that I got started programming in the first place. These days I play more of an advisory than active role in writing programs, by running much of <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/">Cemetech</a> behind the scenes and providing the occasional input to others. I think calculators are an excellent way to introduce people to programming, since they are readily available devices and not too complex to get started on, while still having enough capability to support experienced developers in doing interesting things (because they are readily accessible embedded systems). I fully credit getting started with programming calculators for having ended up programming embedded systems profesionally.</p><figure><img src="https://www.taricorp.net/2020/introducing-tihle/calcdcc.jpg" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Tim's workspace for
<a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?p=262170#262170">CalcDCC</a>
looks like it could contain any embedded engineer's prototype.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, the future of programming for TI calculators seems to be in peril. About a month ago, the news came out that new versions of the OS for the TI-84+ CE (the most recent variant of the 83+ featuring a color screen and improved eZ80 processor) <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/news/2020/5/949/_/ti-removes-asmc-programming-from-ti-83-premium-ce">will remove support for running native code</a>.</p><h3 id="death-of-a-platform">Death of a platform</h3><p>While this doesn’t necessarily affect older calculators or programs, in the long
term it seems to spell doom for calculators as an inroad to developing embedded
software in particular. Programs written in the calculators’ dialect of BASIC
continue to be accessible and a new Python implementation fills the void
somewhat, but they lack in depth- where a user could spend time and effort
developing native programs constrained only by the hardware they run on before, in
the future users will be <strong>limited to only those capabilities provided by TI’s
software</strong>.</p><p>In much the same way that I believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">Scratch</a> is a decent introduction to programming but completely hides interesting details and is not seriously used by anybody but those using it a learning tool, I also believe removal of support for running native code will ultimately mean people will no longer have calculators (which are often required school equipment!) as a useful entrypoint to serious programming.</p><h3 id="historical-interest">Historical interest</h3><p>In addition to the loss of a way to introduce people to programming, removing support for native code also effectively throws away a large existing library of programs that stretches back more than 20 years (nicely embodied in <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/">ticalc.org</a>, which first came online in 1996). While the 84+ CE is a young platform relative to the TI-83+ series as a whole (and is incompatible with earlier software), it already has a rich library of programs created by users that will effectively be lost when they can no longer be run on the hardware they are designed for.</p><figure><picture>

<a href="https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/1347">Tetric A</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The precedent of effectively <strong>destroying the work of community members</strong> is
troubling, and I am motivated to look for ways to preserve it. In much the same
way that there still exist thriving communities around long-obsolete home
computers like the <a href="https://apple2online.com/">Apple II</a> and <a href="https://thec64community.online/">Commodore
64</a> today, I think it’s worthwhile to try to
provide a similar opportunity by preserving the platform into a hostile future
by working to give the systems and software ongoing life beyond what their
creators envisioned (or perhaps more pointedly, beyond what they decided they
could make money from).</p><p>As a newer platform than those early home computers that still have active communities, information and resources may be rather easier to come by for these calculators because much of the information was born digital and has always been online. However this is also hazardous to preservation, because if items are readily available online there may not be any replacements available if the original goes away. For instance, TI used to <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/news/articles/1/19/19421.html">freely provide an SDK for the 83+</a>, but have more recently made it <a href="https://education.ti.com/en/customer-support/sdk-request">much more difficult to access</a>. Perhaps even more concerningly, TI’s web site no longer seems to provide <em>any</em> information about the <a href="https://www.ticalc.org/basics/calculators/ti-84plus-cse.html">TI-84+ CSE</a>, seeming to deny that it ever existed (though manuals and software are still available if you know where to look).</p><h3 id="a-calling">A calling</h3><p>Recognizing these concerns about the loss of a valuable resource for beginning programmers and loss of interesting history to the grind of the education-industrial complex,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> what are we to do?</p><p>There exist a number of web sites that document the calculators and offer
resources related to them- I’m already involved in that, which is valuable and
<a href="https://archive.org/details/ticalc-2014-08">generally well-preserved</a> on <a href="https://web.archive.org/">the
Internet Archive</a>. But if the existing resources are
useless on current hardware as they largely become when large classes of
programs are not runnable, new tools become required: I believe this situation
calls for emulation of the calculators, to <strong>make the platform accessible to
everybody</strong>.</p><h2 id="the-state-of-the-art">The state of the art</h2><p>There already exist a number of emulators for TI calculators, including:</p><ul><li><a href="http://wabbitemu.org/">WabbitEmu</a>, which is open-source and generally good
quality.</li><li><a href="https://www.cemetech.net/projects/jstified/">jsTIfied</a>, an emulator
available as a web application.</li><li><a href="https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/84/8442.html">Virtual TI</a>,
one of the earliest calculator emulators to be created.</li><li><a href="https://wikiti.brandonw.net/index.php?title=Emulators:PindurTI">PindurTI</a>,
which is now defunct but offered some useful capabilities in its day.</li><li>..and others</li></ul><p>While most of these are accurate enough to run most programs, this is not the
whole story: all of them <strong>require a ROM image to work</strong>. The ROM includes the
calculator’s operating system and boot code, which implement huge swaths of
functionality from keyboard and display handling through implementing
floating-point arithmetic and the TI-BASIC interpreter.</p><p>TI jealously protect their OS and boot code because from the point of view of
their business, the entire value of the calculator is in its software. If an
emulator can run the same software on a more general machine, what reason is
there for a user to purchase a $100 device from TI?<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> But if we want
to preserve <em>community</em> software for emulation, we don’t really care about the
same functions that TI are interested in protecting.</p><p>Though truly accurate emulation still requires all OS functions be available in
the same way, many applications only use a small subset of them. So what options
are available for emulating the system software?</p><h3 id="os-implementations">OS implementations</h3><ul><li>TI’s EOS (TI-OS) is provided with the calculator, and can be downloaded
from TI in order to update a calculator. However, they added a <a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8819">clickwrap
agreement to the OS in
2013</a> that attempts
to forbid use of the OS for emulation. While that clause is questionably
enforceable, nobody (myself included) is very interested in challenging it-
mostly because TI has historically tended to turn a blind eye to the
distribution of ROMs. Any such distribution in a larger, more public forum
increases the risk of calling in the lawyers, so for these and the reasons
discussed above, I do not believe it is tenable to use TI’s OS for
general-availability emulation.</li><li>Brandon Wilson’s <a href="https://www.brandonw.net/calculators/OS2/">OS2</a> seems most
relevant, in that it wants to reimplement TI-OS “but better.” However,
it hasn’t been updated in 11 years at this point and seems dead. It’s also
dependent on the assembler and tools provided by Zilog, which only run on
Windows and are closed-source.</li><li><a href="https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5686">GlassOS</a>
is implemented in C and actually seems useable, but lacks compatibility
with any existing software.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/KnightOS/KnightOS">KnightOS</a> is UNIX-like and seems to
have a selection of useful software, but again is not compatible with any
existing software beyond a small library of ports targeting it.</li><li>Many other people (myself included) have attempted to write OSes, but they

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>Are you confused about what to learn when it comes to the fundamentals of programming? Do you constantly get told that algorithms and data structures are the gold standard for what will help propel your understanding? How do you get better at designing solutions rather than operating preexisting ones?</p>
<p>Most of what people try to shill as fundamentals does not end up empowering people with a framework around problem solving. People assume that instead of having the ability to solve problems themselves, they instead need to learn a grab-bag of tool-oriented prior knowledge. This taints one's arc of learning with the idea that it is all about gobbling up technical arcana, all the while reliant on others to find just which mystery to focus on next.</p>
<p>Mathematics and systems thinking has helps me build mental models of almost everything around me, aiding me in how I navigate the world and make decisions. You are likely carrying around <em>lots</em> of mental models with you already. Strong mental models that refine over time give you the ability to understand different programming languages without having to read entire books, immerse yourself in new code you've never seen before without having to ask a number of it's inventors who may have left little to no documentation, or, perhaps, how to reason about a market you are creating as part of a business. <strong>Models describe the essence of these things; them being "mental" is merely a matter of keeping them in your head.</strong></p>
<p>Modeling is about describing systems. While a collection holds all the items contained, a system augments this with descriptions of how the items interrelate. <strong>At it's essence, a system is a collection of shapes, usually boxes or circles, representing distinct entities, and arrows describing the relationships between these entities.</strong> If you're mathematically inclined a system is a graph with nodes (the shapes) and edges (the arrows).</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-pdp11.jpg" alt="A functional block diagram of the PDP-11 computer" title="A functional block diagram of the PDP-11 computer">
  
</figure>
<p>The shapes in the graph expressed should <strong>not</strong> be thought of as black boxes. Instead, <strong>think of a systems diagram as merely a view of the system at a particular scale.</strong> It is not that we should never see the details of the entities in the system, as the popular notions around encapsulation may lead us to think, but that we are simply ignoring them when discussing the system at this level of detail.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-555-timer.jpg" alt="A schematic for a 555 timer integrated circuit" title="A schematic for a 555 timer integrated circuit">
  
</figure>
<p>Systems that describe the flux of some unit, continuous or discrete, often refer to the unit flowing across the connections as a <strong>stock</strong>. <strong>Taps</strong> adjust the rate of flow of the stocks along the arrows. It's is a good practice to not overload the usage of what an arrow means by having it describe verbs <em>or</em> the inlet and outlet of stocks, but not both.</p>
<p>Systems inevitably end up describing repetitive actions, otherwise known as <strong>loops</strong>. A loop may consist of a way to communicate necessary changes to some other entity in the loop which we call <strong>feedback</strong>. A loop with finely-tuned feedback mechanism will seek some state of equilibrium while a loop whose feedback is disregarded or misaligned will self-reinforce in some general trend. If a stock is involved, you can see how producers and consumers are affecting the quantity of the stock in this system with a behavior-over-time graph.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-feedback-loops.jpg" alt="A systems diagram showing the basics of feedback loops. Author: Kjell Magne Fauske licensed under CC BY 2.5" title="A systems diagram showing the basics of feedback loops. Author: Kjell Magne Fauske licensed under CC BY 2.5">
  
</figure>
<p>When we talk about misalignment of feedback in loops, we tend to mean the amount of delay of some message or action. <strong>All loops have some delay in their communications</strong>, but the tuning of that delay is important. Given the context of the system or loop, a short delay may be just as bad as a long delay. A system describing the supply and demand of a widget may want a certain sized delay so that demands for manufacture do not lead to oversupply.</p>
<p>An example of a system seeking a state of equilibrium may be a thermostat connected to a heater. If the heater reaches a target point on the thermostat, the heater stops until the thermostat drops below the target point. If the thermostat didn't exist, there would be no feedback and the heater would continue to increase over time. If there was a substantial delay in the feedback of the thermostat to the unit that controls whether or not the heater is on, the heat would also continue to grow up until a point. If you include a cooling system, you may get finer control of both directions of temperature. It's worth mentioning that most systems of growth have a saturation point, but that point may be functionally quite high in the context of use!</p>

</figure>
<p>State machines also make up the basis of a system; the boxes are states, the arrows transitions between states, and the use of a state machine includes tracking the current state of where an agent in the state machine might be. This type of thinking is highly underappreciated when designing transactional systems such as network requests, payment flows, and so on. State machines help clarify if the flow of logic has any odd behavior, such as winding up in invalid states or transitions that lead to inescapable states.</p>

</figure>
<p>The best way to get better at systems thinking is to start drawing out systems diagrams. Drawing by hand in a journal is my preferred route, but there are also many services that make doing these easily. For example, here's an incredibly rough sketch of a diagram I copied from Richard Hamming's classic "The Art of Doing Science and Research" showing the essence of a CPU.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.justanotherdot.com/assets/images/systems-thinking-a-primer-cpu.jpg" alt="A hand-drawn diagram of the essential parts of a CPU, based on
    Richard Hammings work in The Art of Doing Science and Engineering" title="A hand-drawn diagram of the essential parts of a CPU, based on
    Richard Hammings work in The Art of Doing Science and Engineering">
  
</figure>
<p>It also helps to see other people building up systems, as I've included some examples here. Functional block diagrams are my favorite but if you see any type of graph you could, theoretically, coerce that into the idea of a system and think about its causal relationships, how time plays a part of the system and the states that it may be in, how the author of the diagram has chosen to render distinct parts of the system, or maybe combine both the flow of units <em>as well as</em> the actions between nodes and see how confusing that gets. There are lots of places like the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> and <a href="http://bitsavers.org/">Bitsavers</a> that have scanned copies of old computer reference manuals with plenty of circuit and functional block diagrams that are great places to start, and an article discussing architectural changes is worth it's weight in gold, <a href="https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/secondary-storage-to-just-storage/">like this one by Charity Majors</a>. <em>Don't worry about system diagrams being perfect; in the same way that writing can help you refine your thoughts, systems diagrams can help refine your thinking around a system.</em></p>

The business would be designed to tap into these “hidden sentiment indicators” in order to understand how people at work are being affected by their environments and situations.</p><p>One clear example of this I saw while browsing through the trending memes/gifs on Microsoft Teams on 6/5/2020 (this was at the apex of the Black Lives Matter protests that were sweeping across the United States as executives and individuals from around the world spoke out against racial injustice). As you can see, most of the memes have to do with feeling love and solidarity, in spite of the turmoil in the world.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1596044405768_23055"><div><p>For executives, developing a meme gauge (in other words, using the quality/quantity/content of sent memes to gauge emotions and sentiments of employees) could help to improve corporate culture and communication.

How do companies keep a pulse on individual sentiment and align that with all-up strategic goals while managing unique differences, perspectives, and opinions? It’s a problem that hasn’t been solved, but as people have more choices and less-ties to specific businesses and companies, culture will become a large selling point (or breaking factor) that makes or breaks a corporation.</p><p><strong>Monetization: </strong>Selling this service to corporations.</p><p><strong>Contributed by: </strong><a href="https://www.michaelbervell.com/">Michael Bervell</a> (Billion Dollar Startup Ideas)</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-e458a53e1867d15f05c8"><div><p>With school starting right around the corner, many full-time working parents are at a loss of for what to do. They don’t feel comfortable with new social distancing policies. They may not like the way distance learning is being implemented at their school. If you’re wracking your brain trying to figure out how you’re possibly going to afford homeschooling or manage it with two full-time jobs, you are not alone.</p><p>What many families don’t realize is that homeschoolers are not rich typically  In fact, they are <a href="https://responsiblehomeschooling.org/research/summaries/homeschool-demographics/">just as likely to be poor or near poor than other families</a>. In fact, homeschoolers generally spend only <a href="https://www.moneycrashers.com/homeschooling-cost-home-school-curriculum-program-books/">$300-600/year</a> on curriculum.</p><p>For decades, homeschooling families have found creative ways to educate their children on a shoestring budget. We’ve talked to thousands of homeschooling families around the world about creative solutions they’ve found and are excited to share them with you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are a few ways that families can homeschool affordable.</strong></p><p><strong>1) Use free curriculum</strong></p><p>There are so many wonderful free resources available to homeschooling families. A great place to start for free curriculum is <a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/khanacademy">Khan Academy</a> for PreK-12th grade or <a href="https://www.modulo.app/all-resources/khan-app-kids">Khan App Kids</a> for Prek-2nd. Khan Academy is a strengths-based program.&nbsp; This means that your child will get positive reinforcement for doing well, not penalized for weaknesses.&nbsp; It is also mastery-based, meaning children move ahead at their own rate.</p><p><strong>Some others we love that offer free or inexpensive options are:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://mysteryscience.com/">Mystery Science</a> for science</p></li><li><p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mathtango/id1234698308">Math Tango</a> for rmath</p></li><li><p><a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a> for coding&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duo Lingo</a> for foreign language</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.zinnedproject.org/">Zinn Education Project</a> for US History</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.teachyourmonstertoread.com/">Teach your Monster to Read</a> (for learning to read)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CosmicKidsYoga">Cosmic Kids Yoga</a> for movement</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ArtforKidsHub">Art Hub for Kids</a> for drawing and fine motor skills</p></li><li><p><a href="https://bravewriter.com/download-your-freewriting-lessons/">Brave Writer </a>for writing</p></li><li><p><a href="https://blossomandroot.com/">Blossom and Root</a> for a nature and art based curriculum</p></li><li><p><a href="https://schoolclosures.org/">Schoolclosures.org </a>offers free tutoring in every subject for all ages</p></li></ul><p><strong>Here is a more comprehensive list of </strong><a href="https://medium.com/@manisharoses/free-on-line-education-resources-for-parents-105c5520b262"><strong>free homeschooling resources curated by homeschool parents.&nbsp;</strong></a></p><p><strong>2) Solve for your childcare problem, not your education problem</strong></p><p>Education and childcare are inextricably linked, but when trying to find creative ways to budget for homeschooling, I find it helpful to focus on the childcare problem, rather than the  education one.  Homeschooling one on one is very different than learning in a classroom because children get individual attention from their parent or tutor and thus benefit from <a href="https://nintil.com/bloom-sigma/">mastery learning.</a> When learning happens through independent study or with a tutor, it happens much more quickly than in a classroom setting. This is why most homeschoolers only need 1-2 hours a day of parent-led instruction to optimize learning outcomes and meet or exceed state standards for learning. </p><p>Many of the curriculum available are designed to be easy to facilitate for a parent or a caregiver, so you don’t need to necessarily spend extra money on a professional teacher or tutor. Lastly, if you do need extra professional teaching support, many free tutoring platforms exist with exceptional teachers and grad students available to guide your child’s learning. </p><p>Often, parents can just set their children up to the day and they’re off to the races. And there are many great curriculum options available to support parents teaching their children in this way for the first time that require no prep or teaching experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, it’s useful to think about <strong>how you managed childcare when your child was in preschool</strong> when school was not available to you<strong> </strong>and start thinking of creative solutions in that context.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are a few great ways to make childcare more affordable:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Ask a family member to watch your children: </strong>While this might seem drastic, having a family member live with you and take care of childcare is one of the easiest and most effective ways to get the job done. It’s very common in other cultures, but in the United States, we’re not accustomed as much for asking for this type of support from extended family.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Swap childcare with other families: </strong>Are there a few other families in your neighborhood who need childcare support? Consider creating a schedule where each family watches the kids one day a week or alternate half-days. Each family takes a morning or an afternoon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Ask your company for support: </strong>During this time, it’s not unreasonable for parents to ask for special support from their companies to do the impossible (work full-time when schools are not providing childcare for kids). Ask your company for completely flexible hours. Ask them to make meetings optional. Ask them to give you a schedule where you do one 3 hour block of work a day.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Take advantage of free classes online: </strong>While the online experience has not been optimal for many students, there are definitely many teachers who are finding creative ways to build highly engaging online courses. The best place I’ve found for inexpensive or free classes for kids is <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/d/online/free--events/kids/">Eventbrite</a>. Here is a search I did for <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/d/online/free--events/kids/">free virtual classes for kids.&nbsp;</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Hire a sitter to homeschool your child: </strong>There are so many great secular, homeschool resources available that are easy for parents and caregivers to follow. You don’t need a professional teacher to guide your child’s learning and a caregiver can often be less expensive.&nbsp; You can also share a sitter with another family to reduce the price. During quarantine, families are also hiring virtual sitters to great success. The more interactive activities a sitter does with a child online (Art projects, movement, etc) the more likely they are to stay engaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Ask a neighbor or friend to watch your child. </strong>You might be surprised by people’s generosity. Often older people in your community feel lonely and would be thrilled to spend time with a child. Likewise, many people are looking for ways to be helpful during the pandemic and helping others (like a working parent) helps them feel like they can make a difference.

    <h2>Data Fetching in React sucks.</h2><h4>You've likely tried countless "global state" libraries, <em>useFancyPromise</em> hooks and maybe even attempted to write your own solutions only to end up back in the same place: Writing TONS of code to handle seemingly endless data fetching scenarios. But WHY?</h4><h3>Server state and client state are fundamentally different.</h3><h4><span>Server state:</span></h4><ol><li>Is <strong>persisted remotely</strong> in a location <strong>you do not control</strong></li><li>Requires <strong>asynchronous APIs</strong> for fetching and updating</li><li>Implies shared ownership and <strong>can be changed by others without your knowledge</strong></li><li><em>Will eventually </em>become "stale" or "outdated" during the lifecycle of your app.</li></ol><h3>So, it's time we <em>stop trying to force</em> server-state into our client-state tools and instead, <strong>harness</strong> the power of its<em> unique </em>challenges for our benefit:</h3><ul><li><strong>Caching</strong>... (possibly the hardest thing to do in programming, but game-changing)</li><li><strong>Deduping</strong> multiple requests for the same data into a single request</li><li><strong>Updating</strong> out of date data <strong>in the background</strong></li><li>Controlling when data is "out of date"</li><li>Performance optimizations like <strong>pagination and lazy loading</strong> data</li><li>Managing <strong>memory and garbage collection</strong> of server state</li><li><strong>Optimistic updates and rollbacks</strong> for "instant" UI and user experiences.</li></ul><h2><strong>React Query</strong> turns these challenges into <em>powerful features</em>.</h2><h5>It is <em>the best tool available</em> for solving all of these issues <strong>out-of-the-box, with zero configuration, and allowing for fine-grained customization</strong> as your application grows<strong>.﻿</strong></h5>

  <p>One of the striking and sad things about the pandemic for me has been a disconnect between my own relatively uninterrupted experience and what I see as the broader, more traumatic experience. One of the key drivers of the more dramatic disparity is the technology that is being deployed in response to the pandemic.</p>

<p>In this essay, I will suggest a framework for teasing out the distribution of relative winners and losers resulting from the adoption of new technology. Using this framework, I’ll argue that <strong>COVID is accelerating the “virtualization” of the economy and that the adoption of new technology and norms like remote work, Zoom meetings, and delivery commerce will drive lumpier (power) distributions of earnings.</strong></p>

<details>
<summary>While this essay focuses on disparity in economic consequences, I want to acknowledge the disparity in health consequences of COVID.</summary>
<div>
    <p>The early numbers confirm that the impacts of COVID-19 are indeed very different for different populations – <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/racial-ethnic-minorities.html">this report from the CDC</a> estimates that the hospitalization rates are 4-5 times higher for Black, Hispanic, Latino, and American Indian people in the US vs whites:</p>

<h3 id="this-is-a-pretty-long-essay-so-here-is-the-tldr">This is a pretty long essay, so here is the tldr;</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We can extend the <em>“microphone or forklift?”</em> question from a 2007 Edward Leamer essay with a few more representative types – shipping container, video conferencing, stethoscope – to build a useful framework for thinking about the relative win/loss distributions of different kinds of new technology.</li>
  <li>As virtualization increases global competition for service work and knowledge work, the effects will mirror those of globalization, driving wages down by allowing jobs to move to geos / countries where labor is cheaper.</li>
  <li>As virtualization allows some local services to become “content,” the effects will mirror those of a “microphone technology,” resulting in superstar effects.</li>
  <li>Virtualization will benefit capital (owners of tech) and relatively favor labor in lower GDP countries / lower cost geos.</li>
  <li>One area where virtualization has the potential to create more jobs than it destroys is where it serves as a “stethoscope technology” that facilitates 1:1 listening.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s dive in.</p>

<h2 id="setup-forklifts-and-microphones">Setup: Forklifts and Microphones</h2>

<p>In a <a href="https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.45.1.83">2007 essay in the Journal of Economics Literature</a>, Edward Leamer asks the following question, which I think we can extend to build a framework that can help us understand the effects of any new type of technology (like virtualization).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Is a computer more like a forklift or more like a microphone?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leamer goes on (<strong>emphasis</strong> mine, and I will quote at length rather than paraphrase):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It doesn’t matter much who drives the forklift, but it matters a lot who sings into the microphone. Think about the forklift first. You might be a lot stronger than I, but with a little bit of training, I can operate a forklift and lift just as much as you or any other forklift operator. Thus <strong>the forklift is a force for income equality, eliminating your strength advantage over me</strong>….</p>
</blockquote>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/forklifts-and-microphones/freddie.jpg"><figcaption>Freddie Mercury, via ngradio.gr</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The effect of the microphone and mass media have been to allow a single talented entertainer to serve a huge customer base and accordingly to command enormous earnings. This creates an earnings distribution with a few extremely highly paid talented and trained individuals</strong>….</p>

  <p><strong>A computer is both a forklift and a microphone.</strong> Clerks in McDonalds no longer have to be able to read or to compute…. That’s the forklift. It doesn’t much matter who punches the buttons. Thus your intelligence advantage over me is eliminated by the computer, just as your strength advantage was eliminated by the forklift. But for many other operations it matters enormously who types on the computer. One example is computer programming.
….
A talented architect with a computer assistant can serve a much enlarged customer base. A talented attorney, or a talented economist, or a talented radiologist with computer assistants can serve much enlarged customer bases. These talented individuals command high wages while the less talented struggle for customers.</p>

  <p>Computer technology seems therefore to be taking us into a future where there are a few very talented, very well-paid people and the rest of us are doing the mundane computer-assisted tasks which don’t require us to read, write, or even think very much. Just push the right button now and then.</p>

  <p>In other words, <strong>the information revolution may be a powerful force for income inequality</strong> by raising the compensation for natural talents and also the interaction between talent and training.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now let’s extend some of his examples and dig a bit more into who wins and loses relatively when technology like a forklift has an “equalizing” effect.</p>

<p>When Leamer talks about the equalizing effect of a forklift, he talks about it as a sort of closed system – the technology is made available everywhere at once and facilitates competition across an entire population, which kind of makes it sound great for the lowest skilled workers in the population.</p>

<p>But I want to add a dimension to Leamer’s framework that considers not only your starting position within a country, but also the relative position of your country relative to other countries (ranked by per capita GDP, workers’ rights, cost of living, or anything else that correlates with cost of labor).</p>

<p>An example will help illustrate why this additional dimension matters.</p>

<p>Take the perspective of a national economy as a closed system – if you start off in one of the lower bands, the forklift might enable you to do a job you previously could not do, making you relatively better off than before.</p>

<p>Now, let’s consider the global perspective, and imagine you are this same person in a lower-ntile of the income distribution within your country. Add the extra dimension that you live in one of the higher GDP countries, so your initial position globally is better than that of someone with your same skills and job in one of the lower GDP countries. With this framing, even though the forklift levels the playing field within your own country, it also entails A LOT more competition for you from every other country, which means you’ll be relatively worse off globally (and, the workers in the lower GDP countries will be relatively better off).</p>



<p>I have also added a few new technologies to Leamer’s forklift and microphone set (which I labeled as representatives of “manufacturing” and “media” respectively): shipping container for “globalization,” video conferencing for “virtualization,” and stethoscope for “listening.”</p>

<p>This little win / loss matrix provides a concise summary of the key technology trends afoot today:</p>

<figure><img src="https://kortina.s3.amazonaws.com/_/forklifts-and-microphones/win-loss-matrix.png"><figcaption>Win / Loss Matrix for (Global) Adoption of a New Technology</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A few notes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>How I scored this is up for debate / somewhat speculative. I’m curious how others would score it differently.</li>
  <li>However you score it, I think the exercise demonstrates that all technologies do not benefit everyone equally.</li>
  <li>I have chalked up pretty much any new technology as a win for the capital class in any country, since they will typically either own related IP, earn a return on investment by provisioning the new technology, or extract rent if they control distribution, eg, in the case of media companies monetizing content.</li>
</ol>

<details>
<summary>full notes on how I scored my scorecard .............................................</summary>
<div>
    <ul>
      <li>Forklift: high earners everywhere win because they own the tech, lower earners in higher GDP countries lose due to increased competition from lower earners in lower GDP countries (who relatively win).</li>
      <li>Microphone: a few superstars win big and can reach infinite audiences, consequently way fewer jobs (both singing and in related things like event production), the real winners are high earners in any country who own the distribution rights, technology, and relationships (eg, record labels, digital media companies).</li>
      <li>Shipping container: good for higher earners everywhere who own the containers, ships, distribution networks; good for lower earners in lower GDP countries when manufacturing is exported there, bad for lower earners in higher GDP countries because they lose manufacturing jobs.</li>
      <li>Video conferencing: good for high earners everywhere because it facilitates knowledge sharing and trade; good for lower n-tile / lower GDP workers when knowledge work is exported to them, bad for lower n-tile / higher GDP workers because they lose knowledge work jobs.</li>
      <li>Stethoscope: perhaps the most positive sum of all of these, least subject to monopoly / rents (tho you could argue that higher earners that own the tech benefit more than workers using the tech).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</details>

<p>In the rest of this essay, I want to discuss the winners and losers posited in the “virtualization” column of this matrix.</p>

<h2 id="virtualization-post-covid-as-globalization-on-steroids">Virtualization post-COVID as Globalization on Steroids</h2>

<p>If adoption of virtualization technology resembles any other technological trend, I think it will be most similar to globalization, but on steroids.</p>

<p>Here are a few of my own personal observations and anecdotes how this is playing out during the pandemic.</p>

<h3 id="the-shift-to-remote-work-via-zoom--slack-will-stick">The Shift to Remote Work via Zoom / Slack Will Stick</h3>

<p>COVID has forced all firms who can virtualize to experiment with it, and the results have largely been positive. For desk jobs, the technology to support remote work has existed for quite awhile, but I think two things held back the shift to remote until now.</p>

<p>First, there was hesitation on the part of firms about losing the high bandwidth / low latency forms of communication afforded by physical proximity. Many at my own company (a small SAAS software business) were specifically skeptical about losing (1) water-cooler and lunch chats for unstructured / exploratory discussion, and (2) white-boarding and tapping people on the shoulder for resolving issues and questions immediately.</p>

<p>So far, in the short term, we have not missed these as much as we expected. If anything, net/net, our team is higher productivity than when in the office.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><figure id="w-node-d2eae0c6afad-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f1f443920701d151f90e0a2_audit-trail.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>App security means app visibility, and <strong>audit logs</strong> are becoming a key requirement of both enterprise customers and fast growing startups. Building audit logs into your app will help land those larger deals and give your customers conviction in your product’s security profile – but actually choosing which events to log, deciding on payloads, and exposing events via the right APIs is far from easy. Our guide will walk you through the basics that every developer should know: why audit logs are important, event formats, SIEM tools, retention best practices, and everything else you didn’t realize you needed to know. </p><h2>The basics: what audit logs are and why you should care</h2><p>CIOs and IT admins (and really anyone involved in security) need <strong>full visibility</strong> into the apps their teams are using: who’s logging in, resetting their password, and accessing what data. Let’s imagine we’re an internal IT admin at Kellogs – and we want visibility into how our organization is using Salesforce. A few things we might be curious about:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Has someone tried and failed to log in 10 times in the past hour?</li><li>Who accessed PII (personally identifiable information) in the past week?</li><li>How many users accessed a sensitive report that was accidentally shared with the wrong team?</li></ul><p>Audit logs answer these questions by providing a granular paper trail of what app users have done. Every time a user does anything of consequence – log in, reset password, create report, you name it – your system emits an event with useful metadata about that event. Companies will <strong>expose</strong> these events via a UI and/or an API so admins can analyze them at scale. Here’s a quick example of what an event might look like:</p><p>The data in audit logs have a variety of different possible use cases by IT admins. In specific industries such as finance, there are laws that require companies store a “paper trail” of user behavior (such as messages) in an audit log, often referred to as data retention. These logs may also be used for digital forensics in the case of a breach, or “e-discovery” during a lawsuit. However in most cases, audit logs are primarily used by admins to inspect user behavior during configuration and set up alerts for potential malicious actors or account compromise.</p><p>Audit logs aren’t only a requirement for giant monolithic enterprises; the need for visibility is being pushed “downstream” to smaller companies as they use more and more applications. Audit logs will help your business move upmarket, but they’ll also help improve retention and close your existing target deals faster.</p><h2>What kinds of events to emit and how</h2><p>Building audit logs into your app isn’t <em>technically</em> difficult – if you’ve instrumented your product with something like Segment already, it’s very similar code. As with most enterprise features, the devil is in the details: what kinds of events to emit, what the payload should be, how to store events, and how to integrate these events with the wider enterprise toolkit.<br></p><h5><strong>1. What kind of events to log</strong></h5><p>The goal of audit logs is to provide a paper trail of important actions that help IT admins and security folks get a detailed picture of what’s happening in your app – that’s the driving logic for what kinds of events you should be writing. </p><p>Chances are you already emit events in a similar fashion: but your audit log events <strong>should not be the same as analytics or observability events</strong>. This is a common mistake companies make - the kind of data a team needs internally for product analytics and general instrumentation will <em>overlap</em> with audit logs, but different use cases necessitate different data (especially handling concerns around PII). The same is true of your observability data: if you’re sending events to Elasticsearch / Prometheus / Honeycomb / your monitoring system of choice, those events might overlap with audit logging use cases – but you’ll need to do a ton of scrubbing and cleaning in advance. </p><p>There’s no catalog of what <em>exact</em> events to instrument, but a few general guidelines might help:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Login / auth</strong> - Anything related to signing up, signing in, resetting passwords, updating usernames, etc.</li><li><strong>Data access</strong> - Opening, updating, or deleting a document or spreadsheet (whatever the canonical unit of your product is).</li><li><strong>Billing</strong> - Updating billing or subscription info.</li><li><strong>Search / navigation</strong> - Using search, navigating around the product.</li></ul><p>Conversely, here are a few examples of things that you <em>shouldn’t</em> be including in your audit logs:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Performance data</strong> - How long a job took to run, CPU usage, etc.</li><li><strong>Internal tracing</strong> - Errors, exceptions, and stack traces.</li></ul><p>If you’re not sure what kind of events to include, look to other products and talk to your customers - they might have specific requirements custom to their compliance needs. <br></p><h5><strong>2. Event payloads and formatting</strong></h5><p>There’s no widely accepted standard for audit log payloads yet, so things are kind of a mess. The general rule of thumb is to include enough information to be useful, but nothing that doesn’t fit the audit log use case (e.g. product data). The typical format looks something like this:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>An actor </strong>- The ID of the user that’s carrying out the action (can also be the system).</li><li><strong>A group </strong>- The permission group(s) the user is part of, usually an organization ID or domain.</li><li><strong>An action type </strong>- The name of the event (password_changed, authentication_successful).</li><li><strong>Timestamp</strong> - A... timestamp. Keep things in UTC, as always.</li></ul><p>Unsurprisingly, there is at least one standard that’s gotten some traction: it’s called the <a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/resources/sites/MCAFEE/content/live/CORP_KNOWLEDGEBASE/78000/KB78712/en_US/CEF_White_Paper_20100722.pdf">Common Event Format</a> (CEF), and it comes from <a href="https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/siem-security-information-event-management/overview">ArcSight</a>, a SIEM provider (more on that later). The standard is aimed at making it easier to communicate between security systems, and prescribes a library of standard event fields like sourceHostName and and requestURL. However, in practice most audit log systems do not match the CEF.</p><p>Whether you follow the CEF or not, there’s one thing you can do: <strong>standardize internally</strong>. Keeping the same structure across all audit events will improve your user experience and make building your audit logs portal a lot easier. This is true across all product instrumentation, but doubly the case here - before building audit logs into your app, sit down with your stakeholders and customers to figure out which fields should be standard and required.<strong>‍</strong></p><h5><strong>3. Retention windows</strong></h5><p>If you’re supporting thousands of users, your audit logs will start to take up a good amount of space. They’ll also need to be indexed for fast search and filtering on various facets. Unnecessarily keeping audit logs forever isn’t always the right approach. Companies typically run a 90 day retention window and allow customers to pay for longer term storage such as 1 - 3 years. We’ve seen companies store these logs in relational stores like Postgres, search systems like Elasticsearch, and even as flat files in an S3 bucket. Another important note: audit logs should be immutable once they’re stored. That’s the whole point.<br></p><h5><strong>4. Building a frontend</strong></h5><p>Once you’ve set up the right system for emitting events on the backend, you’ll need to build a frontend to expose those events to your users. We’ve seen implementations as simple as a table with events in it, and as full-featured admin panels with search, filtering, sorting, and exporting to SIEM solutions (more on that later). What you build depends on the use cases your customers have: detailed frontends are useful if your users are going to interact with audit logs directly in your app, but can be overkill if you’re dealing with much larger customers who will want to export these logs to a different tool anyway.</p><figure id="w-node-ee3bce30d6ea-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f1f6295e9f2b67123846b07_Screen%20Shot%202020-07-27%20at%206.25.52%20PM.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Example audit logs UI from the WorkOS dashboard</figcaption></figure><p>Once you’ve got your events system and frontend in check, you’ve got one more thing to worry about: integration.</p><h2>Integrations: working with SIEM tools</h2><p>When you’re serving hundreds or thousands of users, combing through audit logs manually to find the data you need isn’t going to work. Enterprise admins use specialized tools called SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) to ingest audit logs and provide search, grouping, and visualization. The relationship here is somewhat similar to Elasticsearch / Kibana, where the visualization tool is purpose-built for a specific use case - but SIEM tools go further down the stack to manage storage and search. </p><p>One of the best known SIEM tools is <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/siem-security-information-and-event-management.html#:~:text=Splunk%20Enterprise%20Security%20(ES)%20is,real%2Dtime%20monitoring%20and%20more.">Splunk</a> – it’s a general purpose aggregation and visualization tool with features built specifically for audit logs. Another good example is <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-sentinel/#features">Sentinel</a>, an Azure specific SIEM from Microsoft. The general idea is that you get a dashboard that aggregates key events over time, as well as granular search and filtering for when you need to dive into specific patterns.</p><figure id="w-node-35807cb27f2b-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f1f54bbc283594367199c89_image%20(5).png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Enterprises will typically be using a SIEM tool like Sentinel, so your systems are going to need to integrate and export data, which, as you can probably guess, isn’t very much fun. Like <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">SSO and SAML</a>, each SIEM solution is going to have different ingestion requirements. Currently there are at least 35 <a href="https://codingcompiler.com/siem-tools-list/">popular SIEM providers</a> out there and many large enterprise admins have bespoke solutions too. You’re lucky if they only request to drop logs in an S3 bucket. We’ve even heard of IT admins wanting a streaming SSH tunnel of events.</p><h2>Walkthrough example: Slack</h2><p>To put all of this together, let’s take a look at a company that <a href="https://workos.com/blog/how-being-enterprise-ready-helps-slack-land-big-deals">has successfully moved upmarket</a> through building great enterprise-ready features: Slack. If you’re on the <a href="https://slack.com/pricing">Enterprise Grid plan</a>, Slack provides access to audit logs via a <a href="https://api.slack.com/enterprise/audit-logs#the_audit_event">read-only REST API</a> that covers pretty much any event that would be of interest to an IT admin or security team. Here are a few examples of the kinds of audit events that Slack retains:<br></p><ul role="list"><li><strong><em>workspace_created</em></strong> – Emitted when a new workspace is created.</li><li><strong><em>organization_created</em></strong> – Emitted when a new organization is created.</li><li><strong><em>ekm_enrolled</em></strong> – Emitted when an organization enrolls in Slack’s <a href="https://slack.com/enterprise-key-management">EKM.</a></li><li><strong><em>user_channel_join</em></strong> - Emitted when a user joins a channel.</li></ul><p>Each event comes with a semi-standard payload: an <strong>actor</strong> (the user who carried out the action), an <strong>action</strong> (the event type), an <strong>e…</strong></p></div></div></div></div>

<p>As you probably know, YouTube just sucks you in, especially with their recommended videos that seem so irresistible with their clickbait titles and thumbnails. I’ve found that the best way to protect against excessive YouTube binge watching was to turn off search and watch history. I’ll go through different approaches I’ve tried and explain why I’ve most recently settled on this method.</p>
<h2 id="methods-tried">Methods Tried</h2>
<hr>
<h3 id="blocking-youtube">1. Blocking YouTube</h3>
<p>I first tried to block YouTube entirely in the hopes that I would stop watching. I removed all YouTube apps from my phone and did a <code>hosts</code> file block of youtube.com on the computer. However, as I’m a software engineer, there were a lot of topics I needed to look up, like technical tutorials, or how to fix a certain bug. For your job or profession, or especially if you’re a student, there are many good videos on YouTube that have valuable information, so a blanket ban doesn’t make sense and can be quite inconvenient.</p>
<h3 id="unsubcribing">2. Unsubcribing</h3>
<p>I then unsubscribed from any channel that was unproductive, such as hardware news, cooking recipes, and crucially, “edutainment” like Wendover Productions, Binging with Babish, Kurzgesagt, and other such channels. These channels serve to keep you entertained under the guise of learning more, but really, when are you going to ever utilize this knowledge? I know I’ve never cooked anything from Babish’s videos, and when I did want to make something, I would just look up that specific topic on YouTube. Even if you do find it useful, it is probably only a few videos out of the myriad that they produce, so the signal to noise ratio is extremely high, and for me, it’s not worth wasting so much time for a fraction of the benefit.</p>
<p>I also tried unsubscribing from everything, but again, some channels are quite useful, such as technology conference talks relating to my field, so I couldn’t keep that up.</p>
<p>However, even though I unsubscribed, I still found myself watching videos from these channels, due to the YouTube recommendation engine knowing that you want to watch this type of content, so once you watch one video, it’ll keep receommending more videos from the same channel and similar videos from other channels. To solve this entirely, I needed to get rid of the recommendations themselves.</p>
<h3 id="turning-off-recommendations">3. Turning Off Recommendations</h3>
<p>This has worked the best out of the solutions I’ve tried. It allows me to not binge watch because YouTube doesn’t actually save what I’ve watched to recommend me anything, yet I can still subscribe to the channels I need. Because I rarely watch videos that YouTube recommends that aren’t in my domain of interest (viral videos, trending videos, etc), I just get bored with even going to the YouTube homepage. Sure, I can search up a creator and watch them that way, but most of my watching comes from impulsively clicking videos on the homepage so I don’t really care to even search up the channels.</p>
<p>To turn off recommendations, you’ll need to turn off and delete search and watch history altogether, which might be a deal breaker for some, but I’ve never really need to go back through my history, I just search for the video I want to find again and the vast majority of the time I find it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-turn-off-recommendations">How To Turn Off Recommendations</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols">Google’s My Activity - Activity Controls</a> and turn off YouTube Search History and YouTube Watch History.</li>
<li>Delete <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/item?restrict=yts">Youtube Search History</a> by clicking the trash can. This only removes it day by day so you can also do this via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/history">YouTube’s History section</a>. To get here, click the hamburger icon in the top left, then click history. You’ll then see an option to “Clear all watch history.” You can also delete watch history, comments, community posts and live chat comments here as well.</li>
<li>Delete <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/item?restrict=ytw">Youtube Watch History</a> by clicking the trash can, or delete it entirely as above.</li>
<li>(Optional) If you don’t like Google tracking your every move:
<ul>
<li>Look through and delete any of your activity on the same <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity">My Activity page</a>. It’s crazy how it tracks every single thing you search, what apps you open, how long you spend on each one, etc.</li>
<li>Look through and delete your <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/timeline">Timeline</a> activity which tracks where you’ve been geographically.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Optional) Hide YouTube’s recommended videos section entirely through the extension Distraction Free YouTube. Note that this just hides the section, but the problem I’ve had is that I could easily toggle it when I wanted to procrastinate. I can’t re-add my search history from the past if I stop tracking it via the above method, so it’s a more complete way of not binging YouTube. The best option may be to follow the steps above and then also add this extension.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna?hl=en">Chrome</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/df-youtube/">Firefox</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>(Optional) On your phone or tablet, delete any YouTube apps you have:
<ul>
<li>iOS - Delete your YouTube app by long pressing it until it wiggles. Then, click the X that comes up.</li>
<li>Android - Since YouTube is a system app that comes with the phone, you need to disable it which is effectively like deleting it. Go to Apps in your Settings and find the YouTube app. It should have a button to Disable. Tap it and follow the prompts.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There you have it, your YouTube should now be pristine, and it may finally help you kick the binge watching habit while still being useful for looking up productive videos.</p>

There’s definitely an element of standardizing care.”</p><p>To train the AI to recognize prostate cancer, Dhir and his colleagues provided images from more than a million parts of stained tissue slides taken from patient biopsies. Each image was labeled by expert pathologists to teach the AI how to discriminate between healthy and abnormal tissue. The algorithm was then tested on a separate set of 1,600 slides taken from 100 consecutive patients seen at UPMC for suspected prostate cancer.</p><p>During testing, the AI demonstrated 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity at detecting prostate cancer – significantly higher than previously reported for algorithms working from tissue slides.</p><figure data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="927"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/435a01a1856340e2c7eb9222ae1678ec/10f875c46ca6524d-e4/s1280x1920/a283e324a29ff753a78e53d7376e632e1bc44012.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1440" data-orig-height="927" width="1280" height="824"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Prostate biopsy with cancer probability (blue is low, red is high).

These all are clinically important features required as part of the pathology report.</p><p>AI also flagged six slides that were not noted by the expert pathologists.</p><p>But Dhir explained that this doesn’t necessarily mean that the machine is superior to humans. For example, in the course of evaluating these cases, the pathologist could have simply seen enough evidence of malignancy elsewhere in that patient’s samples to recommend treatment. For less experienced pathologists, though, the algorithm could act as a failsafe to catch cases that might otherwise be missed.</p><p>“Algorithms like this are especially useful in lesions that are atypical,” Dhir said. “A nonspecialized person may not be able to make the correct assessment. That’s a major advantage of this kind of system.”</p><p>While these results are promising, Dhir cautions that new algorithms will have to be trained to detect different types of cancer. The pathology markers aren’t universal across all tissue types. But he didn’t see why that couldn’t be done to adapt this technology to work with breast cancer, for example.</p><p>–</p><p><b>Source:&nbsp;<a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.upmc.com%2Fmedia%2Fnews%2F072720-dhir-prostate-ai-lancet&amp;t=ZmVmODQyMjQ0MmY1ZDM0Y2FjZmQyMWM3YmEyZGMyYjNiNWZlMzFmNyxhQVc1MFkyNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625008272238313472%2Fai-identifies-cancer-with-great-accuracy&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596284576">University of Pittsburgh</a></b></p><p><b>Full study:</b>&nbsp;“An artificial intelligence algorithm for prostate cancer diagnosis in whole slide images of core needle biopsies: a blinded clinical validation and deployment study”,&nbsp;<i>The Lancet Digital Health</i>.</p><p><a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi.org%2F10.1016%2FS2589-7500%2820%2930159-X&amp;t=MGRkNjY4OTZmZDI4OGJkNWM5MzU2ZjVhZmU0MjNlNzZiZTdjYjFiNixhQVc1MFkyNQ%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F625008272238313472%2Fai-identifies-cancer-with-great-accuracy&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1596284576">https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30159-X</a><br></p><h2><b>Read Also</b></h2><p><a href="https://nuadox.com/post/189795339262/ai-aml">AI can now detect acute myeloid leukemia (AML)</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="articleBody">
<p>I get more hits to my site and RSS feed in a typical month now than I used to get in a given year. For a fifteen year old blog that started life as a Perl CGI script in high school, it’s been wild to see. Whether you’re coming here from Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter, Discord, newsgroups, or the BSD Now podcast, hi! Sometimes I talk about tech here.</p>
<p>This marked increase in traffic corresponds with more feedback email, a not altogether insignificant number of which are negative. I’ll address some recurring themes here, because they’re Jason Bourne of the same misunderstanding of the kind of site people have come across.</p>
<p>Once you filter out the obvious trolls saying BSD is dead, Apple computers are for posers who value form over function, and that we’re all sheep for wearing a mask, most of the remainder concern the tone of my posts, and what they consider the ancillary topics I cover. They claim that my writing is too jovial, my site <a href="https://rubenerd.com/about/#mascot">mascot</a> drawn by Clara is inappropriate, and inclusion of posts about <a href="https://rubenerd.com/josh-on-how-to-peel-garlic/" title="Josh on how to peel garlic">cooking garlic</a> are a waste of time and somehow detract from my serious technical and political posts.</p>
<p><em>(One gentleman spent an inordinate amount of time criticising Rubi’s skirt in such lurid detail I felt but the tiniest twinge of what women must feel as creepy men ogle them walking past).</em></p>
<p>I appreciate—most of—the feedback, but respectfully disagree. There may not be many of us doing this anymore, but this is specifically a personal blog. This site has always been a labour of love for me since I started it in high school in 2004, and will necessarily be about stuff that’s on my mind and that I’m interested in. There are drier technical blogs by people I respect out there, but that’s not my style.</p>
<p>I’m also unsure how one can quantify detraction in this context. I remember having a similar debate with a WikiProject Albums contributor, who claimed compilation album articles similarly detracted from the quality of Wikipedia. In a finite space like a newspaper or book that might make sense, but in an electronic medium it seems to me the easiest solution is to ignore things in which you have no interest. Your also free to find an anime mascot drawn by my girlfriend offensive, just as I’m free to include her to make the world a slightly nicer place.</p>
<p>Which dovetails to the third comment which I take more seriously. I haven’t received permission to quote their email, but in summary they said my serious posts about COVID, social security, and attitudes in open source software communities are valuable, but sporadic. The implication is it’s incumbent upon me to only discuss important topics, and that by including what amounts to sidebars I’m trivialising them.</p>
<p>This one, selfishly, comes down to self-preservation. I need to write about the intricacies of BSD text editors and fun engineering or cooking videos to afford me sufficient mental fortitude to discuss serious topics. Sometimes we all need a break, and this is how I do it.</p>
<p>As I wrote on my <a href="https://rubenerd.com/the-first-post/">first post</a> fifteen years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… it’s a blog site with random stuff on it that I think is groovy, weird etc … maybe one percent of it, or maybe two, might be useful to someone, especially with respect to some of the tech problems I’ve had and solved over the years. So here it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<![CDATA[How to STOP everything being so critical and urgent]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  

  

  <p>You can read this post in Spanish <a href="https://stanete.com/es/incident-management">here</a>.</p>

<p>At some point in a <em>Product Engineering</em> team you will be tired of every <a href="https://xkcd.com/1700/">bug</a> or issue being urgent and critical. This usually happens after dealing with several problems informed by late night Slack messages. At this point nobody really knows which issue is an urgent incident, which is worth waiting to the next morning and which isn’t even something worth solving. All this is harmful for the team’s culture and for the business itself. When everything becomes urgent, nothing is urgent and nobody cares anymore.</p>

<p>Unlike other processes, Incident Management doesn’t emerge naturally. It’s a defensive mechanism agains <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdTMuivYF30">chaos</a>; it needs to be created and agreed on.</p>

<p>You can’t fix it all at once and you can’t do perfect from the beginning. But you need to start somewhere. This post is about how to go from having nothing related to Incidenct Management to having something.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2>

<p>You may feel the urge to adopt <a href="https://response.pagerduty.com/">Pager Duty’s incident response process</a> or <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/handbook/incident-response">Atlassian’s Incident Management process</a>. Or even to use what’s in this post. Be careful. I’m writting what has worked for my team. Don’t just copy. You have a brain. Use it.</p>

<p>My team literally has all this written down in a Counfluence page. Writting it down is not enought. Everyone should agree to use it. You need to educate through workshops, talks and training sessions giving real life examples and making sure everybody understands the basic process you are about to set in place. Everybody must be on board.</p>

<p>First thing you probably need to address is everything being urgent and critial. For that you need to define what is really an <a href="https://xkcd.com/838/">incident</a> and a few severity levels. Give some real life examples and instructions on how to report each incident. Don’t worry if it isn’t perfect. With every incident you will adapt and iterate over it.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-incident">What is an incident</h2>

<p>An incident is an event that causes disruption to a service or a reduction in the quality of a service which requires an emergency response.</p>

<p>That las part is important. Emergency response. An incident has such an impact that gives someone the right to disturb somebody else’s life.</p>

<h2 id="severity-levels">Severity levels</h2>

<p>When you detect an incident try to analyze the impact and apply a severity level. What is severity? The severity of an incident is derived based on the effect of that incident on the system. It indicates the level of threat and how can it affect the system.</p>

<h3 id="sev1">Sev1</h3>

<p>Critical incident that involves irreversible damage to the company or brand reputation, it must be solved instantly even if it means to take the site down. This should never happen.</p>

<p>Example: Security vulnerability exposing customer data, images showing violent content appear on the home page, customer accounts have been hacked.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Call the responsible Engineering Manager.</p>

<h3 id="sev2">Sev2</h3>

<p>Critical system incident actively impacting many customers’ ability to use the product. It is an incident which is a major blocker and has affected the functionality of the whole service. It affects the business as a whole.</p>

<p>Example: Showing big differences in prices, discounts that shouldn’t exist but apply to all the products, site down.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Send a message on Slack on the #radar channel. If nobody responds in 10 minutes, call the responsible Engineering Manager. The fix is to be deployed as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="sev3">Sev3</h3>

<p>Stability or minor customer-impacting incidents that require immediate attention from service owners. Priority number one for the team involved. It can be fixed the next morning.</p>

<p>Example: One category is not working. Emails are not being sent.</p>

<p>Typical Response: Send a message on Slack on the #radar channel. If it happens out of office time it could be fixed the next day.</p>

<h3 id="sev4">Sev4</h3>

<p>Minor issues, cosmetic issues or bugs, requiring action, but not affecting customer ability to use the product, must be prioritized.</p>

<p>Example: One customer didn’t receive a confirmation email. One customer bought an item without stock. The image of a product is not correct.</p>

<p>Typical response: Only in working hours. Talk to the Product Owner and Team Lead of the team responsible for the service/feature.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/bug_fixing.png" alt=""></p>

<p>An incident’s severity level can be upgraded if it is not solved in a resonable amount of time. If that happens, you’ll need to take more severe and drastic actions.</p>

<h2 id="incident-response">Incident response</h2>

<p>Keep calm. Don’t pressure anybody. People work and communicat poorly under pressure.</p>

<p>You don’t need to set up all the roles of a mature <em>Incident Management</em> process. The most important one that you do need is the <strong>Communications Manager</strong> or <strong>Communications Lead</strong>. Somebody will take this role during an incident. This person keeps everybody informed about the status of the situation. What has been detected, what is being investigated, what the team has found, timeframe for resolution, actions that are being taken, etc.</p>

<p>If updates are not communicated regularly people get nervious. Even a message like <em>“We are still investigating.”</em> helps to keep the nerves under control. Give updates every few minutes. It may seem like a lot but believe me, it’s not. When in crisis mode, overcommunicate. I can’t stress this enough.</p>

<p>Later on you can add other roles as <strong>Commander</strong> or <strong>Deputy</strong>, set up <strong>On-Call</strong> processes, etc. All depending on your needs and customized to your organization and culture.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>Start small. Something is better than nothing. And done is better than perfect. Educate and give people time to understand and use the process. Ask for feedback, use each postmortem to analyze the Incident Management process and try to improve it just a tiny bit.</p>

<p>Rustling leaves, light rain at the window, a quietly ticking clock - muffled sounds, just above the threshold of hearing. One moment we perceive them, the next we don't, even if we, or the sounds, don't seem to change. Many studies have shown that we never process an incoming stimulus, be it a sound, an image, or a touch, in the same way. This is true, even if the stimulus is exactly the same. This occurs because the impact a stimulus makes, on the brain regions that process it, depends on the momentary state of the networks those brain regions belong to. However, the factors that influence and underlie the constantly fluctuating momentary state of the networks and whether these states are random or follow a rhythm, was previously unknown.</p>
<p>Now, scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (MPI CBS) in Leipzig, Germany, have discovered that the sensitivity of the network state, at the time the stimulus-related information reaches the cerebral cortex, influences how strongly the brain reacts to the stimulus. Depending on the network state, certain nerve cells in &nbsp;this so-called primary somatosensory cortex can be more or less ‘excitable’, which shapes the following stimulus processing in the brain. This means that the brain's response is modulated already at the entry to the cerebral cortex and depends on more than how the stimulus is evaluated at higher, downstream levels.</p>
<p>"There is always a certain amount of activity between the neurons of a network, even if there are apparently no external influences on us. So, the system is never completely still or inactive," explains Tilman Stephani, PhD student at the MPI CBS and first author of the study, which has now been published in the Journal of Neuroscience. Rather, information is constantly arising, from inside the body about our heartbeat, digestion, or breathing, information about our position in space, the temperature, and internally generated thoughts. In addition, intrinsic neuronal activity occurs even if neuronal networks are isolated from any input. This constantly affects the excitability of various brain networks. "The dynamics from internal processes are thus associated with the system´s excitability and therefore, also the stimulus response," says Stephani. "So, the brain does not seem to function like a computer where the same incoming information always means the same reaction."</p>
<p><strong>Fluctuation between highly and less excitable moments does not occur at random</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that fluctuations of cortical excitability do not occur completely at random but rather show a certain temporal pattern: The excitability at one moment depends on previous network states and influences subsequent ones. Scientists refer to this as long-range temporal dependency or long-lasting autocorrelation.</p>
<p>The fact that cortical excitability varies in this special way suggests that neuronal networks are poised at a so-called “critical” state, where there is a delicate balance between excitation and inhibition of the network. Earlier theoretical and empirical studies have indicated that such “criticality” may be a fundamental principle underlying brain functioning where information transmission and capacity are maximized. Stephani and colleagues now provide evidence that this principle may govern the variability of sensory brain responses in the human brain, too. Presumably, this serves as an adaptive mechanism of the brain to cope with the variety of information that is constantly arriving from the environment. A single stimulus should neither excite the entire system at once nor fade away too quickly.</p>
<figure data-description="<p>How strongly the cortex is excitable by a stimulus (lightning symbol) is not left to chance.

        <p>How strongly the cortex is excitable by a stimulus (lightning symbol) is not left to chance.

</figure>


<p>However, it is still unknown whether greater excitability leads to a more salient experience. In other words, do the study participants perceive the intensity of the stimuli different depending on the instantaneous excitability? This is now being tested in a second study. "But other processes can also play a role here," explains Stephani. "Attention, for example. If you direct it to something else, a first, strong brain response can still occur. However, higher brain processes downstream may then prevent it from being consciously perceived."</p>
<p>The experiments were carried out by examining the response of participants’ brains to thousands of small successive electrical currents. These stimuli were applied to the participants´ forearms to stimulate the main nerve in the arm. This, in turn, produced an initial reaction 20 milliseconds later in a specific area of the brain, the somatosensory cortex. Based on the evoked EEG patterns, they were able to see how easily each individual stimulus excited the brain.</p>

        <p>Debugging an MCU requires attaching a debugger via JTAG and halting the core. Or does it?</p>

<p>There are many situations where this debug strategy is not feasible such as on</p>

<ul>
  <li>production units where JTAG has been disabled.</li>
  <li>systems where halting the core causes the subsystem you are trying to debug to
fault. (i.e Asserts from the NRF52 SoftDevice after halting at a breakpoint<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">1</a></sup>)</li>
  <li>remote systems where only a UART or network interface is exposed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately, ARM Cortex-M’s have us covered!</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->

<p>This week we explore how to debug running systems with ARM Cortex-M’s DebugMonitor
exception handler. We cover how to configure the MCU to operate in this mode and walk through an
example of installing breakpoints and single-stepping on a running device!</p>

<!-- excerpt end -->

<blockquote>
  <p>In my opinion, DebugMonitor handling is an underutilized feature that can be applied creatively
for a variety of debug use cases. I hope by the end of this article I can convince you of this as well!</p>

<h2 id="basic-terminology">Basic Terminology</h2>

<p>ARM Cortex-M’s support several “levels” of debug:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Halting debug</strong> - This is the typical configuration you use with a debugger like GDB. In this mode, the core is
halted while debugging. This mode requires access to the <strong>Debug Port</strong> via JTAG or SWD. We’ve
walked through an overview of how ARM debug interfaces work in <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/a-deep-dive-into-arm-cortex-m-debug-interfaces">this article</a>.</li>
  <li>Tracing via the <strong><a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/profiling-firmware-on-cortex-m">ITM</a></strong>,
<strong>DWT</strong> &amp; <strong>ETM</strong> - These peripherals let you stream instruction execution and data
accesses while the system is running. Tools such as Lauterbach’s Trace32<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">2</a></sup> and SEGGER’s JTrace<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9">3</a></sup>
can decode these streams and present results in a GUI on your desktop.</li>
  <li><strong>Debug monitor mode</strong> - Enables debug on running systems via the DebugMonitor exception
handler. This can be helpful in scenarios where halting the core will cause timing
sensitive subsystems to fail or for use cases where connecting a debugger is not feasible.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s worth noting that debug monitor support is not available for the ARMv6-M architecture
(Cortex-M0). However, it is implemented for all other Cortex-M architectures.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="example-project-setup">Example Project Setup</h2>

<p>In the following sections, we will explore how to set up Debug monitor mode with a very simple bare-metal application running on a nRF52 using the following tooling:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a nRF52840-DK<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">4</a></sup> (ARM Cortex-M4F) as our development board</li>
  <li>SEGGER JLinkGDBServer<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">5</a></sup> as our GDBServer (V6.80b)</li>
  <li>GCC 9.3.1 / GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain as our compiler<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">6</a></sup></li>
  <li>GNU Make as our build system</li>
  <li>the simple CLI shell <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/firmware-shell">we built up in a previous post</a>.</li>
  <li>PySerial’s <code>miniterm.py</code><sup id="fnref:miniterm"><a href="#fn:miniterm">7</a></sup> to connect to the serial console on the nRF52.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this article, we will extend upon the <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/cortex-m-breakpoints">example app we built to explore how breakpoints work</a>.</p>

<h2 id="enabling-the-debugmonitor-exception">Enabling the DebugMonitor Exception</h2>

<p>Debug monitor mode based debugging works by triggering an exception known as the “DebugMonitor
Exception” when debug events take place. We’ll explore how to configure the handler in the
following sections.</p>

<h3 id="debug-halting-control-and-status-register-dhcsr-0xe000edf0">Debug Halting Control and Status Register (DHCSR), 0xE000EDF0</h3>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/debugmon/dhcsr.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Monitor Mode Debug only works if halting debug is disabled. Notably, the <code>C_DEBUGEN</code> setting
above must be cleared. This bit can <em>only</em> be set via the JTAG/SWD connection and is <em>only</em> reset when a full
Power-On-Reset (POR) occurs or a debugger clears the bit on exit.</p>

<p>If you are trying to use Monitor Mode Debug, I recommend adding a check on boot for
this. Otherwise, you are bound to confuse yourself when you are trying to test the feature and have a debugger connected via JTAG/SWD:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>bool</span> <span>debug_monitor_enable</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>volatile</span> <span>uint32_t</span> <span>*</span><span>dhcsr</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>0xE000EDF0</span><span>;</span>

    <span>EXAMPLE_LOG</span><span>(</span><span>"Halting Debug Enabled - "</span>

    <span>return</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// code to set up debug monitor mode</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="tip-disabling-halting-debug-from-gdb">TIP: Disabling Halting Debug from GDB</h4>

<p>If you are using GDB, Halting Mode debug can be disabled manually by clearing <code>C_DEBUGEN</code> and setting
the appropriate value for <code>DBGKEY</code> (0xA05F):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(gdb) set *(uint32_t*)0xE000EDF0=(0xA05F&lt;&lt;16)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can also be a useful way to keep an active GDB session open and probe its state while
the system is running!</p>

<h3 id="debug-exception-and-monitor-control-register-demcr-0xe000edfc">Debug Exception and Monitor Control Register (DEMCR), 0xE000EDFC</h3>

<p>The core configuration for the DebugMonitor exception is controlled in the upper 16 bits of the
<code>DEMCR</code> register:</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/debugmon/demcr.png" alt=""></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>MON_EN</code> - Controls whether the DebugMonitor exception is enabled or not. When enabled, debug
“events” will cause the exception to fire.</li>
  <li><code>MON_PEND</code> - Can be used to trigger a DebugMonitor exception irrespective of whether or not
<code>MON_EN</code> is set to 1.</li>
  <li><code>MON_REQ</code> - Not used by the MCU. Software can use this bit to convey state about monitor mode.</li>
  <li><code>MON_STEP</code> - Can be toggled from the DebugMonitor exception to enable hardware
single-stepping. When set, upon return from the exception handler, the core will execute a single instruction and then return to the DebugMonitor exception.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: The lower bits (<code>VC_HARDERR</code>, etc) controls whether or not a debug trap occurs automatically when
various types of exceptions take place. These <em>only</em> take effect when using <strong>halting debug</strong>
mode. They allow you to guarantee the system is halted any time an exception path is hit which can be useful
when trying to debug!</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="debugmonitor-exception-configuration-nuances">DebugMonitor Exception Configuration Nuances</h4>

<p>The DebugMonitor exception will only be triggered for debug events when the group priority of the
exception is greater than the current execution priority.</p>

<p>This can be a useful feature to guarantee that certain high priority operations (i.e Bluetooth
radio scheduling) continue to run while you step through the code in other parts of the system.</p>

<p>An important consequence however is it does mean any interrupts running above this priority of the
DebugMonitor exception will not be debuggable when using debug monitor support.</p>

<p>Configuring the DebugMonitor exception priority will require updating <code>SHPR3</code>. More details can be
found in <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/arm-cortex-m-exceptions-and-nvic#system-handler-priority-register-shpr1-shpr3---0xe000ed18---0xe000ed20">our post about ARM Cortex-M exception handling</a>.</p>

<h3 id="c-code-to-enable-the-debugmonitor-exception">C Code to Enable the DebugMonitor Exception</h3>

<p>For simplicity in our example app we will set the DebugMonitor exception to the lowest configurable
interrupt priority. This means all other interrupts will be able to run while debugging code not
running from an interrupt.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, we have:</p>

<p>When the DebugMonitor Exception fires, the DFSR can be inspected for information about what debug
event took place:</p>

<p><img src="https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/img/debugmon/dfsr.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Some of the events are only possible when using a <strong>halting debug</strong>. For the DebugMonitor the
states of interest are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>DWTTRAP</code> Indicates the a debug event was generated due to a configuration in the DWT.</li>
  <li><code>BKPT</code> Indicates one or more breakpoint event took place (either via the FPB or a BKPT instruction).</li>
  <li><code>HALTED</code> Indicates the core was halted due to a MON_STEP request.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: DFSR bits are sticky and you have to write 1 to the value to clear them</p>

And I love it. By planning out my days with a simple pen and paper, I have become more productive and less stressed.</p><p>To help others decide whether they should try bullet journaling, I thought I'd write about why I love it and how I use it, with some caveats at the end.</p><h2>The Basics of Bullet Journaling</h2><p>Bullet journaling, reduced to its simplest form, is merely a pen, paper, and a legend. It was created by Ryder Carroll, who describes it as a tool to "help you track the past, organize the present, and plan for the future."</p><p>The system is based on planning your days by writing a list of tasks that can be marked as done or rescheduled. For long-term planning, yearly and weekly overviews can be created and easily referenced when writing down daily tasks and events. </p><h2>Why I Love It</h2><p>Bullet journaling has three main advantages that distinguish it from Google Calendar, Todoist, and similar digital tools. It keeps a permanent trace of events, is tangible, and offers amazing flexibility.</p><h3>Permanence</h3><p>By default, bullet journaling is a permanent way to keep track of life. As it is paper and pen based, everything written down leaves a trace. If you want to reschedule or delete a task or event, you can annotate it with an arrow or cross it out. There is no erasing. Although this might seem scary at first, it is incredibly helpful as it helps with reflection and weekly reviews.</p><p>Weekly reviews, which is part of the Getting Things Done methodology by productivity consultant David Allen, helps you tie up loose ends, schedule important tasks that came up during the week, and be mindful of the progress you made.</p><h3>Tangible</h3><p>With the arrival of the Digital Revolution, I think the value of tangibility and analog systems is becoming underrated. Digital tools have amazing features, but it can quickly become too complex and overwhelming. Being able to flip through actual pages and slowly write down tasks and events has helped me be calm in the midst of a chaotic world. Writing down my tasks, which takes more time than typing them out, makes me give more thought to the importance of each task.  And since paper is not of infinite size, I find it easy to avoid over-scheduling my time and energy. This helps with mindful productivity, <a href="https://nesslabs.com/mindful-productivity-2">a sustainable way to work and think</a>.</p><p>An obvious difference between bullet journaling and digital tools is the lack of notifications. However, by writing everything down and having my journal in front of me at all times, I find that I remember tasks effortlessly and don't need to be bombarded with notifications. I am less stressed this way as I don't need to worry about missing a notification since everything is stored in my brain. In a sense, the lack of notifications is a plus.</p><h3>Flexible</h3><p>Since the entire journal is a blank canvas, it is up to the user to create everything. It allows me to be creative and organize my weeks depending on the amount of work I have. I can also add extra features, such as habit trackers, book reviews, and idea spaces. This not only helps with having complete control over planning your days, but also helps with exploring fun creativity.</p><h2>How I Use It</h2><p>I start with a yearly overview, called a "future log", that allows me to note important events, deadlines, and birthdays. For each month of the year, I create a mini monthly calendar on the left, and leave space on the right for writing down those important dates. I then reference the future log when creating my monthly and weekly spreads to make sure I don't miss anything important.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>My monthly overviews consist of a large calendar that fills up two pages. The boxes can be filled in with important dates, and the remaining space contains my additional features like trackers and project ideas.</p><p><span>

    </span></p><p>Finally, the most interesting spread: my weekly overviews. I have experimented with a lot of layouts, but the essentials are the same. I write down my tasks and events under the corresponding day, and then annotate them with my legend elements. Mine is currently as follows:</p><ul><li>dot: task</li><li>crossed-out dot: completed task</li><li>circle: event</li><li>filled-out circle: completed event</li><li>line-through: cancelled task or event</li><li>right-arrow: rescheduled task or event</li><li>left-arrow: task or event needs to be rescheduled

    </span></p><h2>Some Caveats</h2><h3>The Shiny New Object Syndrome</h3><p>Planning your life on paper with a new system will not automatically help you take control of real life. Like most tools, the bullet journaling system is a method to support you in being more productive, but will not do the work for you. You still need to do the tasks you have written down, and be fully present at the events you have scheduled. If your existing method works, then stick with it instead of taking the effort to transition to a new system.</p><h3>Dangers of Permanence</h3><p>Organizing in general can be a great way to plan and be productive. However, with a pen and paper, you can easily run into the soul-sucking problem of over-organizing. With a limited amount of space and no possibility of erasing, it can be easy to fall into the trap of needing to plan every minute detail to fit in nicely within the confines of the page. Since the future is uncertain and nothing ever goes to plan, this is practically impossible. Instead, feel comfortable with getting a bit messy and imperfect. It's all part of the process and gives you a better and accurate view of reality.
Having to leave tasks unchecked and needing to be rescheduled or crossed out can be another problem for those with a perfectionist eye. You may want to leave it as it is, and hope you finish the task miraculously before the end of the day. In the beginning, this might work as your motivation for aesthetics triumphs your low levels of energy and motivation for the task itself. In the long run, however, this is unsustainable and can leave you drained. Just reschedule the task! Being able to see what types of tasks you reschedule and the crossed out scribbles is a good method to assess your workflow.</p><p>It's better to view bullet journaling as a guideline to go about your day instead of a strict schedule. My bullet journal is filled with scribbles and random thoughts, which I didn't enjoy in the beginning. Over time, as I realized that aesthetics will not help me with my task, bullet journal has taught me to be okay with imperfection. As long as I'm moving towards my goals, that's perfect enough.</p><h3>The Invasion of Aesthetics</h3><p>Wanting something to look nice can be great, as long as it does not impede on its usefulness. With bullet journaling, a blank page means unlimited creativity and this can turn into a problem. A few weeks ago, I made the following spread:

I had taken inspiration from Pinterest, and I loved how it looked. However, in terms of practicality, it was useless. I could write three events at max, and tasks were just not written down. That meant I had to memorize what to do, so naturally, I forgot to do a few items on my list.</p><p>The advice that comes out of this: be as creative as you want until it hinders the use. I like to add a bit of cursive writing, a few drawings, colors, and that's it.  I like to be a bit creative as it helps me associate certain events and text with colors and drawings I made that week. You can also be like my brother and not have any colors or defined layout as long as it works.</p><h2>Tl;dr</h2><p>Bullet journaling is an effective way to increase mindful productivity and reduce stress. By being tangible and simple, a journal keeps a permanent record of tasks allows for the user to express their creativity and adapt the system to their needs.</p><p>To avoid becoming hopelessly entangled with digital tools and notifications, try bullet journaling.</p></section></div></div>]]>

    </span></p><p>Most of us have been given the same advice: to become a better problem solver, you need to solve more problems. But this advice is too simplistic. Getting good at anything requires more than just reps. It’s also <em>how</em> you go about it.</p><p>Besides, when programmers hear the advice “solve more problems,” they often think that “more” means faster. It’s a mistake I made when starting out. </p><p>The problem-solving treadmill can be detrimental to learning and improving. Early on I’d speed through one problem and head to the next. But the reality of that approach soon set in. By focusing on quantity, I compromised quality and missed key learnings along the way.   </p><p>It’s not to say that repetition doesn’t matter; it does. However, repetition alone doesn’t get to the heart of the matter. The process does.</p><p>I have a vested interest in this topic: I want to get better at solving problems in order to improve as a programmer. So here I offer my plan of attack. It involves reps to be sure—and a whole lot more.</p><h2>1. Solve a Variety of Problems on a Variety of Platforms</h2><p>“I was obsessed with HackerRank when I began learning to code,” said an instructor of a Python course I was taking. Although it’s fine to have a favorite platform, don’t limit yourself to a single one. Here’s why: you need to be ready for anything.</p><p>One goal of mine is to toggle smoothly among different problem types and across different platforms. The problems on Interview Cake are different than those in Reuven Lerner’s book, <em>Python Workout</em>. Likewise I find the problem statements in Lerner’s Weekly Python Exercise different from those on HackerRank.</p><p>I have my preferences, to be sure. However, I need to be able to solve problems of all types. So I’m using a variety of platforms and resources to get practice.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>LeetCode</li><li>Interview Cake</li><li><em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em> by Gayle Laakmann McDowell</li><li>Exercism</li><li><em>Python Workout</em> by Reuven Lerner</li><li>Weekly Python Exercise by Reuven Lerner</li></ul><p>On Sundays, when I make <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/working-in-blocks-of-time">my plan</a> for the week ahead, I select a few problems from the above resources. I’m deliberate about it. For example, I’ll pick a problem that focuses on binary search from LeetCode. Then, one that focuses on data structures from one of Reuven Lerner’s sources. </p><p>This practice prevents me from getting too comfortable. I can’t rely on the same data structure or technique. I need to be able to pick the best tool for the job. I’ve got to be able to pivot. </p><p>It also challenges me. That’s because I select problems that push me to the edge of my limits, a feature of what psychologist Anders Ericsson calls “deliberate practice.”</p><p>Deliberate practice is all about skill development. It’s a fully-focused, conscious effort that takes you out of your “comfort zone,” centers on a specific goal, and “demands near-maximal effort,” Ericsson explains in his excellent book, <em>Peak</em>.</p><p>In other words, you’re not going through the motions doing something that comes easy or natural. “The hallmark of . . . deliberate practice,” Ericsson writes, “is that you try to do something you cannot do.”</p><h2>2. Cross-Train Your Programming Brain</h2><p>You often hear about athletes who incorporate cross-training into their routine. For example, a runner completes a bike workout or two each week. It makes a lot of sense: by cross-training athletes push their cardiovascular fitness from a different angle.</p><p><a href="https://amymhaddad.com/why-you-should-cross-train-your-programming-brain">Cross-training for programmers</a> is a topic I’ve written about before. Yet, more needs to be said about the benefits of this approach. Just like an athlete cross-trains to improve their cardiovascular fitness, I’m incorporating cross-training to improve my mental fitness. </p><p>My cross-training involves solving math problems. I apply the same tactics I’d use to solve a programming problem but in mathematics. Same process, different context. </p><p>My current math book is one to note: <em>The Art of Problem Solving</em>. Yes, it provides the cross-training benefits mentioned above. But it’s doing something more: it’s helping me build my intuition for solving problems. </p><p>That’s an important point. I don’t want to memorize a math equation or process. I want to intuitively know when to use it. The same is true when solving programming problems.  </p><h2>3. Learn from Your Solutions</h2><p>All of us get stuck and all of us get errors while problem-solving. We use these failures to help us figure out what to do differently. </p><p>Oftentimes that’s where the learning stops. Once we’ve solved the problem we’re anxious to move along. But don’t. </p><p>Mathematician Richard Hamming suggests that’s when the learning should begin. </p><p>“I regard the study of successes as being basically more important than the study of failures...there are so many ways of being wrong and so few of being right, studying successes is more efficient,” Hamming writes in his book, <em>The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</em>.</p><p>This idea of "looking back" and studying your successes is a topic I've <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/when-are-you-done-with-a-programming-problem/">written about previously</a>, and it's worth noting again.
You always hear about how we need to "learn from our failures." But Hamming is right: there's so much to learn from our successes.</p><p>So one of the biggest changes I’ve made to my problem-solving process is putting Hamming’s words to practice. I vividly recall solving my first problem that involved a linked list, a data structure that was new to me at the time. After I solved the problem, I studied it intently. I copied my solution into a Google Doc file and used comments to explain the code to myself. </p><p>I wanted to ensure I clearly understood <em>what</em> I did and <em>why</em> for this critical reason: so I could do it again. </p><h2>4. Get Feedback</h2><p>Awareness can be a wonderful teacher. </p><p>Don’t assume your solutions are great. Find out for yourself by getting feedback. Feedback is a critical factor when it comes to getting better. It’s also a component of deliberate practice.</p><p>There are two ways I’m getting feedback.</p><p>First, after I complete a problem, I study the solutions of others. Sometimes resources, like LeetCode and <em>Cracking the Coding Interview</em>, provide the solution. Other times I find the solution of a programmer who’s solved the same problem. Sometimes use both.</p><p>Either way, the next step is the same: I start at the top of the solution and explain each line in my own words. I speculate <em>why</em> the programmer chose this particular data structure, for example. Then, I write a short summary of the program to solidify the core concepts or new approaches that I just learned about.</p><p>Putting something complicated, like a line of code, into your own words is a great test to see if you really understand it. Plus, you get practice at another core skill: <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/why-reading-code-matters">reading code</a>.</p><p>If there’s something that’s new to me, I research it. I compare their code to my own. I study. I evaluate. I learn. It’s an arduous process, but I get so much from it.</p><p>The second way to get feedback is to simply ask another programmer for it. Video calls are helpful to step through code line by line in real time. Although, pull requests are useful, too.</p><p>There’s a point to the feedback: apply it! Put your learnings into practice.</p><h2>5. Be Consistent</h2><p>Now let’s talk about repetition. Problem-solving is a skill. Like any skill, it takes time to build. It simply doesn’t happen overnight or over a weekend. That’s why I devote time each day to problem-solving. </p><p>There’s a common reaction to this daily practice: “There’s too much to learn. I can’t spend time each day problem-solving.”</p><p>My response is two-fold. First, there’s always going to be something more to learn, <em>always</em>. </p><p>Second, in large part programming <em>is</em> problem-solving. It's fundamental to our craft. It’s worthy of your time and attention each day. Here’s the caveat: make your daily practice intentional. </p><h2>It’s an Art</h2><p>Many people regard problem-solving as an art. I happen to agree with that sentiment. The same can be said for the process itself. </p><p>The ideas outlined in this article are my approach for getting better at problem-solving. Your approach may look very different. The point is this: be intentional about your practice. Quality matters; make each problem count.</p><p><a href="https://amymhaddad.com/"><br>← back to all posts</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>There's a deceptive allure to a rewrite.  The logic can go something like this: </p>

<p>
The system is already in production, we obviously know how it works, so we just need to port what we have to a better platform, and once we're there things will be easier.
</p>

<p>In this chapter, we're going to rip this basic intuition to shreds.  Rewrites, as we'll see, are anything but easy.  While they may be immune to some of the challenges of a nascent app, they introduce completely new ones we often don't anticipate.  In order to successfully deliver a rewrite, we must navigate these challenges, and so it's important to understand what they are up front.  
</p>

<p>
Before we get into the hazards of a rewrite though, let's tell a quick origin story.  How did we get here in the first place?  
</p>

<h3>The Rewrite Origin Story</h3>
<p>
It all starts in the <i>Greenfield Development</i> stage, where we take an idea and begin to build from it a functioning application.  After weeks or months of dogged effort, something is eventually <i>Launched</i> to "market" (which may be actual paying customers, or just  a set of internal business users, etc.).  If the app is well received, it lives in the equilibrium stage of <i>Enhancement</i> for some period of time, where new features are added and defects are resolved.  Everyone is happy.  Eventually though, <a href="http://www.bennorthrop.com/Essays/2019/the-trouble-with-tech-debt.php">technical debt</a> can accumulate, and we begin to see <i>Diminishing Returns</i> in our effort - whereas a week of development used to be enough to add an entire new feature, it might barely suffice now to change the color of a button.  
</p>

<img src="http://www.bennorthrop.com/rewrite-or-refactor-book/rewrite-lifecycle.png">
<p>
It's at this point that we might question whether it's worth sinking money and time into a lost cause.  Further, since the app was first launched, some exciting new technologies have probably emerged, and we may have some grand visions for how they could be leveraged to make our app more resilient, easier to work with, performant, etc.  And so we begin to make a plan for a rewrite.  The idea is to freeze development on the existing system for some short period of time, and then shift resources over to work on the replacement system.  We'll first build the foundation (using more modern patterns, tools, languages, etc.) and then next migrate the existing functionality into it.  Users will just need to ride out the "pause" (i.e. not get any new updates), but when the rewritten system is in place, productivity should be twofold (or more!) what it was before.
</p>

<p>
And while this "lift and shift" plan seems straight forward, it belies some critical risks - technical, organizational, and psychological factors all conspire to make this <i>Rewrite</i> stage extremely precarious.  Moreover, the longer this phase drags out, the lower the chance we will make it out (i.e. deliver the replacement).  So let's take a look at some of the dangers that lurk within...
</p>

<h3>Parallel Development</h3>
<p>
The first hazard we often confront on our journey is the realization that a rewrite is fundamentally a dual prong effort.  Sure, on the technology side we'd love to think we can pause development to focus only on writing code in the new platform, but reality (and more specifically, the business) rarely abides.  Maybe in order to win (or keep) an important customer, the business demands we add some new feature to the existing system NOW.  Or maybe a third-party system has changed its API and we need to refactor, or a sev-1 defect pops up, or a new government regulation is written.  The point is, <b>almost never can a production system sit static in space and time for long</b>, and that's true even during a rewrite period.  Some care and maintenance will inevitably be necessary on the old system, which means parallel development.
</p>

<p>
The first problem here is that developing in parallel violates that principle we developers hold most sacred: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">Don't Repeat Yourself</a>.  Any change made to the legacy system will need to be ported into the new system as well.  For example, if we add feature X into the old stack, we must add X again in the new one (but this time write it in the new language or framework).  And that duplicative effort applies for the testing, project management, build, and deployment of X as well.  Essentially, whatever it would cost (in time or resources) to make a change to the legacy system, it could now, during this rewrite phase, easily cost double.  
</p>

<p>
Even more, depending on how far along the rewrite effort is, the change (e.g. feature, defect fix, etc.) might need to be made to a part of the source code that has not yet been rewritten, and so the team will have to remember and account for it when they get there (which will then push the timeline back for the rewrite).  Or in the opposite case, the change is in a section of the app that has <i>already</i> been rewritten, and so the team has to circle back and make updates to code that was just migrated (and then re-test, etc.).  Either way, the parallel development element of a rewrite can make it feel like the team is keeping a plane flying while also building its replacement on the ground.  For the safety of the passengers, that plane's got to stay in the air, but if we spend too much focusing on its maintenance, we'll never get the new one off the runway.  And of course the team responsible for both "planes" is often one and the same, which leads to the next issue...
</p>

<h3>Team Schism</h3>
<p>
Given that there's some amount of effort necessary to support the existing system, the question is: who is responsible for this?  There are a couple approaches that teams typically take to manage the parallel work.  One option is to have the more junior developers stay back in maintenance mode, and thereby free up the senior devs to forge the path forward for the new system.  And this makes sense.  To pull off a rewrite generally requires a higher level of technical bad-assery - getting new technologies up and running and working together, configuring environments, establishing patterns and conventions, and so on are all tricky tasks that could leave a more green developer spinning their wheels in the mud.  
</p>

<p>
And so teams may settle on this type of split, junior developers to maintain, senior developers to go forward.  And it may work for a short while, but <b>it's not long until the senior devs are pulled back in</b> to help solve a critical all-hands-on-deck issue or discuss the impact of some change.  Their years of acquired knowledge of the old system and their relationships with business stakeholders, ops people, and others make them effectively irreplaceable.  They need to be included.  And even if these "pull-outs" only take up a couple hours a week, that level of context-switching can still stymie productivity.  As developers float back and forth between the old and new systems, the timeline for the rewrite just gets pushed back.
</p>

<p>
To avoid this, teams may take an alternative approach: spin up a new team that can be more easily dedicated to the rewrite.  The developers on this "rewrite team" would have negligible ties to the existing system (maybe they're consultants, new hires, etc.) and would therefore be better able to isolate themselves and stay productive on the new work.  Problem solved?  No.  The first issue, of course, is that these developers are by definition less familiar with the codebase, domain, and generally how and why things work the way they do.  Sure, they have the original code as documentation, but this can be like learning a programming language by looking at the source.  It's all facts, but no story.  And so this new team will either flail while trying to understand the intricacies and complexities of the existing system, or make bad assumptions just to move forward, or end up having to pull in the original team anyway.  None of these are productive outcomes.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, this "fresh team" approach can also alienate the veteran developers who are charged with staying back to support the legacy system, and make them feel as though they are being penalized for their loyalty and experience.  While the new team gets to work with modern technologies and a clean slate, they are still left in the doldrums of maintenance.  No fun.  And so unsurprisingly, this can quickly lead to disgruntled developers and shortly after that, brain-drain.  Somehow a team structure needs to be devised where the old system can be supported, the new system can be built correctly and efficiently, and everyone is happy.  But even when you put the right people on the right busses, there are still surprises...
</p>

<h3>Unknown Unknowns</h3>
<p>
Now even if the rewrite team is staffed with seasoned developers - i.e. those who either helped write the legacy system or at least have some experience with it - there are always surprises when migrating the existing source code to the new platform.  Donald Rumsfeld (yes, <i>that</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a>) made this not-so-crazy insight about these types of surprises:  

</p><p>
Reports that say that something hasn't happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknownsâ€”the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.
</p>

<p>
When we begin the rewrite process, we typically try to estimate how much effort it will be.  And it's here where we begin to catalogue the first two categories of work.  There are of course segments of the codebase that we have direct experience with, and so we give quicker (and more accurate) estimates.  These are the known knowns.  But then there are also pockets of the system that we recognize we have less direct experience with, and so we add a little buffer.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><figure id="w-node-70a9116c0fe8-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f20a0e12e2249592eae4d8e_Frame%2015.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you want more people using your product, the easiest place to start is making it easier to actually sign up. <strong>Adding SSO to your app</strong> will help you land those larger enterprise deals and decrease the signup friction that keeps causing your visitors to drop off. For modern developers though, the world of XML, SOAP, and OASIS standards can be opaque. Fear not: our guide will walk you through SSO: what it is, why it’s important, and best practices for getting it up, running and integrated with your app.</p><h2>The basics: what SSO is and why you should care</h2><p>The easiest way to understand SSO quickly is to think about your app’s authentication as a service. Most developers build the service themselves: you take care of creating usernames and passwords, adding them into a database, and checking credentials every time someone logs in. But in the same way that you skip building payments infrastructure and use Stripe, you can “outsource” your auth and have someone else do it; and that’s what SSO is.</p><p>If you’ve heard of SSO before, you’re probably thinking of it as a security feature, and that’s true; but where it really shines is through <strong>increased engagement</strong>. Making it easier to sign up for and sign into your product lowers friction for users, increases retention through smoother login flows, and helps you land those elusive enterprise deals (many enterprises can’t work with vendors who don’t support SSO).</p><p>Apps with SSO enabled allow users to authenticate through someone else’s service: instead of you managing usernames and passwords, you integrate with a provider like Okta or OneLogin that does it for you. Those services – called Identity Providers, or IDPs if you want to save time – are generally more full-featured and secure than what your typical growing startup would be able to build themselves.</p><p>SSO is a given among everyone from high growth startups to more traditional enterprises. Here’s the Dropbox sign-in page: they’ve built SSO with Google and Apple as two headline IDPs (they also support Okta).</p><figure id="w-node-171366ed88a2-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef87ff2e125d68276a54_5ef11a093ff6f8501b52b19b_dropbox.png" alt="Dropbox SSO"></p></figure><p>Slack, Asana, Notion, Airtable, and Trello all support SSO too, and some even charge extra for it (you can find them on the <a href="https://sso.tax/">SSO Wall of Shame</a>). It’s pretty much part of the standard growth playbook.</p><h2>Learning the lingo: SAML, SPs, IDPs, and assorted acronyms</h2><p>Let’s get a little deeper into how SSO works. One thing worth noting: SAML isn’t the only protocol you can use to implement SSO. OAuth (1.0 and 2.0) are also popular, as well as WS-Fed and OpenID Connect. The broad concepts can carry over across protocols, too.</p><p>If you’re integrating SSO into your app, you’re a ​<strong>service provider​</strong> (SP). Your app is the service. The provider that you’re “outsourcing” identity to – like Okta or OneLogin – is called the ​identity provider ​(IDP). Simple enough, right? Where things start to get a bit more complex is when your app needs to ​communicate​ with identity providers to actually authenticate your users. SSO works with a communication protocol called ​<strong>SAML</strong> ​(Security Assertion Markup Language) that governs these phone lines.</p><p>SAML – and by extension, how you build and work with SSO – works through <strong>assertions</strong>.</p><figure id="w-node-fda86aed2629-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef87a82ddb32f4057b52_5ef11a0adb11ec2004c7bc71_assertions.png" alt="SSO Assertions"></p></figure><p>Let’s walk through a typical SAML flow, starting with a user trying to sign in through your site.<strong>‍</strong></p><h5>1. The SAML request from the SP</h5><p>When a user navigates to your login page (to log in, of course), they’ll either enter their email or click a button that takes them to an IDP portal like Okta. Your app issues a SAML request (and a browser redirect) to the IDP: it’s basically saying “hey, this user wants to sign in, do me a favor and verify that I should let ‘em in.”</p><h5>2. The SAML assertion from the IDP</h5><p>At the IDP, they’ll enter their full credentials, and deal with more extensive security measures like 2FA. Once they’ve successfully authenticated with the IDP, the IDP sends your app a response containing an assertion: this user is good to go, and you can let them in.</p><p>SAML works via XML (for all those SOAP fans out there. Nobody? Ok). Here’s an example of what a response containing an assertion might look like (thanks to <a href="https://www.samltool.com/generic_sso_res.php">OneLogin</a>):</p><p>The flow we just outlined is called ​<strong>SP-initiated​</strong>, because it started at ​your​ app, and you’re the service provider. There’s another way this can go down though: users can ​start​ at their IDP (like the Okta app directory), click on which app they want to sign into, and then authenticate and redirect. That’s called ​<strong>IDP-initiated​</strong>.</p><h2>Getting practical: how to add SSO to your app</h2><p>Like pretty much anything in software, there are two ways to add SSO to your app: you can build it yourself or pay someone else to do it for you.</p><h5>1. <strong>Building SSO from scratch</strong></h5><p>Building SSO yourself is all about handling and working with the protocol you choose: assuming you’re targeting larger companies, we’re talking about SAML here. This isn’t a technical tutorial, but here are a few high-level components you’ll need to write:</p><ul role="list"><li>A SAML controller for handling requests and providing responses to your integrated IDPs.</li><li>A SAML service to verify x509 certs, entity IDs, and IDP URLs, alongside parsing SAML assertions and creating and validating SAML responses. You’ll particularly enjoy the XML parsing and IDP-specific request formats.</li><li>A strategy to correctly authenticate users in your app based on the attributes that IDPs send back (you’ll need to normalize these if you’re supporting multiple customers).</li></ul><p>If any of this sounds weirdly unfamiliar to you, that’s because it probably is: there’s a lot of upfront research required to understand the right way to do it. It’s not as simple as adding a new frontend library and skimming through the docs.</p><p>Part of the challenge of building SSO from scratch is customization: you’ll need to build SAML flows for each IDP independently. SAML is a standard and like any good standard it’s often fractured and can sometimes be a pain to work with. As usual, XKCD gets it.</p><figure id="w-node-ccb9efecc6ca-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef87590fbe675d1eb724_5ef11a0aa1289c05c64daeb7_xkcd.png" alt="XKCD"></p></figure><p>Over the past few years, the web dev ecosystem has developed a few packages that take care of some of the repeatable work. Middleware like <a href="http://www.passportjs.org/">​passport.js<strong>​</strong></a> can help you avoid building everything from scratch; or if your backend is in Python, OneLogin offers a <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python-saml">python-saml​</a> package.</p><h5>2. <strong>Use an SSO provider</strong></h5><p>If you don’t want to build SSO yourself (I mean, why would you?), there are a bunch of great third-party services that offer SDKs and packages to make integration as easy as a few lines of code.</p><p><strong>➞ WorkOS (we're biased)</strong></p><p>WorkOS lets you add SSO to your app with just a few lines of code, and it’s completely free. Integrate once and you can support SAML with IDPs like Okta, GSuite, OneLogin, and more. Here’s what that same SAML flow above might look like with something like WorkOS:</p><figure id="w-node-9f81c6e54660-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f03ef874de037b12ed1bd53_5ef11a0a3b878a5998d1038b_sso-workos.png" alt="SSO WorkOS"></p></figure><p>WorkOS ships with something pretty cool – <a href="https://workos.com/docs/sso/embed-workosjs">WorkOS.js</a> – that allows your end-users to configure their own​ SSO connections to their IDP of choice.</p><figure id="w-node-3fccad929910-e13c3243"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f03ef1d331a69193fae6dcd/5f07eb72970fa85d5dbd58cd_workos-workosjs-compressed.gif" alt=""></p></figure><p>Doing this manually is ​rough​: you need to coordinate with enterprise IT admins, exchange URLs and certificates, and build custom infrastructure like field mappers for SAML profiles. It’s not just frustrating; it drags out the integration cycle and takes up sales, support, and success time too.</p><p><strong>➞ Auth0</strong></p><p><a href="https://auth0.com/pricing/">Auth0<strong>​</strong></a> is identity as a service: they offer SSO (among other products) that easily integrates into your app and supports all of the IDPs you’d ever need. Auth0 for social connections is free up to 7K users, and plans start at $23/mo for 1K users. If you want enterprise connections (think: SAML), you’ll need to move into the Developer Pro pricing tier, which starts at $28/mo for 100 users.</p><p><strong>➞ AWS Cognito</strong></p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">Cognito</a> is AWS’s identity-as-a-service product and supports SSO with SAML, OAuth 2.0, and OpenIDConnect. Cognito supports IDPs like GSuite and Facebook, and pricing is...well, it’s AWS, so you’re on your own.</p><p><strong>➞ GCP Identity Platform</strong></p><p>GCP’s identity-as-a-service goes by “<a href="https://cloud.google.com/identity-platform">​Identity Platform</a>​” (catchy) and supports the standard feature set. It also comes with some interesting built-in Google features like Machine Learning based security measures (identifying compromised accounts). Pricing starts at $0.015 per SAML MAU when you’re over 50 MAUs.</p><h2>Best practices from some engineers who have done it before</h2><p>Here are a few tips that might make your SSO integration process just a bit easier, whether you’re using a third-party provider building it from scratch.</p><h5>1. <strong>Security</strong></h5><p><em>Disallow username and password logins, password resets, and email address changes</em></p><p>If an organization is using SSO with your product, give admins the ability to disable username/password based auth for their users. It creates a more seamless SSO experience by avoiding false login starts and keeps things secure.</p><p><em>Enforce session timeouts</em></p><p>Expire idle user sessions to make sure users aren't signed in indefinitely — it's good practice to grab the SAML response's session timeout value and use that, but there are cases where having a "time to live" setting for each account is useful too.</p><p><em>Force sign-in for active browser sessions</em></p><p>If your app gets a new sign-in request, replace any currently active browser sessions with the newly authenticated session. This is particularly important for apps that lean toward multi-tab use, like IDEs or CRMs.</p><h5>2. <strong>Routing</strong></h5><p><em>Ask users for the information to determine the right IDP</em></p><p>If you plan on supporting multiple IDPs in your SSO implementation, ask users for their email address, account subdomain, or unique account URL to determine the correct identity provider for their login.</p><p><em>Make sure to deep link</em></p><p>If you’re asking users to authenticate from an existing product page or they’re expecting to land somewhere in particular in your product, you’ll want to implement deep linking in your SAML flows. You can use ​SAML’s RelayState parameter​ to get this working.</p><h5>3. <strong>UX</strong></h5><p><em>Disable email verification for SSO users</em></p><p>If your app sends verification emails on username/password signups, disable that for SSO authentication: it’s not necessary.</p><p><em>Use Just-In-Time (JIT) User Provisioning for first time sign-ins</em></p><p><a href="https://jumpcloud.com/blog/jit-provisioning-defined">JIT user provisioning<strong>​</strong></a> automates the account creation process for users signing in to your app for the first time via …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Background: <a href="https://ebbflow.io/">Ebbflow</a> is a multi-cloud load balancer that provisions browser-trusted certificates for your endpoints in addition to providing a client-friendly SSH proxy. Servers can host endpoints from any cloud, on premises, or from your home, all at the same time. It uses nearest-server routing for low latencies and is deployed around the globe.</p>
        <p>This post describes how Ebbflow vends its <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow">client</a> which is written in Rust to its Linux users, describing the tools used to build the various packages for popular distributions. In a future post, we will discuss how these packages are ultimately vended to users.</p>
        <h2>Linux</h2>
        <p><img src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/tux.png"></p><p>Ebbflow vends the client to numerous distributions of Linux based operating systems. Linux is free, flexible, and is widely used in the software community and is being used increasingly in consumer markets. Ebbflow uses Linux for development machines and production servers.</p>
        <p>To vend software to Linux users, you must consider the Distribution that the users may be running. For non-Linux users, a distribution can be thought of as a version or flavor of an OS. Each distribution provides package management systems and backround-service management software which may be different, adding complication to our task of vending our client.</p>
        <p>This guide will talk about the problems that need to be solved after the core code has been written and all that's left to do is get it into users' hands. So, given that we have our binaries, here are the main tasks that we must work on:</p>
            <table>
                <tbody><tr>
                    <td>Task</td>
                    <td>Solution</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Run the Daemon in the Background</td>
                    <td><a href="#daemon">Create a <code>systemd</code> service</a></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>No Dependencies</td>
                    <td><a href="#static">Statically Linking</a></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Working with Distributions</td>
                    <td><a href="#package"><code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code> Packages</a></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Automated Builds</td>
                    <td><i>Next Blog Post</i></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Vending the Packages</td>
                    <td><i>Next Blog Post</i></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody></table>
        
        <h3>Ebbflow Client 101</h3>
         <p>Ebbflow's job is to route user traffic to your web server application (or SSH Daemon) on your servers. The central Ebbflow service proxies data between user connections (e.g. browser, SSH client) and the client. The client then proxies the data to your web server or local SSH daemon. Users of Ebbflow install the client on machines that will host endpoints, be SSH-ed to, or both at the same time (which is very useful). The following diagram shows this visually.</p>
        <p><img id="clientdg" src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/clientdiagram.png"></p><p><small><i>Quick note: The client initiates the connection to the central Ebbflow service via an outbound TLS connection, which makes the client extremely firewall friendly. You may completely block all inbound connections but still host websites or be SSH-ed to! Also, this innovation allows the servers to be located in any network, and even change networks without any configuration at all. Ebbflow just receives connections from the general internet, and after authentication and authorization, will allow the server to host the endpoint or be SSH-ed to. Neat!</i></small></p>
        <p>The client has two parts, the CLI and the background daemon. Both of these programs are 100% Rust, 100% <code>async</code>, and 100% 'safe', <i>and</i> statically linked - the dream of any Rust developer! The <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/src/ebbflow.rs">CLI</a> is an executable tool named <code>ebbflow</code> that is used to tell the background to host new endpoints, disable or re-enable endpoints or the SSH proxy, and configure other settings.</p>
        <p>The background daemon is the second piece to this puzzle, and is the workhorse and is responsible for actually transferring bytes between the central Ebbflow servers and your local web server or SSH daemon. This daemon is just a long-running background executable named <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/src/ebbflowd.rs"><code>ebbflowd</code></a>.</p>
        <h3 id="daemon"><a href="#daemon">Backround Daemon / <code>systemd</code> Service</a></h3>
        <p><img src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/systemd.png"></p><p><code>ebbflowd</code> needs to run in the background, run without a logged-in user, start on system boot or reboot, and be started again if it crashes. (most) Linux distributions provide a mechanism for this called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd"><code>systemd</code></a>, which is a system to manage and execute "services". When <code>systemd</code> manages a service, it will start it, watch it, and fulfulls all of the needs we have.</p>
        <p><code>systemd</code> uses "unit files" as the means to know how a service should be handled. They can be very simple, and you can see Ebbflow's <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/assets/ebbflowd.service">unit file on GitHub</a>. The unit file points to the executable, declares a dependency that the system's networking services should be initialized first, and that the program should be restarted quickly if it exits. There are many helpful guides for <code>systemd</code> online from <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-systemd-units-and-unit-files">general info</a> to more <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.service.html">reference</a> type guides.</p>
        <p>Below is the actual <code>ebbflowd.service</code> unit file used by Ebbflow.</p>
        
        <p>Simple, short, and gets the job done! The daemon will be restarted after one second, and will execute <code>/usr/sbin/ebbflowd</code> on our users' behalf.</p>
        <p>If you are making your own, you can get started quickly by changing <code>ExecStart</code> to your built program in whatever directory it lies in now. To run the service, we must do the following
        <small>
        </small></p><ol><small>
            <li>Add the unit to <code>systemd</code>'s known services<ul>
                <li><code>sudo cp myprogram.service /etc/systemd/system/</code></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Enable the unit so <code>systemd</code> will start it on boot, registering the unit file<ul>
                <li><code>sudo systemctl enable myprogram</code></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Tell <code>systemd</code> to start your program<ul>
                <li><code>sudo systemctl start myprogram</code></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Check that its running!<ul>
                <li><code>sudo systemctl status myprogram</code></li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Stop the program<ul>
                <li><code>sudo systemctl stop myprogram</code></li>
            </ul></li>
        </small></ol>
        <p>After writing and testing your unit file you will need to either instruct users to complete the above steps or, preferably, vend your Unit in a proper package so that the users can avoid managing the unit file themselves. Ebbflow's <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/assets/ebbflowd.service">unit file</a> is vended through the built packages which we describe later.</p>

        <h3 id="static"><a href="#static">Going Static</a></h3>
        <p>Rust will dynamically link against the OS's <code>libc</code> implementation when the standard library is used, which is the case for almost all substantial Rust applications. When compiling Rust on a Linux system Rust will dynamically link against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_C_Library"><code>glibc</code></a> by default.</p>
        <p>For background, linking against <code>glibc</code> is not necessarily a bad thing - you can reduce your binary size and benefit from any performance or security updates without changing your code. However, when vending your project to users, linking against something that is not under you control is not ideal. First off, when linking, you will link against a specific version of <code>glibc</code> - the version that your build system has. So let's look at a ficticious example where you build on Ubuntu 20.04 (which uses <code>glibc</code> version <code>2.31</code>) and vend to Ubuntu 18.04 (which uses <code>2.27</code>). If you build on your Ubuntu 20.04 system and <code>rustc</code> uses some feature of <code>glibc</code> <code>2.31</code> that is not present in <code>2.27</code>,  and you execute your code on the Ubuntu 18.04 system, your code may break!</p>
        <p><strong>Edit</strong>: Per reddit commenter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/i0465c/creating_linux_packages_for_rust_projects_12/fznavnw/">/u/STEROVIS</a>, the above statement is innacurrate, and instead of "breaking", the "program simply will refuse to run at all whether you use a nonexistent feature or not. The dynamic linker will instantly fail complaining about a missing <code>GLIBC_*</code> version symbol". Still, the program will not work!</p>
        <p>You could avoid this scenario by building and linking to a low <code>glibc</code> version, but how low? How far back should you go? What if you want to vend to users of very very old systems?</p>
        
        <p>For maximum flexibility and to gain ground against our goal of working on many distributions, you can avoid these problems by statically linking <code>libc</code> using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/platform-and-target-support/musl-support-for-fully-static-binaries.html"><code>MUSL</code></a>, a <code>libc</code> implementation that <code>rustc</code> can include in your built binary so your program can run without any <code>glibc</code> dependencies. To get started using <code>MUSL</code>, you add a new target to <code>rustup</code> by executing the following. Also note that you may need to install a musl package, for example on Debian execute <code>apt-get install musl</code>. </p><pre><code># Add new MUSL target to rustup
$ rustup target add x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

# Build!
$ cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl</code></pre>

        <p>Besides the <code>std</code> library, Rust code may link to other OS libraries most often OpenSSL or libsodium for crypto. The Ebbflow client avoids this by using <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rustls"><code>rustls</code></a> which uses <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ring">ring</a> under the hood. Rustls is an ergonomic TLS library for Rust. It is <a href="https://jbp.io/2019/07/01/rustls-vs-openssl-performance.html">highly performant</a> even compared to OpenSSL and recently underwent a 3rd party <a href="https://github.com/ctz/rustls/blob/main/audit/TLS-01-report.pdf">security audit</a> which showed no flaws. When you invest in the Rust ecosystem and use Rust-written libraries, you are rewarded with the ability to statically link which is a desireable situation.</p>

        <p><i>To this point, we've taken our project and registered the backround daemon with the OS using <code>systemd</code> and statically linked our code using <code>MUSL</code>. The client could be tested to run on a single machine, but there are many installation steps. From here, we will package up our daemon and unit file nicely using packages.</i></p>

        <h3 id="package"><a href="#package">Packaging for Linux; <code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code></a></h3>
        <p>Each Linux distribution provides a Package Manager which is used to manage the installed software, called packages, on the system. Most distributions use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_%28file_format%29"><code>.deb</code></a> or <a href=""><code>.rpm</code></a> package formats. <code>.deb</code> packages are used by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian">Debian</a> distribution and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions#Debian-based">its derivitatives</a> such as Ubuntu. <code>.rpm</code> packages are used by other distributions such as OpenSUSE, Fedora, and CentOS. Each distribution may have a different CLI tool for managing packages, even if they use the same package format, but that problem will be solved in the next blog post.</p>
        <p>To create a package, you first create a format-specific specification or configuration file. Once your specification is created you use the format-specific build tool to build the actual packages, in our case a <code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code> file.</p>
        <h4 id="deb"><a href="#deb"><code>.deb</code> Packaging</a></h4>
        <p><img src="https://ebbflow.io/resources/debpkg.png"></p><p>Building Debian packages for a Rust project is dead simple using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cargo-deb"><code>cargo-deb</code> crate</a>, which is used as a cargo subcommand. This command will create a <code>.deb</code> package from your Rust project and is highly configurable - check out the <a href="https://github.com/mmstick/cargo-deb">README</a> for all of the options.</p>
        <p>Working with <code>cargo deb</code> is simple, so simple that you don't actually need to touch any configuration at all if you have a simple Rust project: you can just execute <code>cargo deb</code> and the tool will infer all of the required settings and build your package!</p>
        <p>The Ebbflow client is more complicated, so we will provide configuration through <a href="https://github.com/ebbflow-io/ebbflow/blob/master/Cargo.toml#L58-L76">the client's <code>Cargo.toml</code></a> …</p></div></div>

		<p><span>In </span><span><a href="http://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="http://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html">Giving GPT-3 a Turing Test</a></span><span>, Kevin Lacker found that GPT-3 does well answering simple factual questions like</span> <span>“Who</span><span> was president of the United States in 1955?”, but also happily answered absurd questions without noticing they didn’t make any sense.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Q: How many eyes does the sun have?<br>
A: The sun has one eye.</p>
<p>Q: How many eyes does a blade of grass have?<br>
A: A blade of grass has one eye.</p>
<p>Q: How do you sporgle a morgle?<br>
A: You sporgle a morgle by using a sporgle.</p>
<p>Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?<br>
A: There are three bonks in a quoit.</p>
<p>Q: How many rainbows does it take to jump from Hawaii to seventeen?<br>
A: It takes two rainbows to jump from Hawaii to seventeen.</p>
<p>Q: Which colorless green ideas sleep furiously?<br>
A: Ideas that are colorless, green, and sleep furiously are the ideas of a sleep furiously.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the trickiest things about GPT-3 is that <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1284271608971100162">you can prove that it knows how to do something, but you can’t prove that it doesn’t</a>, since a slightly different prompt can get much better results.</p>
<p><span>Nick Cammarata of OpenAI </span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1284050958977130497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener" data-target-href="https://twitter.com/nicklovescode/status/1284050958977130497">responded to Kevin’s post on Twitter:</a></span> <span>“it’s all about the prelude before the conversation. You need to tell it what the AI is and is not capable. It’s not trying to be right, it’s trying to complete what it thinks the AI would do :)”</span></p>
<p><span>Nick changed Kevin’s prompt to add a prelude saying:</span> <span><i>‘This</i></span><span><i> is a conversation between a human and a brilliant AI. If a question is</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“normal”</i></span><span><i> the AI answers it. If the question is</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“nonsense”</i></span><span><i> the AI says</i></span><i> </i><span><i>“yo</i></span><span><i> be real”’</i> and added two examples of nonsense questions:</span><br>
<img draggable="true" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EdHdZT4UMAASHpN?format=png&amp;name=small" alt="Image" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><br>
I was surprised this worked. When I asked Nick, he said he didn’t try many prompts, and it’s possible he just got lucky, so I wanted to test the limits of what Gwern is now calling <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1285723744074452993">Uncertainty Prompts</a>.</p>
<p>Using the same prompt as Nick above, I got the same answer for the first nonsense question:</p>
<p>Q: How many bonks are in a quoit?<br>
A: yo be real</p>
<p>Using ‘Show probabilities’ in the OpenAI Playground settings we can see how probable the model thought this next token was. In this case, it was pretty sure the question was nonsense, since ‘yo’, at 35.91% is twice as probable as the runner up ‘A’ at 17.50%</p>

<span>You can see the runner by manually entering</span> <span>‘A’,</span><span> while keeping the temperature at zero. It completes to</span>&nbsp;<span>‘A:</span><span> A quoit has two bonks.’ Let’s look at the next question.</span></p>

<span>In this case</span> <span>‘yo</span><span> be real’ wins by a narrower margin.</span></p>

<p>The ‘Temperature’ setting controls how likely the model is to choose what it thinks is the most probable next token each time. We set it high when we want creativity, but in this case we just want to see the most likely completion each time, so we’ll set it to 0.<br>

<p>We’ll add each question we ask to the end of this prompt, then replace it with the next question once we have our answer. For each answer, I’ll include all the different probabilities for the first word. I’ve mostly excluded math questions, which GPT-3 generally struggles with.</p>

<p>For the sake of this post I’m more interested in whether GPT-3 correctly identifies a question as sensible than whether it answers correctly, but we’ll track both to see if there are any interesting correlations.</p>

<p><span>A: yo be real</span></p>

<p>Uhoh, our first mistake, and it was pretty confident this question was nonsense, assigning twice the probability to ‘yo be real’ than the runner up. Entering ‘A’ manually gives us the completion: “<span data-offset-key="erroh-341-0">A</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-342-0">:</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-343-0"> A</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-344-0"> computer</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-345-0"> hard</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-346-0"> drive</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-347-0"> works</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-348-0"> by</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-349-0"> using</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-350-0"> a</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-351-0"> magnetic</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-352-0"> field</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-353-0"> to</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-354-0"> store</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-355-0"> data</span><span data-offset-key="erroh-356-0">.”</span></p>

<p>Reviewing the examples in our prompt, I now notice that both questions starting with ‘How’ are nonsense questions, so we’re accidentally telling the model that the word ‘how’ means a question is more likely to be nonsense. Let’s add these to the prompt:</p>

<p>This is close, but wrong – the latitude is 30.0444 and the longitude is 31.233334. I’m guessing this is because longitude is typically expressed as a pair with latitude and latitude comes first. Testing by replacing Cairo with San Francisco confirms this – it gives us the latitude rather than the longitude.</p>

<p>9/10 questions were correctly identified as sensible, and once we improved our prompt it got 10/10, and 9/10 of the answers were factually correct. <span>Pretty good!</span></p>

<p>It’s pretty bad at telling whether something is physically impossible (at least with this prompt), but it doesn’t label the question as nonsense. 6/6 were correctly identified as sensible, but 4/6 were factually wrong.</p>

<p>So 5/10 unknowable questions are incorrectly interpreted as nonsense. These questions <em>are</em> nonsense only in so far as that there’s no justifiable correct answer. It would be an interesting experiment to see if you can teach the model the difference between ignorance and nonsense.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>When developing the UI of an app, we most often deal with a 2D layout of visual elements.</p>
<p>There are many models designed to standardize and simplify layouts. For web development, CSS Working Group proposed Grid Layout in 2017 as the best way to create 2D UI templates.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/Artboard-1-100.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Swift has been late on adding something similar to Grid Layout. In iOS 13 SDK, Apple added the possibility to arrange elements linearly through VStack, HStack, and ZStack in the form of a list. But creating 2D interfaces in such a way is unwieldy since it is inconvenient to arrange the elements in a two-dimensional coordinate system.</p>
<p>Recently, both Exyte and Apple worked on and released our own grid implementations, but our final results are quite different. In this article, we will look at what Grid Layout is, what features it has, and how our grid implementation differs from Appleâ€™s. </p>
<h2>What is Grid Layout?</h2>
<p>Hereâ€™s an example of a simple grid:</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/Screenshot-2020-07-02-at-14.25.44.png" alt=""></p><p>Essentially, a grid consists of rows and columns, organized in tracks. </p>
<p>Each of the tracks is of a certain size, which can be either:</p>
<ul>
<li>a fixed number of points.</li>
<li>a certain fraction of free space.</li>
<li>an adaptive size that depends on the size of internal elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here, all the grid items are of one size. If we wanted, we could make them different sizes â€” some could span multiple columns and rows, others would remain in their cell. </p>
<h2>Examples of Grid Layout</h2>
<p>The most obvious example of a grid is a collection of cells. Whether they are on a horizontal or vertical axis, with merged or single cells â€” it doesnâ€™t matter. </p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/vertical_Scroll.gif" alt=""></p><p>Grid, unlike UICollectionView, works with row- and column-level semantics. </p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/horizontal_scroll.gif" alt=""></p><p>Here are a few applications where Grid Layout greatly helps with UI: </p>
<h3>Timetable</h3>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/timetable.gif" alt=""></p><p>In this example, we display a daily schedule in the form of a grid with cells representing various events, with their span proportional to the duration of the event.</p>
<p>Additionally, we can see how a change in the duration and start date of some events changes the timetable. </p>
<h3>Flipboard</h3>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/flipboard.gif" alt=""></p><p>Flipboard is a news application where each news item is represented by a cell that contains a picture, headline, and a short description. The size of the cell can signify the priority of the news, and their position can be linked to their recency. </p>
<p>Grid Layout is well-suited for rearranging the order of the news on the fly. For example, in the picture above, we change the grid flow from .rows to .columns. </p>
<h2>Grid Layout implementation requirements</h2>
<p>In addition to basic grid functionality, Grid Layout must implement several other features which are very useful for developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the key features of the grid is the ability to merge rows and columns. We should be able to merge them even when the semantics of sizing are different. </li>
<li>For each element, we need to be able to explicitly specify a column, row, or both at once as its location. The rest of the elements should be positioned automatically. </li>
<li>It should also be possible to set the direction of the tracks (along which axis the elements will be located: along rows or along columns). </li>
<li>In some situations, the next element cannot fit in the current free position and is transferred to the next track. In this case, we have an empty space even if some of the following elements would be able to fill in this space. To solve this, we need to have access to a dense packing algorithm. </li>
<li>A grid can contain elements that need either to fit within the parent container or become scrollable to fit the parent container. To solve that, we need the scroll and fill modes.  </li>
<li>The spacing between the elements must be adjustable. </li>
<li>And, of course, we should be able to add animations for all the changes that happen. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Our grid implementation</h2>
<p>We have implemented all the requirements above in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/exyte/Grid">ExyteGrid</a> â€” our own grid implementation that is written entirely in SwiftUI.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples where ExyteGrid could be used to implement application UIs: </p>
<h3>Strava</h3>
<p>The interface of this applicationâ€™s screen is nothing more than a grid (which we have represented by colored rectangles). Weâ€™ve also implemented an alternative landscape view by changing the number of columns, starting positions, and spans of some of the elements. </p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/tracker_blur_device.gif" alt=""></p><h3>iOS calculator</h3>
<p>Do you remember the built-in iOS calculator? As you might have guessed, it also is a grid, with each button representing one grid item. Using ExyteGrid, we not only replicated the layout, but also easily implemented an alternative view in a similar way. Thanks to the power of SwiftUI, we can animate grid state changes.</p>
<p><img src="https://exyte.com/upload/calc-animation-mock-iPhone-XS-Max-1.gif" alt=""></p><h3>Differences between ExyteGrid and Appleâ€™s Lazy Grid</h3>
<p>If we talk about the recently announced Apple LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid, there are several differences between them and ExyteGrid: </p>
<ul>
<li>Appleâ€™s implementation lacks the ability to specify the cell span. This means that cells canâ€™t be combined vertically and/or horizontally with multiple adjacent cells. </li>
<li>It is also impossible to specify a priority position for elements: a fixed column or a row you would like the item to reside in.</li>
<li>Existence of these two possibilities in ExyteGrid enables us to provide two modes of packing elements: sparse (the usual one) and dense (the order of elements can be changed to minimize the number of empty spaces).</li>
<li>Changes in the Apple Gridâ€™s state most often result in the usual fade animation if the elements are not in a single ForEach. ExyteGrid does animation by associating the itemâ€™s ID with its position within the grid. In this case, individual elements can be assigned a specific ID using a GridGroup or ForEach, which allows SwiftUI to assign a transition animation to each element.</li>
<li>Flex tracks are sized differently. Flexible size in Apple Grid requires an explicit specification of max size in points, while .fr (fractional units) in ExyteGrid can specify the track sizes as ratios. </li>
<li>There is a big difference between Apple Grid's .adaptive sizing and .fit sizing of our implementation. Adaptive sizing does not really specify a specific number of tracks. It creates as many of them as it can in accordance with the restrictions. Fit sizing for ExyteGrid creates one track, the size of which is equal to the size of the maximum element that falls into it.</li>
<li>In ExyteGrid, you can specify a gridCellOverlay and a gridCellBackground, which makes it possible to place a custom view in free space around items when it appears. (This happens when there is a difference in the size of items in the same row or column.)</li>
<li>Apple Grid loads items lazily, while ExyteGrid initializes them all at once.</li>
<li>ExyteGrid has content mode: .fill where the grid arranges items to fill the container view, without having to manually calculate the size of each item.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two implementations are conceptually similar, but in many respects quite different. On the one hand, Apple Grid has a native implementation focused on a large number of elements, and on the other hand, ExyteGrid possesses more functionality and open source code, so anyone can participate in its improvement. </p>
<p>If you choose to use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/exyte/Grid">ExyteGrid</a>, we would be glad to see you both as users and collaborators. Of course, there are still many features that have yet to be done. More on that in <a href="https://github.com/exyte/Grid/blob/master/README.md#roadmap">our roadmap</a>.</p>

                    <p>I can’t tell you how many people I have worked with over the years whom I have never met in person. </p><p>And just like working in an office, some of them remained at the “Just circling back on this email!” level, while others grew into the “How has your son been doing since the divorce?” level.</p><p>I experienced this natural evolution recently. I first met Hana through a prior work arrangement; she was a client of my former employer’s. From our first video call--her in Spain, I in the Western U.S.--I knew I had met a kindred spirit. After I parted ways with my firm, Hana and I maintained our weekly video calls, getting to know each other better from afar, mostly by talking about anything and everything. Both aspiring writers, we swapped personal essays. She asked me to do some writing for <a href="https://supportbee.com/">SupportBee</a>, and I agreed. Soon, we promised each other, we would meet in person. I looked at plane tickets to Spain, and she considered attending a conference in San Francisco. Then, the pandemic hit. </p><figure><img src="https://hightouch.co/content/images/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-29-at-9.11.39-AM.png"><figcaption>Hana and I, the only way we've ever seen each other</figcaption></figure><p>Things got busier for me, as I was homeschooling a young, high-risk child while working, and she was isolated in her apartment, looking at the same four walls every single day. The inability to do much of anything meant we had no new life updates for each other. All dreams were on hold indefinitely. As the month progressed, we became so emotionally drained by such an unexpected global crisis that it took all we had to simply keep true to our weekly video call. And while I had lost motivation for almost everything else, I <em>hadn’t </em>lost my drive to produce good work for Hana--and I attribute that to the friendship we had built prior to...everything. <strong>In a way, working with her--even through a pixelated experience--has made me feel less alone during one of the most isolating times of my life. </strong></p><p>While our situation was different than the typical cubicle soulmate/work wife/see-you-as-much-as-my-own-family scenario, all of this had me wondering--what happens to workplace friendships when they go from the office to the Zoom screen, <em>particularly</em> out of circumstance, and not by choice? And what role does established rapport play in the shift to strictly virtual relationships? While a 21st-century pandemic of this scale is unprecedented (and therefore no such research yet exists), perhaps there’s something we can learn from adjacent data that will help us understand what tele-relationships need to thrive.</p><h2 id="you-re-not-alone-well-kind-of-">You’re Not Alone (Well, Kind Of)</h2><p>Former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned that the trend towards remote work (pre-pandemic) was birthing a “<a href="https://hbr.org/cover-story/2017/09/work-and-the-loneliness-epidemic">loneliness epidemic</a>"--a position likely based on research around the effect of office friendships on workplace culture. Employees who say they have strong relationships with co-workers <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/peps.12109">tend to be more productive</a>, more engaged, and generally more satisfied with their jobs. For years, Silicon Valley startups lured talent with the promise of after-work happy hours and other team-building events. But now that the physical water cooler has been reduced to a digital image of a water cooler, prioritizing culture and peer relationships is crucial. </p><p>A more recent study from the <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0466">Academy of Management</a> observed and surveyed workers at a company with a co-located and remote structure. The findings confirmed two things: <a href="https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/barsade/">Sigal Barsade</a>, a University of Pennsylvania professor who studies emotions in the workplace and contributed to this project, says yes--<a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/how-to-stop-loneliness-from-hijacking-your-career">loneliness does impact the quality of our work</a>. <strong>Loneliness emerges because the process of establishing friendships with colleagues is stifled once telework has a presence--a <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236072/why-friendships-among-remote-workers-crucial.aspx">Gallup survey</a> showed that only 15% of remote workers felt they had friends at work.</strong> (In-office rapport is so powerful that <a href="https://www.hrreview.co.uk/hr-news/strategy-news/a-third-of-all-relationships-start-at-work/50545">one-third of romantic relationships start at work</a>!)</p><p>Buffer’s 2019 “<a href="https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work-2019">State of Remote Work</a>” report, which looked exclusively at all-remote companies, revealed that while employees considered a flexible schedule and the ability to work from home to be a pro, the cons were just as significant. The most common complaint was that working remotely made it difficult for them to unplug at work. (I recently heard someone say, “I don’t work from home, I live at work.”) In second place was loneliness, and third place went to communication issues. </p><h2 id="feel-the-love-from-way-over-there">Feel the Love...From Way Over There</h2><p>As opposed to an in-office situation, remote setups elongate the getting-to-know-you process. We miss out on opportunities to “read” people via a constant feed of intonations, facial expressions, and impromptu conversations. As one psychologist <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/02/how-will-you-have-office-romances-and-friendships-when-everyones-working-remotely-9091557/">explains</a>, ”Online communication, similar to everyone’s Instagram ‘best life’ profile, presents an idealized view of the person you’ve set your trackpad on, and there are subtle details missed.”</p><p><strong>The Academy of Management researchers concluded that the best way to address such a barrier is to create an environment where employees can establish a “cadence” with one another.</strong> A cadence sets expectations around when and how employees interact--getting to know each person’s typical response times, job roles, email style, and even their affinities and dislikes (what sign-offs <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90469176/stop-annoying-people-with-these-email-greetings-and-sign-offs#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20sign,%2C%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9CBest.%E2%80%9D">really irk them</a>?). To do this, co-workers must communicate with each other outside an as-needed basis. (At SupportBee, we exercise together virtually with a trainer.) In addition to paving the way for cadence-building, managers should also signal answers to the questions most likely floating around employees’ heads, like, “Is it ok to be ‘friends’ with this colleague?” “How informal can we get on Slack?”</p><p>To keep employees connected beyond the internet, digital product design platform InVision hosts an annual off-site <em>and </em>smaller team offsites (though it was a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/we-cancelled-our-annual-kickoff-meeting-because-happened-brian-kardon/">video event</a> this year).</p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/how-coworkers-are-staying-connected-while-they-work-from-home.html">CNBC recently reported</a> on the ways that companies are fostering culture and peer relationships in the pandemic, a time when entire teams have found themselves working from home for the foreseeable future. While most everything is video-based, it’s important to get creative. General Assembly recreated the morning coffee break and the Gitlab team replicates happy hour. After they wrap the meeting, Gitlab employees with kids let their little ones speak with each other. Parents swap homeschooling and activity ideas for kids and establish a connection beyond deadlines. Basecamp, a<a href="https://hightouch.co/how-co-worker-friendships-impact-remote-work-culture/www.supportbee.com"> SupportBee</a> partner, has a Slack channel where employees can talk about anything <em>but </em>work.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rk2aXaxLUtAyeI6y8N5Jlr24Pbnb3HrJQBcHr-nRAE4NYm7lKKgjGa5yTjWhMyKPrmR525F_wDcWxX0AELL6VT6kV9RYZi3rO77oNci0PaX7BrLl6ri4jpFWIWhgTBkyGPkYKIsJ"><figcaption>Photo credit: <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/">Gitlab</a><span>‌‌</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7228-engaging-remote-employees.html">Other tactics</a> management should consider? Encouraging health and wellness and conducting regular check-ins with each employee to help workers feel heard. And if nothing else, it is true that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-stress-of-disaster-brings-people-together/">nothing brings people together like a crisis</a>; 20% of respondents in a Robert Half survey reported more substantial<a href="https://www.roberthalf.com/blog/management-tips/covid-19-and-the-workplace-employees-weigh-in?utm_campaign=Press_Release&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_source=Press_Release"> relationships with co-workers</a> when lockdown was in full swing. And with significant fear (56%) about returning to close quarters too soon, the environment would likely be too tense to keep cubicle-oriented relationships growing right now.</p><p>With a vaccine for COVID-19 a year or more ahead of us, undoubtedly more business will share what works for them (and what doesn’t). In May, an Atlassian employee <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90506101/12-road-tested-team-building-activities-that-work-for-real-life-remote-teams">shared ideas for helping teams keep the cohesion alive</a> based on what her company does. The tactics are divided into three categories: practical vs. just-for-fun; real-time vs. asynchronous; and one-hit-wonder vs. regularly scheduled activities. The ideas reflect what earlier research has advocated: offer a healthy blend of exercises that encourage bonding on a personal level by way of laughter or vulnerability, while also improving professional understanding of each other’s roles and work styles. </p><p>Back to Hana, the dear work friend I’ve never actually met in the flesh. Even though we video conference at least once a week, I wonder if it will be strange when I see her in person--the same way we pause, for a moment, after staring at a photograph, only to look up and realize the small details that make a person who they are have eluded us throughout our study. I’ve had friends express concerns about growing apart from their most beloved colleagues, as remote work seems likely for the rest of 2021. Yet, it is this kind of nervous anticipation that saves me at my loneliest moments at work. One day I will hear what my co-workers’ laughs sound like when they travel through the air, instead of a microphone, thousands of miles away.</p>

<![CDATA[SMB vs. Mid-Market vs. Enterprise Customer Onboarding: What’s the Difference?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    

<p>When building out a Productized Onboarding Experience for your customers, it’s important to take your customer segment into account. Think carefully about the tools and technologies you’re going to use with each customer.  Each customer segment has its own unique challenges that need to be addressed within the onboarding process. While some strategies may work across segments, you will quickly find the unique edge cases that need to be addressed for each segment. Below, we’ll run through the three most popular customer segments, their unique onboarding challenges, and some possible solutions.</p>



<p>To onboard SMB customers, you need to build a system that can serve a high volume of customers. The SMB onboarding experience should be able to help shuttle a customer through the process without them needing to speak with someone on your side. Ideally, your team is only reaching out to these customers after they’ve completed key milestones in the onboarding process. Due to the high volume nature of serving SMB businesses, it’s almost impossible to scale this experience just by hiring more people. Automations are key to delivering an onboarding experience to this segment that helps drive customers to first value in the shortest time possible. Examples of these types of automations include account configuration, provisioning and firing off templated emails and API calls to 3rd parties.</p>

<p>Most SMB engagements involve one external stakeholder who is highly motivated to get up and running with your service as quickly as possible. This means you don’t need to coordinate between multiple stakeholders and keep folks aligned.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Build a system to handle high volumes of customers</li>
<li>Invest in automating as much of the process as possible</li>
<li>Scaling by hiring is not economically viable</li>
</ul>



<p>To onboard Mid market organizations, you need to build a system that can align multiple stakeholders within a single engagement. Midmarket onboarding tends to involve multiple stakeholders, each with their own unique responsibilities pertaining to the onboarding process. Assets shared with the customer should be branded with their logos and brand identity to present a more personalized process. Automations and tasks need to be tailored to each persona to ensure there is no opportunity for misalignment. Along with this, a strategic cadence needs to be put in place with regards to calls and meetings that serve as checkpoints through the onboarding process. A Mid Market onboarding experience should be able to drive all customer stakeholders to these checkpoints in lockstep with your team. It should allow your team to stay a few steps ahead of your customers and ensure they’re providing a proactive onboarding experience.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Build a system that can align all stakeholders (internal and external)</li>
<li>Invest in Branding and Personalizing the process for each customer</li>
<li>Use automations to help drive stakeholders towards strategic checkpoints in the onboarding process</li>
</ul>



<p>To onboard Enterprise customers, both your system and process needs to be highly customizable and flexible to the needs of your customer. Enterprise onboarding generally tends to run more bespoke than Midmarket or SMB onboarding. The number of stakeholders can vary heavily along with their responsibilities. Because of how bespoke Enterprise onboardings are, your system needs to be able to support an extremely high-touch process with a heavy emphasis on documentation and collaboration to get your customers through the process. Your team and system need to be adaptable enough to deliver a white-glove experience that is unique to each customer. Another thing to keep in mind is that stakeholders may end up changing as the engagement progresses. Due to the lengthy nature of enterprise onboardings, this shakeup is more common than you think.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Build a system that is highly adaptable and flexible for each unique customer</li>
<li>Focus on delivering a white-glove experience</li>
<li>Plan for unexpected changes like stakeholders leaving or priorities changing</li>
</ul>

<p>For most organizations, it’s generally easiest to start with building out a productized onboarding experience for the SMB segment first. This usually results in more freed up resources that can then be shifted and applied to building out the Midmarket and Enterprise onboarding experiences.</p>

<p>At Simplemnt, we recognized the nuances of onboarding different customer segments early on and built out the ability to create Onboarding Playbooks that can be customized to each segment. Using Simplemnt, our users can create a variety of different onboarding experiences from fully automated processes designed to onboard a high volume of SMB customers to high-touch and bespoke onboarding experiences for the largest enterprise. Simplemnt gives you the ability to provide every customer with the best customer onboarding experience without needing to invest in multiple tools and processes.</p>

July 29, 2020 | https://blog.libro.fm/the-harmful-impact-of-audible-exclusive-audiobooks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.libro.fm/the-harmful-impact-of-audible-exclusive-audiobooks/">archive.org</a>

<p>We are <a href="https://libro.fm/?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Libro.fm</a>, an audiobook platform that makes it possible for you to buy audiobooks directly through your local bookstore. We are fiercely independent and we oppose Amazon’s efforts to prevent independent bookstores and libraries from providing certain audiobooks, called Audible Exclusives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One frequently-asked question we get from Libro.fm listeners is why certain audiobooks aren’t available on our platform—like <em>Born a Crime</em> by Trevor Noah and <em>Maybe You Should Talk to Someone</em> by Lori Gottlieb.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is there a word for grief as it relates to being very interested in a story only to find out it’s an Audible exclusive</p>— Becky Dingwell (@BDingz) <a href="https://twitter.com/BDingz/status/1283384951602401282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>While Libro.fm has a catalog of over 150,000 audiobooks—and more than 99% of all <em>The New York Times</em> bestsellers—some titles are unavailable due to exclusive licenses granted by audiobook publishers and authors to Amazon’s Audible.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>What does Audible Exclusive or Audible Original mean?</h3>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">we all know amazon is evil, but did you know that when a book becomes an audible exclusive, libraries cannot buy copies of that audiobook? did you know that capitalism is the enemy of accessibility?</p>— Alyssa (@imajoyk) <a href="https://twitter.com/imajoyk/status/1270769242682646529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>For Audible listeners, the yellow band on a book cover reading “only from Audible” facilitates a feeling of access to premium content, but for the rest of the book world, it’s an access barrier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It means that the audiobook in question can only be sold through Amazon’s Audible. No other retailers or providers can sell or distribute the digital audiobook, including bookstores and libraries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Books should be equally accessible to all, and Audible Exclusive audiobooks—also known as Audible Originals—are the antithesis of that.</p>



<h3><strong>How does an audiobook become an Audible Exclusive?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>This is going to get a little technical, but stick with us. It begins with the <a href="https://www.acx.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audiobook Creation Exchange (ACX)</a>, a marketplace launched by Audible in 2011 that connects narrators, authors, agents, publishers, and rights-holders to create audiobooks. The decision to make an audiobook Exclusive is made by authors, publishers, and agents—it depends on who is granted the audio rights to a book.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why do these parties choose this option? ACX offers higher royalties to creators (i.e. more money from audiobook sales) if they opt for <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.acx.com/help/what-s-the-deal/200497690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exclusive distribution</a>. If a creator wants to distribute their audiobook to other audiobook platforms or libraries, they will earn 15% to 20% less of retail sales from ACX. The ACX system rewards exclusivity, so it’s easy to see why authors and publishers spring for this opportunity.</p>



<p>Within the ACX world, Audible Studios is the production arm of Audible. They pay authors like Mark Manson (<em>Love Is Not Enough</em>), Margaret Atwood (<em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em>), and Alice Walker (<em>The Color Purple</em>) giant sums to keep their audiobooks exclusive to Audible, and prevent bookstores and libraries from selling and distributing them.</p>



<h3><strong>What does this mean for audiobook distribution?</strong></h3>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Librarian Friends: If an audio book is part of Audible's "Only on Audible" exclusive thing, does that mean people can't get the audiobook through the library? Books in the program include "Born a Crime" and "Handmaid's Tale."</p>— Hank Green: A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor is Out! (@hankgreen) <a href="https://twitter.com/hankgreen/status/1195061252730441730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Libraries, bookstores, schools, and anyone who isn’t affiliated with Amazon cannot distribute audiobooks that are Audible Exclusives. This means Libro.fm can’t sell Audible Exclusive audiobooks, which means <a href="https://libro.fm/indies?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">our 1,200 bookstore partners</a> can’t sell them, either.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>Audible Exclusives also work in direct opposition to the basic principles of libraries—free access to books, both digital and print. By limiting distribution, Amazon aids in making books, perspectives, and information inaccessible to certain communities and users.</p>



<p><strong>To reiterate: There are audiobooks being published that bookstores cannot sell, and libraries cannot lend.</strong></p>



<p>This hurts bookstores because they are consistently missing out on sales for big releases. When they aren’t able to sell audiobooks that are in high demand, potential customers will opt for Audible over their local bookstores. This, of course, only continues to increase Audible’s (and ultimately Amazon’s) power and influence within the publishing industry, resulting in more Exclusive deals and increasingly restricted access to audiobooks for the rest of the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because audiobooks are a digital product, they’re inherently easier for Amazon to monopolize. For example, the superstar-stacked audiobook for <em>The Sandman </em>by Neil Gaiman and DC Comics is only available on Audible:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Full-cast audiobook Sandman adaptation is a FANTASTIC idea – that I can't even get excited about properly because it's a freaking Audible exclusive. </p><p>Which means libraries are excluded. Which means our patrons are excluded. </p><p>So that's fun. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/libcomix?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#libcomix</a></p></div>— Matthew Noe 😔💜 (@NoetheMatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoetheMatt/status/1260564670626365445?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Audiobooks are also a vital means of access for some readers with disabilities:</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>due to disabilities, some people need audiobooks to read. people with disabilities are more likely to be underemployed/unemployed, thus they rely on the library for access to audiobooks.</p><p>amazon putting a pay wall between someone’s disabled audience and their book is hot garbage.</p></div>— whitney 🧸 (@ginkgo_ghost) <a href="https://twitter.com/ginkgo_ghost/status/1195065151243849729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2019</a></blockquote></div>

<h3><strong>How else does Audible bar audiobook access?</strong></h3>



<p><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/libraries/article/80658-citing-embargo-libraries-plan-boycott-of-blackstone-digital-audio.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audible pays some publishers to embargo new audiobook releases for 90 days</a>—meaning that for the first three months of sales, the audiobook can only be found on Audible. </p>



<p>Audible also doesn’t allow Libro.fm and bookstore customers to make certain audiobooks redeemable with membership credits—books like <a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781483080703?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Neapolitan Novels</a> by Elena Ferrante and <a href="https://libro.fm/audiobooks/9781094135465?cmp=aea" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Me and White Supremacy</em></a><em> </em>by Layla F. Saad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By rewarding Exclusive distribution, striking Exclusive deals with influential authors, and paying publishers to delay the distribution of new releases, Audible’s creeping monopoly pushes independent bookstores and libraries out of the audiobook industry.</p>



<h3><strong>I’m an author. How do I prevent Amazon’s Audible from shutting out independent bookstores and libraries?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>First, understand the contract with your publisher. Are they producing the audiobook, or licensing it to another publisher? Either way, add language into your agreement that requires your audiobook to be sold through independent bookstores and made available through libraries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, if your publisher is planning to contract or license the audiobook version, ensure that your publisher puts language in their licensing agreement that prevents the audiobook publisher from selling your title exclusively to Amazon’s Audible. If your audiobook is currently Exclusive, you might be able to change the distribution rights after a year depending on the payment option you have chosen. Learn more <a href="https://www.acx.com/help/contracts-agreements/200474550#change-contract">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>How is this any different from television and movie streaming platforms that produce originals?</strong></h3>



<p>Most original series and movies are still available to loan from your public library, and you can purchase DVDs online. The level of accessibility to all is much higher. Audible Exclusive audiobooks are only available through Amazon’s platform and not available through libraries or bookstores.</p>



<h3><strong>How can we work together to make change?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<h4>1. <strong>Make the #AudiobookSwitch.</strong></h4>



<p>When you choose Libro.fm over Audible, you support our 1,200 bookstore partners, invest in your local community, and get audiobook recommendations from real booksellers—not an algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By spending money with intention, we can collectively work to not let audiobooks become another form of privatized entertainment controlled by a single entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Make the <a href="https://libro.fm/switch?cmp=aea">switch from Audible to Libro.fm</a>. The more people we move away from their platform, the more power we take away from a singular provider in the industry. With Libro.fm, you get to choose a local bookstore to support, so you’re putting money back into your community.</p>







<h4><strong>2. Reach out to authors and publishers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p><a href="https://libro.fm/authors?cmp=aea">Authors</a> can change the story by ditching Audible, so reach out or tag authors on social media who have chosen the Exclusive path and share your feelings. Sharing this post with them might be a good place to start, perhaps with the statement “Choosing Audible Exclusive for your audiobook restricts audience access and hurts bookstores and libraries.”</p>



<p>We recommend <a href="https://www.authorsrepublic.com/">Author’s Republic</a> as the ACX alternative. Their audiobooks will be available on Libro.fm, libraries, and wherever audiobooks are sold or distributed. Publishers can also produce their own audiobooks and distribute to Libro.fm via <a href="https://www.ingramcontent.com/publishers/lp/coresource-audio">Ingram Plus</a>, <a href="https://findaway.com/">Findaway</a>, and <a href="https://zebralution.com/en/">Zebralution</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>3. Spread the word.</h4>



<p>Share this blog post to help educate others on this issue. You can even reshare <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDKCRKGgZBn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Instagram post to your Story</a> or <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/librofm/status/1287833557784649728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retweet our tweet</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re a member, tell your friends, family, colleagues, and everyone you know about Libro.fm—when you refer someone, you get free audiobooks. We also offer bulk audiobook purchases for organizations.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Even if you don’t make an account with Libro.fm, it’s important that people are informed and aware of the harmful tactics that Amazon’s Audible uses to control the audiobook market. When you choose Libro.fm over Audible, you support our 1,200 bookstore partners, invest in your local community, and get audiobook recommendations from real booksellers—not an algorithm.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>&nbsp;Since capitalism has existed, corporations have had the power. </p><p>Henry Ford invented the modern nine to five workday in 1926, and it stuck. </p><p>Society built a reverence towards the shrine of the salaryman. Pack up your briefcase, drive your Chevy to work, and build your identity around work. We made it cool to work at McKinsey, and made Wall Street Money movers the modern day kings. </p><p>Things are changing. </p><p>Technology companies are eating the world, and technology companies’ most important assets are the people that work there. </p><p>New tech is different. An exceptional engineer or designer is worth millions in market cap (though hard to quantify). Attracting and retaining incredible people is why these companies are so valuable. </p><p>The most valuable companies now have the best engineering cultures. </p><p>The past 15 years it’s been Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon. They attracted folks through generous compensation, a cult-like corporate culture, and perks like massages, free food, and bean-bag chairs. </p><p>The power dynamics are shifting. </p><p>It’s no longer cool to work at Facebook, and many exceptional people are leaving the big 4 to join the next breed of technology juggernauts. </p><p>These companies are embracing new rules of corporate culture, and specifically investing in remote. </p><p>Gitlab is the world’s largest fully remote organization, and others are joining. </p><blockquote>As of today, Shopify is a digital by default company. We will keep our offices closed until 2021 so that we can rework them for this new reality. And after that, most will permanently work remotely. Office centricity is over. - Tobi Lutke, Shopify CEO</blockquote><p>Companies like Shopify, Twitter, Slack, and Square have gone remote first. Many others like Stripe are heavily increasing their investment in remote engineers. </p><p>Even companies like Siemens (140,000 employees), and Fujitsu (80,000 employees) are committing to remote. </p><p>On the surface remote work is not that interesting. </p><p>“Telecommuting” has been around for decades.</p><p>However, remote does not need to be just telecommuting. This is the biggest opportunity we’ve had to rewrite the rules of work, and it’s being led by companies built on rewriting the rules of society. </p><p>The rebels. &nbsp;</p><p>Shopify is led by a &nbsp;German online snowboard salesman. </p><p>Twitter a San Francisco modern-day monk. </p><p>Basecamp a wise midwesterner and a crazy Dane. </p><p>Stripe genius small-town Irish brothers. </p><p>These guys are not Henry Ford. And software is not cars. </p><p>Building software cannot be done via assembly line, and human intelligence and creativity is infinitely more important than compliance to the norms. </p><p>Remote-first culture lets companies throw out all the traditional rules of modern office culture. </p><p>People don’t want free food, yoga classes, and daily happy hours. </p><p>They want freedom. </p><p>Every human is different. Everyone works differently. </p><p>This simple fact has been ignored for hundreds of years.</p><p>Some people work better at night. Some in the morning. </p><p>Some people have young kids and need to work around them. </p><p>Forcing the 26 year old gamer to wake up at 8am to sleepwalk her way through a standup is cruel and unnecessary punishment. </p><p>Some folks want an open schedule. </p><p>Some want rigid structure. </p><p>We believe in everyone’s right to choose (their schedule). </p><p>And that companies who embrace that, will win. </p><p>Gitlab <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/06/18/day-in-the-life-remote-worker/" target="_blank">encourages every employee structure their day</a> in a way that their most productive and happy — fitting work around their lifestyle. </p><p>They're not alone, and more companies will follow. <br></p><p>For me, it’s no meetings before noon. Two 2 hour blocks of undistracted focus time. 2 hours of exercise and self-care. A quick catch-up with my team. </p><p>The option to take off whenever to clear my head. </p><p>Late night bursts of inspiration. </p><p>For my cofounder Nathan it’s waking up at 6am to do Crossfit. 4 hours of coding. Checking out at 6 and enjoying the evenings in the mountains. </p><p>We find the overlap in our days for impromptu calls as we’re virtually “co-working” outside of our focus time. </p><p>As more teams adopt truly flexible hours and culture, individuals will gain. People will finally be able to design work around their life, not life around work. </p><p>While not everyone will get exactly what they want, we believe the more the giant Venn diagram of your entire teams' ideal days overlaps — the happier your team will be. And the better your company will be. </p><p>‍</p></div></div></div>]]>

It is human nature that when we are simply given information, like on a tour, it can be<strong> difficult to retain</strong>. We are much more likely to retain information when we <strong>complete the task ourselves</strong>, and product walkthroughs exploit that.</p><p>Product walkthroughs are very similar to user setup experiences, which take you through the steps required to register to use a product – such as providing an email, setting up a password, uploading a profile picture, and so forth. But these are generally considered separate parts of the user onboarding experience.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because user setup is<strong> a one-off task</strong> that needs to be completed by a new user, but they do not need to retain the knowledge to complete this task repeatedly. <strong>User expectations</strong> for setup and walkthrough are also quite different. For setup, users generally expect to be spoon-fed and to follow fairly rigid instructions. Users tend to be <strong>less patient</strong> when it comes to using <strong>the product itself</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg" alt="what is product walkthrough" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough.jpg 1400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/what-is-product-walkthrough.jpg 1400w"></figure><h2 id="who">Which products should use Walkthroughs?</h2><p>Teaching users how to use products is <strong>always essential </strong>for success, but the best way to teach a user how to engage <strong>depends </strong>on the product.</p><p>Specifically, product walkthroughs tend to be highly structured and rigid, and therefore work best when there is more or less only<strong> one single route</strong> to gaining value for the product. Walkthroughs are highly effective in helping users <strong>discover </strong>the steps on that route.</p><p>Walkthroughs can be less effective for more creative products, for which there are many options.</p><p>For example, take a design tool such as<strong> Canva</strong>. There are hundreds of different design templates, and thousands of different feature options. Walking them through a generic design task is <strong>unlikely</strong> to show the user how to do what they actually want to do.</p><p>That’s why Canva starts with <strong>one design at first </strong>in their product walkthrough, which is something you should keep in mind; <strong>you can split product walkthroughs</strong> in different pieces. More on this later…</p><p>That said, the utility of interactive walkthroughs is <strong>not limited</strong> to onboarding new users. They can also be effectively leveraged to<strong> instruct existing users</strong> about updates and new features. You can target walkthroughs at <strong>different user segments</strong>. For example, you could have:</p><ul><li>Walkthroughs for <strong>new users</strong>;</li><li>Walkthroughs for all users after the <strong><a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/new-feature-announcement/">launch of an important new feature</a></strong>;</li><li>Walkthroughs for users that have been <strong>using the product for a month or so</strong>, but still haven’t advanced beyond the basic features, showing them some of the more complex things they can do;</li><li>Walkthroughs for <strong>users returning</strong> to the product after a long break.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg" alt="how to create product walkthrough" loading="lazy" data-src="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg" data-srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2.jpg 1400w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px" srcset="https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-1160x373.jpg 1160w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-800x257.jpg 800w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-120x39.jpg 120w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-90x29.jpg 90w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-320x103.jpg 320w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2-560x180.jpg 560w, https://userguiding.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/product-walkthrough-examples-2.jpg 1400w"></figure><h2 id="howto">Create the Perfect Product Walkthrough in 3 Steps</h2><p>Now, there are <strong>3 steps</strong> to creating <strong>product walkthroughs that can make you stand out in the competition.</strong></p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-4"><strong>1- Start with your Value Metric</strong></h3><p>The best product walkthroughs aim to get users to their <strong>aha moment</strong> – the moment when the product is delivering value for the user – as quickly as possible.</p><p>What that moment is, very much <strong>depends </strong>on the product.</p><p>Take Instagram for example: is the value moment liking someone else’s photo, publishing your own photo, or having the photo that you published liked by someone else?</p><p>Product owners should be digging deep into their <strong>analytics</strong> to identify what the value metric for their product is. This is what point of engagement that the user needs to reach within the product for them to <strong>understand its value to them</strong>, and therefore be more likely to continue using the product than abandon it.</p><p>For example, Twitter has determined that users that follow at least 20 accounts within the first three days of joining the platform and<strong> much more likely to become regular users</strong>. So their onboarding approach is focused on<strong> getting users to this point</strong>.</p><p>Walkthroughs should focus on getting people to complete the task that they need to get to this value point as well. For an online store product, it might be the user listing their first product. For task management software, it might be setting up and sharing the first task.</p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-5"><strong>2- Define the Barriers</strong></h3><p><strong>No one likes to be spoon-fed</strong>, it can feel patronizing and like a waste of time. A rigid walkthrough can seem like a bother rather than a help if the route to success doesn’t have barriers.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, you shouldn’t need your camera all on your phone to show you how to take a photo, switch to video, or switch between front and back cameras. All of those steps should be <strong>obvious from the UI</strong>. Instruction could be more useful when it comes to more sophisticated features, but the user has probably already met their value metric at this point, so <strong>will they be interested?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Onboarding should<strong> focus on</strong> what, if anything, is standing between the user and getting to their <strong>value point</strong>, and be designed to guide the user past those <strong>obstacles.</strong> Identifying these obstacles will probably require a bit of <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/user-research/">user research</a>, <a href="https://userguiding.com/blog/usability-testing/">usability testing</a>, and seeing where they struggle. This process does not have to be time-consuming – research shows that we tend to identify <strong>80 percent of usability issues</strong> from the first five user tests.</p><p>Common barriers include:</p><ul><li>Users are<strong> unaware</strong> of the most important features, where they are, and how to use them.</li><li>Users<strong> do not understand the value </strong>that they will gain from using particular features.</li><li>Users are <strong>missing important steps</strong> along the way to completing a vital task.</li><li>They <strong>overestimate</strong> how difficult it will be to reach a certain point.</li><li>They <strong>do not understand the terminology</strong> used.</li></ul><p>Once these barriers have been identified, you will have a good idea of what needs to go into the walkthrough (and whether a walkthrough is the best approach for educating your users).</p><h3 id="ftoc-heading-6"><strong>3- Design</strong></h3><p>Just as much attention should be paid to the design of a walkthrough as the product itself, as it can <strong>make all the difference </strong>when it comes to successfully onboarding users.</p><p>It should be developed iteratively and tested with users, just like every other feature of the product. <strong>The best product walkthroughs are:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Clear </strong>– they tell the user <strong>exactly how</strong> to use the features, and don’t do things such as rely on unexplained jargon.</li><li><strong>Concise </strong>– users want to get to the value point as quickly as possible, so walkthroughs should be comprehensive, but as<strong> short</strong> as possible.</li><li><strong>Engaging </strong>– interactive walkthroughs should already be engaging, by definition, they require users to interact and complete tasks. The tasks should be meaningful. The amount of guidance appropriate to the complexity of the step in question, graphically appealing, and using appropriate language.</li><li><strong>Skippable </strong>– not everyone wants to have to complete a walkthrough before using a product. They may have used the product before, they may be an expert.

<p><span>When I saw a couple of years ago the demo of Google Duplex, the beta version of Google Assistant, it was a truly jaw-dropping moment to me (and many others). Perhaps you remember the dialog:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>(phone rings) Hi how can I help you?</span></li>
<li><span>“Hi, I’m calling to book a women’s haircut for a client, I’m looking for something on May 3rd.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Sure, give me one second.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Mm-hmm.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Sure what time are you looking for around?”</span></li>
<li><span>“At 12 pm.”</span></li>
<li><span>“We do not have a 12 pm available. The closest we have to that is a 1:15.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Do you have anything between 10 am and 12 pm?”</span></li>
<li><span>“Depending on what service she would like. What service is she looking for?”</span></li>
<li><span>“Just a woman’s haircut, for now.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Okay we have a 10 o’clock.”</span></li>
<li><span>“10 a.m. is fine.”</span></li>
<li><span>“Okay, what’s her first name?”</span></li>
<li><span>“The first name is Lisa.”</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Which one was the machine? And hearing the voices was even eerier, as the machine voice (the one booking the appointment) sounded so, so real, including human hesitations, filler words, and so on.</span></p>

<p><span>You can reckon that such a (non-scripted) dialog is a technical feat. As Yaniv Leviathan of Google puts it, “When people talk to each other, they use more complex sentences than when talking to computers. They often correct themselves mid-sentence, are more verbose than necessary, or omit words and rely on context instead”.</span></p>

<p><span>But what I want to check now is the following question: </span><b>if voice assistants are going to have these amazing dialog capabilities, could they be our next language teachers?</b></p>

<p><span>This question is not rhetorical; it makes economic sense. You see, the online English language market is now in the order of several billion dollars a year and rising, and services like online tutors (with sites and apps like Italki, Verbling, etc.) are becoming increasingly popular.</span></p>

<p><span>But private tutors are not cheap: at an average cost of $20 dollars per lesson, taking a minimum of one lesson a week cumulates to a hefty cost of a grand per year. Not for most of us, I guess.</span></p>

<p><span>The cost of voice assistants, in contrast, is close to zero. They run from servers based on the cloud (with ever dropping costs) and talk to the final users through their smartphones, which most people have. Yes, in case you think smartphones are for the wealthy, let me show you the figures: more than 3 billion people have a smartphone, even budget communities like Latin America (with 500 million smartphones) and India (with 400 million smartphones).</span></p>

<p><span>Imagine this: instead of playing the silly vocabulary games of Duolingo, having </span><b>voice lessons</b><span> with an app that even corrects your pronunciation mistakes –without you feeling vexed, because it’s not even a human.</span></p>

<p><span>You know, last year, in a language practice Meetup I met a guy who had been 2 years studying French with Duolingo. Well, the dude was completely unable to put a single spoken sentence together! After studying daily for two years! Is this fair?&nbsp;</span><span>In another post, I’ll discuss Duolingo and its tech, but for now, we can see the problem: Duolingo doesn’t make you speak, you tap the screen of your phone and solve mini-games that aim to expand your vocabulary. But when you want to speak with someone, what happens? You freeze, no help from those silly word games.</span></p>

<p><span>Now, voice-assistant language teachers would be not only very cheap but also effective: you learn to talk by talking. Just answer</span><b> with your voice</b><span> the questions asked by your synthetic tutor, engage with the conversation, follow its advice, and learn to speak! Instead of starting by memorizing the conjugation tables, first, the assistant would give you several examples where you can see a pattern in a </span><b>real-life</b><span> context.</span></p>

<p><span>Wait a moment, will this make Italki and all other live tutor services call for bankruptcy and put thousands of tutors into unemployment?</span></p>

<p><span>Not so fast.</span></p>

<p><span>Voice assistants are advancing, no doubt, but speech recognition is not yet at a human level, especially for people who are learning the language. When I started using Siri, some years ago, it “recognized” phrases completely wrong (mostly my fault, of course). I tried to say “what time is it in London?” and it got “What is it in the law?”, and then showed a Google search page for that phrase. Mmmhhhh…</span></p>

<p><span>The lower the level of the language student is, the more difficult it is to recognize what s/he&nbsp;</span><span>is trying to say. Pronunciation is not the only problem: the phrase being spoken could be ill-constructed in the first place. We humans often guess, using the context, the speaker’s intention: if s/he is getting into a bar and approaches the barman, whatever s/he says could be related to asking for a drink. But to use the context is not easy for a machine. At least not for the moment.</span></p>

<p><span>The other missing piece is to put together a set of (flexible) scripts for specific language lessons, which falls in the territory of AI tutors. Though not trivial, there is a huge body of research on AI tutors, and I think it’s perfectly doable having the needed budget.</span></p>

<p><span>So, the short answer is YES, in a few years we will have voice assistant AI-based synthetic tutors which will mostly eliminate the need for human private tutors (except for the wealthy).</span></p>

<p><span>Notice I’m not talking about today’s half-baked systems like Mondly, which is way too rigid, lacks true ability to recognize the student speech, has dialogs with almost no options, and though it looks good (especially on a VR headset) it’s not at all what we are talking about. Perhaps voice assistants could be incorporated into VR systems like we intend to do with our Avalinguo VR system, wherein some virtual rooms there could be a synthetic tutor leading the sessions, providing feedback, suggesting discussion topics, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span>Please mark my words: </span><b>in less than 5 years from now</b><span> there will be at least one language-learning service with lessons verbally given by a voice assistant, who will be able to guide you through the lesson, have a practice conversation with you, and correct your mistakes. This technology will be likely to remedy the “<a href="https://avalinguo.com/the-talking-gap/">talking gap</a>” I wrote about in a previous blog post.</span></p>

		The JSON <a href="https://www.schemastore.org/api/json/catalog.json">API</a> contains a list of JSON Schema files for known JSON file formats.
		Each schema file can be used in tooling such as command line validators, editor auto-completion etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		The API exposes metadata about each schema in the following format:
	</p>
<pre>{
  "name": "bower.json",
  "description": "Bower package description file",
  "fileMatch": [ "bower.json", ".bower.json" ],

	<p>
		<code>name</code>, <code>description</code> and <code>url</code> are all required properties.
		<br>
		The <code>url</code> property is an absolute URI pointing to the schema.
		It can be hosted anywhere on the web.
		<br>
		The <code>fileMatch</code> property is for specifying what known file names corresponds with
		the schema. This property is optional since not all JSON formats enforce a specific file name.
	</p>

    <h3 id="editors">Supporting editors</h3>
    <p>
        Various editors and IDEs have direct support for schemas hosted on SchemaStore.org.

      </h2>

<p>Innovation in neural networks often happens through architectural change. In fact, architectural change is arguably what popularized deep neural networks (DNNs). The convolutional variety of DNNs had their first mainstream success in 1989 for classification in a now-antiquated model called the <a href="http://yann.lecun.org/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-89e.pdf">LeNet</a>. In 2012, the <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf">AlexNet</a> was introduced for a more difficult dataset, but the blocks which composed the AlexNet were mostly the same as the blocks which composed the LeNet. The innovation of the AlexNet was mostly in how the blocks were situated with respect to one another and the number of blocks used—in other words, the architecture<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>If architecture plays such an important role in performance, it is natural to ask how to choose an architecture. In computer vision there have been a slew of papers that introduce both radically different architectures and incremental improvements. In medical image segmentation, however, the architecture often seems to default to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf">U-Net</a>.</p>

<p>The U-Net is a simple-to-implement DNN architecture that has been wildly successful in medical imaging; the paper that introduces the U-Net, published in 2015, is the most cited paper at the prestigious medical imaging conference MICCAI. Over the past five years, however, there have been significant improvements to architectures for segmentation tasks, and it is no longer safe to assume that the U-Net will provide near state-of-the-art performance.</p>

<p>This article will provide an overview of the U-Net, explaining why it works and why it is the default, and then it discusses a few more recent architectures which are promising for medical imaging applications.</p>
    
      <h2 id="what-is-the-u-net-and-why-is-it-so-popular">
        
        
          What is the U-Net and why is it so popular? <a href="#what-is-the-u-net-and-why-is-it-so-popular">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The U-Net is a 2D or 3D fully-convolutional neural network architecture that consists of an encoder and a decoder with skip connections that connect the two at various levels of feature abstraction.</p>

<p>The encoder consists of convolutional layers along with progressive downsampling which captures contextual information about the input in a compressed representation. The decoder consists of convolutional layers with progressive upsampling which, along with the skip connections, preserves sharp boundaries and structural information about the input image.  Figure 1 shows an example of a U-Net architecture.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/unet.svg" alt="U-Net architecture">
    <figcaption>Figure 1: U-Net architecture</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The purpose of downsampling—in this case via max-pooling—in the decoder is not only to increase the receptive field<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> of the network, but make it computationally and memory efficient to create a large number of convolutional feature maps. More feature maps means the network can learn more complex relationships between the input and output.</p>

<p>The purpose of upsampling is to restore the spatial structure in the output so the prediction corresponds pixel- or voxel-wise to the input. This correspondence wouldn’t otherwise be the case due to downsampling. The skip connections restore the spatial structure at every level.</p>

<p>The downsampling and upsampling encoder-decoder structure combines to make the U-Net have a large receptive field while maintaining spatial structure in the prediction.</p>

<p>The U-Net is ubiquitous in medical imaging conferences and journal articles. The apparent reason is that it is established to work reasonably well and the model is easy to implement. Consequently it is a go-to for prototyping. As opposed to some of the other models that I will discuss, the U-Net can be written in PyTorch in a few lines, which makes it quick to prop up and debug.</p>

<p>For an example implementation, see <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcreinhold/ba65d56a15386dd6ffafc1a4798078e9">here</a>. I tried to keep the implementation short without doing anything outright barbarous. For intuition as to why this network is so often used, that example implementation took me about 30 minutes from scratch (although I’ve implemented this several times before).</p>
    
      <h2 id="what-are-the-alternatives">
        
        
          What are the alternatives? <a href="#what-are-the-alternatives">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>What options does a deep learning practitioner in medical imaging have outside of the U-Net? We’ll start from the beginning with the ResNet, a now-classic architecture, and move on to more recent architectures that build on the encoder-decoder architecture of the U-Net.</p>
    
      <h2 id="alternative-1-resnet">
        
        
          Alternative 1: ResNet <a href="#alternative-1-resnet">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The ResNet architecture introduced residual connections—similar to the skip connections of the U-Net—which made it possible to train architectures with many more convolutional layers. The residual connections added the features of earlier layers to later ones so that the convolutional layers only had to learn the difference (that is, the <em>residual</em>). This can be seen in the equation below, where x is the input, y is the output, and f is the residual layer.</p>



<p>This trick helped solve a long-standing problem of getting backpropagation to update the weights of early layers in very deep neural networks.</p>

<p>The ResNet was initially proposed for classification tasks, and thus was a straight-forward architecture composed of residual blocks and pooling layers to downsample the input to an output vector shaped according to the number of target classes. The downsampling and lack of upsampling layers make this architecture not immediately transferable to segmentation, but the architecture can be modified to do so.</p>

<p>Another problem with this network for medical imaging purposes is that the implementations of the network are for 2D networks. When working with 3D images like MR and CT, you’ll either need to use a 2D or 2.5D method of slice extraction to fit the images into the network. Given that the architectures that we will discuss in the remainder of this article are created for natural images, this 2D dimension problem persists; however, all of the mentioned 2D networks can be converted into 3D networks by replacing 2D convolutions, pooling, and other layers for their 3D equivalents. This conversion can make the number of parameters explode, and the resulting network can be infeasible to train due to memory-constraints. Nevertheless, it is usually straight-forward to modify the hyperparameters so as to create a working 3D model from a 2D one.</p>
    
      <h2 id="alternative-2-deeplabv3">
        
        
          Alternative 2: DeepLabv3+ <a href="#alternative-2-deeplabv3">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02611.pdf">DeepLabv3+</a> architecture is one way to modify the ResNet for semantic segmentation. There are several modifications, but the one most relevant to our purposes is the modification to be an encoder-decoder with skip connections (akin to the U-Net). This is done by making the ResNet into the encoder and adding additional upsampling layers to form the decoder. Skip connections use features from intermediate layers of the ResNet and concatenate them to intermediate features in the decoder. See Fig. 2 for a block diagram of the architecture (look at the original paper for a description of the ASPP block).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/deeplabv3plus.svg" alt="DeepLabv3+ architecture">
    <figcaption>Figure 2: DeepLabv3+ architecture</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another important modification is that the architecture uses dilated convolutions instead of downsampling to increase the receptive field. See Fig. 3 for an example of a dilated convolution, where the shaded blue squares in the array on the bottom show the kernel of the dilated convolution (mapping to the shaded teal square on the top array).</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/dilation.gif" alt="Dilated convolution">
    <figcaption>Figure 3: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07285">Dilated convolution</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The benefit of dilated convolution is the size of the feature map is kept constant while increasing the receptive field. While keeping the feature maps a constant size is more computationally and memory inefficient, the resulting dense features make it easier to resolve small objects in the input image—an important characteristic for segmentation.</p>

<p>These two modifications have been shown to produce state-of-the-art performance on many semantic segmentation datasets in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452109420301172">medical</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8620285">imaging</a>. While the network is large in terms of numbers of parameters and computationally expensive to run, this architecture has the benefit of using a ResNet as the encoder which can be found pre-trained in all of the most common deep learning frameworks (for example, PyTorch and Tensorflow). Using a pre-trained network can often reduce the training time or improve the robustness of the network on an underlying task (as discussed in our previous article on <a href="https://innolitics.com/articles/self-supervised-learning/">self-supervised learning</a>).</p>

<p>There are many implementations of this network that are freely available, but many of the PyTorch implementations we found were difficult to follow, so <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcreinhold/faff34dc075bdbfe7d85bf2b16249516">we implemented our own</a> that attempts to maximize code reuse from the PyTorch vision repository.</p>
    
      <h2 id="alternative-3-tiramisu">
        
        
          Alternative 3: Tiramisu <a href="#alternative-3-tiramisu">🔗</a>
        
        
      </h2>
<p>The main contribution of the ResNet—the use of residual connections—begged the question: If it is good to connect previous layers output to later layers, is it better to connect all previous layers to all future ones? It turns out, in some applications, that the answer was yes. The <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Huang_Densely_Connected_Convolutional_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf">DenseNet</a>, composed of several densely-connected (in terms of residual connections) blocks, improved the performance on image classification tasks. An example of a densely-connected block is shown in Fig. 4. Like the ResNet, however, DenseNets were designed for classification and need to be modified for semantic segmentation.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://innolitics.com/img/articles/segmentation-overview/denseblock.svg" alt="Example densely-connected block">
    <figcaption>Figure 4: Example densely-connected block</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.09326.pdf">Tiramisu</a> architecture blends together the DenseNet and the encoder-decoder with skip connections structure of the U-Net to get the benefits of the densely-connected convolutional layers, as well as the greater spatial-structure-preserving aspects of the U-Net.</p>

<p>The idea of how to blend the two architectures together is simple, but it works well for <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32248-938">medical image analysis applications</a>. The idea is simply to replace the convolutional blocks of the …</p></div></div></div>

				<p><em>I have built a custom search functionality for this blog,
based on Java and the Apache Lucene full-text search library,
compiled into a native binary using the Quarkus framework and GraalVM.
It is deployed as a Serverless application running on AWS Lambda,
providing search results without any significant cold start delay.
If you thought Java wouldn’t be the right language for this job, keep reading;
in this post I’m going to give an overview over the implementation of this feature and my learnings along the way.</em></p>
<p>Having a search functionality for my blog has been on my mind for quite some time;
I’d like to give users the opportunity to find specific contents on this blog right here on this site, without having to use an external search engine.
That’s not only nice in terms of user experience, but also having insight into the kind of information readers look for on this blog should help me to identify interesting things to write about in the future.</p>
<p>Now this blog is a static site — generated using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> — which makes this an interesting challenge.
I didn’t want to rely on an external search service
(see "Why No External Search Service" below for the reasoning),
and also a purely client-side solution as described in this <a href="https://endler.dev/2019/tinysearch/">excellent blog post</a> didn’t seem ideal.
While technically fascinating, I didn’t like the fact that it requires shipping the entire search index to the client for executing search queries.
Also things like result highlighting, customized result scoring, word stemming, fuzzy search and more seemed a bit more than I’d be willing to implement on the client.</p>
<p>All these issues have largely been solved on the server-side by libraries such as <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Apache Lucene</a> for quite some time.
Using a library like Lucene means implementing a custom server-side process, though.
How to deploy such service?
Operating a VM 24/7 with my search backend for what’s likely going to be not more than a few dozen queries per month seemed a bit like overkill.</p>
<p>So after some consideration I decided to implement my own search functionality,
based on the highly popular Apache Lucene library,
deployed as a Serverless application,
which is started on-demand if a user runs a query on my website.
In the remainder of this post I’m going to describe the solution I came up with and how it works.</p>
<p>If you like, you can try it out right now, this post is about this little search input control at the top right of this page!</p>

<p>Why No External Search Service?</p>
<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling/status/1284925378868518913">tweeting</a> about my serverless search experiment, one of the questions was "What’s wrong with <a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a>?".
To be very clear, there’s nothing wrong with it at all.
External search services like Algolia, <a href="https://developers.google.com/custom-search">Google Custom Search</a>, or an Elasticsearch provider such as <a href="https://bonsai.io/">Bonsai</a> promise an easy-to-use, turn-key search functionality which can be a great choice for your specific use case.</p>
<p>However, I felt that none of these options would provide me the degree of control and customizability I was after.
I also ruled out any "free" options, as they’d either mean having ads or paying for the service with the data of myself or that of my readers.
And to be honest, I also just fancied the prospect of solving the problem by myself, instead of relying on an off-the-shelf solution.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="_why_serverless">Why Serverless?</h2>
<div>
<p>First of all, let’s discuss why I opted for a Serverless solution.
It boils down to three reasons:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Security:</em> While it’d only cost a few EUR per month to set up a VM with a cloud provider like Digital Ocean or Hetzner, having to manage a full operating system installation would require too much of my attention; I don’t want someone to mine bitcoins or doing other nasty things on a box I run, just because I failed to apply some security patch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Cost:</em> Serverless does not only promise to scale-out (and let’s be honest, there likely won’t be millions of search queries on my blog every month), but also scale-to-zero.
As Serverless is pay-per-use and there are free tiers in place e.g. for AWS Lambda,
this service ideally should cost me just a few cents per month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Learning Opportunity:</em> Last but not least, this also should be a nice occasion for me to dive into the world of Serverless, by means of designing, developing and running a solution for a real-world problem, exploring how Java as my preferred programming language can be used for this task</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_solution_overview">Solution Overview</h2>
<div>
<p>The overall idea is quite simple: there’s a simple HTTP service which takes a query string,
runs the query against a Lucene index with my blog’s contents and returns the search results to the caller.
This service gets invoked via JavaScript from my static blog pages,
where results are shown to the user.</p>
<p>The Lucene search index is read-only and gets rebuilt whenever I update the blog.
It’s baked into the search service deployment package,
which that way becomes fully immutable.
This reduces complexities and the attack surface at runtime.
Surely that’s not an approach that’s viable for more dynamic use cases,
but for a blog that’s updated every few weeks, it’s perfect.
Here’s a visualization of the overall flow:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://www.morling.dev/images/serverless_search_overview.png" alt="Serverless Search Solution Overview">
</p>
</div>
<p>The search service is deployed as a Serverless function on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>.
One important design goal for me is to avoid lock-in to any specific cloud provider:
the solution should be portable and also be usable with container-based Serverless approaches like <a href="https://knative.dev/">Knative</a>.</p>
<p>Relying on a Serverless architecture means its start-up time must be a matter of milli-seconds rather than seconds,
so to not have a user wait for a noticeable amount of time in case of a cold start.
While <a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/building-class-data-sharing-archives-with-apache-maven/">substantial improvements</a> have been made in recent Java versions to improve start-up times,
it’s still not ideal for this kind of use case.
Therefore, the application is compiled into a native binary via <a href="https://quarkus.io/">Quarkus</a> and <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>,
which results in a start-up time of ~30 ms on my laptop, and ~180 ms when deployed to AWS Lambda.
With that we’re in a range where a cold start won’t impact the user experience in any significant way.</p>
<p>The Lambda function is exposed to callers via the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/">AWS API Gateway</a>,
which takes incoming HTTP requests, maps them to calls of the function and converts its response into an HTTP response which is sent back to the caller.</p>
<p>Now let’s dive down a bit more into the specific parts of the solution.
Overall, there are four steps involved:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_data_extraction">Data extraction:</a></em> The blog contents to be indexed must be extracted and converted into an easy-to-process data format</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_search_backend_implementation">Search backend implementation:</a></em> A small HTTP service is needed which exposes the search functionality of Apache Lucene, which in particular requires some steps to enable Lucene being used in a native GraalVM binary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_wiring_things_up">Integration with the website:</a></em> The search service must be integrated into the static site on GitHub Pages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><a href="#_deployment_to_aws_lambda">Deployment:</a></em> Finally, the search service needs to be deployed to AWS API Gateway and Lambda</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>

<div>
<p>The first step was to obtain the contents of my blog in an easily processable format.
Instead of requiring something like a real search engine’s crawler,
I essentially only needed to have a single file in a structured format which then can be passed on to the Lucene indexer.</p>
<p>This task proved rather easy with Hugo;
by means of a <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats/#output-formats-for-pages">custom output format</a> it’s straight-forward to produce a JSON file which contains the text of all my blog pages.
In my <em>config.toml</em> I declared the new output format and activate it for the homepage
(largely inspired by this <a href="https://xdeb.org/post/2017/06/11/make-hugo-generate-a-json-search-index-and-json-feed/">write-up</a>):</p>

<p>The template in <em>layouts/_default/list.searchindex.json</em> isn’t too complex either:</p>

<p>My stack of choice for this kind of application is Quarkus.
As a <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka-streams-guide">contributor</a>, I am of course biased, but Quarkus is ideal for the task at hand:
built and optimized from the ground up for implementing fast-starting and memory-efficient cloud-native and Serverless applications,
it makes building HTTP services, e.g. based on JAX-RS, running on GraalVM a trivial effort.</p>
<p>Now typically a Java library such as Lucene will not run in a GraalVM native binary out-of-the-box.
Things like reflection or JNI usage require specific configuration,
while other Java features like method handles are only supported partly or not at all.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_apache_lucene_in_a_graalvm_native_binary">Apache Lucene in a GraalVM Native Binary</h3>
<p>Quarkus enables a wide range of popular Java libraries to be used with GraalVM,
but at this point there’s no extension yet which would take care of Lucene.
So I set out to implement a small Quarkus extension for Lucene.
Depending on the implementation details of the library in question, this can be a more or less complex and time-consuming endeavor.
The workflow is like so:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>compile down an application using the library into a native image</p>

<li>
<p>run into some sort of …</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-9565"><div><div><div><h2>While Apple wants MacBook users to remove Webcam tapes/covers, Purism’s Librem 14 Linux laptop now has microphone kill switch in addition to BIOS kill switch</h2><p>After Apple issued an <a href="https://androidrookies.com/taping-your-macbook-camera-to-prevent-it-from-spying-is-not-a-good-option-says-apple/">advisory to MacBook users</a> to not cover their webcams with tapes or physical switches, the need and efficacy of such methods is being <a href="https://androidrookies.com/purism-criticizes-apple-for-its-no-webcam-tape-covers-on-macbooks-advice/">debated</a> upon by tech gurus and pundits. The whole debate revolves around trusting Apple with users’ privacy and security. Many pro-Apple fanbois agree that users should let Apple decide what is best for them while the anti-camp says that kill switch is the way forward.</p><p>Apple may never offer a kill switch for the webcam on its MacBooks, but a Linux laptop maker, Purism is making kill switches its USP for selling its laptops.&nbsp;&nbsp;Purism is a Linux laptop maker that is huge on privacy and security. On 24th July Purism had announced that it will offer the Librem 14 PureOS power Linux laptops with BIOS kill switch which would give users <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/librem-14-features-bios-and-ec-write-protection/">BIOS and EC flash chip write protection</a>.</p><p>Now the company CFO, <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/librem-14-adds-microphone-kill-switch-enhancements/">Kyle Rankin has announced that Librem 14</a> will also feature a Microphone kill switch including even for those that are connected through the headphone jack. The Microphone kill switch will provide users physically disallow any spyware, hacker, or malware from using the microphone. If the Librem 14 user uses headsets with a built-in microphone, this kill switch disables the mic but leaves the audio to work properly so the user can continue to listen to any sound that comes through this port.</p><blockquote><p>With the Librem 14 we have enhanced this kill switch so that it also disables the microphone in the headphone jack while leaving audio out unaffected. That way if you happen to leave a headset plugged in–which is common in the age of quarantined video chats–you can use the hardware kill switch to disable all microphones, even ones connected through the headphone jack.</p><p>Kyle Rankin</p></blockquote><p>The Librem 14 is a 14 inch Linux PureOS powered laptop with Intel Core i7 10710U processor. The Librem 14 is priced at $1499 but the company is offering a flat $300 discount if you <a href="https://shop.puri.sm/shop/librem-14/">pre-order before August 7, 2020</a>.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header><small>Article - TypeScript - GraphQl<!-- --> · <!-- -->3 min read</small><h4>Autogenerate Typescript types and custom React hooks in React applications with GraphQL Code Generator.</h4><figure><img src="https://danilowoz.com/images/generating-typescript-types-and-react-hooks-based-on-graphql-endpoint/cover.jpg" alt="Generating TypeScript types and React Hooks based on GraphQL endpoint"><figcaption><small>Photo by Fred Jesus</small></figcaption></figure></header><p>Nowadays, developing ReactJS with TypeScript gives us a solid way to write applications: it adds the advantage of type-safety, component auto-documentation, error handling, and accurate autocomplete in the editor code. However, it still requires a considerable effort to write types and keep them maintainable. Moreover, when the data provider is a GraphQL server, it makes you feel like you're doing a useless job, given the server already has its own schemas for types. Seem redundant, right?</p><p>With this in mind, <a href="https://graphql-code-generator.com/">GraphQL Code Generator</a> gives us the ability to generate TypesScript typing out of GraphQL schemas. Beyond that, it gives us a couple of plugins to create custom React hooks that don't require any kind of maintenance or workaround to fit into your application.</p><p>Among many others, some of the benefits of using this tool:</p><ul><li><strong>Codeless:</strong> forget about creating the interfaces/types for every GraphQL endpoints; save time and spend effort on what matters;</li><li><strong>Development experience:</strong> as a result of having the types always available, your editor will provide meaningful autocomplete and error checking;</li><li><strong>Types always up-to-date:</strong> if your GraphQL endpoint schemas change, your application will be updated and typescript will help you make sure you make the necessary changes.</li></ul><h2>Setup</h2><p>First of all, let's install the dependencies needed:</p><pre><pre><p><span>npm i @apollo/react-hooks graphql</span></p></pre></pre><pre><pre><p><span>npm i @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/import-types-preset @graphql-codegen/typescript @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations @graphql-codegen/typescript-react --save-dev</span></p></pre></pre><p>I'm considering the following folder structure, but of course, feel free to adapt it to your liking, just have in mind that it needs a place to store the schemas that will be fetched by the Code Generator:</p><pre><pre><p><span>📦 my-project</span></p><p><span>┣ 📂 src</span></p><p><span>┃ ┣ 📂 pages</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┗ index.tsx</span></p><p><span>┃ ┣ 📂 queries</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┣ 📂 autogenerate</span></p><p><span>┃ ┃ ┗ my-query.gql</span></p><p><span>┃ ┗ apollo-client.ts</span></p><p><span>┣ codegen.yml</span></p><p><span>┗ package.json</span></p></pre></pre><p>Then, basically, you'll need to create a configuration file at the root of the project, named <code>codegen.yml</code>. The following snippet shows how I usually set it up in my projects, where it generates different files for its own purpose, in other words, split by concerns like GraphQL operations and server schemas:</p><pre><pre><p><span></span><span>schema</span><span>:</span><span> https</span><span>:</span><span>//countries</span><span>-</span><span>274616.ew.r.appspot.com/graphql/</span></p><p><span></span><span>overwrite</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>hooks</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>afterAllFileWrite</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>-</span><span> prettier </span><span>-</span><span>-</span><span>write</span></p><p><span></span><span>generates</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>src/queries/autogenerate/schemas.tsx</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>documents</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'src/queries/**/**.gql'</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>plugins</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>-</span><span> typescript</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>src/queries/autogenerate/operations.tsx</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>documents</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'src/queries/**/**.gql'</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>preset</span><span>:</span><span> import</span><span>-</span><span>types</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>presetConfig</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>typesPath</span><span>:</span><span> ./schemas</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>plugins</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>-</span><span> typescript</span><span>-</span><span>operations</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>src/queries/autogenerate/hooks.tsx</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>documents</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'src/queries/**/**.gql'</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>preset</span><span>:</span><span> import</span><span>-</span><span>types</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>presetConfig</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>typesPath</span><span>:</span><span> ./operations</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>plugins</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>-</span><span> typescript</span><span>-</span><span>react</span><span>-</span><span>apollo</span></p><p><span>    </span><span>config</span><span>:</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>withHOC</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>withComponent</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span></span></p><p><span>      </span><span>withHooks</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>true</span></p></pre></pre><p>Also, let's add the scripts to generate the schemas and watch the files change in <code>package.json</code>:</p><pre><pre><p><span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  ...</span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"schemas"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"graphql-codegen --config codegen.yml"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>"schemas:watch"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"npm run schemas -- --watch"</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>,</span></p></pre></pre><p>And as it turns out in the editor code:</p><img src="https://danilowoz.com/images/generating-typescript-types-and-react-hooks-based-on-graphql-endpoint/live-coding.gif" alt="Live coding" width="800" height="461"><p>This is only one of the possible ways to use it, as it has many plugins, presets, integrations, and configurations, for different purposes such as to generate React higher-order component, Gatsby integration, prettier and lint the files, among other cool things.

<![CDATA[Standard C Loop Idioms]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>What’s your standard idioms for doing loops in C? A summary of a Twitter
thread betweeen me, Per Vognsen and Shachaf. 
<!-- excerpt end --></p>


<h2 id="looping-over-arrays">Looping over Arrays</h2>
<p>One of the most common idioms in a programming language is the form of a loop.
The idiomatic form is like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)  // or i += stride
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And for pointers:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (T *p = start; p != end; p++)  // or p += stride
    *p = 1.0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not an arbitrary choice. It visits each member of an n-element array
indexed from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code>. It places all loop control in the for itself, runs
in increasing order, and uses the very idiomatic ++ operator to update the loop
variable. It leaves the index variable at a known value just beyond the last
element.</p>

<p>But what about backwards iteration? How do you do that? Some use the <code>--&gt;</code> “operator”:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (int i = n; i--&gt;0;)
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Others prefers to start iterating at <code>n-1</code> (it was my preferred way in the past):</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (int i = n-1; i &gt;= 0; i--)
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pervognsen/status/1252099900193435650">In a twitter thread, Per Vognsen
said</a> that he
prefers to start at n due to it being analoguous to the pointer case<sup id="fnref:indices-between"><a href="#fn:indices-between">1</a></sup>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (int i = n; i &gt; 0; i--)
    a[i-1] = 1.0;

for (T *p = end; i != start; p++)
    p[-1] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>His motivation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>n-1</code> and <code>i &gt;= 0</code> form doesn’t translate to the pointer case without
invoking undefined behavior (you can’t point past the start of an object in
C). […] BTW, this is all related to the choice of using 0-based
indices/addresses and lower-inclusive, upper-exclusive ranges. With 1-based
indexing and lower-inclusive, upper-exclusive you have mirror symmetry.<sup id="fnref:EWD831"><a href="#fn:EWD831">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="using-unsigned-index-variables">Using Unsigned Index Variables</h2>
<p>In C the <code>sizeof</code> operator returns <code>size_t</code> and malloc takes a <code>size_t</code>
parameter. In C++ the containers <code>size()</code> method<sup id="fnref:size-rant"><a href="#fn:size-rant">3</a></sup> returns <code>size_t</code>
. Even more the <code>std::string</code> uses <code>size_t</code> in many parameters and it uses
<code>(size_t)-1</code> as a sentinel for value not found. So C and C++ programmers need
to deal with using unsigned index variables.</p>

<p>I like the idea of using <code>size_t</code> for showing intent: this variable represents
an index into memory. But it’s easy to end up with unintended underflow in the
for condition expression. Using <code>size_t</code> works fine for looping forward over a
collection <code>i = [0, n)</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) 
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>But statements where the condition expression might be negative causes endless
loops, such as this when <code>offset</code> is larger than <code>n</code>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; n-offset; i++) 
    a[i] = 1.0;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So you have to guard each such for-statement inside an if-statement. Clumsy! I
haven’t found a way around that.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>size_t len = n - offset;
if (len &lt; n) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
        a[i] = 1.0;
    }
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<h2 id="iterators">Iterators</h2>
<p>I’ve, <a href="https://twitter.com/shachaf/status/1256772996154286082">like twitter user Shachaf</a> done C iterators in this style:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Iterator it = foo_start();
while (foo_next(&amp;it)) {
    ...it.value...
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pervognsen/status/1256775864366194690">Per pointed out</a> that this is a conflation of iterator state vs iterator value.
He places the return value of the next call inside the struct and ends up
with an API similar to this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>for (Iterator it = iterator_init(); iterator_next(&amp;val);) 
    use(val);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Per has written a <a href="https://gist.github.com/pervognsen/fed0b1328b10b63f51ad42f961fc4058">line, word and token iterator using his Ion language in a
gist</a>. A
C implementation of a line iterator in his style would be:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>typedef struct StrLinesIter {
    const char *next;
    const char *start;
    const char *end;
} StrLinesIter;

StrLinesIter str_lines(const char *str) {
    return (StrLinesIter){ .next = str };
}

bool str_lines_next(StrLinesIter *iter) {
    if (!*iter-&gt;next) {
        return false;
    }
    iter-&gt;start = iter-&gt;next;
    iter-&gt;end = iter-&gt;next;
    while (*iter-&gt;end &amp;&amp; *iter-&gt;end != '\n') {
        iter-&gt;end++;
    }
    iter-&gt;next = *iter-&gt;end ? iter-&gt;end + 1 : iter-&gt;end;
    return true;
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That iterator can be called like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>for (StrLinesIter iter = str_lines(buf); str_lines_next(&amp;iter);) {
        printf("...'%.*s'\n", (int)(iter.end - iter.start), iter.start);
    }
</code></pre></div></div>

But before we explain SLO, we need to go over another term:&nbsp;<strong>SLI</strong>&nbsp;(Service Level Indicator).</p><p>An SLI is a quantitative measurement of quality of a Service. It may be unique to each use-case, but there are certain standard qualities of services that practitioners tend to follow.</p><ul><li><strong>Availability</strong>&nbsp;The amount of time that a service was available to respond to a request.

For example, if the rate of food preparation at a restaurant falls below a certain number of dishes per hour, the customers are going to have longer waiting periods.</p><p>Having the right SLOs help you take better decisions.</p><h2 id="7501"><span id="Uptime"></span>Uptime<span></span></h2><p>One of the primary indicators and objectives is&nbsp;<strong>Uptime</strong>. If the site isnâ€™t serving, speed and accuracy should not even be a concern. This is also why uptime is usually desired to be close to 100%.</p><p><em>If there’s a restaurant that sees footfall throughout the day and night, why shut and lose business.</em></p><p>How do we compute uptime? That’s fairly straightforward. The time that the systems were up / total time.</p><p>To compute:</p><p> \[x = {Up \over (Up + Down)}\%\]</p><hr><p>99% uptime means that out of&nbsp;<strong><em>total time</em>,</strong> we have&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>% allowance to not be available. Over the course of a year, this turns out to be 3.7 (~4) days.<br>But would a business, say a retail store be OK remaining shut for consecutive 4 days from 25th December â€” 28th December?</p><p>Uptime is like a periodic allowance that we get a refill on, not ration that we can keep accumulating. If it wasn’t spent, there’s no carry forward.</p><p>Based on each bucket, the downtime allowance may seem more palpable.</p><figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>9s</strong></td><td><strong>Downtime per Day</strong></td><td><strong>Downtime per Week</strong></td><td><strong>Downtime per Month</strong></td><td><strong>Downtime per Year</strong></td></tr><tr><td>99%</td><td>14.4 Mins</td><td>1.7 Hrs</td><td>7.3 Hrs</td><td>3.7 Days</td></tr><tr><td>99.9%</td><td>1.4 Mins</td><td>10.1 Mins</td><td>43.8 Hrs</td><td>8.7 Hrs</td></tr><tr><td>99.99%</td><td>8.6 Secs</td><td>1 Mins</td><td>4.4 Mins</td><td>52.6 Mins</td></tr><tr><td>99.999%</td><td>0.864 Secs</td><td>6.1 Secs</td><td>26.3 Secs</td><td>5.3 Mins</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Measure of Availability in 9s</figcaption></figure><p><strong>How do you measure the time that the service is up?</strong></p><p>A request comes in, the request was served.

For a request that wasnâ€™t served, there cannot be a log line emitted. So how do we measure it at the receiver? And how do we control the sender?</p><hr><h2 id="cd36"><span id="Option_1_SDK_(Measure_at_each_caller)"></span>Option 1: SDK (Measure at each caller)<span></span></h2><p>We could use an SDK that tracks every outbound request to our service. Depending on the design, one may be using&nbsp;<a href="https://envoy-mobile.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://envoy-mobile.github.io/</a>&nbsp;or a segment.com to emit constant metrics.

There will be a Firewall upstreaming to a Load Balancer upstreaming to a L7 proxy upstreaming to your servers.</p><blockquote><p>SLOs is an aggregate of all layers underneath.</p></blockquote><p>We should be talking about the SLO of each layer before the service as a whole. A breach in&nbsp;<strong>Uptime</strong>&nbsp;SLO of a backend service would impact NOT the uptime but the&nbsp;<strong>ErrorRatio</strong>&nbsp;of the calling L7Proxy. Similarly, if the L7Proxy is down, Load Balancerâ€™s&nbsp;<strong>ErrorRatio</strong>&nbsp;will increase and not the&nbsp;<strong>Uptime</strong>. All the way till we reach the CDN, probably.</p><p>So, Uptime (as customer experiences) is best measured at the layer which is closest to the Customer and farthest from the code.</p><p>Each such layer, we are probably monitoring the uptime of a component which is not our core business unit and outside our control. In the -&gt; LB -&gt; CDN -&gt; â€¦ journey, we have probably lost the uptime essence of the actual code deployed.</p><p><em>Itâ€™s possible that the business calls the SLO&nbsp;<strong>Uptime</strong>, but what we’re actually addressing is the&nbsp;<strong>ErrorRatio!!</strong></em></p><hr><h2 id="a354"><span id="Option_2_Uptime_(actually_Downtime)_Monitors"></span>Option 2: Uptime (actually Downtime) Monitors<span></span></h2><p>This is where we introduce uptime monitors and downtime checkers. Simple services that have existed forever, but extremely crucial. Outsource the trust of uptime to these services where some poor bot(s) have been assigned the mundane work of periodically hitting a service endpoint.</p><p> \[Uptime = {timeUp \over (timeUp + timeDown)}\%\]</p><p>This introduces two compromises:</p><ul><li>Uptime is now as the monitor sees it,&nbsp;<strong>Not</strong>&nbsp;how the real customer sees it. Those 1% of ISP faults may still be affected.</li><li>How about the reliability of the uptime monitor? If we have trouble staying up 100% of the time, sure they cannot be up 100% of the time.</li></ul><p><em>Say, uptime monitor guarantees an uptime of 99.99%, What if those 4 minutes donâ€™t overlap? For the 4 minutes that the uptime monitor was down for, the service may be up or down, the monitor would not know.</em></p><hr><p>We donâ€™t keep all our eggs in the same basket. We introduce a multi-geography downtime monitor. Say a downtime monitor requests from 4 Geos.</p><ul><li>Should a failure across 1 Geo- be called a downtime?</li><li>What if one of the Geos is highlighting a downtime for a geographical region?</li><li>Also,&nbsp;<strong>CAP</strong>&nbsp;and Network failures.</li></ul><p>Downtime monitors arenâ€™t holier-than-thou. They go through glitches too. They need to retry too. Say if a request failed, wisdom says retry. Wisdom says Hystrix. But what about the failed attempt? Was it a failure or was it counted as success?</p><p>Before we proceed, there is a frequency too. How often do we check? We cannot go per second. We cannot go per minute. Itâ€™s a balance that we pick.</p><ul><li>The faster we check, the shallower will be the health check.</li><li>The slower we check, the deeper can be the health check.</li></ul><p>Depth of a health check is basically a trade-off we make. A shallow check only checks for a static response. A deeper health check will check for a DB operation in and out. The DB call obviously will take considerably longer and eat a transaction. We canâ€™t have that come in every 10 seconds.</p><p><em>The frequency vs depth is an argument that doesnâ€™t have one right answer. And like other things, we may just need both.</em></p><hr><h2 id="6263"><span id="Option_3_Statebased_Monitors"></span>Option 3: State-based Monitors<span></span></h2><p>Because the uptime is not being requested every ms, we count the time between states of the service.</p><p>We need states.&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>.</p><p>Error is confirmed down. The Unknown could be any emission that was interrupted or pending for retry or the duration that was in-between maintenance.</p><ul><li>Time spent between&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;since you cannot tell for sure.</li><li>Time spent between&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>.</li><li>Time spent between&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Unknown</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;since you cannot tell whether service is Up or not.</li><li>Similarly, the time between&nbsp;<strong>Error</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;is considered down, since it was down.</li></ul><p>This in itself is the first step of aggregation.</p><p>Letâ€™s take these two situations</p><ol><li>Counted as&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;for 20.

		</div><p>Some 700 years ago, the Tuscan town of Siena was a burgeoning banking and proto-industrial powerhouse with over 50,000 inhabitants — a population surpassed only by medieval “mega-cities” like Paris, London and Milan.</p>
<p>But then, in 1348, just when the thriving city was in the prime of its golden age, Siena’s prosperity was brought to a sudden halt by the Black Death. In just a few years, the city lost 60 percent of its population and entered into a steep decline, falling into obscurity. It took until the 20th century for it to <a href="http://www.montana.edu/historybug/yersiniaessays/davis.html#:~:text=In%201348%2C%20the%20pestilence%20struck,population%20(Benedictow%2C%202004).&amp;text=Siena%20suffered%20immensely%20more%20than,Florence%20both%20culturally%20and%20economically." target="_blank">recover</a> its pre-pandemic size.</p>
<p>COVID-19 isn’t nearly as deadly as the medieval bubonic plague, but the social and economic upheaval it’s caused is already leaving physical marks on modern cities in Europe: Once-busy business districts have emptied out as people opt to work from home. Shops and restaurants have closed. Public transport has slowed down.</p>
<p>There’s also reason to believe this pandemic could have an even more lasting impact than its predecessors. For the first time since the earliest cities emerged in the Fertile Crescent some 6,000 years ago, concentrated urban centers no longer have a monopoly on the economic and cultural connections that make civilizations tick forward.</p>

<p>For many workers worried about the coronavirus — and employers looking to cut costs during the economic crisis that has followed — technologies like video conferencing, shared documents and instant messaging provide viable alternatives to high-rise office buildings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, services like video streaming and social media and websites like Reddit and Twitter offer a taste of the cultural effervescence and community that has drawn so many to the big city over the centuries. You don't even need a bar or club to meet the love of your life: Apps like Tinder, Bumble or Grindr are happy to link you to a potential mate.</p>
<p>“This pandemic has the potential to really affect cities,” said Peter Clark, a professor of European urban history at the University of Helsinki.&nbsp;“If there isn’t a second wave, the changes may be far fewer than people are speculating. But if there is, we could see the European model of the ‘cultural city’ seriously affected.</p>
<p>“Because of deindustrialization, since the 1980s, we’ve had a shift to the service sector in order to maintain urban prosperity,” he added. “The pandemic poses a direct threat to that model.”</p>
<h3><strong>Ghost towns</strong></h3>
<p>There’s no question whether the pandemic has transformed working life.</p>
<p>In the early spring, as the coronavirus spread through Europe, government restrictions forced all but essential workers such as health and supermarket workers to work from home to keep new infections at bay. Industrial demand slowed or shut down completely as purchases of cars and other products collapsed.</p>
<p>Before the lockdowns, teleworking was not particularly common in most European countries.&nbsp;According to <a href="https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/data/percentage-of-workers-doing-telework-and-ict-based-mobile-work" target="_blank">data compiled by Eurofound</a>, just 11 percent of Germans and 8 percent of Italians “occasionally” worked remotely in 2015.</p>
<p>But as the crisis progressed, workers and businesses adjusted remarkably quickly to the new reality. Government, corporate and other meetings <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1310870">shifted online</a>; classes were taught <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1351286">virtually</a>; e-medicine and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1322367">virtual therapy</a> took off.</p>
<p>The question now is whether these new behaviors will stick — or whether most people will return to their offices as soon as they can.</p>

<p>Stanford University economist Nicholas Bloom, an expert on teleworking, says that while it’s unrealistic to expect everyone to work from home indefinitely, between 50 percent and 60 percent of the population would be able to keep at it.</p>
<p>“A third of the working population — office workers, senior management — can telework 100 percent of the time. Another third — clothing designers, real estate agents, scientific researchers — can do it most of the time, but will sometimes need to be onsite. And another third cannot do it at all: Most of these people are lower-paid service-sector workers, but you also have higher-range jobs like those held by dentists, surgeons, pilots.”</p>
<p>Bloom says it’s still too early to tell how intense the impact of the pandemic will be, but that it’s unlikely that office workers will want to go back to business as usual, even if a cure or a vaccine is developed.</p>
<p>“The skyscrapers and office buildings in the city centers that used to be our most valued real estate have become places people avoid out of fear of infection,” Bloom said. “I don’t see people growing comfortable with packed subway trains and elevators, and firms aren't going to want to open and close every time there’s a wave.”</p>

<p>“It’s the fear of the virus that keeps people at home,” said Sven Smit, senior partner at McKinsey &amp; Company and co-chair of the McKinsey Global Institute. He added that while it was too early to be certain the shift would stick, “the tendency [for longer-term change] is there.”</p>
<p>Companies have already taken notice of the opportunities for cost-cutting. A <a href="https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/covid-19-impacts-on-commercial-property-202006.html" target="_blank">new&nbsp;report</a>&nbsp;from Credit Suisse indicates that office space rental income loss has “so far been limited.” At the same time, however, “executive boards — including those of large global corporations — have identified the latent potential to make savings and are already looking to reduce the amount of space they use.”</p>
<p>Commercial property investments fell by an average of 44 percent across Europe between the middle of March and the end of May, according to <a href="https://www.realestate.bnpparibas.com/covid-19-report-june-2020" target="_blank">figures</a>&nbsp;released by BNP Paribas Real Estate last month; the decline was especially notable in Ireland, where the Irish Times&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/commercial-property/irish-commercial-property-deals-slump-most-in-eu-amid-covid-19-1.4286605" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;that commercial property deals slumped by 79 percent during that period.</p>

<p>In a sign the trend is likely to continue, tech companies like<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/12/twitter-coronavirus-covid19-work-from-home" target="_blank"> Twitter</a> and <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/working-google/working-from-home-and-office/" target="_blank">Google</a> have announced plans for their employees to continue working remotely, and a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-13/most-german-companies-say-work-from-home-should-be-here-to-stay" target="_blank">new&nbsp;survey</a> conducted by Germany’s Ifo Institute shows that 54 percent of businesses want to make greater use of home offices henceforth.</p>
<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10111936118050541/" target="_blank">has said</a> he expects half the company’s workforce to be working from home in the next decade — and that employees who moved to less expensive areas would see their salaries cut to reflect the cost of living.</p>
<p>Michel Serafinelli, an economics lecturer at the University of Essex, said that the value of office space could be expected to decline. “Why rent a big office that only a few workers will be able to use at a time, and only on certain days each week?”</p>
<h3><strong>COVID-flight</strong></h3>
<p>The end of the office, should it come to pass, would transform the urban landscape. Workers, unshackled from their morning commute, will be free to gravitate to suburbs and the countryside.</p>
<p>Europe has a long tradition of rich city-dwellers fleeing plagues to the countryside, leaving the poor and working class behind. In Giovanni Boccaccio’s 14th-century literary landmark, "The Decameron," wealthy Florentines escaped to the Tuscan countryside to hide from the Black Death.</p>
<p>During the coronavirus crisis, urban elites in hard-hit places like Spain and France left the city for greener and safer pastures. Former Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/world/europe/rich-coronavirus-second-homes.html" target="_blank">traveled to his holiday villa in Marbella</a> rather than ride out the lockdown in Madrid.</p>
<p>If there are further waves of the coronavirus or home-working continues to proliferate, that trend could easily stick. Why pay big-city rents for an undersized apartment if you can pursue an equally attractive career from a house in the hills? And from the employer’s point of view, why pay big-city salaries if you can source the same talent for cheaper, even if you never or rarely see your employees in person.</p>
<p>But even if teleworking does become ubiquitous, not everybody will be able — or will want — to flee to the suburbs and the country. And those who stay behind may find the city they call home has become a very different place.</p>

<p>“Cities are almost certainly going to become cheaper, because more spaces become available,” Bloom said. “That might help address the affordability crisis we see in urban centers ... but that’s going to leave quite a vacuum.” Artists, he added, “might move into the vacant spaces, but they don’t spend much money, and that’s quite a problem for cities that rely on revenue to offer services.”</p>
<p>Businesses are already suffering from the knock-on effects of emptier business areas and city centers. Shops, restaurants and other services that depend on corporate and other clientele are reeling from the pandemic’s economic impact.</p>
<p>“The restaurants where executives go out to lunch, the cafés where secretaries grab their cappuccino, the retail shops where workers shop on their breaks…&nbsp;If the offices go, we&nbsp;can plausibly expect urban expenditure to drop by a third,” Bloom said. “That’s a hit which most commercial spaces can’t take.”</p>
<p>In Brussels’ European Quarter, the disappearance of the Eurocrats and office workers who used to flood Rue de la Loi and the Schuman Roundabout already led to <a href="https://twitter.com/liliebayer/status/1278689951723462658" target="_blank">the&nbsp;closure</a> of one of the area’s most popular cafés.

Let’s work through the steps below:</p><h2 id="1dfd">Step 1: Upload Style Transfer Notebook</h2><p id="93e0">Simply open Google Colab, and in the intro flow where you’re prompted to choose a project/Notebook, drag-and-drop the provided Python Notebook file. Once you’ve done that, Colab should automatically connect to the appropriate runtime—so for the purposes of this project, you won’t need to adjust anything there.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3838/1*SrFFTpGMr8VLrNCqTxlm0A.png" width="1919" height="882" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*SrFFTpGMr8VLrNCqTxlm0A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*SrFFTpGMr8VLrNCqTxlm0A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*SrFFTpGMr8VLrNCqTxlm0A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*SrFFTpGMr8VLrNCqTxlm0A.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*SrFFTpGMr8VLrNCqTxlm0A.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Drag-and-drop the provided model file here.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="12c9">Step 2: Upload Style and Reference (Test) Images</h2><p id="c9aa">Because we’re training our own custom style transfer model, we’ll need to supply our model with the necessary training inputs: a <em>style image</em> and a <em>content reference </em>image.</p><p id="5f3e">With other templates (i.e. Classification, Segmentation), you’d need to upload full image datasets, but here, given the model architecture and task, you’ll only need to upload two images. These are the ones I chose:</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/8064/1*_HR8OlexfrRAGNPdQnaNPQ.png" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*_HR8OlexfrRAGNPdQnaNPQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*_HR8OlexfrRAGNPdQnaNPQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1144/1*_HR8OlexfrRAGNPdQnaNPQ.png 572w" sizes="572px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*_HR8OlexfrRAGNPdQnaNPQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3072/1*oydP9JSQkd8uFJFdS5iudw.png" width="1536" height="1536" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*oydP9JSQkd8uFJFdS5iudw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/858/1*oydP9JSQkd8uFJFdS5iudw.png 429w" sizes="429px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*oydP9JSQkd8uFJFdS5iudw.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Left: Style Image; Right: Content Reference Image</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><p id="4bf6">To upload these, simply drag-and-drop them into the “Files” tab on the left-side panel. Click “Ok” when notified that exiting the runtime will delete these files — we should have a fully trained model once we’re done with this process, so no need to worry about that.</p><blockquote><p id="f5d5"><strong>Important note: </strong>To ensure the model accepts these two input images, they must be named <code>style_image</code> and <code>test_image</code>, respectively. They should be in <code>.png</code> format.</p></blockquote><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*bXyu4VG720a-pbQhSx3hwg.gif" width="600" height="330" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*bXyu4VG720a-pbQhSx3hwg.gif 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*bXyu4VG720a-pbQhSx3hwg.gif 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*bXyu4VG720a-pbQhSx3hwg.gif 600w" sizes="600px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/freeze/max/60/1*bXyu4VG720a-pbQhSx3hwg.gif?q=20"></p></div></div></figure></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><h2 id="6ffa">Step 3: Train the Model</h2><p id="7bcc">Because all the model needs is a single style image to train on and a reference image to test on, we’re ready to train our model once we’ve uploaded these two images.</p><p id="4852">If you scroll through the Notebook you’ll notice each step in the process is commented out, with explanations for what’s happening at each step. I like this kind of additional detail, as it gives small windows into how the model is trained at each step, along with the requisite code blocks. So if you’re interested, I’d encourage you to sift through it to get a flavor of Snap’s magic sauce.</p><p id="9a0b">But if you just want to train your model, click <strong>Runtime </strong>in the top nav bar and choose the first option, <strong>Run All. </strong>This will automatically run all code blocks in succession, all the way from installing the necessary libraries to importing training data (the model leverages the COCO dataset to help train) to training, converting, and downloading the model.</p><blockquote><p id="b900">Note: I was hit with a notification during COCO training data extraction (code block 13 in this template) that indicated I was running out of disk space. If you see this alert, just click OK—with this model training job, using the default runtime, you won’t eclipse that disk space limit.</p></blockquote></div></div><div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1036/1*0Oj8QKjlxvWsei608NC3Bg.png" width="518" height="543" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*0Oj8QKjlxvWsei608NC3Bg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/970/1*0Oj8QKjlxvWsei608NC3Bg.png 485w" sizes="485px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/58/1*0Oj8QKjlxvWsei608NC3Bg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1146/1*yXRLsApDC4X5rf1GyQM0jg.png" width="573" height="564" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*yXRLsApDC4X5rf1GyQM0jg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1032/1*yXRLsApDC4X5rf1GyQM0jg.png 516w" sizes="516px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*yXRLsApDC4X5rf1GyQM0jg.png?q=20"></p></div></div><figcaption>Visualizing model training (left: epochs 0–250; right: epochs 5000–5250)</figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><p id="5402">As you can see in the screenshots above, the Notebook provides a nice in-progress training visualization, which gives you both a qualitative and quantitative look at how the model is coming along.</p><p id="916e">After 10,000 training loops (the default amount — seemed like somewhere between 5000–7500 would have been sufficient), the model successfully trained! Next, we need to download the model and start working with it in Lens Studio.</p><h2 id="f821">Step 4: Downloading the .ONNX file</h2><p id="41bd">This might have to do with my inexperience in coding and working with Colab, but this part tripped me up just a bit. Since all the other code blocks had run automatically, I assumed the same for the model download.</p><figure><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1174/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png" width="587" height="198" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1174/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png 587w" sizes="587px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*h5_Hg8Ux85edsdzhrwKDmw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></figure><p id="a979">But as you can see in the above screenshot, there’s a note at the end that we need to “uncomment” and run the code block manually to actually download the file. Delete the <code>#</code> from the <code>download_onnx_from_colab()</code> function, and delete the remaining white space so that the function is all the way to left margin of the code block.</p><p id="9cdb">Run the block again, and your <code>.onnx</code> file should automatically download. Now we’re ready to implement our custom style transfer model in Lens Studio!</p><p id="cb3d">If you’ll recall, Lens Studio includes a range of templates that pre-populate projects with certain components, textures, and more. One of those is Snap’s Style Transfer Template, and it should be easily accessible from the Lens Studio home page.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3832/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png" width="1916" height="986" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*wNuFx7DkTRrYagBlQB70Bw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Empty Style Transfer Template</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="0531">Above is what you’ll see when you launch the Style Transfer template. The Lens Studio team has already configured this template with components needed to import and run style transfer models built with their Notebooks.</p><p id="2634">Also, you can see that there’s already a preview in the right panel—this is the pre-built model, fashioned from the style and test images Snap provides in the original zip file. Our task here is to add our own model and tell Lens Studio to use it in order to apply the target style within the Lens.</p><h2 id="602b">Step 1: Import Model File</h2><p id="11f6">First, we need to import the <code>.onnx</code> model file into the <strong>Resources</strong> panel (lower left).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section></section><section><article><p>Apps and websites are baked into the e-commerce business plan of practically every startup. As startups move past the early funding rounds, the VCs funding and advising them have to ask, “What’s slowing online growth and how can we help?”</p><p>A usual suspect in these e-commerce growing pains is staffing. Ramping up a solid internal team takes a while, especially when management roles and product plans surf the taller waves of Series A. Startups find themselves confronting a common trade-off between spending on product and spending on marketing and user acquisition.&nbsp;</p><p>Finding a nimble partner at the beginning can help control costs and ensure that you're establishing a strong product foundation until a company’s internal team takes shape. Experienced developers, UX designers, user acquisition experts, and project managers can provide much-needed stability and deliver product updates on time.</p><h4>Find an Agency That’s Flexible</h4><p>Startups vary greatly in the expertise they bring to the table. Some founders are engineers, some favor product management or design, others focus on market research and marketing, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>An effective product partner will be experienced and flexible enough to immediately plug into your most urgent needs, whether it’s front-end development or user acquisition or content strategy.</p><p>That flexibility extends to cost too, sometimes you just need a few people, other times you need an entire team to design, develop, and test a site and app. If an agency can’t go lean or be nimble, move on.</p><p>More importantly, determine if an outside agency can fit in with an existing product team, understand the product vision, and provide firm guidance and structure without stepping on toes.</p><h4>Beware False Prophets</h4><p>When you’re hiring an agency, cost looms over everything. We get it, it’s unavoidable. Startups can feel abstract in the early days, so you don’t want everybody thinking you’re burning cash on something that’s still taking shape.</p><p>But beware of outliers that promise the moon and come in with a low estimate. The long-term cost of using a crummy company the first time around is exorbitant and can be a real company-killer. When bad UX and development get in the bloodstream that early, correcting problems later is a challenge. Broken products, broken dreams!</p><p>VCs should look at an agency’s longevity and relationships:</p><ul><li>How long has the agency been around</li><li>Do they form long-term partnerships with their clients</li><li>Do they get to iterate on projects and therefore really understand users and their needs</li><li>Does the agency portfolio have a healthy mix of large and small companies</li></ul><p>You want to assess an agency's UX process. How do they get to know users and how do they translate UX insights into better experiences? What’s their idea of a frictionless customer experience? And, can they provide reviews and references, just like an individual who’s applying for a job?</p><h4>Be Realistic About “Turnkey” Solutions</h4><p>Please carry grains of salt when considering e-commerce solutions that position themselves as easy and out-of-the-box. Even if your startup is already doing $2-3 million in online sales, chances are you’re going to need a team to help you overcome hurdles you didn’t expect.</p><p>There is a tremendous number of third-party applications for Shopify that handle things like wish lists or reviews or shipping calculations. Some we euphemistically describe as “budget quality,” offering limited customer support, wobbly functionality, and infrequent updates.&nbsp;</p><p>When these apps are updated they can wreak havoc on the rest of your ecosystem. They need to be vetted, monitored, and often tweaked beyond the original code to fit your customer UX and product fulfillment needs.</p><p>Updates can come fast and furious from the solutions providers too. Shopify, Netsuite, and AWS roll out updates big and small all the time (and occasionally unannounced). The potential for things to break, especially if you're making changes to a live site, can be alarmingly high.</p><h4>Since We’re On The Subject of Updates…</h4><p>Get used to them. For some reason, there's still a perception that digital updates and upgrades are a one-time cost, and that once an update happens a product &nbsp;is finally “done.” But that's really never the case. No software is that way anymore, really.</p><p>Consumer products from Adobe and Microsoft have charged monthly subscriptions for their products for years, and they roll out updates regularly. Ditto for many photo and video editing apps on your phone.</p><p>Once you move into the e-commerce space, that principle multiplies. Shopify isn't a flat fee for a reason. Baking in a regular “maintenance” cost is mandatory, and you’ll save yourself headaches by planning for it quarterly versus ad hoc.</p><p>Managing updates applies to product offerings too. E-commerce plans need new products to stay interesting to customers, which in turn requires digital expertise. Are there wholly-new offerings? Are existing product names/lines changing, and are new sizes and colors available? Are new filtering capabilities required since there are more products?</p><h4>Don’t Sleep On Mobile</h4><p>There’s a library of articles dispelling the myth that people don’t buy things on their phones. Some estimates put mobile driving <a as="a" href="https://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/blogs/immersive-commerce-leads-retails-jump-to-light-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">36% of online sales and 58% of all retail traffic.</a></p><p>And yet, that myth persists, maybe because the UX of mobile retail changes so quickly. Or, it could be that the process of getting the web experience right is so time-consuming and cost-intensive, mobile simply becomes an afterthought.</p><p>Lockdown has <a as="a" href="https://internetretailing.net/mobile-theme/mobile-theme/mobile-and-social--along-with-international-traffic--driving-uk-ecommerce-growth--21709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finally changed that perception</a>, and like clockwork, the percentage of mobile purchasing is ticking up every month <a as="a" href="https://www.retaildive.com/spons/millennials-and-gen-zers-look-to-retailers-for-a-more-community-minded-comm/581604/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(especially among younger shoppers embracing “decentralized commerce”)</a>.</p><p>We’ve also observed changing mobile patterns among customers in loyalty programs. The sharp rise of contactless payments (overall use in the U.S. has <a as="a" href="https://tearsheet.co/payments/as-the-effects-of-covid-19-continue-to-rise-in-the-u-s-so-does-the-use-of-contactless-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increased by 150%</a> since March 2019) will boost mobile purchasing across retail sectors too, in-store and at home. It just can’t be an afterthought anymore.</p><h4>Think About Customization</h4><p>Even if a business doesn’t have many SKUs at the moment, room to grow is essential. Customers (especially in sectors like wellness, jewelry, or fashion) want variants, and a lot of them: different colors, sizes, accessories, and add-ons.&nbsp;</p><p>Some e-commerce platforms offer a&nbsp;very&nbsp;limited number of product variants. If a startup has highly-customizable merch, find out how many options your solutions provider can offer … and how smooth the UX ride will be for customers.</p><p>Even if customization isn’t an essential part of your product plan, you should think about (at least) one or two highly-specific technical “must-haves” the online shopping experience will need as it evolves.</p><p>For instance, how will a product fulfillment team’s workflow integrate with a new e-commerce setup? Can a new site handle your post-purchase automation strategy? If your solutions start looking makeshift and jury-rigged, it’s probably because they are. Don’t run from simple solutions to complex backend problems.</p><hr></article></section><section></section><section></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><main><article><section><div><p><span>Mon Jul 27 2020</span></p><div><div><p>A friend and I were discussing school openings in light of Covid19. He was keen on keeping the kids home, while I though it would be better if our kids could go to school and interact in person. To convince me that school should remain online, he sent me an article with the following title - "Scans Reveal Heart Damage in Over Half of COVID-19 Patients!" </p>
<p>Wow, that sounds scary, no parent would want their kids to get heart damage from going to school! If Covid was indeed causing all these issues, then of course it would be wise to keep kids at home. But was it? </p>
<p>From what I could tell after reading the actual paper cited in the article (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/ehjcimaging/article-pdf/doi/10.1093/ehjci/jeaa178/33402488/jeaa178.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noindex nofollow">link here</a>), the paper was not very scientific and had no clear evidence that heart issues in the study were somehow the result of Covid. They sampled a handful of old people who had Covid, and found issues with their cardiograms. They used the two unrelated measurements to draw a conclusion that Covid was somehow responsible for the potential heart problems. To be sure that I was not hallucinating, I asked a medical statistician friend for his opinion. His answer? </p>
<p>"This study reveals no clinically useful information. This is an online retrospective survey, which is generally the lowest possible grade of robustness of clinical data. Definitely not good enough to suggest any causality. Absolutely empty paper."</p>
<p>This is the new reality we live in. Information is free, it's abundant, anyone can publish without much thought, and it is being disseminated with incredible speed. Pick a catchy headline, make the most noise, and your opinion becomes the truth, regardless of how wrong it actually is.</p>
<p>Not only is this bad because false information gets across as facts, it also confuses people and makes us question the facts. No information is safe, no truth is for certain.</p>
<p>The problem with this paper on heart conditions, for example, is that it is not explicitly false. Even though the headline, the data, and the conclusion are all misleading, the very idea that Covid could be related to heart conditions introduces a doubt. The paper does not prove that Covid causes heart conditions, but it also does not prove that it does not. </p>
<p>A trained scientific mind will see that to prove that Covid does not cause heart problems you would have to design a study in which a group of volunteers would get infected with Covid at random, and then measured to see if they develop any such problems. You would not find many volunteers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people without training would read this paper and interpret the lack of evidence as the evidence in itself. "See, they did not prove that Covid did not cause heart problems, therefore there is a <em>chance</em> that it may have caused heart problems." - they would say.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to get their kids sick, so it's only natural to look for ways to be at least somewhat right, when being right means your kids will be safe. But when it comes to serious issues, being right for the sake of being right is wrong. </p>
<p>If we continue down this path, where instead of having intellectual conversations we instead try to win arguments at all costs, we are going to fail. We will have true information presented as disinformation and visa-versa, and so long as it seems legitimate and appeals to one's believes, it would be interpreted as true information.</p>
<p>There is no quick solution to this problem. Facebook won't fix it for us. While Facebook, through human scanning and algorithms can identify that a shark walking across the desert is probably a piece of fake news, only inquisitive dissection of data can uncover fake news like the one above. No, the solution to this problem is us, the collective wisdom of humans.</p>
<p>To be able to identify this type of high quality fake, we need to debate, to discuss, to be willing to lose and to be willing to be wrong. We need to have the freedom to doubt, and the desire to uncover the truth, regardless of what we find. We need to share, openly, willingly, without being afraid that such thoughts would get us in trouble. Asking questions, reasoning, those are the basics we should hold dear.</p>
<p>It is on me, and on on you, and on all of us to be curious, to question the status quo, to question the authority, to question the media and the truth as it appears. But question it not blindly, at the expense of all reason, but question it with the naiveté and the intellectual curiosity of a child. </p>
<p>Assume you don't know, look for answers, don't stop until there are no more questions.</p>

<br/>
July 29, 2020 | https://insideclojure.org/2020/07/28/clj-exec/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://insideclojure.org/2020/07/28/clj-exec/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>A new development version of clj is now available (1.10.1.600) and it includes the first public release of several strands of work that have been ongoing over the last few months (with more to come).</p>

<p>This version has not yet been promoted to “stable” release. You can either install it explicitly with that version though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On Linux, use the <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started#_installation_on_linux">instructions here</a> but with 1.10.1.600.</li>
  <li>On Mac, use a <a href="https://github.com/clojure/homebrew-tools#version-archive-tool-releases">versioned release</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>brew uninstall clojure</li>
      <li>brew install clojure/tools/clojure@1.10.1.600</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On Windows, use the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/wiki/clj-on-Windows#install">install</a> but with 1.10.1.600.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="execution">Execution</h2>

<p>The primary feature of this release is support for a new kind of Clojure calling convention. Since the beginning, <code>clj</code> has been wrapping <code>clojure.main</code> for execution. <code>clojure.main</code> has its roots deep in the early years of Clojure and supports invoking the <code>-main</code> function of a Clojure namespace or running a Clojure script (reading and evaluating it).</p>

<p>We stepped back to think about how the command line for a Clojure entry point should look and came to several conclusions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Execution should be tied to a fully-qualified function</li>
  <li>The function’s namespace should be automatically loaded (thanks <a href="https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/requiring-resolve">requiring-resolve</a>!)</li>
  <li>Arguments should be key/value, not positional</li>
  <li>We want to work in edn, not strings</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus you can now define programs as functions that take a map and execute them via clj:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">clojure <span>[</span>clj-opt<span>*</span><span>]</span> <span>-X</span>:an-alias <span>[</span>kpath v]<span>*</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>-X is configured with a descriptor map with <code>:fn</code> and <code>:args</code> keys and stored under an alias in deps.edn:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>{</span><span>:aliases</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>:my-fn</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>:fn</span><span> </span><span>my.qualified/fn</span><span>
   </span><span>:args</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:my</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>:data</span><span> </span><span>123</span><span>}</span><span>
          </span><span>:config</span><span> </span><span>456</span><span>}}}}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For more on using aliases to name edn data, see the “Alias data” section below.</p>

<p>To invoke, pass the name of the alias:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">clj <span>-X</span>:my-fn</code></pre></figure>

<p>You can supply additional keys, or override values stored in the deps.edn file by passing pairs of key-path and value. The key-path should either be a single key or a vector of keys to refer to a nested key (as with assoc-in). Each key-path will be used to assoc-in to the original <code>:args</code> map, overriding the value there.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span># Top key override</span>
clj <span>-X</span>:my-fn :config 789

<span># Nested key override</span>
clj <span>-X</span>:my-fn <span>'[:my :data]'</span> 789</code></pre></figure>

<p>Key/value pairs are read as edn strings. A general rule is that you can surround edn data with single quotes (like <code>'data'</code>) to get a literal shell string (which exec will read as edn data). In some cases (particularly numbers and keywords), you can omit the single quotes as bash does not have any conflicting interpretation. Note that strings must be passed in double quotes, also surrounded by single quotes to escape correctly with bash: <code>clj -X:my-fn :config '"foo"'</code>.</p>

<h2 id="local-maven-install">Local Maven install</h2>

<p>One helper program included in this release is clojure.tools.deps.alpha.tools.install/install. You can execute this program with -X to install a jar into your local Maven cache.</p>

<p>The install argmap takes the following options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>:jar (required) - path to jar file</li>
  <li>:pom (optional) - path to pom file</li>
  <li>:lib (optional) - qualified symbol like my.org/lib</li>
  <li>:version (optional) - string</li>
  <li>:classifier (optional) - string</li>
  <li>:local-repo (optional) - path to local repo (default = ~/.m2/repository)</li>
</ul>

<p>Add the tool configuration to your deps.edn under an alias:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>{</span><span>:aliases</span><span>
 </span><span>{</span><span>:install</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>:fn</span><span> </span><span>clojure.tools.deps.alpha.tools.install/install</span><span>
  </span><span>;; :args map could be provided but can pass on command line instead</span><span>
  </span><span>}}}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To execute, use the built-in <code>:deps</code> alias to include tools.deps.alpha on the classpath, execute the install tool with -X and pass the args on the command line:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">clj <span>-A</span>:deps <span>-X</span>:install :jar <span>'"/path/to.jar"'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>(As mentioned above, edn strings must be in double quotes, and then single-quoted for the shell.)</p>

<p>The install tool will find the pom inside the jar file (if it exists) and use that to determine the groupId, artifactId, and version coordinates to use when the jar is installed. Alternately, you can provide a pom file or specific coordinates via the other attributes.</p>

<p>Other existing “programs” provided with <code>clj</code> (like <code>-Sresolve-tags</code>) may be converted to this in the future.</p>

<h2 id="runtime-basis">Runtime basis</h2>

<p>The primary functionality provided by tools.deps is to take a set of dependencies and compute the expansion of the transitive dependency tree and the subsequent classpath intended for a set of deps and paths. While we had means to give you parts of that result, it has been clear from working on other features and libraries (add-lib, tools.deps.graph, etc) that we needed something to tie all of this information together.</p>

<p>We call the output of the resolution process the “runtime basis” (or just “basis” for short). The runtime basis is a map that is a combination of the inputs to the process (merged deps, resolve-args, classpath-args) and the outputs (the lib-map and classpath-map). In combination this data can be used to understand the full classpath context of a subsequent execution.</p>

<p>The Clojure tools now caches the computed basis data, just as it previously cached the lib map data, and injects the basis file into the execution via the Java system property “clojure.basis”. Programs can read this data using the tools already in Clojure (it’s just an edn map):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>(</span><span>require</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>[</span><span>clojure.java.io</span><span> </span><span>:as</span><span> </span><span>jio</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>[</span><span>clojure.edn</span><span> </span><span>:as</span><span> </span><span>edn</span><span>])</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>basis</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>System/getProperty</span><span> </span><span>"clojure.basis"</span><span>)</span><span> 
               </span><span>jio/file</span><span>
               </span><span>slurp</span><span>
               </span><span>edn/read-string</span><span>))</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="alias-data">Alias data</h2>

<p>deps.edn aliases were always conceived of as an open mechanism to store edn data and give it a name for use in programs. For a long time we have only used it to provide such data to the internal processes of <code>clj</code> itself (via <code>-A</code> etc), but with this release we are expanding the use of alias data in several ways.</p>

<p>First, :paths can now (in addition to path strings), take alias names that refer to vectors of paths:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="clojure"><span>{</span><span>:paths</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>:clj-paths</span><span> </span><span>:resource-paths</span><span>]</span><span>

<p>Second, execution with <code>clj -X:an-alias</code> takes an alias that provides a map of inputs for a function.</p>

<p>Third, the runtime basis is injected into a program so anyone can write programs that take the alias for edn data stored in deps.edn and make use of it via the basis:</p>

<h2 id="deprecated-unqualified-lib-names">Deprecated unqualified lib names</h2>

<p>One other change that you may notice in this release is that we have deprecated support for unqualified lib names in <code>:deps</code>. Unqualified lib names (like <code>cheshire</code> or <code>hiccup</code>) are interpreted in Maven terms as having the same groupId and artifactId. Unqualified lib names will now warn on use - you can address by using the qualified name (<code>cheshire/cheshire</code> or <code>hiccup/hiccup</code>).</p>

<p>The groupId exists to disambiguate library names so our ecosystem is not just a race to grab unqualified names. The <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html">naming convention in Maven</a> for groupId is to follow Java’s package naming rules and start with a reversed domain name or a trademark, something you control. Maven itself does not enforce this but the Maven Central repository does all new projects.</p>

<p>In cases where you have a lib with no domain name or trademark, you can use a third party source of identity (like github) in combination with an id you control on that site, so your lib id would be <code>github-yourname/yourlib</code>. Using a dashed name is preferred over a dotted name as that could imply a library owned by github.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every day, we carry burdens of family, job, and community. We manage the load by breaking them into pieces and put them into a to-do list. The agony of life is that the more tasks we tick off the list, the more added. Running faster seems to be the only way out, so we run faster aided by tools, only to discover at the end of a period that we have been running on a treadmill with ever-increasing speed, going nowhere.</p><p>I have run on the treadmill of tasks with panting of disappointment for more weeks than I can count. For reasons I can't explain, enlightenment in life strikes only at the trough of despair. I was reminded of a story in the great Indian epic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>, during one of the downcast days. The story goes like this.</p><p><em>I'm paraphrasing the story here, so if you know the story, allow me some latitude.</em></p><blockquote><p>One day, Drona, the teacher, lines up his students to teach archery. He commands them to focus on a bird on a near-by tree. Every student raised their bow and was ready to shoot. <br>
Before they shoot, he walks over to each student and asks them what they see. <br>
“I see the tree, the branch, and the bird” answers the first student. Drona asks him to put the bow down and stand aside. He moves to the next student. <br>
“Tree, branch, and the bird …” The second student repeats the same answer. And the next, and the next. Finally, Drona approaches Arjuna. “What do you see, my favorite boy?” <br>
“The tip of the arrow and the eye of the bird,” Arjuna replied. <br>
“Do you see the tree and the leaves?” Asked Drona. <br>
“No, just the tip of the arrow and the eye of the bird.” <br>
“Shoot,” commands Drona. <br>
Arjuna releases the arrow and hits the target.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Moral of the story: When you want to achieve something, your attention should be on what you have and what you target. Everything else is noise, and you should shut them out.</p></blockquote><p>I'm no archer, but I can transfer the fundamentals to any domain of interest. I started building a system that embodies the principles of the above story. I have used and fine-tuned the system for long, so I feel sure to share it with you. Here are the fundamental principles behind this system:</p><ul><li>Know the outcomes that you want to achieve</li><li>See the outcomes often</li><li>Create projects to reach the outcomes</li><li>Divide each project into weekly wins</li><li>Win a day</li><li>Review to learn, pat, and adjust</li><li>Iterate this cycle to win the outcomes</li></ul><h2 id="know-the-outcomes">Know the outcomes</h2><blockquote><p>It's hard to do a really good job on anything you don't think about in the shower - Paul Graham, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html">The top idea in your mind</a></p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/wins-plan.png" alt=""></p><p>We don't stop thinking about our personal life when we enter the office, and we don't stop thinking of our job when we play with our kids. Thus it is futile to try for a balance; rather, we should integrate all areas of our lives to have a fulfilling life.</p><p>After many iterations, I have found <strong>four areas that encompass all of life</strong>, and if I do well in those areas, I would have a fulfilling life. They are <strong>w</strong>ealth, <strong>i</strong>nsights, <strong>n</strong>etwork, and <strong>s</strong>elf-control.</p><p>For each area, I think of one or two outcomes I want to achieve in three years. The outcomes I want to accomplish in each area in the coming three years looks like this:</p><p><strong>Wealth</strong></p><ul><li>Launch Gravitas WINS course</li></ul><p><strong>Insights</strong></p><ul><li>Learn to run a digital business (Gravitas WINS course)</li></ul><p><strong>Network</strong></p><ul><li>Five mentors &amp; Five Thousand Students</li></ul><p><strong>Self-control</strong></p><ul><li>Stay fit and healthy</li></ul><p>All the projects are related, hence it is easier to remember and think about them cohesively. Because they are cohesive, ideas pop into my head during showers or when I take a walk.</p><p>Once I know the outcomes, I divide them further into quarterly projects and weekly milestones. At any quarter, I run only one or two projects. In this quarter, JAS 2020, I am focusing only on two projects:</p><ul><li>Completing the material for the Gravitas WINS course</li><li>Double the subscribers for this newsletter</li></ul><h2 id="win-the-day">Win the day</h2><blockquote><p>Slow is smooth, smooth is fast - Navy SEALs</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/daily-wins.png" alt=""></p><p>WINS sheet is not a glorified to-do list; it is not even a to-do list by another name. It is a WINS sheet. I enter only those activities that will move me towards the outcome.</p><p>There are always other tasks that I need to do. I do one of the three with those tasks:</p><ul><li>avoid them</li><li>delegate them</li><li>do a good enough job to move on</li></ul><h2 id="reflect-daily--review-weekly">Reflect daily &amp; Review weekly</h2><p>Every day, I reflect on the day that went by.</p><ul><li>Did something catch my attention?</li><li>Did I do something beyond expectation?</li><li>Was I distracted?</li><li>Did I spend too much on movies or YouTube?</li></ul><p><img src="https://cdn.olai.in/jjude/weekly-reflection.png" alt=""></p><p>Every Sunday night, I sit with the sheet and review the previous week.</p><p>There is always a surprise every week. New things pop up; I completed more than I planned; but most weeks, I completed only 80% of what I intended.</p><p>Since the outcome is clear, I am not disappointed even if I have not completed everything I planned. Eighty percent progress every week towards the outcome is a great move forward.</p><p>When I review every week, I get 54 chances to review and amend my ways.</p><h2 id="adjust-as-you-go-along">Adjust as you go along</h2><p>After the Sunday review, I take a print-out for the next week. I write down the three-year outcome and the quarterly projects again. Repeatedly writing the expected results gives me a moment to consider the outcomes and projects in light of what I know.</p><ul><li>Do these outcomes still make sense?</li><li>Are these projects the best way to achieve the outcomes?</li><li>Is there a way to achieve the outcome differently?</li><li>Can I partner with someone to reach the milestone in half the time?</li><li>Can I use any tool to amplify my efforts?</li></ul><p>I go through these questions, and I adjust the outcomes, projects, and weekly wins. Usually, I don't make any changes to outcomes and projects. But there are always changes to weekly wins.</p><h2 id="drown-out-the-noise">Drown out the noise</h2><p>Going through such routine cement the outcomes in my mind. My unconscious mind reflects these outcomes all the time - when I sleep, work out, or take a shower. My mind doesn't think of anything else.

<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ksvlJ3F4Mcc" width="320" youtube-src-id="ksvlJ3F4Mcc"></iframe></p><p>I have a confession: I used to be a Mac gamer. For a long period of time, my main gaming machine was a Mac. My daily driver not too long ago was a hand-me-down 2007 MacBook Pro with 4gb ram and 128mb vram. I managed to still game on the thing, even as it burnt my lap (thanks Apple!) and pushed the machine to its absolute limits. Some of the games I played included <i>Borderlands</i> and <i>Borderlands 2</i>, <i>Skyrim</i> and <i>Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines</i>. Some games were an absolute joy to play, others were a semi-pixellated mess with textures popping in.&nbsp;</p><p>It was not very fun at times but this was all I had at the time.&nbsp;</p><h3>Beginnings</h3><p>I've played games on a range of Macs. One of my earliest experiences was playing <i>Prince of Persia 2</i> on a 2CX. I wasn't very good and died a lot but I liked the animation and fluidity. I swiftly moved on to games like <i>SimCity 2000</i>, which was amazing. I loved the disasters and wrecking havoc on my cities.&nbsp;</p><p>I learnt to enjoy games like <i>Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego? </i>on an old Powerbook and even had fun finding shareware on the CD-ROMS <i>Macworld </i>used to include with their magazine. It was through this I discovered Bungie's <i>Marathon</i> series and the wonderful action adventure <i>Oni</i>:</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ggC6kfJJE_w" width="320" youtube-src-id="ggC6kfJJE_w"></iframe></p><h3>All hail the iMac</h3><p>One of the most influential Macs I played on was the iMac. I had a 2nd generation iMac (released in 1999) and it was glorious. Beautiful to look at, it opened my eyes to games like <i>Deus Ex </i>and&nbsp;<i>Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force</i>. I loved the included games from Pangaea Software and have fond memories of <i>Nanosaur</i>, <i>Otto Matic</i> and <i>Cro Mag Rally</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>The ever expanding collection of shareware showed me some great games from Spiderweb Software and I loved playing the original <a href="https://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/productsOld.html" target="_blank"><i>Blades of Exile</i> and <i>Avernum games</i></a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Gaming on a MacBook Pro</h3><p>As I mentioned earlier, my daily driver was a hand-me-down 2007 MacBook Pro. It was a few years old by the time I got it and still in usable condition. Its ram had been upgraded to the maximum 4gb and it had a new(ish) hard drive.&nbsp;</p><p>I really wanted to play games on it and was limited by 128mb vram. The original <i>Rage</i> didn't work and games like <i>Skyrim</i> played but suffered from texture issues. Some would be missing in places, which made for an interesting experience.&nbsp;</p><p>I had a good time playing <i>Doom 3</i> and <i>Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines</i>, though. The latter was a great RPG and I had an amazing time with it. Steam ran well and I had a blast with <i>Half Life 2</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>My experience playing on Macs taught me how to make the most of whatever hardware you have. You can still have a great time no matter the platform.&nbsp;</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><em>On TypeScript, ESlint, jest, TSDoc, Travis-CI, and VSCode (with inspirations from the Zen of Python)</em></p>

<p>It is fun to write fast without constraints, and run code in a flash. That is why I fell in love with Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment, a great tool for prototyping and interacting with data. However, interactive notebooks fall short when you want to write bigger, maintainable code. See the <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~azh/blog/notebookpainpoints.html">What’s wrong with computational notebooks?</a> survey:</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/notebooks-chart.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Restructuring and cleaning up code (refactoring) is being listed as one task notebooks are not meant for. For further reading on the pros and cons of notebooks, see <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2018/09/notebook-war/">The First Notebook War</a>.</p>

<p>While I knew the concept of tests, I got discouraged by some overzealous test-driven development practices which make feature development slow and experimentation — even slower. In data science, you pretty much need to take an iterative approach to data. Creating meticulous tests before exploring the data is a big mistake, and will result in a well-crafted garbage-in, garbage-out pipeline. We need an environment flexible enough to encourage experiments, especially in the initial place.</p>

<p>Moreover: writing clever code is tempting! Why should you deny yourself the fun of solving a seemingly difficult problem in a one-liner? Well, there is a word of caution, and it’s called <a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/hacker-laws#kernighans-law">the Kernighan’s Law</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words: being smart won’t make you automatically a good software engineer. The combination of high intelligence and no software engineering skills often results in code-golf-style contraptions that do the job but are completely incomprehensible for anyone else (including their authors’ future selves). This may explain the baseline <a href="https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/23237/why-are-papers-without-code-but-with-results-accepted/23238#23238">code quality in academia</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Last autumn, I got invited to the Centre for Quantum Technologies at the National University of Singapore to lead the creation of <a href="https://github.com/Quantum-Game/">Quantum Game with Photons 2</a>. It is a bigger project, with a few people on board (with various skillsets), so things that would work for solo coding won’t fly there. And I learned a lot, by trial and error.</p>

<p>I got quite a few insights from things most software engineers take for granted: <strong>types</strong> and <strong>tests</strong>. If you are a fellow (ex-)scientist, have ADHD (I do) or for any other reason find yourself too impatient, or smart, to set types and write tests: this post is for you!</p>

<p>In this post I will discuss:</p>

<ul>
  <li>TypeScript as an improvement over JavaScript</li>
  <li>Code documentation with TSDocs</li>
  <li>ESLint as a “spell checker” and automatic style guide for code</li>
  <li>Tests (with jest framework)</li>
  <li>Continuous integration with Travis CI and Codecov</li>
</ul>



<p>Since it is a browser-based game, JavaScript was an obvious choice. We chose <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> (<em>“JavaScript with types”</em>) as its dialect, and never looked back. We all used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> open-source editor, due to its TypeScript support and rich plugin ecosystem</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/pmigdal/status/1179329959598313473"><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/pmigdal-tweet-typescript.png" alt=""></a></p>

<p>In principle, types are not necessary. All in all, everything in the computer is a long sequence of zeros and ones. But almost always we want to <strong>restrict</strong> what we can do with a particular variable to things that make sense, in the given context. There are exotic cases when we want to treat 0s and 1s of a <strong>float</strong> using operations for an <strong>integer</strong>, vide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root">fast inverse square root</a>. But there are rare exceptions that do deserve a few extra lines of switching between types.</p>

<p>In Python, when trying to do a dubious operation, you get an error pretty soon. In JavaScript… an undefined can fly through a few layers of abstraction, causing an error in a seemingly unrelated piece of code. We can get funny results due to using different types. Open a console, write:</p>

<p><code>function add(a, b) { return +(a + b) }</code></p>

<p>And then try to <code>add(2,2)</code> and <code>add('2', 2)</code>. In both cases, you get a number… but, is it the same one? Sure, this case is trivial. But what if this function were much more complicated, had a few arguments (in non-obvious order), and its input arguments came from different functions (from modules or packages you don’t maintain)?</p>

<p>Even in Python, the error happens in the runtime. Why not see it coming while writing code? In TypeScript, with a few keystrokes, we can set:</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/typescript_add.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I found that the overhead to use types in TypeScript is minimal (if any). When writing a new class, method or function, very often it is faster. Sure, I need to specify types of input and output. But then I get speedup due to autocompletion, hints, and linting if for any reason I make a mistake.</p>

<p>Types give built-in testing — that a given function takes arguments of particular types. However, they also help greatly with the code readability. When seeing <code>changeVolume(volume: number)</code> you don’t need to guess if <code>id</code> is a number, string, boolean, <code>Volume</code> object, or Cthulhu-knows-what.</p>

<p>So, let’s start with a few lines of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Explicit is better than implicit.</p>

  <p>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>To be fair: there is quite a lot missing in TypeScript types. For example, integer types would help a lot in typical tasks such as accessing an array or iterating a loop; even if they are stored as floats, I want to make sure someone won’t take the 2.5-th element of a list.</p>

<p>Still, for me, TS is a day and night difference with JavaScript.</p>

</ul>



<p>Good comments do clarify code. <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc">TSDoc</a> is a way of writing TypeScript comments where they’re linked to a particular function, class or method (like<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/"> Python docstrings</a>).</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/tsdoc2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If we are clueless about what to write in the description, it may be a sign of a more fundamental problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.</p>

  <p>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, it is possible to create the whole documentations with <a href="https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc">TypeDoc</a>, see <a href="https://quantum-game.github.io/quantum-tensors/classes/_operator_.operator.html">Operator for Quantum Tensors</a>.</p>

<p>Since the code runs, it is fine, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/letz.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Well, unless someone needs to read it. A collaborator, or yourself in 6 months. When the other person needs to develop it (use, expand, or rewrite) — there are so many things that can go wrong, be misunderstood, or take an unproportionate amount of time. When it comes to code, I have a strong belief that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Readability counts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://eslint/">ESLint</a> does automatic code linting — it’s “spell checking” for code and serves a few purposes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>marking things that are incorrect,</li>
  <li>marking things that are unnecessary or risky (e.g. <code>if (x = 5) { ... }</code>)</li>
  <li>setting a standard way of writing code.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two are a no-brainer. It may be debatable what is “risky”, but we can customize that if needed.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://oppressive-silence.com/comic/oh-no-the-robots">oppressive-silence.com/comic/oh-no-the-robots</a>. Using <a href="https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-cond-assign">no-cond-assign</a> would have saved their lives.</p>

<p>The standardization is less obvious. Personally, I like setting the linter to be as strict as possible, going in line with a controversial piece of wisdom from the Zen of Python:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By reducing ways to write something, it reduces the number of unnecessary choices (<em>should I indent it or not?</em>) and allows me to use my cognitive resources in a more meaningful way.</p>

<p>Moreover, it makes it much easier to collaborate. No more inconsistencies because one uses <strong>tabs</strong> and the other — <strong>spaces</strong>. Or different name conventions. Even if you verbally decide to use <strong>two spaces</strong>, it takes some cognitive power to self-police oneself… with no guarantee.</p>

<p><a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a> can be configured in various ways, to be laid back or strictly pedantic. There are many plugins with settings for particular languages and frameworks (such as TypeScript, Vue, etc) and styles (I recommend <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/">Airbnb style JavaScript style guide</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-typescript">Airbnb TypeScript</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beautiful is better than ugly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many plugins go with two possible settings: base (only errors) and recommended (enforcing good practices with style). I suggest going by default for the latter. If you need to override an option, it is easy. And IMHO it does not matter nearly as much what style you choose (if you want, go for tabs for indentation — you have my official blessing) as long as it is restrictive and enforced ruthlessly.</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/prettier.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I do have a love and hate relationship with <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>, another a code formatter purely focused on style. In some cases, it makes code, well, prettier and more standardized. However, for many things (say: indentations, trailing characters) Airbnb can do the job. I have also found that a restrictive approach to line width can occasionally produce an inconsistent style (and is pretty vocal about that).</p>

<p>Testing seemed the way to slow down development, kill fun and momentum.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Errors should never pass silently.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I won’t fool you: tests require you to write a few more lines of code (see <a href="https://jestjs.io/">jest</a> examples). But ask yourself: when writing a longer function, does it work on the first go? Always, no exceptions?</p>

<p>Probably you have the same doubt, and at least test it somehow: open an app and eyeball it if it works, or open a console and check if you get a correct result (this REPL / Jupyter Notebook approach for testing).</p>

<p>This interactive approach is fine… but manual. You need to do it each time you change your function. So, how about testing it once and then saving it for further use?</p>

<p>Well, with <a href="https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest">VSCode plugin for jest</a> you can do that! Write a new test and the result. If you want to make it REPL-like, instead of writing <code>console.log(x.toString())</code> use <code>expect(x.toString()).toBe('')</code> and you will directly get the result.</p>

<p><img src="https://p.migdal.pl/imgs/2020-03-02-types-tests-typescript/jest_test_repl.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Then, we can set it as a test. We wrote once but turned into a guardian of our code.</p>

<p>Tests do not prove that the code works. They safeguard against …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p>Tesla is currently valued at 10x Price-to-Sales, and Trailing Twelve Months Price-to-Earnings of 743. This makes Tesla grossly overvalued, right? In the short term, definitely yes. But is there a way this valuation will be justified in the next 10 years?</p>



<h2><strong>High level thesis</strong></h2>



<p>I believe that at the end of this decade, Tesla will be the first $1 trillion market cap car company. Except it’s not a car company. It’s a fundemental technology company.</p>



<p>Tesla is best compared to Amazon. They started as a boring book retailer. Low margins. Complicated logistics. Nothing too exciting.</p>



<p>Who would have thought in 1997 when Amazon went public that 23 years later the business would look like it does today? There was no AWS, no Amazon Advertising, no Amazon Prime, no Amazon Marketplace, no Alexa, no Kindle. In their IPO prospectus they described themselves as “the leading online retailer of books.”</p>



<p>So what was different about Amazon? Jeff Bezos. A visionary owner-operator with an extremely long-term focus and customer obsession. </p>



<p>Exactly the same is true for Tesla. It may look like a car company today. But 10 years from now it will look very differently, thanks to Elon Musk.</p>



<h2><strong>How Tesla will look like in 2030</strong></h2>



<h4><strong>Car business</strong></h4>



<p>It’s reasonable to expect that they will keep growing volume by 35 percent per year (so far it has been &gt;50 percent). That means in 2030 they will produce about 10 million cars. With an average selling price of $25k this will generate $250 billion in revenues. If we assume a similar 5 percent net income margin as Volkswagen this would generate after-tax net income of $12.5 billion.</p>



<h4><strong>Software business</strong></h4>



<p>I expect each sold car to generate $10k worth of software revenues. Currently, the Full Self-Driving option alone sells for $8k, and there will be many in-app-purchases like the&nbsp;<a href="https://electrek.co/2019/12/19/tesla-acceleration-boost-model-3-dual-motor/">$2000 acceleration boost</a>, which is delivered over the air. This will generate $100 billion in revenues on top. With a net income margin of 20 percent this would add after-tax net income of $20 billion.</p>



<h4><strong>Ride-sharing business</strong></h4>



<p>Tesla will add ride sharing capabilities, which will enable it to earn a cut (usually 20-30%) from rides on their network.</p>



<p>That means that Tesla will not just make money from cars and software, but also make money from each mile that is driven on its ride sharing network.</p>



<p>The only question is, how big will this get? If they don’t solve full self-driving, then this will just be another version of Uber/Lyft or Zipcar or Turo. It can be substantial, but probably not huge.</p>



<p>But if, and this is still a big if, they solve full self-driving and can offer fully autonomous robotaxis, this can become gigantic, especially if they are the first ones. This is not unlikely, because they have the largest fleet and by far the largest data pool to train their neural nets.</p>



<h4><strong>Solar business</strong></h4>



<p>Tesla currently offers the lowest-cost solar panels in America. They plan to massively scale this business. They also offer a more premium solar roof option where the panels are directly integrated into the roof.</p>



<p>If we assume they scale this globally to 5 million roofs per year by 2030 and an average selling-price of $15k, this will bring in another $75 billion in revenues. With a 3 percent net income margin this would add $2 billion in after-tax net income.</p>



<h4><strong>Battery business</strong></h4>



<p>Tesla will be the undisputed leader in battery technology. Soon, they will start manufacturing their own cells, which will likely last <a href="https://www.electrek.co/2019/09/07/tesla-battery-cell-last-1-million-miles-robot-taxis/">1 million miles</a>. </p>



<p>They need cells for their cars, but also for their energy storage solutions like <a href="https://www.tesla.com/powerwall">Powerwall</a>, <a href="https://www.tesla.com/powerpack">Powerpack</a> and <a href="https://www.tesla.com/megapack">Megapack</a>. </p>



<p>A Powerwall costs $8.5k and adds energy independence and backup. Pretty much every buyer of solar panels will buy one or more, which means millions of units per year. </p>



<h4><strong>Licensing business</strong></h4>



<p>The recent positive attitude by Volkswagen chairman Herbert Diess towards Tesla (see <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/vw-ceo-lauds-musk-over-tesla-s-earnings-and-value-potential">here</a>, <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/03/02/vw-chief-adjusts-goal-from-overtaking-tesla-to-keep-as-close-as-possible/">here</a>, or <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2020/04/29/vw-ceo-is-worried-teslas-neural-network-is-far-beyond-other-auto-manufacturers/">here</a>) can only mean one thing: Volkswagen wants to potentially license Tesla’s software and technology.</p>



<p>Elon Musk confirmed his willingness to do so:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tesla is open to licensing software and supplying powertrains &amp; batteries. We’re just trying to accelerate sustainable energy, not crush competitors!</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1288265150928125952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It’s not realistic that every single car company in the world will be able to build all the necessary hardware and software in-house. </p>



<p>It will look more like computer or smartphone operating systems, dominated by two or three players. Tesla will be one of them, which will translate into substantial revenue.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>When we add everything up, Tesla will be a $500+ billion revenue company in 2030 with healthy profits. So I believe a valuation of $1 trillion is justified, leaving a 4x upside from today’s price. </p>



<p>And if they solve full self-driving and become the leading robotaxi provider, the revenue and profit from that will be substantial.</p>



<p>But make no mistake. There will be huge challenges and volatility. It won’t be a smooth ride. And there is still a “black swan” type chance that they will go bust.</p>



<p>If they are able to pull it off, I have no doubt in my mind that Tesla will become one of the largest and most important companies on the planet.</p>



<p>And who knows what other products or businesses they will come up with along the way?</p>

<p>It was a rollercoaster of a week. It began when <a href="https://bbirnbaum.com/two-lessons-on-reducing-sign-up-friction/">an article</a> I wrote about my side project, which I’d been quietly building for seven months, unexpectedly made it to the number two spot on Hacker News. It ended with me considering whether I should give up on the project completely.</p><p>The side project is called <a href="https://cortadomail.com/">Cortado</a>. It’s a website that gives users control over their information intake by letting them create a customized daily email from sources like Twitter, Reddit, RSS feeds, Hacker News, and more.</p><p>Over the course of 24 hours, ten thousand people read my article. About one hundred of them clicked through to Cortado’s landing page and signed up. My user base grew from a handful of family and friends to more than a hundred strangers from across the world. These new users were giving me great feedback, saying nice things about the service, and sharing helpful criticism.</p><p>I was thrilled that something that I made for myself, something that I wasn’t sure anyone else would want, seemed to be solving a real problem for other people. I couldn’t wait to improve the product and grow my user base more.</p><p>But my excitement didn’t last long. The next day I noticed an email from a service called Mailbrew in my inbox. I didn’t give it much thought because I didn’t remember signing up for a something of that name. I assumed the email was spam and archived it. But the following day I got another email from Mailbrew, and this time I opened it.</p><p>It was a digest of sources from Twitter, Reddit, and RSS feeds about entrepreneurship. It felt familiar.</p><p>I clicked through to mailbrew.com and found a product just like Cortado. Even the copy on the landing page was similar. The term “information diet” was prominently displayed, and the two projects shared a coffee-inspired name.</p><p>But Mailbrew was much further along. It had more features, better-formatted emails, and wider visibility. I was really impressed by what the creators had accomplished.</p><p>My first thought, however irrational, was that Mailbrew must have been inspired by Cortado. Of course that was impossible -- it couldn’t have been so far along if that were the case -- but the idea was just so similar. Soon, however, I realized that the creators had launched their product quite visibly months earlier. In fact, the reason their email showed up in my inbox in the first place was that I had previously subscribed to a product built by them called Unreadit, which had morphed into Mailbrew after the launch.</p><p>I had already been working on Cortado for months before Mailbrew launched, but my progress had been slow (I have a full-time job and two small kids), and I hadn’t yet gotten any users apart from family and friends.</p><p>So it looked like I was the copycat.</p><p>I was bummed. Here I was, poised to double down on my side project and turn it into something bigger, fresh off of an unanticipated burst of validation, when I found out that not only did I have a formidable competitor, but also that I was the unwitting imitator.</p><p>Of course, there’s nothing wrong with seeing a good product and trying to improve on it, but it’s nice to at least know what you’re getting into up front. If I had known about Mailbrew before I started, I might have just signed up for it instead of investing hundreds of hours building my own product.</p><p>I considered my options: I could stop working on Cortado completely, I could find a way to pivot the product to distinguish it from Mailbrew, or I could simply press on, continuing to improve Cortado and grow its user base.</p><p>My first instinct was to stop. I wasn’t that interested in competition, especially when I was second to market. I couldn’t see how I could ever catch up to Mailbrew given my time constraints. But after some thought, I realized I wasn’t ready to stop. I couldn’t give it up just days after I had gotten my first real users, many of whom were telling me how much they liked it.</p><p>Next, I thought more about pivoting. But I was already building the product that I wanted, the one that was solving my own problem and that was apparently also solving a problem experienced by others. A pivot immediately after this positive feedback didn’t feel right.</p><p>So finally I decided to continue with Cortado, focusing on building the best product that I could for my users. Cortado would of course continue to evolve as I got more feedback, but any pivots would be based on what users were telling me instead of on what another product was doing.</p><p>That was two months ago. Since then, I’ve talked to a number of users and worked to address their feedback. Some people I've talked to have also used Mailbrew, and I've learned that one of Cortado's main selling points is simply that it’s free. So that’s at least one concrete difference between Cortado and Mailbrew. We’ll see what others develop.</p><p>The truth is I don’t yet have full clarity on what distinguishes Cortado from Mailbrew. I do know that I don’t want to stop building and growing Cortado, that there’s plenty that I can still learn from this project, and that it can’t hurt for users to have more choice.</p><p>Six months from now, I expect it will be more clear what makes Cortado unique. But the way I will get there will not be by focusing on a competitor. It will be from talking to users, responding to their feedback, and building the best product that I can.</p><hr><p><em>Thanks to Yaw Anokwa, Josh Haimson, and Jenny Klein for providing feedback on drafts of this post.</em></p>

Learning these modern languages and reflecting on ones I've used in the past has alerted me to the difference between a <i>Software

This post is the first of a series that describes this difference and analyses a few languages through this lens.</p><div><p>What is a Software Development Language and how is that different from a "Programming Language"?</p><p>When talking about a language, we could say that it's fast or slow, concise or verbose, mangled or pretty, beginner-friendly or plagued by a steep learning curve.

With this, the following are all programming:</p><ul><li>Writing a two-line Bash script to rename some files.</li><li>Writing a Python function to generate a plot for a Data Science class.</li><li>Editing some CSS to alter your website's layout.</li><li>Typing an SQL query into a database prompt.</li><li>Solving a <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">coding challenge</a>.</li><li>Refactoring a module to use newer idioms, reducing code by half.</li><li>Writing a patch in C for the Linux Kernel to support a USB device.</li><li>Writing an algorithm prototype with an associated academic paper.</li></ul><p>And so would these be:</p><ul><li>Writing pseudocode of a sorting algorithm on a final exam.</li><li>Linking <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">visual logic blocks</a> together to cause a fun game effect.</li><li>Establishing "forms" with associated validation rules on a <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce</a> -based data management system.</li><li>The main mechanic of the game <a href="http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/">SpaceChem</a>.</li><li>Controlling the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_machine">operation of a loom</a> via punchcards.</li><li>Taking a walk or a shower to solve coding problems in your mind.</li></ul><p>In this sense, the act of programming itself is available to everyone.</p></div><h3 id="org940e47">Definition: Software Development</h3><div><p>On the other hand, we have <i>Software Development</i>:</p><blockquote><p>Software Development is the creation of software to be used over time. It is
Programming followed by Testing, Collaborating, Releasing, and Maintenance.</p></blockquote><p>With this, the following are Software Development activities:</p><ul><li>Accepting a bug ticket at work, finding the problem, and submitting a PR for the solution.</li><li>Creating and uploading a personal website.</li><li>Developing and launching a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bubble-level-for-iphone/id465613917">phone app to help level</a> a framed picture.</li><li>Producing a game for a major gaming console.</li><li>Evaluating and merging patches to the Linux Kernel.</li><li>Updating and deploying the assembly code of a 50 year old satellite that has left the solar system.</li><li>Speaking to other developers at a conference.</li></ul><p>All languages can be measured on a scale of how sharp a tool they are for the entire Five Pillared process of Software Development, not just programming. Particularly sharp languages have solid answers to these real concerns:</p><ul><li>Programming:<ul><li>Do my ideas flow into the editor, or do the language idioms get in my way?</li><li>Is my day-to-day experience a productive dialogue with the compiler?</li><li>How many characters must I type to express my intent?</li><li>Is the language <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">filled with GOTCHAs</a>?</li><li>How short are compilation / typecheck times?</li><li>How beautiful is the syntax I look at every day?</li></ul></li><li>Testing:<ul><li>How efficiently can I discover if my code is incorrect?</li><li>Am I protected from future changes breaking old code?</li><li>Does the language itself provide correctness guarantees that avoid the need for test writing?</li><li>Are benchmarking and profiling first-class activities?</li><li>How easy does the language make it to write code that performs poorly?</li><li>How long is CI turnaround?</li></ul></li><li>Collaborating:<ul><li>How easy is it to write code that others won't understand?</li><li>When I have a question, are there well-trafficked channels to find the answer?</li><li>Is there a canonical way to write the language, or are there competing paradigms?</li><li>Can I easily incorporate other people's code into my own?</li><li>Are there meetups or conferences close to me that are dedicated to the language?</li></ul></li><li>Releasing:<ul><li>Is documentation "first class"? Are generated docs well-organized and easy to navigate?</li><li>Is it obvious how to release a library?</li><li>Are dependencies a source of strength or liability?</li><li>Is it straight-forward to produce an optimized release binary?</li><li>Are strange runtime flags necessary for sane program behaviour?</li></ul></li><li>Maintenance:<ul><li>Will code I write today be compilable in a year? In 10 years?</li><li>Can I refactor with confidence?</li><li>Should I expect frequent runtime crashes?</li><li>If I don't update my dependencies and compiler often, how soon will the ecosystem "leave me behind"?</li><li>Can the language interact with legacy code?</li></ul></li></ul><p>Naturally this list could be longer, but working software developers would likely agree with much of it. To contrast, how many of these points are relevant to students, researchers, and working scientists? This brings us to our main point:</p><blockquote><p>Some languages are better suited for Software Development than others.</p></blockquote><p>Should you write a multi-million line Operating System in Python? You could, but you shouldn't. Python has other strengths.</p><p>The same is true for working in research and for learning how to program in the first place. Should you write complex, high-performance physics simulations in Java? You could, but you shouldn't. Java has other strengths. Should you teach someone C++ as their first exposure to programming? You could (and many have been), but you shouldn't. C++ has other strengths.</p></div></div><div><p>They say that a good craftsman never blames his tools. This is true, but it's also important to recognize when you're trying to build a skyscraper with a hammer, or a bikeshed with a crane. Sometimes the tools are inappropriate for the task at hand. For Software Development, we should choose a sharp Software Development Language from our toolbox.</p><p>All Software Development Languages are Programming Languages, but the reverse is not true. With all this in mind, what sense is there really in debating the syntax of a <code>for</code> loop? Or in writing the 1000th <i>FooLang vs BarLang</i> article? Or ranking the Top 100 Languages?</p><p>For me, I'll take a language that lets me create, share my creations, and keep my creations alive. Next week, we'll apply the above philosophies to Rust, and see how it measures as a Software Development Language.</p></div></div>]]>

        <p>Full-Text Search is one of those tools people use every day without realizing it. If you ever googled "golang coverage report" or tried to find "indoor wireless camera" on an e-commerce website, you used some kind of full-text search.</p>
<p>Full-Text Search (FTS) is a technique for searching text in a collection of documents. A document can refer to a web page, a newspaper article, an email message, or any structured text.</p>
<p>Today we are going to build our own FTS engine. By the end of this post, we'll be able to search across millions of documents in less than a millisecond. We'll start with simple search queries like "give me all documents that contain the word <em>cat</em>" and we'll extend the engine to support more sophisticated boolean queries.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Most well-known FTS engine is <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/" target="_blank">Lucene</a> (as well as <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a> and Solr built on top of it).</p>
</div>
<div id="why-fts">
<h3>Why FTS<a href="#why-fts" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start writing code, you may ask "can't we just use <em>grep</em> or have a loop that checks if every document contains the word I'm looking for?". Yes, we can. However, it's not always the best idea.</p>
</div>
<div id="corpus">
<h3>Corpus<a href="#corpus" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>We are going to search a part of the abstract of English Wikipedia. The latest dump is available at <a href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/latest/enwiki-latest-abstract1.xml.gz" target="_blank">dumps.wikimedia.org</a>. As of today, the file size after decompression is 913 MB. The XML file contains over 600K documents.</p>
<p>Document example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Wikipedia: Kit-Cat Klock<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;url&gt;</span>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit-Cat_Klock<span>&lt;/url&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;abstract&gt;</span>The Kit-Cat Klock is an art deco novelty wall clock shaped like a grinning cat with cartoon eyes that swivel in time with its pendulum tail.<span>&lt;/abstract&gt;</span></code></pre>
</div>
<div id="loading-documents">
<h3>Loading documents<a href="#loading-documents" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>First, we need to load all the documents from the dump. The built-in <span>encoding/xml</span> package comes very handy:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>"encoding/xml"</span>
    <span>"os"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>type</span> <span>document</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>docs</span> <span>:=</span> <span>dump</span><span>.</span><span>Documents</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>docs</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>docs</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>].</span><span>ID</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>docs</span><span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Every loaded document gets assigned a unique identifier.
To keep things simple, the first loaded document gets assigned ID=0, the second ID=1 and so on.</p>

<h4>Searching the content<a href="#searching-the-content" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have all documents loaded into memory, we can try to find the ones about cats. At first, let's loop through all documents and check if they contain the substring <em>cat</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>search</span><span>(</span><span>docs</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>r</span> <span>[]</span><span>document</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>_</span><span>,</span> <span>doc</span> <span>:=</span> <span>range</span> <span>docs</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>strings</span><span>.</span><span>Contains</span><span>(</span><span>doc</span><span>.</span><span>Text</span><span>,</span> <span>term</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>append</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>doc</span><span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>On my laptop, the search phase takes 103ms - not too bad.
If you spot check a few documents from the output, you may notice that the function matches <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>category</em>, but doesn't match <em>Cat</em> with the capital <em>C</em>. That's not quite what I was looking for.</p>
<p>We need to fix two things before moving forward:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make the search case-insensitive (so <em>Cat</em> matches as well).</p></li>
<li><p>Match on a word boundary rather than on a substring (so <em>caterpillar</em> and <em>communication</em> don't match).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="searching-with-regular-expressions">
<h4>Searching with regular expressions<a href="#searching-with-regular-expressions" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>One solution that quickly comes to mind and allows implementing both requirements is <em>regular expressions</em>.</p>
<p>Here it is - <span><span>(?i)\bcat\b</span></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span><span>(?i)</span></span> makes the regex case-insensitive</p></li>
<li><p><span>\b</span> matches a word boundary (position where one side is a word character and another side is not a word character)</p></li>
</ul>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Ugh, the search took more than 2 seconds. As you can see, things started getting slow even with 600K documents. While the approach is easy to implement, it doesn't scale well. As the dataset grows larger, we need to scan more and more documents. The time complexity of this algorithm is linear - the number of documents required to scan is equal to the total number of documents. If we had 6M documents instead of 600K, the search would take 20 seconds. We need to do better than that.</p>

<div id="inverted-index">
<h3>Inverted Index<a href="#inverted-index" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>To make search queries faster, we'll preprocess the text and build an index in advance.</p>
<p>The core of FTS is a data structure called <em>Inverted Index</em>.
The Inverted Index associates every word in documents with documents that contain the word.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code><span>documents</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>1</span><span>:</span> <span>"a donut on a glass plate"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>2</span><span>:</span> <span>"only the donut"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>3</span><span>:</span> <span>"listen to the drum machine"</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>index</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"a"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"donut"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"on"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"glass"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"plate"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"only"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"the"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"listen"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"to"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"drum"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"machine"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>],</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Below is a real-world example of the Inverted Index. An index in a book where a term references a page number:</p>

</p></div>
<div id="text-analysis">
<h3>Text analysis<a href="#text-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>Before we start building the index, we need to break the raw text down into a list of words (tokens) suitable for indexing and searching.</p>
<p>The text analyzer consists of a tokenizer and multiple filters.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://artem.krylysov.com/images/2020-fts/text-analysis.png">
</p></div>
<div id="tokenizer">
<h3>Tokenizer<a href="#tokenizer" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>The tokenizer is the first step of text analysis. Its job is to convert text into a list of tokens. Our implementation splits the text on a word boundary and removes punctuation marks:</p>
<pre><code><span>func</span> <span>tokenize</span><span>(</span><span>text</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>[]</span><span>string</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>strings</span><span>.</span><span>FieldsFunc</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>r</span> <span>rune</span><span>)</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// Split on any character that is not a letter or a number.

</div>
<div id="filters">
<h3>Filters<a href="#filters" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h3>
<p>In most cases, just converting text into a list of tokens is not enough. To make the text easier to index and search, we'll need to do additional normalization.</p>
<div id="lowercase">
<h4>Lowercase<a href="#lowercase" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>In order to make the search case-insensitive, the lowercase filter converts tokens to lower case. <em>cAt</em>, <em>Cat</em> and <em>caT</em> are normalized to <em>cat</em>.
Later, when we query the index, we'll lower case the search terms as well. This will make the search term <em>cAt</em> match the text <em>Cat</em>.</p>

<h4>Stemming<a href="#stemming" title="Permalink to this headline"> #</a></h4>
<p>Because of the grammar rules, documents may include different forms of the same word.
Stemming reduces words into their base form. For example, <em>fishing</em>, <em>fished</em> and <em>fisher</em> may be reduced to the base form (stem) <em>fish</em>.</p>

<p>Back to the inverted index. It maps every word in documents to document IDs.
The built-in <span>map</span> is a good candidate for storing the mapping.
The key in the map is a token (string) and the value is a list of document IDs:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>index</span> <span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>][]</span><span>int</span></code></pre>

        <hr>
<p>When I started my career in development, my first job was a DBA. Back then, before AWS RDS, Azure, Google Cloud and the rest of them cloud services, there were two types of DBAs:</p>
<p><strong>The Infrastructure DBA</strong> was in charge of setting up the database, configuring the storage and taking care of backups and replication. After setting up the database, the infrastructure DBA would pop up from time to time and do some "instance tuning", things like sizing caches.</p>
<p><strong>The Application DBA</strong> got a clean database from the infrastructure DBA, and was in charge of schema design: creating tables, indexes, constraints, and tuning SQL. The application DBA was also the one who implemented ETL processes and data migrations. In teams that used stored procedures, the application DBA would maintain those as well.</p>
<p>Application DBAs were usually part of the development team. They would possess deep domain knowledge so normally they would work on just one or two projects. Infrastructure DBAs would usually be part of some IT team, and would work on many projects simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>I'm an Application DBA</strong></p>
<p>I never had any desire to fiddle with backups or tune storage (I'm sure it's fascinating!). Until this day I like to say I'm a DBA that knows how to develop applications, and not a developer that knows his way around the database.</p>
<p><strong>In this article I share some non-trivial tips about database development I gathered along the way.</strong></p>

<h2 id="update-only-what-needs-updating"><a href="#update-only-what-needs-updating">Update Only What Needs Updating</a></h2>
<p><code>UPDATE</code> is a relatively expensive operation. To speed up an <code>UPDATE</code> command it's best to make sure you only update what needs updating.</p>
<p>Take this query for example that normalizes an email column:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 1010000</span>
<span>Time: 1583.935 ms (00:01.584)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Looks innocent, right? the query updated emails of 1,010,000 users. But, did all rows really needed to update?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span> <span>users</span> <span>SET</span> <span>email</span> <span>=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span>
<span><span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>email</span> <span>!=</span> <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>);</span>
</span><span>UPDATE 10000</span>
<span>Time: 299.470 ms</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Only 10,000 rows needed to update. By reducing the amount of affected rows, the execution time went down from 1.5 seconds to just less than 300ms. Updating fewer rows also saves the database maintenance later on.</p>

<p>This type of large updates are very common in data migration scripts. So the next time you write a migration script, make sure to only update what needs updating.</p>

<h2 id="disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads"><a href="#disable-constraints-and-indexes-during-bulk-loads">Disable Constraints and Indexes During Bulk Loads</a></h2>
<p>Constraints are an important part of relational databases: they keep the data consistent and reliable. Their benefits come at a cost though, and it's most noticeable when loading or updating a lot of rows.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, set up a small schema for a store:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>DROP</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>IF</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>product</span> <span>CASCADE</span><span>;</span>

<span>);</span>
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> <span>product</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>price</span><span>)</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>random</span><span>()::</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>*</span> <span>1000</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span>

<span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The schema defines different types of constraints such as "not null" and unique constraints.</p>
<p>To set a baseline, start by adding foreign keys to the <code>sale</code> table, and then load some data into it:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>sale_product_fk</span>

<span>ALTER TABLE</span>
<span>Time: 18.413 ms</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>sale</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>CONSTRAINT</span> <span>sale_customer_fk</span>

<p>Loading data into a table without indexes and constraints was much faster, 2.27s compared to 15.4s before. Creating the indexes and constraints after the data was loaded into the table took a bit longer, but overall the entire process was much faster, 3.1s compared to 15.4s.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for indexes PostgreSQL does not provide an easy way of doing this other than dropping and re-creating the indexes. In other databases such as Oracle, you can <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sqlrf/ALTER-INDEX.html#GUID-D8F648E7-8C07-4C89-BB71-862512536558" rel="noopener">disable and enable indexes</a> without having to re-create them.</p>
<hr>

<p>When you modify data in PostgreSQL, the changes are written to the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html" rel="noopener">write ahead log (WAL)</a>. The WAL is used to maintain integrity, to fast forward the database during recovery and to maintain replication.</p>
<p>Writing to the WAL is often needed, but there are some circumstances where you might be willing to give up some of its uses to make things a bit faster. One example is intermediate tables.</p>
<p>Intermediate tables are disposable tables that stores temporary data used to implement some process. For example, a very common pattern in ETL processes is to load data from a CSV file to an intermediate table, clean the data, and then load it to the target table. In this use-case, the intermediate table is disposable and there is no use for it in backups or replicas.</p>

<p>The user <em>haki benita</em> registered twice, once with the email <code>ME@hakibenita.com</code> and again with <code>me@hakibenita.com</code>. Because we didn't normalize the emails when we inserted them into the table, we now have to deal with duplication.</p>
<p>To consolidate the duplicate users, we want to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify duplicate users by lower case email</li>
<li>Update orders to reference one of the duplicate users</li>
<li>Remove the duplicate users from the users table</li>
</ol>
<p>One way to consolidate duplicate users is to use an intermediate table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>UNLOGGED</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>AS</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>SELECT</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>lower</span><span>(</span><span>email</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>normalized_email</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>convert_to_user</span><span>,</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>array_remove</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY_AGG</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>),</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>))</span> <span>as</span> <span>convert_from_users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>normalized_email</span>
<span>db-#</span>     <span>HAVING</span>
<span>db-#</span>         <span>count</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>CREATE TABLE</span>

<span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span><span>;</span>
<span> normalized_email  | convert_to_user | convert_from_users</span>
<span>-------------------+-----------------+--------------------</span>
<span> me@hakibenita.com |               2 | {3}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The intermediate table holds a mapping of duplicate users. For each user that appears more than once with the same normalized email address, we define the user with the min ID as the user we convert all duplicates to. The other users are kept in an array column, and all the references to these users will be updated.</p>
<p>Using the intermediate table, we update references of duplicate users in the <code>orders</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>UPDATE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>orders</span> <span>o</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>SET</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_to_user</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>duplicate_users</span> <span>du</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>ANY</span><span>(</span><span>du</span><span>.</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>);</span>
<span>UPDATE 2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now that there are no more references, we can safely delete the duplicate users from the <code>users</code> table:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>DELETE</span> <span>FROM</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>users</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>WHERE</span>
<span>db-#</span>    <span>id</span> <span>IN</span> <span>(</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>SELECT</span> <span>unnest</span><span>(</span><span>convert_from_users</span><span>)</span>
<span>db(#</span>        <span>FROM</span> <span>duplicate_users</span>
<span>db(#</span>    <span>);</span>
<span>DELETE 1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that we used the function <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html#ARRAY-FUNCTIONS-TABLE" rel="noopener"><code>unnest</code></a> to "transpose" the array, that is, turn each array element into a row.</p>
<p>This is the result:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>email</span><span>,</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>as</span> <span>order_id</span>
<span>db-#</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>orders</span> <span>o</span> <span>JOIN</span> <span>users</span> <span>u</span> <span>ON</span> <span>o</span><span>.</span><span>user_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>u</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>
<span> id |       email       | order_id</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>In the early 1990s, the programming languages research community was in an
optimistic mood. In the recent past, two of its paradigmatic languages—<wbr>Scheme
and ML—<wbr>had formalized their semantics. For ML, it took the form of a whole
book by Milner, et al. Scheme provided a denotational semantics in its
standard. Surely, it seemed, it was only a matter of time before all languages
went in this direction.</p><p>What went wrong?</p><blockquote><p>If you’re a working programmer without a theoretical background, you might
wonder why a formal semantics matters at all. It’s actually for reasons you can
understand easily. When you write programs against code that someone else
wrote, you like having an interface, or <span>API</span>, to program against. It mediates
your conversation with the remote code, and anchors conversations about whom to
blame if something doesn’t work as expected.</p><p>The formal semantics of a language does exactly the same thing. The language
itself is the “remote code” you’re programming against. What it does should
be pinned down as precisely as possible—<wbr>but also as understandably as
possible!—<wbr>for you to work with.</p><p>The semantics isn’t just an interface for the user of a language. It’s also a
crucial interface for tool authors, who must (also) otherwise guess at the
behavior of the language. If you want an example of how even the relatively
simple act of a variable rename refactoring can go wrong, see Appendix 2 of
our <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pmmwplck-python-full-monty/">Python semantics</a>. A semantics
doesn’t guarantee those kinds of errors won’t occur, but its absence makes them
far more likely to.</p></blockquote><p>For many researchers, it’s a given that programming languages are
<span>mathematical</span> objects. This is a natural and attractive view. Languages
are formal objects, after all; they are therefore amenable to codification by
everything from logic to topology and more. (Formal) Specification is a natural
consequence of this worldview.</p><p>The world, however, is full of programming languages that do not fit this
model.<span><span><span>Some may even have been created by programming language
semanticists, which is worth pondering.</span></span></span> Created by the ostensibly unwashed,
they rudely announce their arrival with nothing more than an
implementation. People pick them up, find them useful, do worthwhile things
with them, and a million lines later, the next big “scripting language” is
born. Let’s call these <span>informal</span> languages.</p><p>Informal languages are, of course, also amenable to formal specification. However,
a crucial difference governs these two types of languages. Suppose we observe a
difference between what the specification says and what the implementation
does. In the case of Standard ML, for instance, one can approach the
implementor, walk through the reasoning in the specification, and explain why
the implementation is wrong. If the implementor agrees with your reasoning, no
matter how unhappy this makes them, they must admit to and eventually fix their
implementation.</p><p>The implementor of an informal language faces no such constraint. Faced with a
mismatch between an ostensible specification and their implementation, they are
free to simply laugh, question the specification’s parentage, and exit stage
right. The specification can <span>at best</span> track what “the language is
doing”, not really dictate its behavior.</p><p>Specification still serves a role. It can:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Shed light on what is happening inside a large and otherwise opaque
implementation.</p></li><li><p>Point out complex designs that would warrant being simplified.</p></li><li><p>Highlight design aspects that are prone to cause programmer error,
security violations, and so on.</p></li><li><p>Serve all the other uses of a specification, such as serving as a basis
for building tools.</p></li></ul></div><p>To do all these things <span>usefully</span>, however, the specification must take
significant steps to show its conformance to the reality of the informal
language, such as by running the same test suites as the implementations.</p><p>An informal language, then, is much more like an object found in nature:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/rock.jpg" alt="A rock."></p><p>We can push at it, poke it, and prod it, and hope that it will yield its
secrets. But we can never be certain—<wbr>without the help of the
implementors—<wbr>that we have properly characterized all of it.</p><p>That doesn’t mean we can’t approach the problem systematically. Geologists,
confronted with a rock, don’t flail helplessly. In high-school chemistry, I was
taught to approach unknown substances with the <span>SCODS</span> test: check for its
state, color, odor, density, and solubility.<span><span><span>They never included a letter
for “taste”, a reflection perhaps more of their aspiration than of the
reality in a high school chemistry lab.</span></span></span> That is, we identify some of
dimensions of classification, and proceed along the principal axes.</p><p>We have these axes for programming languages, too. We can talk about their
scope rules, their evaluation semantics, their type system, and so on. Indeed,
because so much of a programmer’s career will be spent confronting informal
languages and having to rapidly make sense out of them, I’ve long felt that how
we <span>teach</span> programming languages should
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/sk-teach-pl-post-linnaean/">also be divided along these
dimensions</a>.</p><p>The problem of informal languages will not go away, so long as a dedicated
amateur can scare up a new language’s implementation. Indeed, the size of our
informal language space grows ever-bigger, and vastly so, than that of
mathematical languages. In 2015, I made this slide:</p><p><img src="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/pls-nature/stack.png" alt="Our programming stack." width="560" height="420"></p><p>It shows the stack atop which a typical client-side Web program of the day
resided. What it actually shows is something much more subtle and important:</p><p><span>Programmers do not program in “languages”.</span></p><p>Rather, they program in some complex combination of languages, libraries,
frameworks (which can impose their own operational behavior—<wbr>e.g., seemingly
turn a call-by-value language into a reactive one), and more. What a programmer
needs is a semantics not just for the language sitting near the bottom, but
rather for the mountain on top of which their program resides.</p><p>For illustrative examples of what such semantics might look like, see our work
on the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lckqk-model-reason-dom-events/">operational semantics of
the <span>DOM</span></a> (it’s a giant control operator, y’all!), and
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/lelk-types-jquery-programs/">the type structure of jQuery</a>. But
these are just a tiny sliver of a tiny sliver. How do we make real progress up
the mountain and keep our position there as it keeps thrusting further out of
the ground?</p><p>We can’t expect the date-picker library’s author to also be a semanticist. But
we shouldn’t therefore resignedly conclude that we can never get there. Rather,
we should acknowledge that there are useful divisions of labor. Instead of
scolding informal language designers for their practices, semanticists need to
find methods to bridge that gap, keeping in mind:</p><blockquote><p><span>One can’t proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means.Alan Perlis</span></p></blockquote><p>Whatever we propose needs to be:
</p><div><ul><li><p>Reasonable (in terms of skill) for the implementor to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for them to produce.</p></li><li><p>Useful for us to consume and work with.</p></li></ul></div><p>One especially good intermediate proxy is a test suite of some sort. Tests
don’t always get the respect they deserve, but they too are a form of
specification. I like to call them “specifications from below”, precisely
defining what should happen in individual cases, whereas the typical formal
specification is “specification from above”, defining what happens across a
family of cases. Ultimately, of course, we need specifications “from above”,
but it’s worth noting that specifications “from below” are both useful to
developers and something they are skilled at producing. The recent trend in
languages of producing “confirmance suites” or “litmus tests” is especially
promising in this regard. (Our work on formalizing the
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/pclpk-s5-semantics/">strict mode of of ECMAScript 5.1</a>,
for instance, made use of the ECMAScript conformance suite.)</p><p>How we use them remains a little bit of an open question. The most obvious use
is to test our semantics: what Arjun Guha and I, to perhaps the horror
of some, called a <span>tested semantics</span>. But we might also be able to
generalize these tests, from “below” to “above”, i.e., it’s a synthesis
problem. This requires some structure to produce a semantics that is also
meaningful. Our paper on <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/kle-next-700-semantics//">The Next 700
Semantics</a> describes some of the contours for this line of work to consider.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p><em>This post describes a Sudoku solver in Python. Even the most challenging Sudoku puzzles can be quickly and efficiently solved with depth first search and constraint propagation.</em></p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<figure>

  <figcaption>A minimal Sudoku puzzle </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Recently the Sudoku bug bit me.
According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Wikipedia</a>, this popular brain teaser puzzle rose to prominence in 2004. “Sudoku” is Japanese for “single number”.
The goal of Sudoku is to full a 9x9 grid where each row, column and 3x3 region contains each of the numbers from 1 to 9. 
These puzzles range in difficulty, and some can be surprisingly hard to solve by hand. But all are remarkably easy to solve with computers.</p>

<h3 id="other-solvers">Other solvers</h3>

<p>After a few days of manually playing Sudoku, I naturally decided to write a solver for it.
I tackled this problem by myself, before comparing it to other online solvers.</p>

<p>There are two articles I would like to mention that were particularly helpful.
The first article is by <a href="https://dev.to/aspittel/how-i-finally-wrote-a-sudoku-solver-177g">Ali Spittel</a>. I liked the overall structure of her code, and used it to refactor some of mine.
Her code however cannot solve hard puzzles because it only follows a simple constraint propagation strategy.
The second article is by <a href="https://norvig.com/sudoku.html">Peter Norvig</a>.
He uses a more comprehensive search and constraint propagation strategy and provides a thorough analysis with multiple puzzles. 
I used his set of <a href="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/sudoku_top95.txt">95 hard puzzles</a> and <a href="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/sudoku_hardest.txt">11 hardest puzzles</a> to test my code. 
However, I found his structure unintuitive. For example, he stores the board as a dictionary instead of a 9x9 array.</p>

<p>Raghav Virmani’s augmented reality <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robovirmani_computervision-ai-ml-activity-6676143042518507520-c2pG">solver</a> is very cool. This program solves and overlays solutions on pictures of unsolved Sudokus in real time. 
It does this by combining Norvig’s solver with a Convolutional Neural Network that can read pictures of numbers.</p>

<p>There are many solvers which refrain from search or any other trial and error strategies.
One of the more complex of these is Andrew Stuart’s <a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm">solver</a> which implements 38 different strategies for solving Sudokus.
A major drawback of this type of solver is, despite the complexity, it cannot solve every type of Sudoku puzzle.</p>

<h2 id="2-difficulty-levels">2. Difficulty levels</h2>

<p>Before describing my solver, I’d like to give a quick overview of difficulty levels in Sudoku. 
I’ve gained an appreciation of them over the last few weeks.</p>

<p>The difficulty levels are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Easy to Hard</li>
  <li>Very hard</li>
  <li>Ultra-hard</li>
  <li>Impossible</li>
</ol>

<p>This is from a human viewpoint. Because the solver uses search, these levels don’t affect its performance. For a computer, all puzzles can be described as “easy”.</p>

<p>This section only considers puzzles with a unique solution or no solution. 
Any given Sudoku puzzle might have multiple solutions, but most published Sudokus only have one.
My solver can find all solutions for any given puzzle.</p>

<h3 id="easy-to-hard-puzzles">Easy to hard puzzles</h3>

<p>The New York Times publishes daily Sudokus at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku/">www.nytimes.com/puzzles/sudoku/</a>. There are three levels: easy, medium and hard.
Here is an example of an easy puzzle (left) and a hard puzzle (right).</p>

<p><img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/NYTimes_easy.png" alt="Sudoku impossible"> 
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/NYTimes_hard.png" alt="Sudoku impossible by Norvig">
</p>


<p>The easy puzzle has 39 clues. At the start, there are 13 singles. These are cells where there is a candidate that is unique to that row, column, or box.
These can be filled in immediately. This will create other singles, until the very end of the puzzle. I can solve such a puzzle in 3-5 minutes.</p>

<p>The hard puzzle has 23 clues. At the start, there are only 2 singles. To solve the rest of the puzzle, one should compare rows, columns and boxes to eliminate candidates. 
It is very easy to rediscover the other basic <a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm">strategies</a>: pairs, triples, pointing pairs and box-line reduction.
I can solve these puzzles in 20-30 minutes.</p>

<p>It is enough to use the simplest of these strategies combined with depth first search to solve any Sudoku puzzle very quickly.</p>

<h3 id="very-hard-puzzles">Very hard puzzles</h3>

<p>People however like to challenge themselves. Is it possible to solve a hard Sudoku without any guessing? 
There are many more complex strategies for solving Sudoku puzzles. For example, constructing chains across multiple rows, columns and boxes to eliminate candidates.
Or comparing multiple cells and candidate combinations to eliminate only a single candidate.
In general, it is more work for less.</p>

<p>Some puzzles require at least one of these strategies for solving (with no guessing).
Andrew Stuart rates them from Tough to Extreme to Diabolical. I don’t solve these puzzles.</p>

<p>Here is a diabolical puzzle with 26 clues:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/Stuart_diabolical.png" alt="Sudoku minimal">
</figure>

<p>This one is particularly nasty. Try put it in Stuart’s <a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/sudoku.htm?bd=..31..72.7.....5...5.24..3....72......6...8......14....6..95.8...5.....9.49..26..">solver</a>. It takes multiple steps of small eliminations before the puzzle can be solved.
Meanwhile my solver takes only six guesses to solve it.</p>

<h3 id="ultra-hard-puzzles">Ultra-hard puzzles</h3>

<p>Ok. So you’ve become a Sudoku master. You abhor guessing.
You’ve learnt all the complex techniques. You can create chains across the entire board and <a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Sword_Fish_Strategy">swordfishes</a>
remind you of your more innocent days.
Can you now solve every possible puzzle with logic alone? No guessing? It turns out, no. Stuart himself posts weekly ‘<a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Weekly_Sudoku.asp">unsolvables</a>’.
These puzzles cannot be solved with his logic-only solver. But they are very much solvable with search.</p>

<p>In 2012, this 21-clue puzzle by mathematician Arto Inkala was labelled the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/9359579/Worlds-hardest-sudoku-can-you-crack-it.html">hardest Sudoku puzzle</a> in the world:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/Inkala_hardest.png" alt="Sudoku minimal">
</figure>

<p>Is it the hardest? I do not know. But it is certainly a monster. At the very start, one cell has two candidates, and the rest have three.
You’re forced to make a guess in the cell with the two candidates. And then at best, another two guesses before you can use any of the techniques in Stuart’s solver.
That is a $1$ in $2^3 = 8$ probability of guessing correctly with no wrong guesses. My solver takes 39 guesses to solve this, of which 29 are wrong<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup>.
So in other words, even an amateur like me can solve the hardest Sudoku puzzle in the world by hand, as long as they are willing to do it 40 times.</p>

<h3 id="impossible-puzzles">Impossible puzzles</h3>

<p>If you search for this term on the internet, you’ll probably find a lot of hard, but certainly solvable, Sudokus. 
People like to exaggerate the difficulty of these puzzles. 
There is, however, a very large set of puzzles that are truly impossible.
They’re trivially easy to construct. The easiest way to do so, is to play a game of Sudoku and make a mistake XD.
Here are two puzzles which are impossible from the start:</p>

<p><img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/Simple_impossible.png" alt="Sudoku impossible"> 
<img src="https://liorsinai.github.io/assets/posts/sudoku-solver/Norvig_impossible.png" alt="Sudoku impossible by Norvig">
</p>


<p>Very amusingly, Norvig passed the puzzle on the right to his solver, and it took almost 24 minutes to conclude that it was impossible.
His solver otherwise takes less than a second to solve ultra-hard Sudokus. 
As an amateur Sudoku player, it took me less than a minute to verify that it was impossible<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="3-code">3. Code</h2>
<h3 id="general-algorithm">General algorithm</h3>
<p>To solve even the most challenging of these puzzles, our Sudoku solver only needs to follow three strategies:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If a square has only one candidate, place that value there.</li>
  <li>If a candidate is unique within a row, box or column, place that value there (hidden singles).</li>
  <li>If neither 1 or 2 is true in the entire grid, make a guess. Backtrack if the Sudoku becomes unsolvable.</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to check number 2, we have to keep a list of candidates for each block, and update it as values are placed.
This adds complexity. We could leave it out - the solver will require more guesses but will still work. 
However it is easy to find these hidden singles and this step makes the algorithm much faster.
So the added complexity is well justified.</p>

<h3 id="sudoku-class">Sudoku class</h3>

<p>My Sudoku class stores two 9x9 arrays: one is for integers with the final value and another is for candidate values.
I also wrote a few helper functions to extract rows, columns and boxes from the grid. 
The <code>__repr__</code> function overrides the default string for the <code>print</code> function.</p>

<h3 id="candidate-functions">Candidate functions</h3>

<p>These functions are for editing the <code>candidates</code> array. They are also part of the <code>Sudoku</code> class.</p>

<p>Below is the <code>find_options</code> function which is called by <code>__init__</code>. 
I’ve chosen to work with the Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset">set</a> type for working with candidates.
The set functions <code>union</code> (operator <code>|</code>) and difference (operator <code>-</code>) make it easy to find distinct candidates between intersecting rows, columns and boxes.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>find_options</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>r</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>:</span>

<p>As we place values, we’ll need to erase them as candidates in neighbouring blocks. 
This might then unlock new values elsewhere, so it is useful to do constraint propagation at the same time. 
While there are many different strategies for constraint propagation,
it is sufficient to use only the simplest strategy, hidden singles.</p></div></div></div></div>

Once you start paying attention to the details, you’ll realize other humans are the most interesting thing in the world.</p> <p><strong>Counter-position.</strong> Don’t try to compete with their fantasy. Like Kellyanne Conway answering a question, just pitch a different one. If you suspect someone the fantasy in the future job is “I will make more money”, don’t immediately offer a raise. Pitch another something else, e.g: “there will be real opportunity for public recognition in this role”. <span>Don’t make your idea comparable to another idea.</span></p> <p><strong>Direct a movie.</strong> Suppose you want someone to quit smoking. The fantasy you want to plant is how youthful they’ll feel when they stop. The most effective way to incept a person isn’t to say those words. Instead, say something like: “it must feel wonderful to run 3 miles in the wilderness, take a breath of fresh air and really live life.” <span>Conduct a movie in the mind with words that evoke vivid imagery.</span> It makes for a much more engaging conversation.</p> <p><strong>Don’t pre-suppose solutions.</strong> Instead of thinking of what you want (“you should build this thing”), think of <em>why</em> you want it (“this thing could be really successful, if someone built it”). Try to formulate a narrative around the underlying motivations for the idea, and let them think of the actual concept themselves. <span>Give context, not commands.</span></p> <p><strong>Run a simulation.</strong> Think to yourself: “what would I be thinking if I was in that position?” To do this well, you must disentangle your own motivations. <span>Take your hat off. Put theirs on. Argue against yourself with them.</span> This helps convey that you’re really trying to see the problem from their side.</p> <p><strong>Pitch theoretically.</strong> When you’re in a biased position, don’t make any direct suggestions (“you should”). Your idea may get auto-rejected because of its origin. Instead, use yourself or a theoretical stranger (“I would…”, “boy <em>somebody</em> ought to…”).</p> <p><strong>Lastly, forget about yourself.</strong> <span>People frequently make the mistake of pitching ideas that will help them, not the other party.</span> This doesn’t work. Smart people have a very strong firewall for truly embracing an idea. To pass it you must really afford the other party something that they deeply want. Not what you want. That is a secondary goal.</p> </article></div>]]>

Introduction
      </p>
      <p>
An article http://eed3si9n.com/console-games-in-scala
<br>
 - describes control sequences that allow to print in any arbitrary location on the screen, rather than in line-by-line manner
<br>
 - describes how to read arrow button press events
      </p>
      <p>
decided to implement in haskell, wrote some preliminary code that reads arrow button presses from console, didn't know how to write tetris in functional style, came across a comment about fs2, been reading about iteratee, postponed tetris, lost preliminary code.
      </p>
      <p>
have read a book "Learn you a haskell for great good" (LYAH)
      </p>
      <p>
an idea was suggested to write tetris, implemented it in java, then decided to translate it to haskell.
      </p>

      <p>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      </p>
      <p>
Project structure
      </p>

      <p>
<code>figure</code>, <code>arena</code>, <code>ConsoleView</code>, <code>main</code>
      </p>

      <p>
a figure is implemented as an immutable structure, instead of rewriting a field value returns another version of itself.
      </p>

      <p>
an arena stores playing field cells and a figure.
      </p>

      <p>
a <code>ConsoleView</code> prints an arena to the console.
      </p>

      <p>
<code>main</code> glues everything together: reading of input symbols, reaction to commands, showing an arena, starting and stopping a timer.
      </p>

      <p>
first implemented without a timer, and after that added a timer and concurrency.
      </p>

      <p>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      </p>
      <p>
Concurrency
      </p>

      <p>
there is a channel (concurrent queue)
<br>
a timer sends a "tick" command to the channel
<br>
a recursive <code>keys2commands</code> function translates read symbols into commands, which it then sends to channel
<br>
some function reads commands from the channel and passes them to the <code>handleTetrisCommand</code> function which reacts to them
<br>
<code>handleTetrisCommand</code> receives game state and a command as an input, shows an arena and returns the next state of a game
      </p>

      <p>
two ways of repeatedly invoking <code>handleTetrisCommand</code>:
<br>
 - using recursive function
<br>
 - using <code>foldM</code>
      </p>

      <p>
when <code>handleTetrisCommand</code> is invoked by <code>foldM</code>, it works because lists are lazy in haskell
      </p>

      <p>

      <div><p>
Conclusions

</p><p>

specific and abstract
<br>
haskell is not as strictly functional as I thought

      <p>
What's next?
      </p>

      <p>
what part of code is pure functional and what part is not pure?
      </p>

      <p>
exit game functionality is not implemented yet, one way of exiting game is through interrupting the console
      </p>
      <p>
optimize changing values in cells matrix
      </p>
      <p>
how to introduce more functional stuff into code, like monads, monad transformers, etc.?

Introduction
      </p>

      <p>
There's a tradition to print Hello World to the console when beginning learning a language. Let's call printing Hello World to the console a first level of interactivity. A next level is when a program gets an input from a user and prints the result to the console. Sounds similar to the way functions work.
      </p>

      <p>
One of the merits of a functional style is said to be the fact that functions don't produce side effects. Side effects have the potential to over-complicate the code, making it resemble a bowl of spagetti (it is called spagetti-code), and unwanted side effects are errors, bugs. When we use functions, we don't have side effects, so from the beginning we eliminate the possibility of introducing an unwanted side effect into the code.
      </p>

      <p>
Sounds convincing, but what does it look like in practice when we're dealing with something more sophisticated than Hello World or a console calculator?
      </p>

      <p>
We want to write something complex and intertwined in functional style and check if spagetti is going to get untangled because we used functions, and if so, what will it look like?
      </p>

      <p>
Are we going to write some UI or a server, or maybe an operation system kernel? It would be too far of a jump on a learning curve, which seems to be pretty steep in haskell's case. We got to flatten the learning curve.
      </p>
      <p>
It's got to be console application. But here is a thing: how are we going to test if functions help us untangle the code, given that console works similar to functions in line-by-line input-output mode?
      </p>

      <p>
This article helps us resolve the problem: http://eed3si9n.com/console-games-in-scala
      </p>
      <p>
It describes:
<br>
 - control sequences of symbols that let us print in any location on screen, rather than line by line.
<br>
 - how to read arrow button pressed events.
      </p>

      <p>
In this way it's possible to use console on a higher level of interactivity.
      </p>

      <p>
After having read the article, I decided to translate the code to haskell, wrote some preliminary code that reads arrow button presses from console, and reacts to them by moving a figure on a screen.
      </p>
      <p>
An article proceeds by adding a code that periodically prints some text. The program's flow got divided into several threads working concurrently. I didn't know how to write something like that in haskell. The learning curve jumped high and became a wall in front of me. Actually it was me who made things more complicated, because I've been searching in the wrong place.
      </p>
      <p>
In the comment to an article someone mentioned fs2 library, I started searching it's equivalent for haskell and reading about the library. I've read in some discussion that the library consists of a set of instruments and there are various options of how to use each of them, developers have coded some of the options, but there are too many combinations of instruments and options to code each one, come up with a name for it, describe it in a documentation and make users memorise all the names. That strange situation discouraged me from using the library.
      </p>

      <p>
I kept the preliminary code only on hard disk, never uploaded it to any kind of cloud, and it so happened that it was lost. Perhaps you need to upload code into repos on cloud, even if it's just some draft code you are playing with. Sometimes such little things determine whether you keep progressing or procractinating.
      </p>

      <p>
Later I came across an idea of iteratees and got an impression that they are related to a functional style.
      </p>
      <p>
EDIT: actually, I forgot that I've read about fs2 and iteratees in this article that was written as a response to "Console games in Scala" article, in which the code was refactored to get rid of global shared mutable state: http://m50d.github.io/2018/09/12/streaming-console-game
      </p>
      <p>
Iteratees were implemented in haskell first, and then were adopted in other languages.
      </p>
      <p>
In search results I saw links to articles about iteratees on scala, skimmed through it, but I wanted to get the knowledge from the root, so to speak. I needed articles about iteratees on haskell.
I followed the link from the wikipedia article to an article in "The Monad Reader" journal. "Iteratee: Teaching an Old Fold New Tricks" by John W. Lato ( https://themonadreader.wordpress.com/2010/05/12/issue-16 ).
      </p>
      <p>
In that article the author created a data type, created Monad, Applicative and Functor instances for the data type and suggested to figure out the flow of execution of one method (&gt;&gt;=) as an exercise. I tried to do that, got lost in intricacies of function invokations and now iteratees seem to me like something complicated and tricky. Are newbie's brains too OOP to understand that stuff or maybe that article is a little too advanced? I think I was lucky enough to bump into the wrong article.
      </p>

      <p>
Are exercices a good or a bad thing? They are a good thing if you know how to use them as a tool. They are bad when the inner perfectionist refuses to continue with the job until the exercise is done, but doesn't want to do the exercise.
      </p>

      <p>
This dead-end branch of learning ended by me switching focus to scala because of an interview. Just a vague feeling remained that I wanted to write tetris on haskell and didn't know how to do that; that in order to do that I needed to understand how iteratees work and finish a hard and confusing exercise. Haskell is so hard to learn! In fact, I didn't even need iteratees to write tetris. This is an example of how the wrong strategy of learning can lead to a dead end and demotivate. Seems like being able to simplify the task at hand is a skill too, and you need to learn and train yourself to simplify things.
      </p>

      <p>
Have read the "Learn you a haskell for great good" (LYAH) book. An easy to read, engaging and interesting book.
      </p>
      <p>
I heard that there aren't much books and articles like that in haskell world. Maybe I'm just not very skilled in finding good articles. Do readers have any recommendations?
      </p>

      <p>
I decided to take a break from anything related to programming, later I started reading books to refresh memory, but didn't code because I could not come up with any project idea, all ideas seemed boring, not interesting enough to start coding.
      </p>

<p><span>O</span>n June 23, Jiang opened an app called 58 Tongcheng and saw a public poll: “I quit my job in January and have been laying low at home so far. How about your first half of 2020?”</p>



<p>She suddenly got emotional. Jiang, who asked to be identified by her last name only, is 27 and lives in Nanjing, a city of eight million people in eastern China. In February, her employer of four years, a small clinic that offers beauty treatments like Botox, laid off all three of its staff workers, on account of pandemic-related economic pressure. Jiang, who had attended only vocational training after high school, found it hard to get a new job. She worked briefly for a hospital call center but quit when she was ordered to lure patients in with false promises. She enrolled in a skills-training program that cost $3,000 but felt she learned nothing new. When Jiang clicked on 58 Tongcheng’s poll, she wrote in the comments, “I’ve used up all my savings. I have no idea what to do tomorrow ever since I became unemployed. Feeling kind of lost.”</p>



<p>58 Tongcheng <a href="http://bj.58.com/">is the Chinese version of Craigslist</a> and one of the most popular websites for classifieds and job posts. But, this year, users like Jiang have turned 58 Tongcheng into a repository for unemployment grief. In the absence of media documentation of the economic upheaval created by Covid-19, the app has become an unofficial record of the depth of the country’s devastation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Officially, the Chinese <a href="http://www.stats.gov.cn/statsinfo/auto2074/202004/t20200417_1739478.html">unemployment rate has been remarkably stable</a>: 5.7% in June, less than 1% higher than the same time last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics of China. But that number has drawn suspicion from both inside and outside China. In April, Li Xunlei, then director of the research unit for Chinese security brokerage firm Zhongtai, published a report estimating a national unemployment rate of around 20%. He was <a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2020-05-01/zhongtai-securities-removes-research-chief-after-controversial-report-101549484.html">removed</a> from the position one week later, a decision Zhongtai claims was not related to the report.</p>



<p>Poor workers have been hit especially hard by the economic turmoil. A team of researchers led by Lu Hai, a professor of accounting at both Peking University and the University of Toronto, found that, based on public job posts, the number of available positions with a monthly salary less than 4,000 yuan (about $570) has decreased this year by 44% compared to the same period in 2019. On the upper end of the economic spectrum, the number of posts advertising jobs with compensation higher than 15,000 yuan (about $2,140), was down by only 12%. (The average monthly salary in urban regions of China was about $1,100 in 2019.) One <a href="https://www.ifpri.org/blog/lockdowns-are-protecting-chinas-rural-families-covid-19-economic-burden-heavy">study</a> of Chinese villages around Hubei, the first epicenter of the virus, found that inhabitants were spending less on food because of economic difficulty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Helping the low-income population in China is quite challenging,” Lu wrote in an email to <em>Rest of World</em>. “These are the most vulnerable people and businesses when there is a significant negative shock.”</p>



<p>58 Tongcheng, or 58.com, is uniquely positioned to shine a light on disadvantaged communities. Founded in 2005 by Jinbo Yao, a young entrepreneur who started out selling domain names, the company started as a website for people to post and find housing leads, job notices, and items for sale. It sells ads on its platform and charges businesses and individuals $1,000 to $8,000 for a yearly membership that allows them to boost their posts or listings. An app launched in 2010 does the same. It is now among the top 30 Chinese apps by number of users, according to the data analytics firm QuestMobile.</p>



<p>Recruitment is one of 58 Tongcheng’s core services. It is especially popular among blue-collar workers and their employers. In 2017, Yao told the business magazine <em>China Entrepreneur</em> that the company has a 90% market share in online blue-collar recruitment. (Many blue-collar workers still find jobs through offline connections.) That same year, the company launched 58 Town, a separate app targeting small-town populations, as part of a strategic push to attract users in China’s less-developed regions. 58 Town has ventured into 13,000 of China’s approximately 40,000 towns, according to the company’s 2019 annual report. Last year, more than half of 58 Tongcheng’s core business revenue was generated outside of the top 19 cities. (At the time of publication, the company was still listed on the New York Stock Exchange.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>58 Tongcheng’s social network feature, launched last year, is designed to give users the chance to chat outside the job search. In these “58 communities,” users talk under pseudonyms about shared experiences. Some of the most popular forums include “life as a laborer,” “all about job seeking,” and “family of restaurant workers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s really a place where [users] discuss things quite freely and find a sense of community online,” Yao explained to a May 2019 earnings call to analysts, translated from Mandarin to English by 58 Tongcheng’s Chief Financial Officer, Hao Zhou. Complaints are common. “Sometimes they are under pressure,” Yao explained. “They don’t have an outlet for some of the steam or just a place to find people [who] have similar feedback or a place to find comfort.” The company did not respond to <em>Rest of World</em>’s interview request.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what’s happening now in the aftermath of the first wave of the pandemic. After losing her job, Jiang used the 58 Tongcheng app because she heard from others that it was a helpful recruitment platform. After several frustrating days of job hunting, she needed to vent her negative energy. Overnight, more than 100 people commented on her post, sharing their own experiences of being laid off or scammed by training programs.</p>



<p>Jiang found comfort in what she read. “I was having so much anxiety, but then I saw that everyone is in the same situation,” she told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Every day, hundreds of people, like Jiang, now use the 58 Tongcheng app to share their experiences of unemployment. Not every post receives equal attention. Some are marked as quality content and placed on the front page. Others are quickly ignored. Four days after her post, Jiang wrote another one, asking for job or apprenticeship leads. It was viewed only 70 times; no one replied.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Few conversations have trickled out of the app into the public conversation. But last month, a Chinese photographer who goes by the alias Fennu Yinhang (<a href="https://weibo.com/5625216939/J566W4nWg?type=comment#_rnd1594845115454">@愤怒银行</a>) posted screenshots on Weibo and called them “Unemployment Notes on 58 Tongcheng.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Fennu Yinhang, the screenshots contained some of the app’s most popular posts. In one, a woman describes spending $10 on cosmetics and picking out her best outfit to interview for salesperson positions. “I don’t care what I will be selling,” she writes, “as long as it’s a sales job.” Another complained that, being 45, she was excluded from all the jobs requiring applicants to be between 18 and 42. (Age discrimination is legal in China.) But her son had reassured her on the phone: “Mom, you are great. They failed to see your value.”</p>



<p>This post quickly went viral, in part because so few users on Weibo — who are typically white-collar — seem to realize how bad the unemployment situation for blue-collar workers is. In comments on the post, many were coming to terms with the extent of China’s unemployment crisis. “We need to be able to talk about poems, about the trending topic BLM, about aesthetics, photography, fashion, coffee bean types, and whiskey producers,” one of the top comments reads, “but we also need to see the pain and dilemma of people around us.”</p>



<p>Still, discussions of the severity of mass unemployment remain scarce on social media — and among Chinese leaders.</p>



<p>Since the pandemic first broke out in December, the Chinese government has taken small steps toward helping workers. This month, it organized its first-ever <a href="http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2020-07/02/content_5523428.htm">civilian-run Company Recruitment Month</a><strong> </strong>to match unemployed workers with jobs in the private sector. 58 Tongcheng pitched in, hosting a <a href="https://hrgactivity.58.com/render/minyingqiyezhaopinyue/home">virtual hiring expo</a> for the service industry, along with other platforms. But government policies, as they exist now, have many flaws. The vast majority of jobless workers — about 90% — are not eligible for unemployment benefits, resulting in a mass underestimation of the unemployment numbers. Xi Jinping made poverty eradication by 2020 one of his goals; now it looks like <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/impact-covid-19-coronavirus-global-poverty-why-sub-saharan-africa-might-be-region-hardest">the numbers will only increase</a>.</p>



<p>In the absence of an open conversation about the effects of the economic downturn, 58 Tongcheng users have turned the app into a channel to express and document their frustration. Away from the media spotlight, this corner of the internet may find its greatest value in illustrating the true depth of pandemic despair.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><main><article><main><a href="https://pento.ai/blog/scaling-computer-vision-dataflow"><p>Scaling Computer Vision models with Dataflow</p></a><nav><span><span><span></span><span>3d<!-- --> ago</span><span>July 28, 2020<!-- --> (<!-- -->3d<!-- --> ago)</span></span></span></nav></main><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/dataflow.webp"></p><p>We will shortly introduce the Google Cloud service <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Dataflow</a>, and how it can be used to run predictions on millions of images in a serverless way. No cluster creation, no maintenance, and you only pay for what you use. We will start by providing a context on why we think this is important, a brief introduction to a couple of concepts and then go directly into a use case.</p><p>Scaling Machine Learning models is hard and expensive. It is costly mainly for two reasons: because the infrastructure is expensive, and because your experimentation pipeline is slow causing your ML team to be constantly waiting for the results.</p><p>It is easy to underestimate how is expensive it is to have an ML team waiting for results. Not only because of the time wasted but also because people get frustrated and end up losing motivation.</p><p>One way to optimize your ML experimentation process it is to build and manage your own infrastructure. This is common in big companies, but this is often prohibitively expensive for smaller companies.</p><p>Traditional software development had similar challenges years ago, companies needed to scale, mainly driven by business needs (slow services/API/website don't scale). Cloud Providers saw an opportunity to provide services that allow companies to scale without upfront costs. They mainly approach this issue in two ways: services that are easier to manage and serverless services. The latter were particularly attractive for small companies that didn't have a big DevOps team or much money to pay for their own infrastructure.</p><p>A similar trend is happening in Machine Learning. This time is driven by the scarcity and high cost of ML talent. Like SW, small companies can't invest a huge amount of money to create a custom optimized infrastructure to ML, it requires a team of experts to build it and maintain it.</p><p>Cloud Providers saw an opportunity to add value similarly by providing Serverless solutions to ML. GCP, in particular, has done this for a while. GCP AI Platform offers different services for each stage of an ML project. But they also count on other services that can help solve ML challenges.</p><a id="what_is_dataflow?" href="#what_is_dataflow?"><h2>What is Dataflow?</h2></a><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow">Dataflow</a> is a fully managed processing service, that uses <a href="https://beam.apache.org/">Apache Beam</a> as its programming model to define and execute pipelines. Dataflow is one of the <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/capability-matrix/">many runners</a> that Beam supports.</p><blockquote><p>Apache Beam provides a portable API layer for building sophisticated data-parallel processing pipelines that may be executed across a diversity of execution engines, or runners.</p></blockquote><p>Dataflow in particular has some interesting features:</p><ul><li>Fully managed</li><li>Autoscaling</li><li>Easy implementation</li></ul><a id="what_is_apache_beam?" href="#what_is_apache_beam?"><h2>What is Apache Beam?</h2></a><p>As mentioned above, Beam is a programming model used to define and execute a processing pipeline. It provides an interface to create a processing pipeline that can be executed in multiple environments (such as Spark, Hadoop, Dataflow).</p><a id="use_case:_extracting_image_features_with_a_pre-trained_resnet50" href="#use_case:_extracting_image_features_with_a_pre-trained_resnet50"></a><p>As Computer Vision engineers, we often need to extract embeddings using a CNN model. Here we will present how to build a Dataflow pipeline that generates image feature embedding using a pre-trained ResNet50. Our pipeline will consist of 3 simple steps:</p><ol><li>Load images</li><li>Extract features</li><li>Store features</li></ol><p>To implement our pipeline we are going to use the Apache Beam Python SDK, Keras, Pillow, and Click. Because we will use non-python dependencies we have to structure our code as it is described <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-pipeline-dependencies/#nonpython">here</a>.</p><p>The first thing we need to do is create a pipeline configuration:</p><pre><pre><code>if local:
    # Execute pipeline in your local machine.
    runner_options = {
        "runner": "DirectRunner",
    }
else:
    runner_options = {
        "runner": "DataflowRunner",
        "temp_location": "...",
        "staging_location.": "...",
        "max_num_workers": max_num_workers,
    }

options = PipelineOptions(
      project=project_id,
      job_name=job_name,
      region=region,
      **runner_options
  )

options.view_as(SetupOptions).save_main_session = True
options.view_as(SetupOptions).setup_file = os.path.join(
    pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.absolute(), "..", "setup.py")
</code></pre></pre><p>As you can see the options change depending on whether we are executing the pipeline locally or on Dataflow.</p><p>Then we need to create a <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/programming-guide/#creating-a-pipeline">Pipeline</a>:</p><pre><pre><code>with beam.Pipeline(options=options) as p:
        ...
</code></pre></pre><p><code>p</code> is our pipeline, to add new steps to the pipeline use the operator <code>|</code> as follow:</p><pre><pre><code>p = p | Task();
</code></pre></pre><p>If you want to explicitly name the step you can use the operator <code>&gt;&gt;</code>:</p><pre><pre><code>p = p | ("task_name" &gt;&gt; Task());
</code></pre></pre><p>And now we need to specify the steps for our pipeline. There are multiple ways to implement it:</p><ul><li>Built-in implementations: BigQuery connector, ReadFile, etc.</li><li>Custom implementation: Map, Filter, ParDo</li></ul><pre><pre><code>(p
 | "source" &gt;&gt; ReadFromText(input_path)
 | "load" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(load)
 | "extract" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(extract)
 | "store" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(store, output_path))
</code></pre></pre><p>Here you can see we have added the three steps mentioned above. We are loading the paths to the images from a CSV file in Google Cloud, then we load the images, extract their embedding, and store them in Google Cloud Storage.</p><p>In all the steps in our pipeline we expect to receive one input and return one output. To apply these type steps we must use the method <code>beam.Map</code>. Alternatively, If you are dealing with steps that could potentially receive/return zero or more inputs/outputs, you could use <code>beam.ParDo</code>.</p><p>Now that the pipeline is defined, let's take a look at implementations.</p><a id="loading_images" href="#loading_images"><h3>Loading images</h3></a><p>At this step, we need to download the image from GCS, load it as a Pillow Image, resize it, and convert it into a numpy array object. The reason why we download and resize in a single step, is that we want to reduce the data transferred between steps in the pipeline, thus decreasing the cost.</p><pre><pre><code>def load(path):
    """
    Receives an image path and returns a dictionary containing
    the image path and a resized version of the image as a np.array.
    """
    buf = GcsIO().open(path, mime_type="image/jpeg")
    img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(buf.read()))
    img = img.resize((IMAGE_HEIGHT, IMAGE_WIDTH), Image.ANTIALIAS)
    return {"path": path, "image": np.array(img)}
</code></pre></pre><p>Beam provides a set of <a href="https://beam.apache.org/documentation/io/built-in/">built-in Connector</a> to handle I/O.</p><a id="extracting_features" href="#extracting_features"><h3>Extracting features</h3></a><p>In this step, we need to load the ResNet model and run the predictions. To avoid loading the model multiple times on the same worker, a singleton wrapper was added to the <code>FeatureExtractor</code> class. Once we extract the embedding, we add it to the item dictionary, and as we do not longer need to have the full image loaded in memory, we remove it from dictionary.</p><pre><pre><code>def singleton(cls):
    instances = {}

    def get_instance(*args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in instances:
            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[cls]

    return get_instance

@singleton
class Extractor:
    """
    Extract image embeddings using a pre-trained ResNet50 model.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = ResNet50(
            input_shape=(IMAGE_WIDTH, IMAGE_HEIGHT, 3),
            include_top=False,
            weights="imagenet",
            pooling=None,
        )

    def extract(self, image):
        return self.model.predict(np.expand_dims(image, axis=0))[0]

def extract(item):
    """
    Extracts the feature embedding from item["image"].
    """
    extractor = Extractor()
    item["embedding"] = extractor.extract(item["image"])
    # We do not longer need the image, remove it from the dictonary to free memory.
    del item["image"]
    return item
</code></pre></pre><a id="storing_features" href="#storing_features"><h3>Storing features</h3></a><p>Now that we have the embedding we just need to store it in GCS.</p><pre><pre><code>def store(item, output_path):
    """
    Store the image embeddings item["embedding"] in GCS.
    """
    name = item["path"].split("/")[-1].split(".")[0]
    path = os.path.join(output_path, f"{name}.npy")

    fin = io.BytesIO()
    np.save(fin, item["embedding"])

    fout = beam.io.gcp.gcsio.GcsIO().open(path, mode="w")
    fin.seek(0)
    fout.write(fin.read())
</code></pre></pre><p>Dataflow allows you to specify the machine type, number of workers, objective, etc, providing a lot of flexibility to find the right configuration for the task at hand. You can check all the options <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#setting-other-cloud-dataflow-pipeline-options">here</a>.</p><p>Once you run your Dataflow pipeline you will see logs about the status of the execution in your machine. Another alternative is to use Dataflow web UI. You can learn more about it <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/using-monitoring-intf">on its doccumentation</a>.</p><p><img src="https://pento.ai/images/blog/dataflow-pipeline.webp" alt="Dataflow UI"></p><p>You can find the <a href="https://github.com/pento-group/dataflow-demo">full code here</a>.</p><p>Apache Beam also supports branching your pipeline. Let's say you want to create 2D visualizations of your embedding, you can do this by branching your pipeline in the following way:</p><pre><pre><code>p = (
   p
     | "source" &gt;&gt; ReadFromText(input_path)
     | "load" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(load)
     | "extract" &gt;&gt; beam.Map(extract)))

(p | "store" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(store, output_path))
(p | "reduce_dim" &gt;&gt; beam.ParDo(reduce_dim))
</code></pre></pre><p>This allows Beam to execute <code>store</code> and <code>reduce_dim</code> independently, providing more flexibility to optimize the pipeline, and therefore improving its performance.</p><a id="scale" href="#scale"></a><p>Dataflow provides <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/specifying-exec-params#setting-other-cloud-dataflow-pipeline-options">multiple configurations</a> that allow you to customize the way you want to scale, in a really easy way. By default, it chooses the values that improve performance. During the execution itself, Dataflow changes the configuration to optimize the performance, changing, for instance, the number of workers, the machine type, etc.</p><p>You can let Dataflow find out what is the best configuration each time you run the pipeline. But if you already know what your jobs need, such as the amount of RAM, or whether it is CPU intensive, what is the maximum throughput supported by your external services (i.e.: your DB or API capacity), it is better to specify this information directly. This will help Dataflow converge faster into the right configuration, speeding up the executing and reducing costs.</p><p>Dataflow should be enough to cover most of small/medium size companies requirements to scale. To have a number as reference, Dataflow is able to execute the use case presented above at rate of 5k images per seconds, using up to 1k workers.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You got a new dog, he’s very smart. So you decided to call him Brain. You love Brain, he’s your best friend now, and you always do things together. Everything would be perfect if Brain didn’t have this little problem; He gets distracted very easily, and when you go out for a walk, he pulls you around. No matter how tight you hold the leash, he always wins. It doesn’t stop there, and most often you find yourself following Brain rather than the other way around.</p><p>You are so frustrated, you can’t get anything done. Brain always wants to eat, play, or go outside to chase squirrels. You had enough, it’s time to train Brain, take control, and show him who is in charge!</p><p>The first step to changing Brain’s behavior is understanding why the behavior is happening.</p><h2>How Dogs Learn</h2><p>Training dogs is all about teaching them that you are the Alpha, and then using psychological techniques to reinforce their learning around key behaviors. The three different types of learning I’ll address here are called <strong>classical conditioning</strong>, <strong>operant conditioning</strong>, and <strong>social learning</strong>.</p><h3>Conditioned Behavior</h3><p>Classical conditioning was first studied in detail by Ivan Pavlov, through experiments with dogs and published in 1897. In one of his most famous experiments, Pavlov offered food to dogs and rang a bell at the same time. Over time, the dogs began to salivate (an unconscious response to food) not only when food was offered, but also when the bell was rung.</p><figure id="w-node-7408c90152ab-4885bece"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eed2ff36d85f3277043492b/5f1b2f8837dee2e4604d0561_Group.png" alt="Pavlov’s experiment with dogs"></p></figure><p>In this way, a dog can be taught to associate a certain event (positive or negative) with another stimulus. This model explains why some dogs can recognize the word “walk” and will grab their leash or get excited if someone says the word.</p><h3>Operant Conditioning</h3><p>Operant conditioning is based more on voluntary behavior. And It’s done by <strong>reinforcement</strong> or <strong>punishment</strong>. This theory was first elaborated by B.F. Skinner, who conducted experiments using rats and pigeons to assess learning based on stimuli. In this model, punishment doesn’t mean abuse or even physical force; it could simply be the removal of something positive, such as attention if a dog engages in bad behavior. Operant conditioning has four quadrants and they are:<br></p><p>1. Positive-reinforcement: This is when you reward your dog for performing a behavior that you would like your dog to repeat.<br></p><p>2. Negative-reinforcement: This is when pressure is applied, and it is only turned off when your dog complies.<br></p><p>3. Positive-punishment: This is when you use a physical correction (such as popping on the leash) to reduce the occurrence of a behavior.<br></p><p>4. Negative-punishment: This is when you withhold a reward from your dog. For example, your dog wants a treat, so you tell him to sit, he decides not to sit, so he doesn't receive the reward.<br></p><h3>Social Learning</h3><p>Social learning is whereby an animal learns by copying or mimicking the behavior of others. This can be a powerful tool to use when training a dog, especially if you have access to a very well-behaved dog that can act as a model.</p><h2>How does this apply to your brain?<br></h2><p>The problem you have with Brain that I’ve mentioned earlier is a combination of two sub-problems. (1) Obedience: how to get Brain to listen to you and do what you ask. (2) Focus: once you get Brain’s attention, and he starts doing what you have asked, how to make sure he won’t quit after <a href="https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/">8 seconds</a> or whenever a random thing tries to get his attention.</p><h3>Obedience</h3><p>If you want to sit to do some work, Brain won’t naturally sit quietly and let you do it. Brain wants to check social media, watch Youtube videos, and keep refreshing your email inbox in case you get a new email so he can rip it up.&nbsp;<br></p><p>You could try to talk some sense to him and convince him to let you work, but good luck with that. Instead, as Pavlov’s experiment suggests, you could train Brain by combining a <strong>natural stimulus</strong> with an <strong>unconditioned stimulus, </strong>and associate it to an <strong>unconditioned response</strong>.<br></p><p>For example, Brain loves coffee, when you offer him coffee (unconditioned stimulus), Brain gets excited (unconditioned response). Let’s say you want Brain to get excited when you sit down to write your morning pages or your daily todo list (which usually he doesn't like doing). In this case, the natural stimulus could be something like sitting down on your desk and saying: “Hey Brain, let’s sit down for 20 minutes and do XYZ”. You would say that while sipping your brewed delicious coffee to create the connection between enjoying coffee and getting something done.<br></p><p>To compare this to Pavlov’s experiment, saying “Hey Brain, let’s do XYZ” is like ringing the bell, the coffee is the treat, and the excitement that follows is the desired response. Eventually, If you repeat this enough times, “Let’s do XYZ” will become the <em>conditioned stimulus</em> and you will get the same excitement as the <em>conditioned response</em> even without having the coffee treat!<br></p><p>Of course, things may not go as smoothly as you hope. Making Brain give you the chance to be productive is just the first step and that doesn’t mean you will actually get the work done. To make sure that happens, we need to use the other training method to deal with the focus problem.<br></p><h3>Focus</h3><p>By now, you have Brain listening to what you say and let you start working on that important task you have to finish. However, Brain’s attention span is as short as 8 seconds as some studies suggest. How do you keep Brain engaged? Since you know Brain very well, you know how much he loves chocolate and to play PUBG on the phone. So you decided to take advantage of that, by using the four quadrants of <strong>Operant Conditioning</strong>, to maximize the possibility of getting Brain to perform with reliable obedience.<br></p><p>To use <strong>positive reinforcement </strong>you could tell Brain something like: “If we work on this task for 25 minutes without interruption you can have a piece of chocolate”. You want to reinforce the good behavior of focus by rewarding it with chocolate.<br></p><p>Don’t confuse this with <strong>negative reinforcement</strong>. If Brain wants to play PUBG, and you say: “you can play PUBG but we have to finish today’s blog post first”. Here you are turning pressure on, and when Brains complies your turn it off.&nbsp;<br></p><p>There are two very important things to remember when using negative reinforcement: (1) once the pressure is turned on, it can’t be turned off until Brain complies. If you told Brain that he can play after you finish the blog post, but you don’t finish it and you let him play, it defeats the entire purpose. (2) Once Brain complies, the pressure must immediately be turned off. If you finished your blog post don’t ask Brain for more work, doing so will make this method less effective later on.<br></p><p>For <strong>positive punishment, </strong>you may need the help of other people. For example,<strong> </strong>if you notice that Brain is spending a lot of time playing video games, you could ask your friend or partner to help you “punish” Brain, and force you to do more cleaning duties like doing the dishes. And if they catch you playing, you have to do 50 jumping jacks. The point is that an unpleasant consequence is introduced to the subject to discourage this behavior.<br></p><p>If after all of that Brain still didn’t comply, you can delete the game from your phone, or ask a friend to change your account password. That would be an example of <strong>negative punishment</strong>, you are taking something of value away.<br>Finally, to strengthen all the new behaviors you could use <em>Social Learning</em>. Take Brain and hang out with other people who have trained “Brains”. Either it’s a local group of friends or an online community. Interacting with other well-behaving “Brains” will help your Brain to do less of the bad behaviors and more of the good ones.</p><h2>🧠 = 🐶 ?</h2><p>We want to believe so bad that we are rational beings, but that simply is not true. The same way a dog’s decisions are driven by impulse, most of your decisions are too as well. If you want to control your actions you need to control the impulses behind them. And the same way you can train a dog to do progressively more complex behaviors and tasks, so too can you train your brain to take on more and more disciplined activities.<br></p><p>Hopefully, by using the brain-dog analogy, you can see that there is progress to be made and it will take time and patience. As you don’t expect your dog to know how to spin or wave on day one, you shouldn’t expect your brain to be super focused and productive without training. So don’t forget to be nice to yourself and your inner-dog.<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
				<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>So far, we've been making great progress. We've <a href="https://sphuff.com/building-an-api-mvp-from-the-ground-up-part-1-introduction-and-user-authentication/">authenticated our users</a> and <a href="https://sphuff.com/building-an-api-mvp-from-the-ground-up-part-2-billing/">set up our billing logic</a>. Now, let's move on to making a beatiful and blazing fast landing page, like the one I made for <a href="https://favoritesapi.com/">FavoritesAPI</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Xb5dJ47/landing.png" alt="FavoritesAPI Landing"></p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>There are a ton of templates and software to create landing pages with limited effort. The most important things (in my opinion) are that you:</p>
<ol>
<li>use minimal Javascript</li>
<li>rely on a CDN</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>It's generally our tendency as web developers to grab Javascript whenever we see a frontend problem, but that has heavy ramifications for site performance. Especially with important marketing material, it's vital that we ship a blazing fast site.</p>
<p>For instance, my landing page for <a href="https://favoritesapi.com/">FavoritesAPI</a> will load from anywhere from 200 ms to 750 ms depending on whether it's been cached by the CDN. A large part of the reason that it's so fast is because it uses very little Javascript. In fact, the only Javascript on the page is the Stripe client package from the <a href="https://sphuff.com/building-an-api-mvp-from-the-ground-up-part-2-billing/">previous billing tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>Just as importantly, you need to rely on a CDN to ship your landing page site. CDNs (or content delivery networks) allow you to easily host your content around the world. Without a CDN in place, your users would need to go all the way to your server in order to fetch your content. With a CDN, they will hit a server that has cached your content much closer to where they live.</p>
<p>There are numberless CDNs to work with. Personally, I recommend <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> for its ease of deployment, but you can use <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> or <a href="https://bunnycdn.com/">BunnyCDN</a> if you want to host your own content.</p>
<p>Now that we've covered how we want our landing page to perform, let's talk about what we want it to contain.</p>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>Our #1 goal when constructing a landing page should be to properly inform our potential customers about the benefits of our service. They should quickly get the answers they are looking for, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>What benefits your service will provide</li>
<li>What sacrifices they will need to make (cost, time, attention, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>On top of having their questions answered, they should also have an action to take. This could be signing up for a waitlist, giving you their email, or paying for your product.</p>
<p>When building <a href="https://favoritesapi.com/">FavoritesAPI</a>, I wanted the user to easily be able to scan my landing page to get the necessary information. The first thing they'll notice is the tag line, which is meant to give them a memorable hook into the product's purpose. Next, they'll want to know more specifically how that benefit is being provided. If you take a look at the landing page, you'll notice that your eye is drawn first to the tag line, and next to any of the bolded text. All of this bolded text is helpful information - how much the API costs, how much you will save, or how to consume the API. The unbolded text can be thought of as filler. If the user is willing to spend more time, they can peruse it, but it shouldn't be necessary.</p>
<p><strong>The user should know your benefits and sacrifices in the first 10 seconds on the page</strong></p>
<p>If they have to dig deep to figure those out, there's little chance they will go further.</p>
<h3 id="deploymentandhosting">Deployment and Hosting</h3>
<p>This is probably a good time to talk about how your frontend landing page should be hosted, as opposed to your backend application. I prefer to keep the two separate with completely distinct Github repos and deployment pipelines. All of my backend code is hosted at api.favoritesapi.com or app.favoritesapi.com, while the landing page is on the base domain. This may seem like an unnecessary complication, but your marketing material has completely different needs than your backend code. Your landing page needs to be incredibly performant and rely on a first-class CDN. On the other hand, your backend code needs to be easy to deploy first and foremost. Keeping the two separate will also make it easier to make future changes to the landing page.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoy using <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to deploy simple static sites. It is incredibly easy to integrate with Github, and I've found their CDN to be great. Deploying is as easy as <code>git push</code>. If you decide to go with Netlify (or a similar service), you will also need to configure your domain registrar to point to their DNS servers in order to use a custom domain.</p>
<p>Other alternatives include <a href="https://surge.sh/">surge.sh</a>, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, or just hosting your site yourself on a VPS. If you decide to go that route, make sure to use another CDN service like Cloudflare.</p>
<p>This has been a cursory overview of how I construct my landing pages. Next time we'll be tying together billing and authentication with an email layer. Thanks for reading!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><article class="page"><div><section><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-1.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-1.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-1.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-1.png 2400w"></figure><p>	When it comes to taking advantage of your larger displays, having a tool that helps you split and arrange windows quickly goes a long way. In this guide, I take this concept further by helping you create a workflow where every corner of your screen has a purpose, and apps can be launched and rearranged quickly with keystrokes. All with a dose of beautiful <em>a e s t h e t i c s</em>.</p><p>If you don’t have a <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-mac-window-management-tools/">window management app</a> yet, that’s a good place to start. I will be focusing the guide on <a href="https://manytricks.com/moom/">Moom</a> but the specific tool doesn’t really matter as long as it supports these killer features:</p><h3 id="grids">Grids</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-22.png" alt=""></figure><p>Your chosen app should allow you define areas on your screen based on a grid that you can customize to your liking. In my case, I divide my screen in an 8x8 grid for fine-control.</p><h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts</h3><p>Many solutions out there have menus that you can click in order to rearrange windows. This can be convenient at times, but if you’re dealing with large displays, using your mouse for this is going to be time consuming. </p><h3 id="gaps-between-windows">Gaps between windows</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-23.png" alt=""></figure><p>When running commands to divide or rearrange your windows, you’ll want your window management app to leave some space or gap between them. While it make seem like a subjective aesthetic choice, it will give you some breathing room and better sense of space. Plus it looks good.</p><h2 id="creating-a-default-layout">Creating a default layout</h2><p>A default layout is how your windows will be arranged most of the time. You may move them around for certain tasks, but having a layout to <em>default</em> to will keep your workflow consistent. Before we jump to specifics, let’s first answer this question:</p><blockquote>What apps do you use the most and what are they used for?</blockquote><p>Make sure you group them by category. Order doesn’t matter. This is <em>my</em> answer:</p><ul><li>Internet browsing: Google Chrome</li><li>Main work tool: <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty</a>, a Terminal.app alternative</li><li>Communications: Slack, WhatsApp, Messages</li><li>File management: Finder.app</li></ul><h3 id="designing-the-layout">Designing the layout</h3><p>This will depend entirely on your personal preference and hardware situation, but what you generally want to do is grab the apps from above and arrange them in such a way that it matches the time you spend on them and the space they actually need. </p><p>Another advice is to keep apps in the same category (such as Slack, Messages and WhatsApp) stacked since you can switch between them easily.</p><p>Here’s my layout:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/zones.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/zones.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/zones.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/zones.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/zones.png 1878w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>I used a 8x8 grid to help create the right proportion. E.g. I needed my browser to be a bit wider than half the screen.</figcaption></figure><p>I have two monitors that are the exact same size. I find that my eyes default more to the right monitor so having my work tool (3) occupy the entire screen there is more ergonomic to me. I need my browser (2) conveniently close for reference or previewing changes, but also general browsing so occupying the majority of the left screen feels right also. </p><p>Communications apps (1) are stacked up on the same quadrant on the top left of my setup and I switch to them based on need. That leaves a convenient location for file management (4) on the bottom left.</p><p>This is a screenshot of how it actually looks:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-1.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-1.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-1.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Click to zoom.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="supercharge-with-hotkeys">Supercharge with hotkeys</h3><p>Once you’re satisfied with the layout, it’s time to make it easy to re-create with your window management tool. Moom will let you select a part of your screen and set a keyboard shortcut:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-17.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-17.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-17.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-17.png 1020w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>On the top right out of each of these custom settings, I can set a key to use in combination with Moom’s hotkey, which is <code>Control + ↑</code> in my case. I chose <code>1</code> because its the first area from left to right. So, if I want to move Slack or any other communication tool like (Messages) to area <code>1</code>, I press <code>Control + ↑ + 1</code>. </p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/keyboard_shortcuts-2.png 1878w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>For area 3, I use <code>Control + ↑ + Space</code>. This is a default hotkey from Moom to occupy the entire screen.</figcaption></figure><p>Moom also has a custom setting that saves your window/app arrangement and lets you set up a key for it using the <em>Arrange Windows</em> custom setting:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-18.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-18.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-18.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-18.png 1018w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>"Ignore obstructed windows" is checked by default, but I kept it on because I want other communication tools to be moved as well (even if they’re not visible)</figcaption></figure><p>In this case, if I want to quickly re-create my entire default layout, all I have to do is press <code>Control + ↑ + D</code>. If something looks off, you can move your windows again (or close apps you don’t want to be affected by this layout) and then click on <em>Update Snapshot </em>to save your changes.</p><h2 id="everyday-layouts">Everyday layouts</h2><p>Depending on your workflow, you may need to move windows quickly in addition to your default layout. </p><h3 id="side-by-side-layout">Side by side layout</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-13.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-13.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-13.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-13.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Useful when you want to cross reference information or previewing. You probably already use it to some capacity, but here are some hotkeys I use that make that process easier:</p><ul><li>Move a window to the left half of the screen: <code>Control + ↑ + ←</code></li><li>Move a window to the right half of the screen: <code>Control + ↑ + →</code></li></ul><p>A setting like Moom’s <em>Arrange Windows</em> also comes handy for this, all you have to do is put the two type of windows you want side by side and set it up:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-20.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-20.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-20.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-20.png 1016w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>In this case, I do want to <em>Ignore obstructed windows</em> because I only care about the windows visible.</figcaption></figure><p>So the keyboard shortcut for this ends up being <code>Control + ↑ + S</code>. If you use a setting like this, you may need to do it per app/window combination.</p><h3 id="zen-layout">Zen layout</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-14.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-14.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-14.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/image-14.png 1600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/image-14.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Even with so much productivity and multi-tasking gains from your default layout, sometimes you just want to focus on one thing at a time. Now, you could take an app fullscreen, but dealing with a big display the contents of that window can look weird or unappealing. </p><p>What I call a <em>zen layout</em> is really just a combination of two things:</p><ol><li>A hotkey to center a window and give it just the right width so the content inside of it doesn’t look weird.</li><li>Hide everything else with the Mac’s standard shortcut &nbsp;<code>Option + ⌘ + H</code></li></ol><p>In Moom, a setting for my zen layout looks like this:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-21.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-21.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/image-21.png 1000w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-21.png 1018w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>So now I can trigger this configuration with <code>Control + ↑ + ↵ Enter</code>.</p><h2 id="launch-or-switching-apps-with-hotkeys">Launch or switching apps with hotkeys</h2><p>Using <code>⌘ + Tab</code> should not be your main way to move between apps. The order of the list changes constantly, and you waste time moving around in order to find the app you want.</p><p>Instead, give your most accessed apps a hotkey. This way, you’ll know exactly what app is opening and it will become second nature. &nbsp;These are my hotkeys:</p><ol><li>Communications (Slack): <code>F1</code></li><li>Internet browsing (Chrome): <code>F2</code></li><li>Main work tool (<a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/">kitty</a>): <code>F3</code></li><li>File management (Finder): <code>F4</code></li><li>Communications (Messages): <code>F5</code></li><li>Communications (WhatsApp): <code>F6</code></li></ol><p>I use function keys because they’re close to me on the keyboard and the number roughly matches their location on screen, but please choose something that is comfortable and convenient to you, otherwise you won’t stick to it. </p><p>To setup these hotkeys, I made an <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> workflow (below) but you can get similar results with a tool like <a href="https://setapp.com/apps/bettertouchtool">BetterTouchTool</a>.</p><h3 id="alfred-workflow">Alfred Workflow</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-4.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-4.png 849w"></figure><p>A very important point here is to make <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/triggers/hotkey/#faster-hotkeys">sure triggers are executed instantly</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-5.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-5.png 699w"><figcaption>If you don't do this, you will be waiting about a second to access each app.</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://changeset.s3.amazonaws.com/2020_july/app_hotkeys__alfred_workflow.zip">Download .alfredworkflow</a></p><h3 id="launch-or-switching-to-other-apps">Launch or switching to other apps</h3><p>Use <code>⌘ + Space</code> and type the first three or four letters of less common apps instead of using <code>⌘ + Tab</code>. Trust me, it’s faster. Not to mention it’s the same command you can use to open for files or folders; or to perform other quick actions. </p><h2 id="centralizing-the-finder-window">Centralizing the Finder window</h2><p>If you’re like me and have a hotkey to focus on the Finder window and also allocated a dedicated space for it in your default layout, I strongly suggest you make tabs the default behavior for it. </p><p>What this means is that whenever you reveal a file or folder on Finder (via Alfred, Spotlight, etc.) they will now open on a new tab <em>on the same window you already have open</em>. You’ll never have to go dig for multiple Finder windows again.</p><p>All you have to do is open your Dock settings on System Preferences:</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-6.png" alt=""><figcaption>This setting will ensure that whenever you open folders using Alfred, your terminal or code editor it is done in a predictable location</figcaption></figure><h2 id="minimal-aesthetics">Minimal aesthetics</h2><p>Make room for beautiful wallpapers by getting rid of noise on your screen.</p><h3 id="no-desktop-icons">No desktop icons</h3><p>Every time you need to grab something from your desktop, it means you have to move windows to the side and waste time looking for where things are. A computer is supposed to help us find things easily. Access your Desktop through your central Finder window instead.</p><p>Unfortunately, there isn't a way to hide your Desktop icons through any settings. So you’ll have to run some commands on your terminal:</p><figure><pre><code>defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool false &amp;&amp; killall Finder</code></pre><figcaption>One-liner to hide icons</figcaption></figure><figure><pre><code>defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop -bool true &amp;&amp; killall Finder</code></pre><figcaption>One-liner to undo this.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="no-dock">No dock</h3><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-2.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-2.png 780w"><figcaption>My Dock preferences pane. Notice "Automatically hide and show the Dock".</figcaption></figure><p>Some people like to have the dock to the side (a la Ubuntu). I prefer to not see it. I don't really need to see what apps are open, I already know.</p><figure><img src="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/image-3.png 600w, https://ghost.changeset.net/content/images/2020/07/image-3.png 780w"><figcaption>My General preferences pane. Notice "Automatically hide and show the menu bar".</figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, I always know which app I'm on, and I'm aware of most of the keyboard shortcuts I need the majority of the time, so no need to see this information either. The menu bar is always there if I need it by using <code>option+cmd+d</code> or hovering to the top of the desktop.</p><h2 id="wrapping-things-up">Wrapping things up</h2><p>Appreciate you reading (or skimming) this far. Hopefully these tips make your life a bit easier. A partying piece of advice is to always experiment with new layouts and configurations until you find one that works for you. I used to prefer working on my smaller laptop screen until I took the time to explore my options with larger displays and multiple monitors. Only then did I realize how much more productive I could me.</p></section></div></article></div></div>]]>

Your host is Tobias Macey, and today I'm interviewing Kyle Kingsbury about his work on the Jepson testing framework and the failure modes of distributed systems. So Kyle, can you start by introducing yourself?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:24">0:02:24</a></span></p><p>Oh, my name is Kyle Kingsbury. I work on Jepsen, which is a project to test distributed systems.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:29">0:02:29</a></span></p><p>And do you remember how you first got involved in the area of data management</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:32">0:02:32</a></span></p><p>out of college? I couldn't get into grad school actually happened during the financial crash in 2009. And I was working up a startup in San Francisco and doing distributed database work</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:42">0:02:42</a></span></p><p>there one thing led to another and so can you dig a bit more into what the Jepsen project is and some of the backstory of how you came to create it and your original inspiration or motivation for digging into this particular area?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:02:56">0:02:56</a></span></p><p>Yeah, so Jepson is a project to helped make distributed systems safer by testing them and seeing what they do under real world failure modes. And back around 2010, its distributed systems were becoming popular industry. But a lot of folks had sort of optimistic expectations. But what was possible, and there were some claims flying around that seemed a little bit irresponsible. There was a good deal of argument over this back and forth on Twitter and blogs, mailing lists. I was active on the React mailing list for quite some time. And eventually, I started Jepson to demonstrate that these problems were actually things that could happen in the real world. They were just theoretical issues.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:03:39">0:03:39</a></span></p><p>Yeah, I know that particularly when you are just testing and building a system. It's easy to see Oh, everything works great. And kind of push off the fact that there are going to be network faults and there are going to be clock skews and clock drifts that causes things to not operate the way that you want them to. And I'm curious what you have seen As far as some of the common misconceptions or misunderstandings of people who are both building and using distributed systems and the types of guarantees that they provide,</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:04:10">0:04:10</a></span></p><p>yeah, that couldn't be started. There were all sorts of interesting expectations. I remember MongoDB, for example, wrote something about how users shouldn't expect to preserve data when a process crashes or is killed with kill dash nine. And as a result, I think, sort of throwing some sort of cocktail party called kill dash nine. Meanwhile, React was busy falling over anytime you tried to list keys in the database. So there was there's a lot of rough and tumble action in those days. Nowadays. I think people take partitions crashes, that sort of thing more seriously. I see a lot of folks at least tried to do some degree of testing for those. And yet, when I do consulting work, often I'll find databases where it looks like nobody tried to verify behavior during faults.</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:04:56">0:04:56</a></span></p><p>And aside from Jepson, what are some of the other matters methods that people typically use for stress testing or evaluating the guarantees of these systems</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:05:06">0:05:06</a></span></p><p>and look at Jepsen, because it's an experimental approach as being one part of a complete breakfast continuum of quality methods. One of those is to start with a proven algorithm, some sort of abstract model of your system and either to have a hand or machine check proof of it, or at least a model checker, maybe with TLA. And if you are lucky, you can do some sort of code extraction with caulk or high level or cipher f HL with Isabel. But that's, that's not I think how most production systems get built. Most systems get built by pointing at a whiteboard and writing a bunch of code. And then your tools for Safety Analysis tend to be more along the lines of unit tests and integration tests. Jepsen takes a blackbox approach, which puts it sort of at the far end of integration testing other systems like Cassandra's D test suite Take a similar approach. You'll see people who do sort of manual testing where they do fault injection via somebody just running commands on the cluster or toggling some sort of hardware power switch, or network switch. That's the approach that's taken by foundation DB foundation. Devi also does a lot of automated simulation testing, where they will run a virtualized network with many simulated nodes in the same process and they can intercept messages and reorder them to get interesting results. So I think there's there's a lot of approaches people take to testing systems Jepson tries to general and who to work across many types of systems, which often means that it's not as deep or as capable as exploring the state space as a say a simulation test that's written specifically for the database that you're working on might be,</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:06:46">0:06:46</a></span></p><p>and then as far as some of the real world usage of things like databases and other mission critical distributed systems, what are some of the real world impacts that can occur as a result of these failures that aren't properly vetted or properly guarded against,</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:07:05">0:07:05</a></span></p><p>oh, you can get all kinds of faults, obviously, data could be lost. So you, you write something and then it just disappears later, you can have different nodes that compete on some version of the history. So maybe one person thinks that the list you're adding things to is 123, and other things, it's four or five, six, you can have temporal anomalies where you read some information from the past, instead of the present. You could have transactional violations where two transactions kind of land on top of each other or interleave, in some weird way. And all these systems that I've tested exhibit,</p></div></div><div><p>Tobias Macey</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:07:40">0:07:40</a></span></p><p>typically one or more of these behaviors. The question is sort of how hard you have to push them to get there. And then in terms of the actual testing approach of using Jepsen for being able to find some of these error modes that exist in a particular system. What is your overall approach for business? Finding the test suite and customizing it for a given system. Because all of these different platforms will have different guarantees that they're trying to provide, or different approaches to linearize ability or serializability, or the strictness of the isolation that they provide. And I know that that provides a fairly extensive surface area to try and cover in any test suite. And I'm wondering just what your approaches for determining what are the key points to interact with. And then also any variability in the actual interfaces that are exposed by these systems for being able to interact with them and validate the correctness of the operations that are being performed?</p></div></div><div><p>Kyle Kingsbury</p><div> <p><span><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/jepsen-distributed-systems-testing-episode-143/?t=0:08:38">0:08:38</a></span></p><p>Yeah, you're quite right. There's there's sort of two huge surface areas to cover. One of them is the breadth of the API, all the different things databases do. Modern SQL databases have so many functions and so many interacting components that it's really difficult to predict, you know, how they're going to interact. And it also is tricky because when you get awkward misers into the mix. You know, depending on something like the size of your data, you might have two very different code paths that can evolve with different safety properties. So I don't have a good answer for that, you know, I write as many tests as I can in the time that I have. But that's usually just a tiny fraction of the overall API. My guiding principle is to …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>Kubernetes is the most popular open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure layer. As a result, developers can focus on building applications, then deploy them to any of those environments.</p>



<p>To bring Kubernetes closer to developers, we’ve created a ready-to-use <a href="https://github.com/microtica-components/component-aws-eks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infrastructure component for Kubernetes</a>. This component uses AWS EKS as a service and sets Kubernetes master and nodes in auto-scaling infrastructure setup. Nodes are EC2 instances based on Kubernetes optimized AMIs.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>Components are a core concept in Microtica which allow developers to create and release their custom Cloud infrastructure setup in a standardized way. A</em>fter <em>the component is created, it can be reused in as many projects and environments as needed.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>In addition to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://microtica.com/start-creating-infrastructure-on-aws-like-a-pro/" target="_blank">infrastructure setup</a> for Kubernetes, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.microtica.com/" target="_blank">Microtica</a> also offers you CI and CD for microservices. This means that you don’t have to worry about the complex details of the integration with Kubernetes. With this, we cover the whole process of software and infrastructure delivery.</p>



<p>In this article, we will learn how to <strong>deploy a microservice in the cloud with our Kubernetes component</strong>. Let’s get started by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/register" target="_blank">creating your account</a> and project in Microtica. To deploy your first microservice in under 10 mins, follow these steps:</p>



<h3><strong>1. Add your AWS Account</strong></h3>



<p>First, go into <em>Settings</em>, then <em>AWS Accounts </em>tab, then <em>Add New Account</em>. Follow the steps to connect your account.</p>



<p><em>Note: All resources will be created on the provided AWS account, expenses will be calculated according to AWS pricing for using the services.</em></p>



<h3><strong>2. Create an environment</strong></h3>



<p>With a connected AWS account, you can continue to create your environment in which you’ll deploy your infrastructure. <a href="https://portal.microtica.com/environments/create" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Create an environment</a> following the wizard on Microtica and then continue to add the components we will need.</p>



<h3><strong>3. Add components</strong></h3>



<p>To successfully setup a working Kubernetes Cluster in which we’ll deploy a microservice, we will need only 2 components: a <strong>VPC component </strong>and of course a <strong>Kubernetes Cluster component</strong>. We need the VPC (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud) component to enable us to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that we’ve defined. This virtual network is dedicated to your AWS account. This component sets one AWS VPC, and four subnets (2 public and 2 private subnets).</p>



<p>Here’s how to configure your components to connect them and create the infrastructure.</p>

<p><em>Note: You will need to create an EC2 key-pair from the AWS console. We don’t create it automatically due to security reasons. This key should always be in your possession and kept in a secure place. This key will allow you to access your EC2 instances through SSH.</em></p>

<p>When configuring the parameters for the Kubernetes Cluster component you can reference the VPC component so you <strong>don’t have to manually reenter the values</strong>. Microtica will take care of the order in which the components will be deployed in the cloud. This will allow you to have a working environment.</p>

<p>With the configuration set in place, you can deploy your environment by clicking <em>Create Plan</em>. Here you will see a detailed listing of the resources that are about to be added to the environment. Confirming will initiate the deployment and lead you to a page where you can follow the logs and events that are happening. Setting up this infrastructure can take up to 15 mins, so let us get started with our microservice in the meantime.</p>



<h3><strong>4. Create a microservice</strong></h3>



<p>For the purposes of this example, we will be using a simple <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world" target="_blank">Hello World microservice</a> available in Docker hub. First, go to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://portal.microtica.com/microservices/create" target="_blank"><em>Microservices/Create microservice</em></a><em> </em>and follow the wizard in Microtica. For a source select public docker image and paste <strong>hello-world</strong>. Then, click <em>Next</em>, then <em>Create Microservice </em>and now we have our microservice.</p>



<figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-1024x492.png" alt="Creating a Kubernetes microservice
" srcset="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-1024x492.png 1024w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-300x144.png 300w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-768x369.png 768w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-1536x738.png 1536w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-2048x984.png 2048w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-06-at-11.38.52-AM-740x356.png 740w" sizes="100vw"><figcaption>Create microservice from public Docker image</figcaption></figure>



<p>As a result of using a docker image as a source, we already have a built artifact so we can immediately deploy it in the Kubernetes cluster. <strong>You can do this from <em>Microservice details — Add to Cluster</em>, or in the<em> Kubernetes Dashboard — Microservices — Deploy.</em></strong></p>

<p>Microtica offers configuration options when deploying your microservice in a Kubernetes Cluster.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can select the scaling options, and as well setup continuous delivery for your microservice.</p>



<p>After successfully deploying the microservice in the Kubernetes Cluster you can preview your microservice by following the <strong><em>Access URL/hello-world-ms</em></strong><em> </em>(the name of the service if you’ve changed it). You should see this in your browser window:</p>

<p><strong>AND WE ARE DONE! WE JUST DEPLOYED OUR FIRST MICROSERVICE ON A KUBERNETES CLUSTER 👏</strong></p>

<p>To remove all the resources we created on your AWS account go to environment details and in the menu select <em>Undeploy. </em>As a result, you’ll get your resources created on AWS cleaned. However, you will still have the configuration in Microtica in case you want to deploy it in the cloud again.</p>

In the example below this case is not presented, but it would basically mean that the signatures of all methods in the <code>DB</code> interface perfectly match the ones of the methods from the <code>Client</code> struct exported by the <a href="https://github.com/go-redis/redis">go-redis</a> library. The methods of the <code>DB</code> interface in the example below differ from their counterparts from the <em>go-redis</em> library in the return type: they return plain Go <code>error</code> instead of <em>go-redis</em>-specific types and the reson for this is to minimize the code coupling to the 3rd party library.</p><p>A books library that allows storing and loading authors and books using a Redis database.</p><h2 id="boilerplate">Boilerplate</h2><p>Create a folder named <code>injectable-method-definitions</code>, <code>cd</code> into it and initialize it as a Go module by running <code>go mod init injectable-method-definitions</code>.</p><p>Then create the following tree of folders and files:</p><pre><code>internal

July 29, 2020 | https://dataform.co/blog/the-startup-data-stack-starter-pack | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dataform.co/blog/the-startup-data-stack-starter-pack">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Data collection, integration, warehousing, modelling and visualization. What are the options, best of breed products and how much do they all cost.</p><div><div><p>I advise a lot of people on how to build out their data stack, from tiny startups to enterprise companies that are moving to the cloud or from legacy solutions. There are many choices out there, and navigating them all can be tricky. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of your options, trade offs, pricing and some thinking points around which you can make your decision, as well as some personal thoughts on the options.</p>
<h2 id="my-background">My background</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m CTO and co-founder at Dataform, I was previously an engineer at Google, where I spent most of my 6 years there building big data pipelines with internal tools similar to what is now Apache Beam. Dataform is a data modelling platform for cloud data warehouses, and while only one small part of the overall data stack, is often the glue that ties many things together and as a result, we spend a lot of time talking about overall data architecture with customers and prospective clients.</p>
<h2 id="product-recommendation-methodology">Product recommendation methodology</h2>
<p>Itâ€™s impossible for me to give a completely fair trial to every product in this space. In general, Iâ€™ve chosen to highlight products that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have generally high adoption and awareness amongst startups</li>
<li>We generally hear our customers speak highly of</li>
<li>Fit into the ELT model of a data stack</li>
<li>Innovative new products that may not tick the above boxes, I personally believe are worth a mention</li>
</ul>
<p>Where I have significant experience with a product, Iâ€™ll let you know and provide more detail on why. Similarly in one or two cases Iâ€™ve shared my reasons for not recommending them.</p>

<p>There is a prevailing model of a data stack that we consistently see the world moving toward, thatâ€™s probably best summed up by this diagram. This is an ELT architecture (extract, load, transform) as opposed to a more traditional ETL architecture, and can support companies of all sizes (perhaps with the exception of extremely large enterprises).</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.dataform.co/blog/startup-data-stack-starter-pack/etl-vs-elt-elt-architecture.webp" alt="ELT Architecture"></p>
<h2 id="event-data-collection">Event data collection</h2>
<p>How do you collect event data from across all of your different applications, web, app, backend services and send them to other systems or your data warehouse.</p>
<p>Conceptually straightforward, so not much to say here! Event based analytics is usually the easiest place to start and most off the shelf solutions are built around this.</p>
<p>Tracking everything that you want to use for analytics in events avoids needing to join in other data sources at analysis time and lends itself well to product analytics where ordering of events is important to consider.</p>
<h2 id="data-integration">Data integration</h2>
<p>How do you move data between databases and services? There is some overlap with collection here. Typically you need to move data between various places such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>SaaS services &gt; Data warehouse</li>
<li>Production DBs &gt; Data warehouse</li>
<li>Event collection &gt; Data warehouse / SaaS tools / CRMs</li>
<li>Data warehouse &gt; SaaS tools / CRMs</li>
</ul>
<p>For the rest of the article weâ€™ll consider these as two different data integration problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data integration to the warehouse</li>
<li>Data integration to other SaaS products</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-warehouses">Data warehouses</h2>
<p>Where you move all your data to so you can query it together.</p>
<p>A lot about data warehousing has changed over the last 10 years, data warehouses now scale to unprecedented levels. Before Snowflake and BigQuery, organizations with truly massive data would have avoided them due to limited scale, and instead opt for solutions such as Apache Spark, Dataflow, or Hadoop MapReduce like systems.</p>
<p>Warehouses and SQL have many benefits and the scalability limits are (mostly) gone. Additionally with the rise of engineering inspired data modelling tools (such as Dataform), itâ€™s possible to manipulate data via SQL in a well tested, reproducible way.</p>
<p>Weâ€™ve <a href="https://dataform.co/blog/consider-sql-when-writing-your-next-processing-pipeline">written about this change</a> if youâ€™d like more information on why we think the shift towards SQL based warehousing is the right one and how it can help you move quickly, especially as a startup!</p>
<h2 id="data-modelling">Data modelling</h2>
<p>How do you actually transform data from many different sources into a set of clean, well tested data sets? </p>
<p>ELT introduces a new problem, you end up with a data warehouse full of messy datasets from your newly set up data integration tools and no idea how to use them. This is where data modelling comes in, and if you are building a stack with a data warehouse at the center, it needs to be addressed.</p>
<h2 id="data-visualization--analytics">Data visualization &amp; analytics</h2>
<p>Once you sort out all of the above, how do you actually use that data to answer business questions or do advanced analytics?</p>
<p>For any company, and particularly startups understanding how your users use your products, how much time they spend on your app, what your signup and activation rates are like is obviously important.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ll mostly cover the business intelligence and product analytics side of this, and avoid more advanced ML and data science applications as this usually comes afterward.</p>

<p>Once you hit a certain level of complexity, or need complete control over how you join and mutate data before sending it to other systems you probably want to move to a model where the data warehouse becomes your source of truth for business data. This gives you the most power as once all your data is there, you can do pretty much anything with it.</p>
<p>For very early stage startups, <strong>I recommend that you avoid this initially</strong>. Off the shelf product analytics tools will provide you with the insights you need without the extra work during the early stages.</p>
<p>In this model, you typically require just two components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data collection (events)</li>
<li>Visualization / analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>A concrete example of this would be something like:</p>
<p><strong>Segment &gt; Mixpanel / Amplitude / Heap / Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Using a product like <a href="#segment">Segment</a> gives you the flexibility to move that data to your warehouse in the future, if not immediately.</p>
<p>As this is probably something youâ€™ll need to do at some point, Iâ€™d recommend using something that can do this from day one, as moving from something all in one such as Google Analytics to something custom built around a warehouse can be difficult or expensive (Google will charge you a lot of money to move your raw GA data into BigQuery).</p>

<h2 id="data-collection">Data collection</h2>
<p>Data collection products allow you to track events from various apps, and capture user activity, pageviews, clicks, sessions etc. This is not about collecting data from e.g. your production DB (see data integration).</p>
<h3 id="segment"><a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a></h3>
<p><em>The market leader, with some good out the box data integration solutions.</em></p>
<p>Segment is great, and we use it ourselves. Segment is more than just data collection. Their somewhat open-source analytics.js provides unified APIs for tracking events in pretty much any system.</p>
<p>Events from Segment can be sent to your warehouse, but can also be sent straight to other systems, for example Google/Twitter/Facebook/Quora Ads, most major CRMs.</p>
<p>Segment can get really expensive really quickly, particularly for B2C companies with high numbers of monthly tracked users. However as their core APIs are open-source, itâ€™s possible to migrate to your own infrastructure. </p>
<p>Definitely worth mentioning <a href="https://rudderstack.com/">RudderStack</a> here, an open source host it yourself alternative to Segment that uses the same open-source APIs. When your Segment costs start to exceed an engineering salary, this is probably the time to consider such alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="snowplow"><a href="https://snowplowanalytics.com/">Snowplow</a></h3>
<p><em>Event data collection done right, and itâ€™s open-source.</em></p>
<p>Snowplow excels at event data collection, period. It lacks the out of the box data integration solutions of Segment, but arguably has a much more rich feature set when it comes to actual event tracking, such as validation of event schemas.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s open-source, so you can run and manage it yourself if you want to.</p>
<p>Snowplow wonâ€™t help you push data to your CRM or other SaaS products, but there are other options here we discuss below.</p>
<h3 id="all-in-one-solutions">All in one solutions</h3>
<p>Segment and Snowplow are primarily designed for data collection. There are other tools that will help you collect data too, but they are part of what Iâ€™ll call â€œall in oneâ€� data analytics packages. I wonâ€™t cover these here, but have mentioned them below as part of <a href="#data-visualization-and-analytics">Data visualization and analytics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="data-integration-to-the-warehouse">Data integration to the warehouse</h2>
<p>Data integration products allow you to move data from one source to another. This section covers products that help you move data to your warehouse. </p>
<p>Some of these products also act as data transformation tools (traditional ETL). We donâ€™t recommend this approach, preferring a more software engineering (SQL / code based) approach that will scale as you grow out your data team (see <a href="#data-modelling">data modelling</a>).
As a result, our recommendations are for data integration products that are designed with an ELT model in mind.</p>
<p>These products move data from other data sources such as CRMs, Stripe, most popular databases (Mongo, MySQL, Postgres etc) into your warehouse, so you have everything in one place and can join it all together and perform advanced analytics queries on the results.</p>
<h3 id="stitch"><a href="https://www.stitchdata.com/">Stitch</a></h3>
<p><em>The best option for early startups, teams who want to write their own integrations, or value open-source.</em></p>
<p>Recently acquired by Talend, of which Iâ€™ve seen little impact so far - for better or worse. We use them ourselves, and they serve the majority of our integration needs very well.</p>
<p>Simple self service onboarding, reasonable usage based pricing. Open-source core, you can write your own singer taps, and run it yourself.</p>
<h3 id="fivetran"><a href="https://fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a></h3>
<p><em>The best option for those who are willing to pay a little more, or with certain data sources.</em></p>
<p>Historically a more enterprise sales model, recently changed to variable/volume based pricing, and will build adapters for you if you pay them, but moving toward a self-service model. My understanding is Fivetran still nets out as a bit more expensive than Stitch, but they certainly build extremely high quality integrations.</p>
<p>Fivetran makes considerable efforts to normalize data coming from source systems into a more friendly format, whereas Stitch integrations are arguably a bit less intelligent.</p>

<p>Accurate data visualisation is the key to understanding your data well enough to be able to draw valuable business conclusions, based on which you can make truly informed, strategic decisions.</p>
<p>Entire books have been written about how to visualise data properly, what to pay special attention to, how to avoid common mistakes, and how to draw the greatest value from your data.</p>
<p>Our goal in writing this article is to provide you with concrete business use cases, based on our practical knowledge and project experience. In the sections below, you’ll be able to learn more about our customer success stories and the tips we’ve gathered to help you succeed with your data visualisation efforts.</p>
<p>We hope you’ll be able to employ some of our 5 data visualisation best practices to grow your business and increase customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>So, let’s get started!</p>
<h3>1. Your data should always present the context and the audience</h3>
<p><strong>Client Scenario:</strong> “We conducted a marketing campaign and want to check if we succeeded”.</p>
<p>Our client approached us as they wanted to check how effective their marketing campaign efforts were. During initial discussions, it turned out (as it usually does) that the client had a different concept in mind than we did regarding how such a data visualisation dashboard should look like.</p>
<p>The client asked us to generate a list of customers that come back to them as a result of the campaign. In response to this request, we asked them whether they were sure that customers would not have come back themselves but did so only as a result of their campaign. We also wanted to know whether the client was interested in finding out which specific group of customers was the most engaged with the campaign and which target audience wasn’t necessarily interested. And so on…</p>
<p>After the discussion, it turned out that we need to take into account customer movement over time and to prepare two different types of analyses – one dashboard with quick insights that may be shared with the Management team and a second, more in-depth dashboard for the Marketing Manager.</p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> Get to know your audience and their needs – this is always a worthwhile, value-adding effort.</p>
<h3>2. Declutter, declutter, and… declutter!</h3>
<p><strong>Client Scenario:</strong> “We want to transfer our reporting system from one tool to another”.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the client’s request and analysing their existing system, it turned out that the best solution would be to simply declutter the reporting charts.</p>
<p>To do so, we removed gridlines, got rid of 3D effects, omitted the y-axis (points had labels), transposed the graph, put the labels inside the bars, and finally sorted the results.</p>
<p>Here’s a before and after comparison:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/media/d1yl4s44/data_5tips_01-1.png" data-udi="umb://media/4bbff0188bde4efaa3945a87f77d4690" src="https://www.objectivity.co.uk/media/d1yl4s44/data_5tips_01-1.png"></p>
<p>To learn more about decluttering, watch this <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X79o46W5plI" target="_blank" data-anchor="?v=X79o46W5plI">video</a> by Cole Nussbaumer Knafilc.</p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> The more unnecessary visual elements you get rid of, the more profound of an impact you will make.</p>
<h3>3. Use colours wisely</h3>
<p>In another one of our client’s projects, we were tasked with preparing a dashboard which included certain clearly negative connotations (e.g. deaths, breakdowns, waste). When discussing the colour palette with the client, we noticed that they were using green to signify certain data points. Using green is completely fine, however, it’s worth noting that the use of a certain colour should support your story and not distract your reader's attention or send a contradictory message.</p>
<p>When considering the colour palette of your dashboards, there are two key things to take into account. Firstly, colours have the power to affect emotions and, secondly, certain topics are often already naturally associated with specific colours (e.g. the colour green is often used to signalise that something is finished, positive in nature, or increasing). Hence, when coming up with a colour scheme for your data solutions, it’s worth reflecting on these aspects.</p>
<p>Another colour palette tip worth sharing concerns accessibility – some end users could be colour blind, so it’s important to take their needs into consideration.</p>
<p>For additional insights on this topic, check out the “DataViz Debate” by Andy Cotgreave and Andy Kirk – the recording is available <a href="https://www.tableau.com/learn/webinars/data-viz-debate-blue-orange">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> “Colours are the visual property that people most often misuse in visualisation without being aware of it.” – Robert Kosara, Senior Research Scientist at Tableau Software.</p>
<h3>4. Less is more</h3>
<p>One of our clients asked us to prepare the data source for one of their departments. Before jumping into the project, we analysed their request and asked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why do you need so much data?</li>
<li>Would you be able to get any insight out of this quickly?</li>
<li>Are you not getting lost in this data?</li>
</ul>
<p>The conclusion was as follows: the client had two data sources and needed to compare the data between them. The first dataset was ready, but we would need to prepare the second one (there was a group of people doing the comparison manually). That’s the entire story in a nutshell.</p>
<p>In such a situation, why not to do the whole comparison automatically then measure and visualise the differences and not the whole dataset? This approach may seem to suggest that the client would be getting less (as they wouldn’t be getting the whole dataset), but I believe that they would actually be able to gain more, by getting the most fit-for-purpose solution.</p>
<p>Before/After:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/media/dfsmfvqy/data_5tips_01.png" data-udi="umb://media/d6c2641f5618464cacbf42b2ee544f31" src="https://www.objectivity.co.uk/media/dfsmfvqy/data_5tips_01.png"></p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> It’s always a good idea to ask why.</p>
<h3>5. Choose the most informative way to visualise data</h3>
<p>We were asked to prepare a dashboard on the progress of projects by another one of our clients. We received a list of measures that should be displayed. At the beginning, it seemed to them that they need several line charts with the possibility to filter by project. But then, during the discussion, we agreed that it would be too cumbersome to draw any conclusions on the portfolio level from such visualisations.</p>
<p>We decided to introduce relationship charts and rankings to enable the end user to draw conclusions and move from the more general information to the more detailed data.</p>
<p>After:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-src="/media/qfeo0gm3/data_5tips_03.png" data-udi="umb://media/19ed4887da9d461091472cf73e55d6cb" src="https://www.objectivity.co.uk/media/qfeo0gm3/data_5tips_03.png"></p>
<p>There are many articles and blog posts on what and how to choose in terms of data visualisation (e.g. <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.datapine.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-data-visualization-types/" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://www.sqlbi.com/ref/power-bi-visuals-reference/">here</a>).</p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> One wisely selected chart can replace a huge table, while enabling users to draw conclusions more quickly.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>When preparing data visualisations and analyses, you must be careful because you can quite easily destroy all the information that should be understood by the end user. Fortunately, however, there are many methods, tips, and best practices that can help you avoid this failure.</p>
<ul>
<li>To optimise the meeting of requirements and the drawing of conclusions, it’s important to keep the context and the audience in mind.</li>
<li>By decluttering visualisations, you provide the end user with the opportunity to draw more accurate conclusions.</li>
<li>Consider the colour scheme carefully as it should support the story you have in your dashboard.</li>
<li>Provide only as much information on your data visualisation as the client needs, in the most legible and informative manner.</li>
<li>Try to achieve results that will prove the most useful and advantageous for the business by choosing the most appropriate visualisations.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re anything like me, you try to learn new things constantly. You read books, watch educational Youtube clips, read interesting blogs, and listen to podcasts. </p>



<p>You might have a system for collecting what you learn from many of these sources. Perhaps you highlight your Kindle books, sketch in your physical books, or you copy/paste blog post takeaways into Roam, Notion or some other Personal Knowledge Management system. But taking notes from podcasts has always been a hassle. Do you stop in the middle of your walk to jot down a note? Do you take a screenshot with an intention to return to this part of the podcast later (which never happens)? Do you try to force your brain to remember it until you’re back at your computer?</p>



<p><strong>I have struggled with this for years, and I’ve finally found an elegant solution to the problem in a wonderful new podcast iOS app called <a href="http://airr.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airr</a>. </strong></p>



<p>Airr may look like any regular podcast player out there, but it has one killer feature that sets it apart from all the others: <strong>it lets you collect snippets of any ongoing podcast, with a single tap, <em>as you are listening</em>! </strong>These snippets are called “AirrQuotes”, and you can think of them as book highlights for the podcast format. </p>



<p>This is how it works: let’s say you are walking around and listening to <a href="http://perell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Perell</a>‘s North Star podcast, for example <a href="https://www.airr.io/episode/5f037b9bc7fd2b4d918d6d54" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the episode where David interviews Partick McKenzie, the co-founder of Stripe</a>. Almost nine minutes in, Patrick says something very smart about why you should start writing online despite having zero people following you, because it can lead to great things down the line. You want to save this for later, for example because you want to use it in a blog post (like this one!). In that case you simply ask Siri to <em>“Take an AirrQuote”</em>, which trigges Airr to save the last 45 seconds you just heard in the podcast episode. </p>



<p><strong>This AirrQuote is then saved in the Airr app, and you can return back to it later, for example when you are in front of your computer and you’re ready to add your AirrQuotes to Roam or your note-taking system of choice. </strong></p>



<p>Let’s say you listen to the entire podcast episode, and you take AirrQuotes this whenever David or Patrick drops some wisdom bombs into your ears, like I did. After the episode is over, I have 5 AirrQuotes that I want to remember or refer back to. </p>



<p>When I’m at my computer, I simply open the Airr app on my phone, select all the AirrQuotes from the episode, and click Share. I can copy links to all the AirrQuotes, and paste the link directly into my Macbook, and it comes out like this:</p>



<ul><li>45s AirrQuote: <a href="https://www.airr.io/quote/5f0732bdd1e72c0d0c903daf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://www.airr.io/quote/5f0732bdd1e72c0d0c903daf</a></li><li>45s AirrQuote: <a href="https://www.airr.io/quote/5f07372dd1e72c2cce903dc3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://www.airr.io/quote/5f07372dd1e72c2cce903dc3</a></li><li>45s AirrQuote: <a href="https://www.airr.io/quote/5f073e17d1e72c5cfb903e9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">https://www.airr.io/quote/5f073e17d1e72c5cfb903e9e</a> (and so on, for as many AirrQuotes as I took during the episode).</li></ul>



<p>Those links all point directly to the parts of the podcast episode that I have highlighted (I’ve made them public so you can listen to them if you want, just click the links above). Now I can simply re-listen to each AirrQuote and type what I hear directly into my note-taking app of choice. No need to listen to the entire episode again to re-discover my key takeaways. No need to try to remember all the points as I listen the first time. It’s all right there. </p>



<h2>Export with text</h2>



<p>If that weren’t enough, Airr has another amazing feature: podcast transcription export. For many podcasts, <strong>Airr provides a transcribed text from the podcast audio, so you can simply export your AirrQuotes in text format directly into your notes.</strong> These transcriptions are computer generated, so they aren’t perfect, but they still save you 90% of the time compared to writing out each note yourself. You just have to edit them for clarity and brevity, which is a good thing because working with the text will boost your retention rate. </p>



<h2>Share AirrQuotes with friends</h2>



<p>Another fun feature in Airr is the ability to share AirrQuotes with friends. Instead of saying <em>“Hey you HAVE to listen to this podcast, it’s so great! Check out the 5, 8 and 32 minute mark!”</em>, you can simply send a quick audio clip to a friend which makes it self-explanatory why he should listen to the episode. </p>



<p>These AirrQuotes can be shared either with a link to the clip (as I showed above), or they can be turned into engaging video clips that are even more fun to share. </p>



<p>Here’s one example from a podcast episode where TOMS Shoes founder Blake Mycoskie is interviewed about his personality type, which I had to send to a close friend who shares some of Blake’s personality traits. </p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://jacobmorch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Blake-Mykoskie-Typology-podcast-Enneagram-7.mp4"></video><figcaption>Blake Mycoskie, founder of TOMS, talking about his personality type as an Enneagram 7 (The Enthusiast)</figcaption></figure>



<h2>See what your Twitter connections have AirrQuoted</h2>



<p>Airr also integrates with Twitter, so you can see the AirrQuotes taken by the people you follow, and share your own AirrQuotes if you want. As Airr grows and gets more users, this will be more and more interesting. This could become the first podcast suggestion engine that serves me things I am actually interested in, much like a well-curated Twitter feed. </p>



<p>What do the people I admire find interesting? Which shows do they listen to? What specific takeaways do they highlight from the episodes they listen to? Their AirrQuotes will show me. </p>

<h2>Take an AirrQuote with just a tap on your AirPods (or other headphones)</h2>



<p>Airr keeps improving with every new release, and the most recent feature that blew me away was a new shortcut for capturing AirrQuotes when I’m on the move. There are three ways to take an AirrQuote in Airr:</p>



<ol><li>Open your phone, open the Airr app and click the quote symbol (high friction),</li><li>Ask Siri to “take an AirrQuote” while listening to a podcast (medium friction).</li><li>Double-tap your left AirPod when listening to a podcast in Airr (extremely low friction). </li></ol>



<p>This third method is simply brilliant. I can now easily capture AirrQuotes with a single tap on my AirPods while driving, walking around or while doing the dishes. </p>



<p>(Note: this feature also works with other headphones, in most cases with a triple click on the play/pause button. This is the command that usually leads to jumping back to the previous song in music apps, or jumping back 30 seconds in most podcast and audiobook apps). </p>



<h2>Bonus tip: Change the Siri command</h2>



<p>One thing I struggled with before the tap your Airpods feature came out, was that Siri would hear my attempts to say <em>“Take an AirrQuote”</em> as <em>“Take an airport”</em>, and be very confused. I changed the Siri command to <em>“Take a podcast quote”</em> instead, and then it worked every time. I recommend you do something similar if you want to use Siri for taking AirrQuotes.</p>



<h2>Bonus tip 2: Export AirrQuotes directly to Roam: </h2>



<p>I found this tip on twitter, posted by Sam Rukeyser, one of the founders of Airr. He has made an iOS shortcut that lets you dump your AirrQuotes directly into Roam from your phone. </p>



<p>See his process in this tweet:  </p>



<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Inspired by <a href="https://twitter.com/mg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@mg</a> to create an iOS shortcut to Copy an AirrQuote into <a href="https://twitter.com/RoamResearch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@RoamResearch</a>. Opens Quick Capture from Airr’s in-app browser, no need to switch apps. <a href="https://t.co/U3UPCLZwFL" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/U3UPCLZwFL</a></p>— Sam Rukeyser (@SamRukeyser) <a href="https://twitter.com/SamRukeyser/status/1279143460574916609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 3, 2020</a></blockquote> 



<h2>Room for improvement</h2>



<p>Airr is a fantastic app, but it’s still not perfect. Sometimes I experience a bug where the play button doesn’t work, and I’m patiently awaiting the day I can export the transcriptions from multiple AirrQuotes at once, which I guess the Airr team has on their roadmap for the future. </p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Despite this minor issues, the bottom line is this: <strong>Airr is hands down the best podcast players for people who want to remember what they hear, take notes from podcasts, or share interesting podcast moments with friends.</strong> </p>



<p>I look forwards to taking loads and loads of AirrQuotes going forwards. If you do too, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="let's connect on Twitter (opens in a new tab)" href="https://twitter.com/JMorch" target="_blank">let’s connect on Twitter</a>, so we can see each others’ quotes!</p>

<![CDATA[A new funding model for open source]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><blockquote><p>Join the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23981563">HN discussion</a>!</p></blockquote><p>The existing open-source funding models don't work well for small projects.</p><p>Big projects —&nbsp;operating systems, frameworks, CMSs, or fully self-hostable applications — are in a privileged position to extract more value from their users, especially corporate ones. Since entire APIs and products are built on top of them, they inspire enough appreciation (or, more likely, fear of obsolescence!) to net a sustainable income from one-off or monthly donations.¹</p><p>But most OSS projects aren't big. The typical project on GitHub is better described as a <strong>utility</strong> — an apt term, given the <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/learning/research-reports/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">infrastructural role</a> these projects play in the world. It is a small tool that does one thing really well. Over the course of building a complex application, you may end up using dozens of these utilities — and they'll save you hundreds of hours of development time. </p><p>Unfortunately, utilities like these rarely bring in any meaningful amount of money from donations, no matter how widely used or beloved they are. Consider <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">react-router</a>. Even with 41.3k stars on GitHub, 3M weekly downloads from NPM, and nearly universal adoption in React-based single-page applications, it only brings in <a href="https://opencollective.com/react-router">~$17k</a> of donations annually. </p><p>The root of the problem is that open-source donations are made on a per-project basis². To support a project via GitHub Sponsors or OpenCollective, you must create yet another auto-renewing monthly subscription for each project you want to support. Moreover, at the moment of truth (<em>"I'm gonna sponsor X!"</em>) it's easy to "logic" yourself out of donating (<em>"But what if it gets replaced by some new hotness next week?!"</em>). This has a huge dampening effect on total donations to open source. And in the end, only the projects that are massively, insanely, indisputably useful get funded. And those projects are usually the "big stuff" — frameworks, self-hostable software, etc.</p><p>A new model is needed; one that works for the small- and medium-sized projects, not just the huge ones. So I propose a novel(-ish) approach to OSS sustainability. </p><h2>Introducing "sponsor pools"</h2><ol><li>Every month, you donate some amount into a "wallet".</li><li>Your funds are then distributed to the projects in your "sponsor pool". Your sponsor pool is just the set of open-source projects you want to support.</li><li>Adding new projects to your pool should require <strong>one click</strong> —&nbsp;as easy as starring the repo on GitHub.</li></ol><p>That's it. It's hardly ingenious, which is why it's surprising that no major player in OSS has implemented it for facilitating open source donations.³</p><p>This would achieve the holy grail of OSS sustainability: the one-click sponsorship.⁴ Once a person has funded their sponsor pool, it would take <em>a single click</em> to financially support another project. <mark>The marginal cost — both psychological and financial — of supporting additional projects would drop to zero.</mark> That's a game changer.</p><h3>Why this works better</h3><p>Why do I think this will dramatically increase the total amount donated to open source? To answer that, consider a hypothetical question.</p><p><em>How much of your income would you be willing to donate to open-source software every year?</em></p><p>I suspect the typical overpaid HN lurker reading this post (👋) came up with a number in the hundreds of dollars. Compare that with how much you’re actually donating — is there a difference? There is for me. <mark>That's because there's currently no way to make a donation to the abstract concept of "open source software".</mark> But with sponsor pools, donation amounts will reflect an honest answer to the question posed above.</p><h3>GitHub</h3><p>The best case scenario, in my opinion, is for GitHub to natively support this model as an extension of GitHub Sponsors. It's where most projects live so it's best positioned to create a zero-friction donation system like this.</p><p>Of course, if GitHub implemented something like this, they would likely divorce the donation mechanism from stars. Perhaps instead, users who have created and funded a sponsor pool can be presented with an "Add to Pool" button in place of the current "Sponsor" button.</p><p><img alt="Add to pool button" src="https://vriad.com/add_to_pool.png"></p><p>GitHub has a financial incentive to switch to this approach — sort of. They're currently eating the cost of all processing fees for transactions on GitHub Sponsors. So if you sponsor a project at $1/mo, the maintainer gets $1/mo...and GitHub pays $0.30 to the credit card companies. Larger donation sizes means GitHub pays a proportionally smaller amount as fees.</p><p>Note that I said <em>proportionally smaller</em>. If more total donations are being processed (which is the goal of this proposal!), they may still end up paying more in total fees, even if the ratio of fees-to-donations is smaller. If the sponsor pool concept is massively successful —&nbsp;say, cumulative donations of $1B annually — GitHub will be eating nearly $20M in card fees. I suspect that would ruffle some feathers at Microsoft.</p><p>As a final addendum —&nbsp;I'd love to see embeddable "badges" that are unlocked at different levels of donorship.&nbsp;Imagine a world where you see a "GitHub Sponsor Gold Badge" in the footer of someone’s website, indicating that they donate, say, $1000+ annually to open source. Clicking on this badge would bring you to a trusted site that lets you verify the claim. Here's my quick-and-dirty attempt at a badge design:</p><p><img alt="order of the gold octocat" src="https://vriad.com/gold_octocat.jpg"></p><p>Some may cry "virtue signaling" but approaches like this are a proven way to establish positive reinforcement loops that a) increase awareness and b) encourage more folks to donate to open source.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>This is a hard problem with a vast array of potential solutions. I don't mean to criticize any existing approaches; they've all done a lot for maintainers, including myself, and I don't mean to minimize that. There may also be major implementational or regulatory hurdles to building something like this that I'm not aware of. This is merely a hypothetical exercise.</p><p><em>My name is Colin and write proposals like this one every month or so. Put your email in the box to get future proposals delivered to your inbox. ✌️</em></p></div><div><p><em>Alternatively follow me <a href="https://twitter.com/vriad">on Twitter</a> or subscribe to <a href="https://vriad.com/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>.</em></p><h3>Footnotes</h3><blockquote><p>¹ Some examples of financially successful large projects.</p><ul><li>operating systems: Red Hat, Elementary OS</li><li>frameworks: Livewire, Next.js </li><li>CMSs: Ghost, Wordpress</li><li>Full-featured applications: Sentry, Blender, Discourse</li></ul></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>² It's worth noting that currently GitHub Sponsorships actually correspond to a given user or organization, NOT a particular repository or project. </p><p>I think it's important that the sponsorship pools themselves are comprised of projects, <em>not</em> users or organizations. This gets complicated if multiple entities/organizations are listed as the maintainers of a particular project. There would need to be a mechanism in place to split the incoming donation money among the set of maintainers as they see fit.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>³ It's been pointed out to me that <a href="https://flattr.com/">Flattr</a> uses this exact model! Unfortunately they're not intended for open source software specifically and simply don't have enough awareness to really move the needle. For this model to reach it's potential, it needs to be implemented by a visible, trusted, established player.</p><p>Other organizations trying interesting things: <a href="https://snowdrift.coop/">Snowdrift</a> ("crowdmatching"...very cool concept), <a href="https://flossbank.com/">Flossbank</a> (a Tidelift-like model), <a href="https://gitcoin.co/">Gitcoin</a>.</p></blockquote><br><blockquote><p>⁴ The even holier grail: a zero click sponsorship! An example of this approach is <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave Browser's</a> token-based micropayments system. Brave lets you fund your "wallet" with various cryptocurrencies, which are then distributed to creators proportional to the time you spend on their site.</p><p>It’s a great idea, but surveillance is necessary to gather the requisite information. This is implemented ethically by Brave, but that’s only possible because they control the full browser experience. For this to work across browsers would require an extension with full access to your browsing patterns. So probably a non-starter.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]>

July 29, 2020 | https://bojanvidanovic.com/posts/moving-away-from-pocket-to-my-hugo-website-and-firefox-bookmarks/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bojanvidanovic.com/posts/moving-away-from-pocket-to-my-hugo-website-and-firefox-bookmarks/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’ve been using <a href="https://getpocket.com/" title="Pocket">Pocket</a> for the last few years, actually moved from <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/" title="Instapaper">Instapaper</a> after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17387146/instapaper-gdpr-europe-access-shut-down-privacy-changes" title="GDPR incident">GDPR incident</a>, and I’ve been happy ever since. But I decided to move all of my public links to my static website. The reason for this has nothing to do with the company, I think they offer a great service for free. It is just I never liked that another company owns my data, especially in this case when a service is easily replaceable by a simple note-taking app.</p>
<p>So how am I going to replace Pocket? Well, all my favorite links will be exported from Pocket to a <a href="https://bojanvidanovic.com/bookmarks" title="dedicated page">dedicated page</a> on my website and will be publicly available, as on the <a href="https://getpocket.com/@bojanvidanovic" title="Pocket profile">Pocket profile</a> page. Then I’ll manage all my future links through Git or <a href="https://forestry.io/" title="CMS">CMS</a>. While the read-it-later type of links will be bookmarked in <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarks-firefox" title="Firefox">Firefox</a> and synced across all my devices, which I’ve been already using for a while and find it much easier to use.</p>
<h3 id="exporting-data-from-pocket">Exporting data from Pocket</h3>
<p>Requesting your data from Pocket is a one-click operation, the problem is that they don’t give you any options on what file type you want. All your data is by default exported in an HTML file with a bunch of list items.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">    &lt;<span>ul</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>li</span>&gt;&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"https://jmperezperez.com/assess-performance-impact/"</span> <span>time_added</span><span>=</span><span>"1595837017"</span> <span>tags</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>&gt;How to Estimate Web Performance Impact Before Making Fixes - José M. Pérez&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>li</span>&gt;&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"https://increment.com/frontend/ask-an-expert-why-is-css-the-way-it-is/"</span> <span>time_added</span><span>=</span><span>"1595518932"</span> <span>tags</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>&gt;Ask an expert: Why is CSS . . . the way it is? – Increment: Frontend&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>li</span>&gt;&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"https://alexnixon.github.io/2019/12/10/writing.html"</span> <span>time_added</span><span>=</span><span>"1595403017"</span> <span>tags</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>&gt;It&amp;#039;s time to start writing&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;
    &lt;<span>li</span>&gt;&lt;<span>a</span> <span>href</span><span>=</span><span>"https://tim.blog/podcast/"</span> <span>time_added</span><span>=</span><span>"1594717067"</span> <span>tags</span><span>=</span><span>""</span>&gt;Podcast — The Tim Ferriss Show – The Blog of Author Tim Ferriss&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;&lt;/<span>li</span>&gt;
    ...
    &lt;/<span>ul</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="converting-to-json">Converting to JSON</h3>
<p>So, I slightly modified the exported HTML file to use dataset attributes for tags like time_added and tags, copied it to <a href="https://codepen.io/" title="Codepen">Codepen</a> and ran this code to get the list in JSON format:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript">    <span>var</span> <span>list</span> <span>=</span> [];
    
    <span>$</span>(<span>'ul a'</span>).<span>each</span>(<span>function</span>(<span>idx</span>, <span>item</span>){
        <span>list</span>.<span>push</span>({
            <span>href</span><span>:</span> <span>$</span>(<span>item</span>).<span>attr</span>(<span>'href'</span>),
            <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span>.<span>textContent</span>,
            <span>date</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span>.<span>dataset</span>.<span>date</span>,
            <span>tags</span><span>:</span> <span>item</span>.<span>dataset</span>.<span>tags</span>
        });
    });
    
    <span>JSON</span>.<span>stringify</span>(<span>list</span>, <span>null</span>, <span>"  "</span>);
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="importing-to-static-website">Importing to static website</h3>
<p>After obtaining the list in JSON format, I needed to create a Markdown file for every entry in the JSON file. This is where the Python magic comes in:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">    <span>import</span> json
    
    f <span>=</span> open(<span>'export.json'</span>)
    data <span>=</span> json<span>.</span>load(f)
    
    <span>for</span> link <span>in</span> data:
        filename <span>=</span> link[<span>"text"</span>]<span>.</span>lower()<span>.</span>replace(<span>" "</span>, <span>"-"</span>)<span>.</span>replace(<span>"?"</span>,  <span>""</span>)<span>.</span>replace(<span>"/"</span>, <span>"-"</span>)
        <span>with</span> open(filename <span>+</span> <span>".md"</span>, <span>"w"</span>) <span>as</span> md_file:
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'---</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'title: "'</span> <span>+</span> link[<span>"text"</span>]<span>.</span>encode(<span>'utf-8'</span>) <span>+</span> <span>'"</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'date: '</span> <span>+</span> link[<span>"date"</span>] <span>+</span> <span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'linkUrl: '</span> <span>+</span> link[<span>"href"</span>] <span>+</span> <span>'</span><span>\n</span><span>'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>write(<span>'---'</span>)
            md_file<span>.</span>close()
    
    f<span>.</span>close()</code></pre></div>
<p>This simple script created a Markdown file for Hugo for every link from the list.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As you can see, with a few simple scripts I have back my data and transferred to my <a href="https://gohugo.io/" title="Hugo">Hugo</a> website. And replaced the core Pocket functionality with Firefox bookmarks.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>Winamp was published by Nullsoft in 1997 as the public supported multimedia player and was a pioneer as well as a disruptor in the Internet space. Lead by Justin and other developers, Winamp soon became one of the most revolutionary applications of its kind. Nullsoft, acquired by AOL in 1999, also published SHOUTcast, Gnutella and NSIS. Winamp was an early leader in community developed programs and helped to spawn the open source software movement for music. You can drop by the team &amp; alumni pages to learn more about the people responsible for creating the player, turning out new revs, maintaining the website, and fostering relations with the developer community.</p>
<p>Winamp is one of the most popular multimedia players allowing users to manage and play audio and video files. Winamp supports playback of 70 audio and video formats, and is available in two versions: Winamp Standard and Winamp Pro. To name a few, it features robust tools for creating playlists, customizing your playback experience (aka “skinning”), managing podcasts, syncing portable devices, listening to internet radio stations, and accessing remote media (Winamp Remote).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mywinamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Winamp-Review.gif"><img src="http://www.mywinamp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Winamp-Review.gif" alt="Winamp-Review" width="550" height="231"></a></p>
<p>The Winamp Pro version provides you with several additional features like mp3 ripping, high speed audio CD burning/ripping, extra-small file size encoding with AACPlus, and native support for H.264 encoded video. If you have not tried this multimedia player, downloading the Winamp must be your first stop.<br>
At its core Winamp is all about individuality and customization, that’s why we offer add-ons to extend functionality beyond the original design. Thanks to the efforts of the development community, Winamp offers over 10,000 add-ons including skins, plug-ins, visualizations &amp; online services.</p>
<h3>Skins:</h3>
<p>In addition to its breadth of features and support of high fidelity playback, one of Winamp’s main differentiators is its skin-able interface. This level of customization gives you the control to reflect your own individual personality. To date the Winamp community has created over 8,000 skins. Browse our gallery to find one that fits your taste, or if you are the DIY type, make your own.</p>
<h3>Plug-ins:</h3>
<p>A Plug-in extends the functionality of Winamp and allows you to add just about anything to your Winamp player including equalizers, additional codecs, language packs, games and more. There are over 3000 community developed plug-ins to choose from, so you can browse the plug-in gallery or make your own.</p>
<h3>Visualizations:</h3>
<p>You can also bring your music to life with any one of Winamp’s world renowned visualizations. Essentially they’re dynamic add-ons that produce images, colors, and textures that change based on elements of the music being played. There are nearly 2,800 presets available for download in our visualization gallery. As a side note, the creator of Milkdrop (one of the two visualization platforms in Winamp) in Ryan Geiss. Ryan who now works for Microsoft, is a core developer of the human-tracking algorithms for Xbox 360’s Kinect. Explore our Winamp visualization gallery and select the best one.</p>
<p>If it isn’t clear already, we’ll say it again… we love our user community! Be sure to support them by downloading and using their add-ons — be it a new skin, a tweaked out visualization, an online service, a plug-in, or one of the 30 different language packs. Winamp is for people who like to customize: offering the widest range of extensions, skins, plugins, and Internet services. If you like the add-on, give them some feedback by reviewing, rating, or leaving a comment.</p>

    <article id="content">
      <p>The Portable Document Format (PDF) was invented in the early 1990s and it’s still thriving. But PDFs are mainly for humans – not machines. So it’s often hard to automatically extract information out of PDFs. Besides, more and more functionalities were put into PDF. The complexity of the format makes it hard to get started. But there are existing, well-established software tools. Some have been around for decades. In this blog post, I review some existing tools with the focus on Python. Python is the default language for data processing right now.</p>
<h2 id="pdf-utilitysystem-libraries">PDF Utility/System Libraries</h2>
<p>There are some PDF libraries that power PDF Viewers but can also be used to work on PDFs from the command line.</p>

<li><a href="https://poppler.freedesktop.org/">poppler</a>: Used for the vast majority of Linux-based PDF viewers, Libre Office, etc. ‘poppler-utils’ is a collection of tools built upon poppler, e.g. ‘pdftotext’.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mupdf.com/index.html">mutool</a>: The library is used for an alternative, lightweight PDF viewer.</li>
<li><a href="http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/">qpdf</a>: Not a fully-fledged PDF library, mainly to manipulate PDFs.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/">pdftk</a> (unmaintained, <a href="https://gitlab.com/pdftk-java/pdftk">here a maintained Java re-implementation</a>)</li>

	    	    				    		      	    	<p>What is the right strategy to achieve greatness and succeed in a specific domain? If you believe the predominant narrative in many efficiency-oriented societies today, the answer is clear: Focus on one thing early in life to have a head start and invest at least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/21/practice-does-not-always-make-perfect-violinists-10000-hour-rule">the famous 10,000 hours of practice</a> to become a master at it. Excellence and ingenuity, the story goes, are a result of hyperspecialization, grit, and relentless focus. Except this might actually not be true.</p>

<p>In “<a href="https://davidepstein.com/the-range/">Range</a>,” David Epstein tells a different story: Neither is an early head start and narrow specialization necessary to achieve greatness, as he demonstrates with several examples from Roger Federer, who played many different sports like skiing, basketball, and soccer as a child until settling for a career in tennis, to the “figlie di coro,” the virtuoso musicians of eighteenth-century Venice, who played not only the violin but also several other instruments like the cello, oboe, lute, mandolin, harpsichord, and “viola d’amore”. Nor is hyperspecialization the primary source of creativity, innovative ideas, and scientific breakthroughs later in life. From Vincent Van Gogh to Django Reinhardt to several inventors and Nobel laureates, the book is full of gripping stories and thought-provoking research showing that mental meandering, personal experimentation, and cross-disciplinary thinking are sources of power, creativity, and true innovation.</p>

<p><em>Range</em> is a powerful reminder that there is a place for the generalists, the curios polymaths, among us. That it is okay, also for your children, to go broad and try different paths until you find what really fits you – and who you really are. That when you face a “wicked” problem, diverse experience beyond the boundaries of a specific field is a huge advantage because it allows you to think outside the box. And that having range can be invaluable in connecting seemingly unrelated disciplines and concepts in new ways.</p>

<p>Like many other domains, the web industry is becoming more and more specialized. And many of us seem to believe that only by becoming specialists ourselves, we can keep up with the increasing complexity and diversity of the Web and its countless technologies. We invent ever more specific positions and job titles, read ever more specific books, and go to ever more specific conferences. And so you have to decide: Are you a designer or a developer? Front-end or back-end? Front of the front-end or back of the front-end? CSS or JavaScript? Angular or React? And <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">the gaps between the disciplines are growing</a>.</p>

<p>Yet, many of us out there are allrounders who love to tinker, prototype, experiment, and build. Many of us are interested in the most diverse topics and feel most at home at the interfaces between design, technology, and the arts. And, as David Epstein shows, the more a domain specializes, the more it depends on generalists who see the bigger picture and make connections specialists are unable to see. Research suggests that broad individuals can even be more valuable than a diverse group of specialists. So the next time someone calls you a “Jack of all trades, master of none,” gift them a copy of <em>Range</em>.</p>

<p>Being a generalist is not a sign of weakness – it is a sign of strength. And, with <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/frontend-design/">job titles like Front-end Designer emerging</a>, it seems as if the industry is slowly recognizing this. So embrace your seemingly unimportant and inefficient interests. Paint, dance, code, run, read, write, sing, play, and dabble. And let nobody tell you that a designer shouldn’t write production code or a developer can’t also be a brilliant writer. If you are a generalist, be a generalist. It is who you are.</p>

July 29, 2020 | https://www.soft8soft.com/verge3d-3-3-for-blender-released/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.soft8soft.com/verge3d-3-3-for-blender-released/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We are excited to present a new release of Verge3D for Blender, an artist-friendly toolkit for creating 3D web interactives. Version 3.3 significantly speeds up the loading and the overall performance of your apps, introduces a code-less way to export Verge3D scenes to glTF format, and implements dynamic canvas textures. This release also brings several new Puzzles, many consistency improvements to the exporter plugin, support for Woocommerce’s global product attributes and many more features and improvements the full list of which you can find below.</p><h2>Loading Speed</h2><p>For this release we addressed user concerns regarding the loading speed of their applications. As such, we performed a series of optimizations for shader compilation, which is often the bottleneck for loading. As a result, we managed to achieve a significant acceleration of loading (up to 3 times for some scenes).</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-128x72.jpg 128w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2-600x338.jpg 600w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/loading-time-optimization2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div><p>The optimizations included:</p><ul><li>introduced parallel shader compilation, especially effective if the <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/KHR_parallel_shader_compile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KHR_parallel_shader_compile</a> WebGL extension is present (before shaders were compiled one by one)</li><li>optimized the shader that represents the environment lighting</li><li>optimized the shaders that relate to real-time shadows</li><li>optimized the material shaders</li><li>loading stages restructured to smooth and speed up the overall loading process</li></ul><p>Some of these optimizations also improved Verge3D’s rendering performance, especially noticeable on low-end hardware or mobile devices.</p><h2>glTF export</h2><p>You can now export objects, groups of objects or entire scenes in glTF format. Both .gltf or .glb (binary) options are available.</p><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/puzzle-export-gltf.jpg" alt="glTF export puzzle"></figure><p>This puzzle is capable of saving configurated objects from your applications.</p><p>For best results, as well as for creating standard glTF files (without Soft8Soft/Verge3D extensions) that can be viewed by third-party glTF viewers (such as Microsoft Windows 10’s default glTF viewer), we recommend you to use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/docs/manual/en/introduction/FAQ.html#gltf_materials" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">glTF-compatible materials</a>.</p><h2>Camera Tweening Trajectory</h2><p>You can now choose the <em>spherical trajectory</em> with the <strong>tween camera</strong> puzzle. Spherical trajectory means that the camera will orbit around the pivot to a new position using the interpolated distance as radius.</p><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tween-camera-trajectory.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tween-camera-trajectory.jpg 635w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tween-camera-trajectory-300x72.jpg 300w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tween-camera-trajectory-600x145.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px"><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure><p>This is especially helpful when the new point of view is located behind the model. The spherical trajectory, which is natural for Orbit cameras, thus may prevent unpleasant intersections with the model on its way.</p><p>In addition, the <strong>tween camera</strong> puzzle now accepts coordinates alongside objects. Coordinates can be provided to this puzzle as lists or vectors.</p><h2>Canvas Textures</h2><p>The HTML canvas can now be used as a material texture. A&nbsp;<code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>&nbsp;element can be created using the newly introduced HTML puzzle&nbsp;<strong>create canvas elem</strong>, and assigned as a material texture as usual, i.e. with the&nbsp;<strong>replace texture</strong>&nbsp;puzzle.</p><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/canvas-puzzle.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>Once created, the canvas becomes available for drawing on it via JavaScript. You can update the canvas inside the&nbsp;<code>runCode()</code>&nbsp;function of&nbsp;<em>your_app_name.js</em>&nbsp;module. To do this, retrieve the canvas texture by its ID specified in the puzzle:</p><div id="crayon-5f255ebf2f45a277462564" data-settings=" minimize scroll-mouseover"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>var</span><span> </span><span>canvasTex</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>v3d</span><span>.</span><span>puzzles</span><span>.</span><span>canvasTextures</span><span>[</span><span>'my_canvas'</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>After that, you can access the HTML canvas element as follows:</p><div id="crayon-5f255ebf2f47b394879003" data-settings=" minimize scroll-mouseover"><div><table><tbody><tr><td data-settings="show"></td><td><div><p><span>var</span><span> </span><span>canvas</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>canvasTex</span><span>.</span><span>image</span><span>;</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>You can use the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_reference.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">standard methods</a>&nbsp;available for drawing on the HTML canvas.

But it’s the hardware that’s letting it down.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The goal of this post is to review well-adopted ideas that have stood the test of time. I will present a small set of techniques that cover a lot of basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research. If you're new to the field, these are a great starting point.</p><div id="post-content"><p>Deep Learning is an extremely fast-moving field and the huge number of research papers and ideas can be overwhelming. Even seasoned researchers have a hard time telling company PR from real breakthroughs. The goal of this post is to review those ideas that have <strong>stood the test of time</strong>, which is perhaps the only significance test one should rely on. These ideas, or improvements of them, have been used over and over again. They're known to work.</p> <p>If you were to start in Deep Learning today, understanding and implementing each of these techniques would give you an excellent foundation for understanding recent research and working on your own projects. It's what I believe the best way to get started. Working through papers in historical order is also a useful exercise to understand where the current techniques come from and why they were invented in the first place. <strong><strong>Put another way, I will try to present a <em>minimal set</em> of ideas that most of the basic knowledge necessary to understand modern Deep Learning research.</strong></strong></p> <p>A rather unique thing about Deep Learning is that its application domains (Vision, Natural Language, Speech, RL, etc) share the majority of techniques. For example, someone who has worked in Deep Learning for Computer Vision his whole career could quickly be productive in NLP research. The specific network architectures may differ, but the concepts, approaches and code are mostly the same. I will try to present ideas from various fields, but there are a few caveats about this list:</p> <ul> <li>My goal is not to give in-depth explanations or code examples for these techniques. It's not easily possible to summarize long complex papers into a single paragraph. Instead, I will give a brief overview of each technique, its historical context, and links to papers and implementations. If you want to learn something, I <em>highly recommend</em> trying to re-produce some of these paper results from scratch in raw <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> without using existing code bases or high-level libraries.</li> <li>The list is biased towards my own knowledge and the fields I am familiar with. There are many exciting subfields that I don't have experience with. I will stick to what most people would consider the popular mainstream domains of Vision, Natural Language, Speech, and Reinforcement Learning / Games.</li> <li>I will only discuss research that has official or semi-official open source implementations that are known to work well. Some research isn't easily reproducible because it involves huge engineering challenges, for example <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">DeepMind's AlphaGo</a> or <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">OpenAI's Dota 2 AI</a>, so I won't highlight it here.</li> <li>Some choices are arbitrary. Often, rather similar techniques are published at around the same time. The goal of this post is not be a comprehensive review, but to to expose someone new to the field to a cross-section of ideas that cover a lot of ground. For example, there may be hundreds of GAN variations, but to understand the general concept of GANs, it really doesn't matter which one you study.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (2012)</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_imagenet_2012">Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton (2012)</span></li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0580">Improving neural networks by preventing co-adaptation of feature detectors (2012)</a> <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al.

It is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the earlier LeNet developed by Yann LeCun. AlexNet beat previous methods at classifying images from the <a href="http://image-net.org/index">ImageNet dataset</a> by a significant margin through a combination of GPU power and algorithmic advances. It demonstrated that neural networks actually work! AlexNet was also one of the first times Dropout <span data-cites="hinton_improving_2012">Hinton et al. (2012)</span> was used, which has since become a crucial component for improving the generalization ability of all kinds of Deep Learning models.</p> <p>The architecture used by AlexNet, a sequence of Convolutional layers, ReLU nonlinearity, and max-pooling, became the accepted standard that future Computer Vision architectures would extend and built upon. These days, software libraries such as PyTorch are so powerful, and compared to more recent architectures AlexNet is so simple, that it can be implemented in only a few lines of code. Note that many implementations of AlexNet, such as those linked above, use the slight variation of the network described in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5997">One weird trick for parallelizing convolutional neural networks</a> <span data-cites="krizhevsky_one_2014">Krizhevsky (2014)</span>.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602">Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning (2013)</a> <span data-cites="mnih_playing_2013">Mnih et al.

What's more, the <em>same</em> neural network architecture learned to play seven different games without being told any game-specific rules, demonstrating the generality of the approach.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning differs from Supervised Learning, such as image classification, in that an agent must learn maximize to the sum of rewards over multiple time steps, such as winning a game, instead of just predicting a label. Because the agent interacts directly with the environment and each action affects the next, the training data is not independent and identically distributed (iid), which makes the training of many Machine Learning models quite unstable. This was solved by using techniques such as experience replay <span data-cites="lin_self-improving_1992">Lin (1992)</span>.</p> <p>While there was no obvious algorithmic innovation that made this work, the research cleverly combined existing techniques, convolutional neural networks trained on GPUs and experience replay, with a few data processing tricks to achieve impressive results that most people would not have expected. This gave people confidence in extending Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to tackle even more complex tasks such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far">Go</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/projects/five/">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii">Starcraft 2</a>, and others.</p> <p>Atari Games <span data-cites="bellemare_arcade_2013">Bellemare et al. (2013)</span> have since become a standard benchmark in Reinforcement Learning research. The initial approach only solved (beat human baselines on) seven games, but over the coming years advances built on top of these ideas would start beating humans on an ever increasing number of games. One particular game, Montezuma’s Revenge, was famous for requiring long-term planning and was considered to be among the most difficult to solve. It was only recently <span data-cites="badia_agent57_2020">Badia et al. (2020)</span> <span data-cites="ecoffet_first_2020">Ecoffet et al.

In other words, a sentence is very similar to a time series with each token being a time step. These recurrent models often had difficulty dealing with dependencies over long time horizons. When they process a sequence, they would easily "forget" earlier inputs because their gradients needed to propagate through many time steps. Optimizing these models with gradient descent was hard.</p> <p>The new attention mechanism helped alleviate the problem. It gave the network an option to adaptively "look back" at earlier time steps by introducing shortcut connections. These connections allowed the network to decide which inputs are important when producing a specific output. The canonical example is translation: When producing an output word, it typically maps to one or more specific input words.</p>  <p><strong><strong>Papers</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980">Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization</a> <span data-cites="kingma_adam_2017">Kingma and Ba (2017)</span></li> </ul> <p><strong><strong>Implementations</strong></strong></p> <ul> <li><a href="https://d2l.ai/chapter_optimization/adam.html">Implementing Adam in Python</a></li> <li><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/master/_modules/torch/optim/adam.html">PyTorch Adam implementation</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.2.0/tensorflow/python/keras/optimizer_v2/adam.py#L32-L281">TensorFlow Adam implementation</a></li> </ul> <figure> <img src="https://dennybritz.com/assets/deep-learning-most-important-ideas/optimizer-benchmark.png" alt=""><figcaption>Source: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758">http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11758</a></figcaption> </figure> <p>Neural networks are trained by minimizing a loss function, such as the average classification error, using an optimizer. The optimizer is responsible for figuring out how to adjust the parameters of the network to make it learn the objective. Most optimizers are <a href="https://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/">based on variations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="description"><p>As developers, we are often talking about high-level architecture. I mean DDD, hexagonal architecture, and so on. We want to introduce those concepts to our project. We want to do that now! The new concept, new architecture, new language, new framework. We fall into a trap. Technical news is for us like drugs. We want more and more. And we don’t think about the consequences. The goal is noble. We want to have a good quality project which can easily adjust to new requirements. Unfortunately, the way we do that is not always the best. We need evolution, not revolution. We need small, conscious steps. Today I would like to discuss one of those kinds of steps. Very important and also very hard. I would like to talk with you about <strong>naming thing</strong>.</p><h2 id="why-naming-is-so-important">Why naming is so important?</h2><p>Naming thing?! It’s boring! You can think like that, but the truth is different. It’s one of the most important parts of programming. How you name things can change your perspective. Can add or remove some information from your context. The information is a powerful weapon in the programmer’s hand. If you call one of your classes <code>User</code>, what information this name gives you? Well, you can expect that this is a representation of a human, and he is using something. That’s all. But if you use a class name like <code>Guest</code>, <code>Gamer</code> or <code>Programmer</code>, you have more information. You know exactly, what that person does, what that person uses. The main question is: Do you need this information? As usual - it depends. You need to know the purpose of this name, what you want to achieve. Sometimes it is enough to have a <code>User</code>, but sometimes you need to be more precise.</p><h2 id="new-name-new-perspective">New name, new perspective</h2><p>Changing the name can give you a different perception, even a different context. It can allow you to look at the problem you are facing with from different angles. It’s like using six thinking hats by Dr. Edward de Bono. Each hat gives you a different perspective. Each hat focus on a specific area of the problem. The similar effect you can achieve with names. Take a look at the example below.</p><p>We want to get information about files from the S3 bucket. Of course, we have AWS SDK for that, but we want to be more specific. Adjust and wrap what AWS SDK gives us. So, we create a <strong>wrapper</strong> for that.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>S3</span>
 <span>class</span> <span>Wrapper</span>
   <span>def</span> <span>image_url</span>
   <span>end</span>

   <span>def</span> <span>get_file</span>
   <span>end</span>
   <span>...</span>
 <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>But wait, we just do file operations. We look for a file path, and we want to read/download the file from S3. Maybe we have something more than <code>Wrapper</code>. Maybe this is something like a <code>File</code>? A remote S3 file? Maybe we should think about that code not as a wrapper but as a remote S3 file:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>S3</span>
  <span>class</span> <span>File</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>public_url</span>
    <span>end</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>read</span>
    <span>end</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Don’t you think that this changed our perspective? I think so. Is the first name wrong? It depends. Our goal is important. We often say: <strong>Context is the king</strong>. The intention has meaning. The thing, we want to achieve. Good names are crucial for understanding the code. Sometimes we need many iterations for the name to be as descriptive as we want to. To show the right perspective on the problem. To be understood in the same way or at least in a very similar way through all the team. And even more, to have the same understanding with a client too. It’s the perfect situation when we use the same names/words during the development process not only in a development team but also with a client. We should create our common language - as Domain Driven Design calls it <strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong>. It will allow us not only better understand our domain, our problem, and each other but also to see the right things and the connection between them.</p><h2 id="create-project-context-by-names">Create project context by names</h2><p>We are naming things that have meaning for us. Our words and our language shapes our world (problem or domain). Example from real life. Do you need one word for expressing a person very sensitive to the cold? People in Spain do. This word in Spanish is friolero. Or one word for telling about tiptoeing on hot sand? People in Nairobi have that word - hanyauku. It expresses their culture and the world around them. OK, but back to programming examples.</p><p>We have two names in the code:</p><p>You can look at these two variables for a long time, and it will be hard to understand their meaning. You can even think that this is a misspelling. Maybe someone just missed one letter <code>n</code> in the second variable? You need to go deeper into the code, spent some time reading it to understand what is going on. You will see that both variables are used. They have their declarations, so this is not a mistake. Then you can focus on the meaning. Plants have a scale of growth, which calls BBCH. They can be grouped in different stages of growing, blooming, or giving fruits. So, numbers 1 and 2 are this king of stages groups. Letter <code>n</code> is from how much nitrogen is in the soil during that stage. So <code>n1n2</code> is a multiplication of <code>n1</code> with <code>n2</code>. Variable <code>n12</code>, on the other hand, is a power of <code>n1</code> (multiplication <code>n1</code> with <code>n1</code>). Is it something you can easily get after reading these names? NO! Those names completely forget about context. They don’t explain their meanings, don’t create the language of the problem. In this situation, we should create specific language-related to the domain.</p><p>I hope those examples convinced you that names have a huge meaning. They can change your perspective, show code from different angles. Help you with understanding the problem, with the creation of the project language. Names can even help you with a better understanding of the project and show you the intention, bigger picture.</p><h2 id="13-tips-on-how-to-improve-names-in-the-project">13 tips on how to improve names in the project</h2><p>Now, this is a time for some tips to improve your names in the projects:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Name logical steps in your code</strong></p><p>When you have long calculations in your code, try to split them into smaller steps and descriptively name them. It will allow you and your team to understand the logic faster.</p><div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>remaining_amount</span>
  <span>total_amount</span> <span>=</span> <span>room_price</span> <span>*</span> <span>days</span> <span>*</span> <span>guest_amount</span>
  <span>paid_amount</span> <span>=</span> <span>room_price</span> <span>*</span> <span>guest_amount</span>
  <span>total_amount</span> <span>-</span> <span>paid_amount</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div></li><li><p><strong>Names of methods should inform about what they really do</strong></p><p>For example, if a method changes the state of an object, it should inform you about this change. In Ruby, to do that, we use an exclamation mark <code>!</code>. Of course, this is only the names convention, so you can find methods that change the state but don’t have an exclamation mark <code>!</code>. No matter what, I think this is a good practice to use. The most important is to find a way to inform about what method really does.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use names for magic, static values in your code</strong></p><p>Give them meaning. Do not use 24. Instead of 24 use names like <code>day</code> and put it in the constant. In Ruby, we write a constant in an upper case like <code>DAY</code>. You have 7 in your code. Tell other team members that you mean <code>WEEK</code>. It will help you with communication via code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use descriptive names</strong></p><p>No more single-letter names. Use descriptive names for variables, methods, classes, or modules. Create context for your code by using good and descriptive names. Allow other people in your team to quickly understand the code meaning based on names. If the name isn’t as precise as it should be, change it. Sometimes you need to do many iterations with the name to get the effect you want. It’s normal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Choose the name to a specific level of abstraction</strong></p><p>It’s a hard one. Sometimes the name can be descriptive, but tells us too much or not enough on a specific level of abstraction. For example:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>create_tmp_file</span><span>(</span><span>image_path</span><span>)</span>
  <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>I think <code>image_path</code> quite good tells what it is. It’s a path for an image file. But wait! Is that method only for image files or can be used in a wider context? Maybe the same code can be called for all kinds of files? When we have a name like <code>image_path</code> we narrow the usability of this function. It’s the name that isn’t good at this level of abstraction. Instead of <code>image_path</code> use <code>file_path</code>. It will show that you can put as an argument any file path.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use your programming language standards and conventions</strong></p><p>In Ruby, when you have to return a Boolean value, you should end it with a question mark <code>?</code> like <code>blank?</code>. When you want to convert an object to a string, you should use <code>to_s</code>. There is a lot of this kind conventions. Try to use your language conventions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tell what pattern you use</strong></p><p>I think it can help you with understanding the architecture. Try to use design patterns names in your code. For example, you have a <code>User</code> class, and you want to decorate it. You can create a <code>UserDecorator</code> class. Maybe even <code>AdminUserDecorator</code> if this is what it will decorate. More you are precise in your names, then better.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use your project standards and conventions</strong></p><p>When you have a complex domain, your project will need more conventions then only language level conventions. It’s why it is a good idea to create your project <strong>Ubiquitous Language</strong> and use it everywhere in the project.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unequivocal names</strong></p><p>Try to create names that tell exactly what they really do. Name like <code>create_record</code> can be too general for your code. Maybe in your context name <code>create_blank_record</code> will be better. Don’t afraid long names too much. If you use the name once or twice, it’s OK to have a longer, more precise name.</p></li><li><p><strong>The longer scope, the longer name too</strong></p><p>If you have a short local scope, like a small loop, it is OK to use a variable like <code>i</code> to iterate by some range. But if you have a longer scope, like class scope, it will be much better to use more descriptive names. The longer scope you have, the longer, more descriptive names you should use. It will allow you to know exactly what is inside the variable. Remember also to don’t go with long names too much. At some point, long names also can be not clear and bring more complexity then readability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do not use prefixes or suffixes with type or sub-domains</strong></p><p>It’s related to Hungarian notation too. Do not create a name like <code>i_age</code> because this is an <code>Integer</code> type of age value or <code>CRMInvoice</code>. It will be better to do <code>CRM::Invoice</code>. It will help you to put files into the right directories. If your whole system is …</p></li></ol></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>‍</p><p>Just recently, I started writing in public. First on '<a href="https://cowriters.app/" target="_blank">200 Words a Day</a>' (now called Cowriters); a digital community of people trying to keep up "writing at least 200 words per day", every day. After that, I started writing on&nbsp;Medium, which is a blogging platform. Then a little later, when I felt I could rationalize to myself&nbsp;the work of <a href="https://webflow.com/?rfsn=3270839.2e7ae6" target="_blank">building a website with webflow</a>, I started on my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p><p>‍</p><h2>What channel? All channels!</h2><p>What I noticed posting on separate channels, is that different people hang out in various communities.&nbsp;</p><p>But these communities don't necessarily overlap. So some of my acquaintances, friends and family wouldn't see my&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/AskJibran" target="_blank">Twitter</a>&nbsp;posts, while others only saw what I posted on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jibranelbazi/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>(Btw, I don't have Facebook or Instagram, so that is why there's nothing for me to talk about.)</em></p><p>This fragmentation of communities is no problem, of course.<strong> Everyone hangs out where they want to.</strong> But I did feel I wanted to reach some more people with my blog posts. And seeing my blog was new, it had not yet had the opportunity to rank in Google.</p><p>So I set out to post my articles on <a href="https://www.jibranelbazi.com/blog/how-to-divide-your-online-channels-in-the-4-most-important-segments">separate channels</a> by hand, which quickly turns into a repetitive chore. I don't like tedious tasks, <strong>which is why I automated the process </strong>— the details of which you can find below.&nbsp;</p><p>In this article, I talk about what I automated, what tools I used, and how I set up the process automation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Hopefully, you can use it for your processes!</strong></p><h2>Automation overview</h2><p>For every blog post I publish on my blog, I&nbsp;have automated a few steps:</p><p><strong>In Integromat:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Retrieve last published Article from Webflow</li><li>Search in an Airtable base if the article has already been published and shared before.</li><li>Extract the Category-ID of the article from the Webflow-object and map it to the right Category.</li><li>Check to which secondary flow (after the 'Router in Integromat) the article belongs.</li><li>Share the article on Twitter</li><li>Share the article on LinkedIn</li><li>Publish the article on 200-Words-a-Day</li><li>Retrieve the 200-Words-a-Day article URL</li><li>Save all article data in a 'Published Posts' table in Airtable</li></ul><p><strong>In Zapier:</strong></p><ul role="list"><li>Publish the article on Medium by retrieving the article data from Airtable</li></ul><h2>The Tools</h2><p><a href="https://www.integromat.com/?pc=jibran" target="_blank">Integromat</a>&nbsp;- "... is the glue of the internet." As they say. And this is undoubtedly true. You can go as detailed with your process automation as you want here, all without writing code.</p><p><a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank">Zapier</a>&nbsp;- No glue but equal in impact. (Maybe the duct tape of the internet?) Zapier sports the most extensive (1500+ different apps) set of API integrations you can find.</p><p><a href="https://airtable.com/" target="_blank">Airtable</a>&nbsp;- A mix between a database and Excel, with connections to almost every app you can think of (through Zapier or Integromat).</p><p><a href="https://webflow.com/?rfsn=3270839.2e7ae6" target="_blank">Webflow</a>&nbsp;- Build beautiful custom websites, without any code. Know how to work with Photoshop? You can build awesome websites that contain a CMS (Content Management System)!</p><h2>My Channels</h2><p><strong>Blog&nbsp;</strong>- This blog.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/AskJibran"><strong>Twitter&nbsp;</strong></a>- I think you know what Twitter is. Short, 280-character messages back and forth with others, publicly, on the web. I am sharing my blog posts as 'Links' there.</p><p><strong>LinkedIn&nbsp;</strong>- This is a social media platform geared towards Professional life.

For that, you need to have a separate API-key from Medium (which I still have not received). <strong>Thus for that part of the process I used Zapier, which was easy peasy.</strong></p><p>By the way, I know there are services out there that do this (publishing automation) for you. But I like to have control over the specific format and filters of my processes. <strong>Also, I very much like building these automation flows.</strong></p><p>The flows are not perfect though. For example, I need to add the image source by hand on Medium.</p><p>What I still want to do is to add a flow where, when I update a post, it also updates on all channels I republished.</p><p>I genuinely hope you got some value out of this article.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Un guide pour intégrer les diagrammes Google Charts dans une page web et visualiser les informations provenant de la base de données d'un projet Laravel.</p><div>
							
							<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

							<p>On utilise une <a title="Voir représentation graphique sur Wikipédia" href="https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repr%C3%A9sentation_graphique_de_donn%C3%A9es" target="_blank" rel="noopener">représentation graphique</a>&nbsp;pour faciliter l’interprétation des données, voir la proportion (l’importance) d’une valeur par rapport à un ensemble de valeurs, comparer les valeurs ou décrire une évolution, ...</p>
<p>Sur une page web, nous pouvons utiliser la librairie JavaScript <a title="Aller vers la page Google Charts" href="https://developers.google.com/chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google Charts</strong></a> pour représenter les données dans un graphique par des diagrammes interactifs tels que :</p>
<ul>
<li>Pie Chart : diagramme circulaire (« camembert » en France)</li>
<li>Bar Chart : histogramme, sous forme des bâtons</li>
<li>Line Chart</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>Ce guide vous présente la technique pour représenter ou visualiser les données provenant d'une base de données avec Google Pie Chart et Bar Chart sur une vue (template Blade) dans un projet <a title="Aller vers le site web officiel Laravel" href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laravel</a>.</p>

								<ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6226100796020554" data-ad-slot="1080726079"></ins>

							<h2 id="integrer-google-charts-dans-laravel">Intégrer Google Charts dans Laravel</h2>

							<p>La documentation sur <a title="Aller vers la galerie Google Charts" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">la galerie Google Charts</a> présente le code source à utiliser pour reproduire un diagramme sélectionné.</p>
<p>La technique pour intégrer un diagramme dans un projet Laravel consiste à copier le code source présenté, le ramener (coller) sur une page ou une vue (template Blade), le personnaliser et adapter les données à celles de votre application :</p>
<ol>
<li>Copier le code source d’un chart depuis la galerie Google Chart</li>
<li>Coller le code source du chart sur votre page ou template Blade</li>
<li>Remplacer les valeurs du chart par celles de votre application</li>
</ol>
<p>Pour expliciter cette technique, nous allons prendre deux exemples d’intégration en récupérant les données de la base de données, les organisant pour les représenter au diagramme. Nous aurons pour cela besoin d’une route « diagram », d’un contrôleur « DiagramController » et d’une vue « diagram ».</p>
<p>Ajoutons la route « diagram » au fichier <strong>routes\php</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>// La route pour afficher le diagramme
Route::get("diagram", "DiagramController@diagram")-&gt;name("diagram");</code></pre>
<p>L’action « diagram » de la route nommée « diagram » est gérée par le contrôleur <strong>App\Http\Controllers\DiagramController.php</strong> que nous pouvons générer en exécutant la commande <em>artisan </em>suivante :</p>
<pre><code>php artisan make:controller DiagramController</code></pre>
<p>Nous allons modifier la logique de la méthode <code>diagram()</code> pour les données de chaque diagramme :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class DiagramController extends Controller
{
	// L'action de la route "diagram"
	public function diagram () {

		$data = collect(); // Les données du diagramme

		// La vue "diagram"
		return view("diagram", compact('data'));

	}
}</code></pre>
<p>Et la vue <strong>resources\views\diagram.blade.php</strong> qui présente le diagramme avec les valeurs :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()-&gt;getLocale()) }}"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
    &lt;!-- CSRF Token --&gt;
    &lt;meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Laravel - Google Chart&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!-- Scripts --&gt;
    &lt;script src="{{ asset('js/app.js') }}" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;!-- CSS --&gt;
    &lt;link href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
	
	&lt;h1&gt;Mon diagramme&lt;/h1&gt;

	&lt;!-- L'élément "#mon-chart" où placer le chart --&gt;
	&lt;div id="mon-chart" style="height: 500px; width: 800px;" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
	// Le code du Chart
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Nous allons modifier la partie <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> pour chaque diagramme.&nbsp; Mon diagramme sera placé dans l'élément <code>&lt;div id="mon-chart" &gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code></p>
<p>L’arborescence des fichiers avec lesquels nous allons travailler est la suivante :</p>
<ul>
<li>app\Http\Controllers\<strong>DiagramController.php</strong></li>
<li>resources\views\<strong>diagram.blade.php</strong></li>
<li>routes\<strong>web.php</strong></li>
</ul>

															
							
							<h2 id="exemples-dintegration-google-pie-et-bar-charts">Exemples d'intégration Google Pie et Bar Charts</h2>

							<h3>Exemple 1 : Intégrer Google Pie Chart</h3>
<p>Supposons pour un site web e-commerce avoir une table « categories » dont le model <strong>App\Category.php</strong> représente une catégorie des produits (Ex : charcuterie, pâtisserie, viande, …) :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

namespace App;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Category extends Model
{
    // Les produits de la catégorie
    public function products () {
    	return $this-&gt;hasMany(Product::class);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Chaque catégorie possède plusieurs produits. Nous voulons afficher la proportion des produits pour chaque catégorie dans un diagramme circulaire.</p>
<p>Pource faire, nous pouvons récupérer les catégories avec leurs produits de la manière suivante au contrôleur <strong>App\Http\Controllers\DiagramController.php</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

// ...

use App\Category;

class DiagramController extends Controller
{
	// L'action de la route "diagram"
	public function diagram () {

		// Les catégories avec les produits
		$categories = Category::with("products")-&gt;get();

		// La vue "diagram" avec les catégories
		return view("diagram", compact('categories'));

	}
}</code></pre>
<p>Puis intégrer les données au <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> <a title="Aller vers la documentation Google Pie Chart" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/piechart" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google Pie</strong></a> sur la vue <strong>resources\views\diagram.blade.php</strong> :</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['corechart']});
  google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);

  function drawChart() {

    var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
      ['Catégories', 'Produits'],
      @foreach ($categories as $category) // On parcourt les catégories
      [ "{{ $category-&gt;name }}", {{ $category-&gt;products-&gt;count() }} ], // Proportion des produits de la catégorie
      @endforeach
    ]);

    var options = {
      title: 'Proportion des produits par catégorie', // Le titre
      is3D : true // En 3D
    };

    // On crée le chart en indiquant l'élément où le placer "#mon-chart"
    var chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('mon-chart'));

    // On désine le chart avec les données et les options
    chart.draw(data, options);
  }
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>J'obtiens le rendu suivant pour mes données :</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1Y0e-UmRIC_RwCni2XB8xHeom6JUjmjRV" alt="Google Pie Chart avec des données d'une app Laravel"></p>
<h3>Exemple 2 : Intégrer Google Bar Chart</h3>
<p>Reprenons les mêmes données catégories avec produits. Nous voulons cette fois visualiser dans un histogramme le rapport quantité produits / ventes pour chaque catégorie.</p>
<p>Pour le nombre des ventes par catégorie, nous avons la relation suivante avec la table des ventes « sales » au modèle <strong>App\Category.php</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

// ...

class Category extends Model
{
    // Les produits de la catégorie
    public function products () {
    	return $this-&gt;hasMany(Product::class);
    }

    // Les ventes de la catégorie
    public function sales () {
        return $this-&gt;hasManyThrough(Sale::class, Product::class);
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Récupérons les catégories avec les produits et les ventes dans la méthode <code>diagram()</code> du contrôleur&nbsp;<strong>App\Http\Controllers\DiagramController.php</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>public function diagram () {

	// Les catégories avec les produits et les ventes
	$categories = Category::with("products", "sales")-&gt;get();

	// La vue "diagram" avec les catégories
	return view("diagram", compact('categories'));

}</code></pre>
<p>Enfin, intégrons les données au&nbsp;<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> <a title="Aller vers la documentation Google Bar Chart" href="https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/barchart" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google Bar Chart</strong></a> sur la vue&nbsp; <strong>resources\views\diagram.blade.php</strong>&nbsp;:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['bar']});
  google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);

  function drawChart() {
    var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
      ['Catégorie', 'Produits', 'Ventes' ],
      @foreach ($categories as $category) // On parcourt les catégories
      [ '{{ $category-&gt;name }}', {{ $category-&gt;products-&gt;count() }}, {{ $category-&gt;sales-&gt;count() }} ],
      @endforeach
    ]);

    var options = {
      chart: {
        title: 'Performance Catégories - Produits - Ventes',
        subtitle: 'Produits, Ventes pour chaque catégorie',
      },
      bars: 'vertical' // Direction "verticale" pour les bars
    };

    var chart = new google.charts.Bar(document.getElementById('mon-chart'));

    chart.draw(data, google.charts.Bar.convertOptions(options));
  }
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<p>J'obtiens le rendu suivant pour mes données :</p>
<p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1b0H6z_LXO4bQKJ5iuo5KuRSPQdmY__n7" alt="Google Bar Chart avec les données d'une app Laravel"></p>

We know the knowns and our existing SRE toolchain does a very good job of validating them. In that sense, existing metrics are our tells and our tools are like Clever Hans, which happily tap away to verify what we know. What existing tools or limited metrics don’t tell us are hidden anomalies that manifest as faint glimmers in incidents when we are in fire fighting mode.</p><p>A single node failure of a standalone 3 node load balancer app has vastly different implications than a single node failure in a system where the faulty node has both upstream and downstream dependencies. Similarly, if you did not have distributed tracing, how would you map a request journey in a microservices based system? Systems evolved, problems evolved and hence tooling evolved. In the absence of tooling that evolves with problems, we are fooling ourselves to believe that our alarms cover the whole outage domain, akin to saying that Clever Hans knows math.</p><p>Making Clever Hans do math is impossible, but choosing tools that solve todayâ€™s problems and anticipate near future needs is tractable. Staying in lockstep with the problem domain of system as it evolves is key. Detecting where your existing tooling falls short and filling those gaps is a learnable skill. During that process, you will realize that marrying your existing toolchain or shoehorning problems to fit a familiar tool is counter productive.</p><p>So do you adopt every shiny new tool that shows up on hackernews? No. Exploring a tool to do a test run is one thing, ensuring enterprise adoption across teams is another. Weigh the benefits against the switching cost. Is it worth switching if the system you are solving problems for is sunsetting in the next 3 months? Conversely, isnâ€™t it worth evaluating a CI/CD tool if your team is spending most of their time doing manual deployments? These are real questions that go beyond the shimmer of superficial concerns like – <em>Is it written in my favourite programming language? Is it the next best thing I could put on my resume?</em></p><h3><span id="Takeaways"></span>Takeaways<span></span></h3><ul><li>Know your Clever Hans toolchain. Put on your poker face and ask hard subjective questions.</li><li>Bend the solutions to your problem, not new problems to old solutions.</li><li>Own your toolchain and not the other way around.</li><li>If the only tool you know is a hammer, everything will look like a nail. Identify those hammers. Be on the lookout for power drills.</li></ul><p><em>Update</em>: We had some really interesting discussions with the SRE community on reddit around this post. We got some really good feedback that helped us enrich the post content. Turns out that you can teach an old horse new tricks!

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>Galaksija was to be in Yugoslavia what Commodore and Sinclair were in the west. Whether it succeeded or not, its deceptively simple design can still teach us a lot of interesting tricks on how to make a usable computer and operating system with as few transistors and bits as possible.

            <div>
                <p>In this article, I’m going to cover various exploits that can work against the Django templating engine in a modern web application.</p>
<p>I’ll show how and why they work, as exploits, the risks of leaving them unfixed. Then, I’ll show you how to find them using a fuzzer I’ve been developing.</p>
<h2>A quick introduction to Cross-Site-Scripting</h2>
<p>Cross-Site-Scripting, or XSS, is the technique of exploiting web applications to cause trick users’ browsers to executing arbitrary (and malicious) JavaScript.</p>
<p>The malicious JavaScript code would be targeted to accomplish something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing users passwords without their knowledge</li>
<li>Data gathering</li>
<li>Executing arbitrary actions</li>
</ul>
<p>This exploit works based on the assumption that the HTML and JavaScript served from a website’s server is “trusted”.</p>
<p>If you visit your favourite website, you’d expect that the HTML and JavaScript served to you and rendered in your browser is “safe”. Because of the mix between User-Generated-Content (UGC) and static content in
most modern applications,</p>
<p>Some common examples of content which is rendered as part of the site DOM from a database would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>A comments section at the bottom of the page</li>
<li>Names or profile pictures of users</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of putting in their name as “Jim Smith”</p>
<pre><code>Article posted by {{ user }}.
</code></pre>

<p>This is fine if <code>user = "Jim Smith"</code>, but if Jim is a bit more callous, then he could enter his name as <code>&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/I3eVhMpz8hns4/giphy.gif"/&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Anyone viewing this page would then see the GIF that Jim injected into his username:</p>
<pre><code>Article posted by &lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/I3eVhMpz8hns4/giphy.gif"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of Stored/Permanent XSS. There are 2 groups of XSS exploits, which we’ll explore:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reflected XSS</li>
<li>Stored/Permanent XSS</li>
</ol>
<h3>Reflected XSS</h3>
<p>Reflected XSS is common in both server-side and client-side applications. A common XSS flaw in applications that attackers will seek out
is a search page. Take this (very) simple example of a HTML + JavaScript page for showing a form asking for a search query
and showing what the user searched for if the GET parameters is existent.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html lang="en-AU"&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form method="get"&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Search: &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="query" name="query" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;span id="search-query" &gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;!-- The results of the search query --&gt;

&lt;script type="application/javascript"&gt;
    var searchParams = new URLSearchParams(document.location.search);
    if (searchParams.has("query"))
    {
        document.getElementById("search-query").innerHTML = "You searched for " + searchParams.get("query")
    }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Your regular user would search a text string which is shown on the page:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/simple-search.png"></p>
<p>An attacker could search for any valid HTML and it would become part of the DOM:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/guacamole-dance.gif"></p>
<p>In the reflective XSS model, the malicious payload is sent back to the attacker. This type of attack is less-dangerous than permanent XSS.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/reflective-xss.png"></p>
<p>Reflective XSS attacks are used by attackers sending a link and tricking a user to show the reflected payload to accomplish the hack.</p>
<h3>Stored/Permanent XSS</h3>
<p>Permanent XSS attacks are far more dangerous to an application because the attack has the opporunity to impact all of the users of the site, including the site administrators.</p>
<p>The attack mechanism is the same as reflective, but the server-side application stores the malicious payload in a database, or a file of some sort:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://tonybaloney.github.io/img/posts/permanent-xss.png"></p>
<p>Some really-basic examples I shared were user names, comments, and profile photos.</p>
<p>Permanent XSS attacks are often used for</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending a “beacon” to the attacker with some details about the target, such as their IP address, user name, browser, OS, password, etc.</li>
<li>Making POST requests to parts of the application which let the attacker take over an account by changing the password.</li>
<li>Combining with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVHX9jDrI0o">SQL Injection</a> vulnerabilities to exfiltrate data from the database.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Django fights back</h2>
<p>Django assumes that all context data is “unsafe” unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>This means that <strong>most</strong> forms of XSS attack don’t work with Django templates.</p>
<p>For example, if you wrote the following template:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;html lang="en-AU"&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form method="get"&gt;
    &lt;label for="query"&gt;Search: &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" id="query" name="query" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;span id="search-query" &gt;You searched for {{ query }}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Django would automatically escape the malicious string in the <code>query</code> context variable:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/I3eVhMpz8hns4/giphy.gif"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;https://media.giphy.com/media/I3eVhMpz8hns4/giphy.gif&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It does this by passing all string data through Python’s <code>html.escape()</code> function.
This function will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace any <code>&amp;</code> with an <code>&amp;amp;</code> ampersand HTML character-reference</li>
<li>Replace any <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> with an <code>&amp;lt;</code> or <code>&amp;gt;</code> HTML character-reference</li>
<li>Replace any <code>"</code> with an escaped <code>\"</code></li>
<li>Replace any <code>'</code> with an escaped <code>\'</code></li>
</ol>
<p>To say that this escaping of these 5 characters “protects” your application is a gross-underestimation of XSS.</p>
<h2>Caveats to Django XSS protection</h2>
<p>There are many caveats to Django XSS protection, and as you learn more about XSS you’ll be able to spot them in your templates.</p>
<h3>1. It only applies to the Django template engine</h3>
<p>The XSS protection for Django is part of the Django templating engine. If your application heavily uses a client-side JavaScript frame (such as Angular, Vue, React)
then the Django XSS protection is not helping you.</p>
<p>An example of a reflective XSS vulnerability is a third-party JavaScript component on your page. Many third-party JavaScript components, such as type-ahead widgets have XSS flaws.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many Django extensions that rely on combined JavaScript/Python logic have XSS flaws. These include many form extensions like Date/Time selectors. Some of these flaws have been discovered and fixed,
but many go unnoticed.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do about this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check your JavaScript and Python dependencies against a CVE database like Snyk.io</li>
<li>Test the whole application (see later in this article) with malicous payloads</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. It does not protect against the misuse of “Safe Strings”</h3>
<p>The Django XSS protection can be disabled when a string is marked as “safe”, either in the View logic by using the <code>mark_safe()</code> function, or in the template using the <code>safe</code> filter.</p>
<pre><code>format_html("{} &lt;b&gt;{}&lt;/b&gt; {}",
    mark_safe(some_html),
    some_text,
    some_other_text,
)
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, in the template you can use the <code>safe</code> filter to disable the HTML escape protection:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;span id="search-query" &gt;You searched for {{ query | safe }}&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This may seem obvious that by explicitly disabling XSS protection that it doesn’t protect you against XSS, but <em>“Use <code>mark_safe()</code>“</em> is an accepted solution to a worrying number of Django questions
on StackOverflow.com.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do about this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Search your code base for use of the <code>safe</code> filter</li>
<li>Search your code base for the use of <code>mark_safe</code> function by using [my PyCharm extension]</li>
<li>Use bleach to clean out any potentially vulnerable attributes</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of a filter tag that I wrote to convert using Bleach to remove any potentially harmful data:</p>
<pre><code>from django import template
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe
import bleach

register = template.Library()
_ALLOWED_ATTRIBUTES = {
        'a': ['href', 'title'],
        'img': ['src', 'class'],
        'table': ['class']
}
_ALLOWED_TAGS = ['b', 'i', 'ul', 'li', 'p', 'br', 'a', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'ol', 'img', 'strong', 'code', 'em', 'blockquote',
    'table', 'thead', 'tr', 'td', 'tbody', 'th']

@register.filter()
def safer(text):
    return mark_safe(bleach.clean(text, tags=_ALLOWED_TAGS, attributes=_ALLOWED_ATTRIBUTES))
</code></pre>

<p>You’d use this tag as a drop-in replacement for <code>safe</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;span id="search-query" &gt;You searched for {{ query | safer }}&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>3. Some types of attribute escape are not protected</h3>
<p>Many XSS techniques use HTML/JavaScript event handlers as attributes of existing tags instead of new <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags.</p>
<p>For example, many HTML elements support an <code>onload</code> event. The HTML can have any JavaScript action as a trigger and it doesn’t require any user interaction:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src=/img/home-bg.jpg onload=alert(1)&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If your Django template had the <code>src</code> attribute replaced with a context variable:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;img src={{ profile_photo }}&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The attacker would set their profile photo URL to <code>"/img/home-bg.jpg onload=alert(1)"</code> to accomplish this attack.
Because you didn’t encapsulate the <code>src</code> attribute in quotes, the Django XSS protection won’t escape the input.</p>
<p><strong>What can you do about this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always quote your attributes if they come from user-generated/untrusted sources</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. It does not protect against other attributes which accept JavaScript</h3>
<p>Let’s say you let your users add a link to their personal website that shows up on their profile page inside your application.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href="{{ user.profile_url }}"&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Well, the attacker can just put <code>"javascript:do_stuff(xxvb)"</code> as the link to their website, so if the user clicks on the link, it executes whatever JavaScript the attacker wishes.</p>
<p>You could check for <code>user.profile_url.startswith("javascript:")</code>, however the following are also valid in most browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;a href="JaVaScript:alert(1)"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;</code> (the protocol is case insensitive)</li>
<li><code>&lt;a href="    javascript:alert(1)"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;</code> (the characters \x01-\x20 are allowed before the protocol)</li>
<li><code>&lt;a href="javas   cript:alert(1)"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;</code> (the characters \x09,\x0a,\x0d are allowed inside the protocol)</li>
<li><code>&lt;a href="javascript \x09:alert(1)"&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;</code> (the characters \x09,\x0a,\x0d are allowed after protocol name before the colon)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What can you do about this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sanitize links before they’re stored in the database, or</li>
<li>Don’t offer this behaviour on the application.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5. <code>html.escape()</code> does not escape JavaScript template strings</h3>
<p>The escape function that Django XSS protection uses will escape the string quotes <code>'</code> and <code>"</code>.</p>
<p><code>html.escape()</code> <strong>does not</strong> escape the backtick ``` used in ECMAScript Template literals. Template literals are part of the …</p></div></div></div>

<p>“The two pizza team” paradigm has become really popular in the context of organizing software teams. The idea is to have small, self-reliant teams working independently to solve problems. The “two-pizza” refers to the guidance to keep the team small enough that we need not order more than two pizzas to feed them.</p>

<p>These teams are all around us today, but we are not seeing the kind of productivity or shipping velocity that we expected to see. Most developers, especially in larger organizations, complain about meetings, the burden of communication, the slow pace of change etc. Startups often sell themselves to potential candidates by touting their agility. But why should larger companies be slow if everyone is using the same “empowered team”/”autonomous team” model for organizing themselves?</p>
<p>I argue that <strong>we have lost the original intent of the “two pizza teams”</strong> (aka autonomous teams). The way we are organizing and scaling teams as companies grow larger is exactly opposite to the spirit of the idea, and this is making the already difficult problem of keeping teams motivated and agile even more difficult.</p>
<h3><strong>Why two pizza teams</strong></h3>
<p>The concept of the “two pizza”/”autonomous” team arose from attempts to minimize communication between multiple teams and empowering a single team to be in complete control of delivering customer value.</p>
<p>Before this idea gained popularity, the most common way of organizing teams was in terms of Backend, UI, DBA, Ops etc.. Building any feature required a lot of communication, collaboration, and alignment between all these groups.</p>
<p>The notion of a small team which had all the skills required to solve a single specific problem was intended to solve this problem. A single team would be given the entirety of the problem statement and the tools it needed to solve it. This would ideally remove the problem of aligning multiple teams around shared roadmaps and delivery schedules and allow the team to own the problem solving process end-to-end.</p>
<p>There are two core concepts underlying the two-pizza team – <strong>mission</strong> and<strong> independence</strong>. Ideally, end-to-end means all the way to the customer or the business. Hence, <strong>every autonomous team is expected to generate direct business value all by itself</strong>, without a lot of overlap with other teams. Additionally, <strong>the team should be able to meets its goals independently</strong> (i.e. without reliance on or interference from other teams) This reduces the cross team communication overhead because its members have all the skills needed to solve the problem.</p>
<h3>What went wrong</h3>
<p>Somewhere along the line, we forgot about “reducing communication” just started fixating on assigning independent teams to problem statements that were essentially tiny slices of business problems. As the problem space gets more finely sliced in hopes of achieving scale at each step, so does the number of teams. e.g. What might have been a “Data Delivery Team” charged with delivering fresh data to customers unfortunately becomes “Data ingestion Team”, “Data processing Team” and “Data Release Team” (real world example).</p>
<p>This causes problems with both the core tenets of the autonomous team philosophy.</p>

<p>The <strong>mission is diluted because most of the teams are now working on problems which are subsets of the original problem and as such not valuable in themselves</strong>. The success of a team can no longer guarantee the improvement of at least one business metric. The team’s work is not tied to a business objective any longer, so it gets tied to tightly defined execution scopes.”Data ingestion team” is supposed to pull in data, that’s it. While the team is still allowed to do this however it wants, succeeding in its objective will not mean that fresh data is being delivered to the customer. </p>
<p>Autonomy is diluted as a direct fallout. <strong>Where a single team could have come together to solve problems of data delivery, now multiple teams with different managers and different roadmaps must come together to deliver anything to the customer</strong>. This creates exactly the kind of coordination overhead that these small teams were created to solve in the first place.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Coordination, also known as alignment, communication, shared roadmap, Gantt chart and many other positive sounding names, is the arch-enemy of the autonomous team</strong>. </p>
<p>We have lots of small teams with lots of independence and no direct impact that keeping everyone pointed in one direction has become a nightmare. Program Managers paper over the ever-increasing complexity involved in coordinating priorities, efforts, and timelines, with developers and managers increasingly wash their hands of the whole business of communicating with other teams.</p>
<p>We took a good idea too far. The current “small” team is certainly small, but we forgot the part about reducing communication. Instead we are now offered “small, highly collaborative” teams as some sort of new ideal, as if high collaboration is something to be desired during execution.</p>
<p>This is a huge blind spot for organizations. The implicit goodness of small teams (devoid of any of the original context) is now internalized to such an extent that deep collaboration between small teams is considered a good thing in the organization. Team productivity and motivation keeps falling even as their sizes increase. And somehow we still believe this way of organizing work among teams is efficient, and something else must be causing the diminishing productivity.</p>

<h3>Collaboration is not good</h3>
<p>Collaboration is a great idea during ideation and brainstorming. It helps in getting a lot of input from lots of different people and can help us discover new aspects which we may not consider ourselves. It can expose other approaches to solving the problem, or even some versions of this problem that have already been solved by others. <strong>Broad stroked collaboration between people and systems is how we build something that is greater than the sum of its parts.</strong></p>
<p>However, <strong>once we reach the execution phase, collaboration is extremely costly.</strong> Collaboration means that two people or teams cannot just focus on doing their jobs, they also have to worry about when the other person is going to finish theirs and how they are going to synchronize with each other to hit the finish line.</p>

<p>I can quote any number of engineering principles to refute the deification of collaborative teams which seems to be the norm today.</p>
<p>In general, it is assumed that multithreading improves the performance of a system. This is completely true if each thread can execute completely independently on its own core without talking to any other thread or sharing any data. However, the moment we end with some shared state or more threads than CPUs, the synchronization overhead can quickly outstrip all the performance gains from using the technique.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amdahl’s law</a> puts a finite upper limit on the increased output when an extra worker is added into the mix. The well-known problem is that every extra worker imposes non-parallelizable, exponentially increasing communication overhead. At some point, adding another worker makes things worse rather than better.</p>
<p>“<em>9 developers cannot finish a 9 month project in one month</em>” is a well-known idea in software management. And yet we see managers trying to grow and manage their teams in isolation. Why is that?</p>
<p>My hypothesis is that we see individual teams delivering quickly and we interpret this to mean that adding more members to these teams will further scale the output. In a world where we examine teams by isolating them from the overall system context, it is very easy to confuse independent with autonomous.</p>
<h3>Independence is not Autonomy</h3>
<p>In a highly collaborative setup, the correct way of looking at the organization is like a factory floor. <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints#:~:text=The%20theory%20of%20constraints%20(TOC)%20is%20an%20overall%20management%20philosophy,Critical%20Chain%2C%20published%20in%201997." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Theory of constraints</a></strong> tells us that the only way to increase output in this situation is to broaden the bottlenecks and widen the entire “flow of work” from conception to final delivery to the customer.</p>

<p>But when we look at each step individually and out of context of the rest of the “pipeline”, “delivery” takes on a very different meaning. It just means “out of my door”. Any attempts to improve output with such a perspective will only create local maxima which means nothing for the final output – it might even be detrimental.</p>
<p>This is where we end up with too many small teams which are only looking at their little slice of work. That is what they are incentivised to do. If the outputs of our teams are arranged sequentially, they are not autonomous in delivery, no matter how independent they might be in their day to day work.</p>
<p>Anyone who has managed a supply chain can tell, independent teams organized in a sequential manner MANDATE a lot of communication and feedback. The lines of communication have not been removed by the creating small teams – they have been multiplied manifold. What’s worse, communication is happening at team boundaries where it is actually the weakest (the <a href="https://kislayverma.com/programming/overcoming-io-overhead-in-micro-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communication overhead in microservices</a> springs to mind readily).</p>

<p>Without an autonomous mission, independent teams are forever shackled by the communication overhead.</p>
<h3><strong>Autonom</strong><strong>y</strong><strong> is a customer facing construct</strong></h3>
<p>What happens if we organize our independent teams by problem statement rather than function? A team that is authorized to solve a customer problem using any means at its disposal in essence owns the entire “pipeline” of tasks that need to be done. There is no cross-team collaboration and communication required for this team to do its job. This team not only operates independently, it also delivers value to the customer independently.</p>
<p><strong>A team is autonomous when it “delivers value to the customer” independently</strong>. In his novel “<a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/8185984565?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=kislayverma-21&amp;camp=3638&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=8185984565" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Goal</a>“, Eliyahu M. Goldratt highlights this beautifully by having his protagonist (who is plant manager) define his success to mean increased sales. Sales is usually not the problem of the manufacturing team, but the novel highlights how defining a customer facing “global” goal transforms the poorly …</p></div></article></div>

July 28, 2020 | https://antmedia.io/the-first-hevc-h265-support-in-webrtc/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://antmedia.io/the-first-hevc-h265-support-in-webrtc/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>We are very happy to announce that Ant Media Server v2.1 is released with some more great new features such as HEVC(H.265) support in WebRTC stack and WebM Recording. Previously <a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-vp8-data-channel-and-4k-60fps-support/">In Ant Media Server v2.0</a>, VP8 and <a href="https://antmedia.io/webrtc-chat-and-file-transfer/">Data Channel</a> features were released. We are continuously adding new features and doing performance optimizations. Before starting the post, let me thank you for your all interest to the Ant Media Server because you’ve made it run in more than 120 countries.After a brief introduction, let’s start the post.</p> <p>I think the most important feature in this release is the HEVC (H.265) support in WebRTC stack because it shows that what Ant Media can do beyond the limits in the industry. Of course, there are many more features and improvements such WebM recording, Unified Plan or PlanB,&nbsp; forcing quality in WebRTC playback, etc. Let me give the highlights for v2.1 and then you can also take a look the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases/tag/ams-v2.1.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">whole change log</a> for sure.</p> <h2>HEVC(H.265) Support in WebRTC Stack</h2> <p>I think the main question is about why it’s important to add HEVC aka. H265 support in WebRTC stack. The answer is clear: <strong>Providing better quality with the same bitrate.</strong></p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024.jpg" alt="Ant Media Server HEVC Support in WebRTC" width="1022" height="376" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024.jpg 1022w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-300x110.jpg 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-768x283.jpg 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/HEVC_main_1024x1024-600x221.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 1"></p> <p>Let me tell what we’ve done in Ant Media Server side. We originally use the <a href="https://webrtc.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">WebRTC stack implemented by Google</a> and we’ve made it scalable to work in the server side. The recent changes is adding packetization and depacketization of HEVC frames in RTP protocol according to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7798" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RFC 7789</a> and adapting these changes to the WebRTC stack.&nbsp; &nbsp;We’ve also adapted these changes to the Android WebRTC SDK because most of the android devices have H.265 decoder to play the H.265 encoded WebRTC Stream.&nbsp; Before proceeding how to test HEVC, let us tell that HEVC support is an experimental feature for now.</p> <h2>How to Play HEVC WebRTC Stream in Ant Media Server</h2> <p>Most of the devices(mobile or desktop) do not have H.265 Encoder to be able use in WebRTC stack. Luckily, Android devices have H.265 decoder to play H.265 encoded streams. So it works as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Enable H.265 in Ant Media Server</li> <li>Send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server</li> <li>Play H.265 WebRTC stream in Android Device</li> </ol> <h3>1. Enable H.265 in Ant Media Server</h3> <p>By default H.265 support is disabled in Ant Media Server so we need to enable it first. After you install the Ant Media Server,</p> <ul> <li>Open the following file <pre>/usr/local/antmedia/webapps/WebRTCAppEE/WEB-INF/red5-web.properties</pre> </li> <li>Enable H265 by adding below property to the file above <pre>settings.h265Enabled=true</pre> <p>I think we should also point out that Ant Media Server uses libx265 for soft encoding and it also support hevc_nvenc for hard encoding.</p></li> <li>Then make the following changes in the file as follows <pre>settings.vp8Enabled=false
settings.h264Enabled=false
settings.encoderSettingsString=360,800000,64000</pre> </li> <li>Save the file and restart the Ant Media Server <pre>sudo service antmedia restart</pre> </li> </ul> <h3>2. Send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server</h3> <p>You can send RTMP stream to Ant Media Server with <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/Open-Broadcaster-Software-Publishing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OBS as documented here</a>. Just send a stream with height 360p or over.</p> <h3>3. Play H.265 WebRTC stream in Android Device</h3> <p>With the new Android SDK, you don’t need to do anything. Just add your server address to the MainActivity and change the mode to Play and open the Activity. It’ll play the H.265 Encoded WebRTC on your Android Device. You can even check the incoming and outgoing SDPs to see the HEVC parameters there.</p> <h4>Good news for Android and IOS SDKs</h4> <p>We’ve decided to provide Android and iOS SDK’s for free. It’ll be available to download on <a href="https://antmedia.io/">antmedia.io</a> later this week.</p> <h2>WebM Recording</h2> <p>In this release, we’re also happy to announce WebM Recording. You can configure WebM recording the same way you do for MP4 recording.&nbsp; Let me tell what I mean.</p>  <h2>Improved Performance and Stability</h2> <p>We constantly improve performance and stability. With this release, there are less threads in both Java and Native side. It means there are less context switching in the same name number of publishers and viewers according to the previous version. We’ve also optimized the WebRTC Stack&nbsp; to make it consume less resources.</p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1.png" alt="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 2" width="489" height="302" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1.png 489w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/java-concurrency-tutorial-introduction-1-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 4"></p> <p>Second improvement is about stability. We’ve improved our devops pipeline for cluster tests. So we’re having more integration test cases for both standalone and cluster modes. Moreover, we’ve also increased our quality gate for test coverage from %70 to %80.</p>  <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1.png" alt="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 3" width="500" height="145" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1.png 832w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1-300x87.png 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1-768x223.png 768w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/software-testing-and-qa-services-new-832x242-1-600x175.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 5"></p> <h2>Force WebRTC Playback Quality in Adaptive Bitrate</h2> <p>Here is the another feature that we’ve got so many requests about that. Let me explain it. When there are multi-bitrates in the server side, Ant Media Server measures the viewers internet speed and sends the best quality according to the internet speed of the viewer.&nbsp; For instance,</p> <ul> <li>Assume that there are two bitrates on the server <ul> <li>First one is 360p and 800kbps</li> <li>Second one is 480p and 1500kbps.</li> </ul> </li> <li>if Viewer internet speed <ul> <li>is above 1500kbps, then the resolution with 480p is sent.</li> <li>is between 800kbps and 1500kbps or less than 800kbps, then the resolution with 360p is sent.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>This is done automatically on the server side. However some users want to force the resolution and don’t want to the server to make it automatically.&nbsp; So we’ve defined a new message in websocket communication&nbsp; and implement it on server side and JS SDK side. It’s <em>forceStreamQuality&nbsp; </em>which is having two parameters <em>streamId</em> and <em>streamHeight.&nbsp; </em>You can get the streamHeights information by <em>getStreamInfo </em>message. Let me explain how.</p> <p><img src="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347.jpg" alt="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 4" width="360" height="240" srcset="https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347.jpg 360w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347-300x200.jpg 300w, https://antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1080p-720p-comparison-e1498827328347-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px" title="The First HEVC (H.265) Support in WebRTC and Improved Performance in v2.1 6"></p> <p>Assume that you are <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/wiki/WebRTC-Playing" rel="dofollow noopener" target="_blank">playing a WebRTC stream</a> that has some <a href="https://antmedia.io/adaptive-streaming-is-supported-for-live-streams-on-the-fly/">adaptive bitrates</a> on the server side. It means that you’ve created WebRTCAdaptor and call <em>getStreamInfo </em>after you receive <em>play_started</em> message.</p> <pre>webRTCAdaptor.getStreamInfo("{your_stream_Id}");</pre> <p>The method above will trigger the <em>streamInformation </em>callback and you can parse it with the <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/StreamApp/blob/master/src/main/webapp/player.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">same way in this file</a>. Then the only thing is calling <em>forceStreamQuality </em>as follows.</p> <pre>webRTCAdaptor.forceStreamQuality("{your_stream_Id}",&nbsp; {the_resolution_to_be_forced});</pre> <p>We’ll provide this to be very easy to use in the embedded player as a built-in feature in the next release.</p> <p>To sum up,&nbsp; these are the highlights for v2.1. You can check <a href="https://github.com/ant-media/Ant-Media-Server/releases/tag/ams-v2.1.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">whole release notes here</a> .Thank you again for your interest to Ant Media Server and we have some more exciting things on their way. Stay tuned and keep in touch.</p>  </div></div>]]>

<br><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/i.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="11"><span size="+1">n
October, 1953, I coined the word 'software.'</span>
<p><span size="+1">The notion of software as a separate thing from hardware
took years to assert itself. Sure, the computer (popularly referred to
as a "giant brain" in the early fifties) was unable to do anything but
consume electrical power until a "programmer" came along to "program" it,
and the consequent "routines" resided in the computer's "memory" thereafter.
One did not, in the beginning, take a program written for one computer
and put it into another.&nbsp; A half-century later, most people will find
that hard to imagine.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">As originally conceived, the word 'software' was merely
an obvious way to distinguish a program from the computer itself. A program
comprised sequences of written -- changeable -- instructions each endowed
with the power to command the behavior of the permanently crafted machinery
-- the "hardware."</span>
</p><p><a name="retdict"></a><span size="+1">For the origin of the word 'software,'
most <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppA.htm#typdict">dictionaries</a> give an unknown source
and 1960 as the date, but [expletive deleted] I was there! That's the only
exclamation point I intend to use in this introduction.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Fifty years ago, I was writing programs for the SWAC at
UCLA, one of only 16 digital computers in the whole U.S. When I was first
struck by the word 'software' (it was an epiphany), I shook my head and
chuckled.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">When I first said 'software' out loud, people around me
said, "Huh?" From the very beginning I found the word too informal to write
and often embarrassing to say. Nevertheless, with smirking trepidation
I did occasionally feature the word 'software' in speeches and lectures
and media interviews throughout the fifties.</span>
</p><p><a name="retneol"></a><span size="+1">It was just a throw-away thing.
The word 'software' was hardly my most notable invention, even back then.
Nothing to write home about (I was only 19 years old and still living at
home).&nbsp; The word 'software' did not belong in a technical paper (besides,
an undergraduate is but a ghostwriter for principal researchers).&nbsp;
Then too, I had a reputation at UCLA as a practical joker. Colleagues and
friends simply shrugged, no doubt regarding each utterance as a tiresome
prank or worse, another offbeat neologism, for which I was also becoming
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#sniglets">noted</a>.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">Nobody in 1953 would have guessed that the silly word
would take hold, that within a few decades 'software' would enter the general
vocabulary for products and for professions -- that a worldwide industry
would wear it as a solemn name. You can be sure that if my ego and I had
harbored any such glorious visions, then... then, what?</span>
</p><p><a name="re38k"></a><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/a.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="33"><span color="#000000"><span size="+1">t
the time of this writing, there are about 4.2 million issued patents (I
once met Bob Hudson, inventor of an asphalt recycling machine for which
he was awarded U.S. Patent No. 4,000,000 -- but I digress). There must
be at least that many more worldwide -- a total, say, of 10 million. Every
patent has some number of "claims" (my largest -- ahem -- for the first
digital cassette recorder has 106 claims). Each patent-claim is, in effect,
a separate invention, an average of perhaps ten per patent. So there must
be at least a hundred million officially recognized inventions in the world.
Punch Line: There are only <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/softword/AppD.htm#38k">38,000 words</a> in the
English Language.</span></span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><i>Nota bene</i>, the hundred million issued patent-claims
officially recognize only a small fraction of the world's inventions, but
the rest are inventions just the same. An inventor does <i>not</i> apply
for patent protection for each and every idea before reducing it to practice.&nbsp;
Likewise, a person inventing a word does <i>not </i>submit it for publication
in a dictionary before speaking it or writing it.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">By comparison to other inventions, words are rare indeed.
One reason is that there is no commercial value to them, which is why patents
do not apply to words: You want to say "<a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/101words/holomrph.htm">holomorph</a>"?
-- get out your checkbook. Copyrights don't make sense either, since a
word uncopied has no linguistic value at all. Trademarks, truth be known,
protect the interests of buyers not sellers; accordingly, a "wordmark"
would benefit listeners and readers not speakers and writers. Words are
<i>coined</i>
and thus spent -- circulated, borrowed, defaced, worn out, and lost.</span>
</p><p><img src="http://www.niquette.com/books/images/IllumLet/d.gif" nosave="" height="33" width="30"><span size="+1">ictionaries
are not gate keepers like the Patent Office but merely infrequent periodicals,
passively reporting on linguistic usage, relying necessarily on snippets
in published documents -- in non-dictionaries. Once usage for an invented
word becomes established, however, the etymological trail gets cold quickly,
and if the original utterance is undocumented, even a linguistic bloodhound
may not pick up the scent of the true inventor. Pity the verbal coiner,
unrewarded, unacclaimed, unattested.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1"><span color="#000000">Inventors themselves, it seems plain,
do a whole lot better job of inventing <i>things</i> than inventing words
to call things. The bicycle got its 'pedal' from the piano, the engine
appropriated 'piston' from the trombone, the airplane named its 'fuselage'
from the sewing spindle and its 'empennage' from the tail feathers of an
arrow.&nbsp; </span>Millions of inventions apply to computers, both hardware
and software. Readers are invited to check <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/compsci.htm">What's
Not in a Name?</a> and <a href="http://www.niquette.com/books/sophmag/mukashi.htm">Mukashi </a>for
lamentations about the dearth of inventive language in 'The Software Age'.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">'The Software Age' -- now, there's an ambitious coinage.
The previous sentence deserves an exclamation point and so does the next
one. Without software, there would be neither "The Computer Age" nor "The
Information Age."&nbsp; Same for "The Space Age."&nbsp; Meanwhile, is "The
Atomic Age" officially over? How much longer will "The Petroleum Age" last?
Accordingly, does 'The Software Age<b>'</b> have any real competition?</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">All right, so one can get a patent on an invention, a
copyright on a book, a trademark on a name, but what does one get to assert
primacy as the originator of a word? As noted above, t<span color="#000000">here
is no proprietary instrument that protects a word. Nor, of course, would
one want one ("I'll sue you if you use that term, I have the 'wordright'
on it"). On the contrary, t</span>he idea is to put each coinage into currency,
not horde it away.</span>
</p><p><span size="+1">And then the grandkids grow up and there comes a time
to write one's memoirs.&nbsp; This one is dedicated to my first great-grandchild,
<a href="http://www.niquette.com/selections/charlotte/charlotte1.htm">Charlotte</a>.</span></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong><em>Serverless approach to real-time analytics now decouples storage from compute in the cloud to outperform operational model of Elasticsearch, Apache Druid and others</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>SAN MATEO, Calif.</strong> – July 28th, 2020 – <a href="https://rockset.com/">Rockset</a>, the real-time indexing database company, today announced new product features—including decoupling of storage from compute in the cloud, and separation of query-compute from ingest-compute—further eliminating the operational barriers in achieving real-time analytics at scale.</p>
<p>To stay ahead in the digital economy, companies need to personalize user experiences, build real-time decision systems and automate actions using sensor data. These types of  applications demand both very low latency and complex analytical queries on a variety of data formats from different sources. Since real-time data is messy and bursty, the high operational cost and complexity in ingesting and querying real-time data at scale has been a major barrier for enterprises moving from batch to real-time.</p>
<p>Built by the creators of <a href="https://rockset.com/blog/rocksdb-is-eating-the-database-world/">RocksDB</a>, Rockset automatically builds Converged Indexes™ on any data—including structured, semi-structured, geographical and time series data—for high performance search and analytics at scale. It supports real-time SQL queries on semi-structured data, so for the first time ever, developers have the flexibility to build features that search, aggregate and join any type of data from any source on the fly. When combined with serverless operations, it is a game-changing approach to making real-time analytics fast, flexible and easy.</p>
<p>With this new release, Rockset decouples query-compute, ingest-compute and hot storage in the cloud, allowing developers to scale the exact resources needed in the cloud and seamlessly adapt to variability. Traditional systems suffer from compute contention during bursty ingest or spikes in queries, so data becomes stale and queries slow down—making it operationally challenging to enable real-time decisions. Separating query compute from ingest compute avoids resource contention, and as a result, data freshness is guaranteed and query performance is never compromised. Additionally, while new data continues to stream in, old data grows over time and is less frequently queried. Scaling storage independently from compute allows customers to seamlessly control their price-performance over the lifecycle of the dataset, simply by adjusting the compute allocation over time.</p>
<p>Rumble Wellness, a company that encourages a healthy lifestyle by rewarding users based on their daily step count, uses real-time data to increase user engagement. "Rockset is pure magic. We chose Rockset over Druid, because it requires no planning whatsoever in terms of indexes or scaling. In one hour, we were up and running, serving complex OLAP queries for our live leaderboards and dashboards at very high queries per second. As we grow in traffic, we can just ‘turn a knob’ and Rockset scales with us," said Yaron Levi, Chief Architect at Rumble Wellness.</p>
<p><strong>With the new release:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data is served from hot storage, and automatically backed up on durable cloud storage, with per-GB pricing.</li>
<li>Compute resources are scaled independently as required, with per-minute billing.</li>
<li>The compute resources are used for ingesting data or querying data from hot storage. Scaling compute resources results in instant performance gains.</li>
</ul>
<p>“First-generation real-time analytics solutions like Elasticsearch and Druid tightly coupled storage and compute because they were optimized for the datacenter era. But this leads to over-provisioning of resources and makes it difficult to manage costs at scale,” said Dhruba Borthakur, co-founder and CTO, Rockset. “On the other hand, scaling storage and compute independently in the cloud provides the benefits of improved scalability, availability and better price-performance ratios. Rockset’s cloud-native architecture and serverless technology already enables massive operational gains for customers, and these new features will further enable developers to achieve real-time analytics at scale.”</p>

I tried out a few different tools for managing accounting and HR etc., but found that Quickbooks has everything you need to start out, and I’m amazed that every time I want to go do something new the functionality is there. We started out only paying $28 for QBO which is nuts given we were able to tie together all our bank/card accounts, do budgeting, pay bills, run payroll (once we started paying people), etc. and are only up to $70 now with the additional modules we’ve added. Such a great value.</span></p></li><li id="viewer-3drp4"><p><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u><strong>Stripe</strong></u></span></a><span>. We need to be able to bill customers, and can’t even begin to think about PCI compliance right now.

We added Carta for managing equity, Datadog and Sentry for deployment metrics, LaunchDarkly for feature flags, SalesForce and Outreach for CRM and email campaigns, Figma for design iteration, etc., but even still our total spend across all tools is less than $500 a month.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>This post is personal one. It is a painful one. I adapted the reflections that I sent to Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Peter Rosseau recently. I have largely redacted names, except for public interactions or my own correspondences.</p>
<p>Everyone who is privileged enough to hold a PhD in economics should reflect on our toxic culture. Before you start, read the American Economics Association (AEA)&nbsp; <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/code-of-conduct">code of professional conduct</a> and <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/aea-policy-harassment-discrimination">policy on harassment and discrimination</a>.</p>
<p>Students please understand that I and many others are working to make your journey better than ours. Economics is hard enough without others who demean you. I love the energy of youth; however, you need allies. We all do.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I am healthy now, due to my hard work in managing my bipolar disorder and the loved ones who carry me when I struggle.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Burn it down: economics failed us.</em></strong></h2>
<p>Economics is a disgrace. The lack of diversity and inclusion degrades our knowledge and policy advice. We hurt economists from undergraduate classrooms to offices at the White House. We drive away talent; we mistreat those who stay; and we tolerate bad behavior.</p>
<p>Some experiences I share may seem innocuous. Taken together, they demonstrate a systemic problem. One economists refuse to tackle. We blame bad behavior on victims. I was blamed. We tell them to toughen up. I was and did. We say the harasser is good economist and imply the victim is not. He was supposedly better than me. He is not.</p>
<p>I chose to name the senior men economists [many redacted here], who hurt me and others. They are well-respected. You know them. By doing nothing, you allow them to hurt people. You allow them to teach bad behavior to the next generation. I did too. I blame myself and did not speak up. I am sorry, and that is why I am sharing now. I am not filing a complaint. I am sharing. After more than a decade as a macroeconomist, I am fine. You know me. It is painful to share a part of me you did not know. It is painful to revisit. I do not name names to tar and feather. I do it to make our problem concrete.</p>
<p>I mentor many people. They come to me as an ally, as someone who will listen. I do. Some conversations are happy, people looking for advice on how to be an economist. Some conversations are sad, people dealing with painful experiences in economics. Some get better. Some do not. Last year a Black woman undergrad asked me how to get from her satellite-school state university to a PhD program in economics. We talked and I gave her advice. I emailed her a few months later to see what she had decided.&nbsp; Her brother replied that his sister had killed herself. She will not be an economist. Other became economists then we drove them away. The tenure of a Native American woman economist was revoked after her men colleagues turned on her. I talk with her regularly. We talk about how she could return to academia after she is healthy again. Do you know how many Native American women are economist? Very few. Do you know how many Black economists work at the Fed? One out of 406. Economics is a disgrace.</p>
<p>The indignities are astounding. The new woman economist at the Board who was asked by the men colleagues at lunch if she “satisfied” her husband. Her husband is an economist I know well. An officer sabotaged her work . She moved to another group. He stayed. I have talked with the woman and her husband several times. Broke my heart. Her tormentor is good friends with mine. I thought it was me. It was not me. It was them and they have not stopped. I told her she would get better. I did. No one told me that in 2011 when I broke. I was told that I was not the first woman he targeted. WTF? No one told me I could report him. WTF?? Both tormentors are senior officers at the Board, instrumental to monetary policy decisions. Neither said they were sorry.</p>
<p>Or how about the Southeast Asian research assistant, who I met once? He called me hyperventilating as he told about his abusive work environment. After I hung up, I closed my door and sat in my office sobbing. Economists messed him up. I coached him on how to leave his job and find a new one. He did.</p>
<p>Finally, the woman economics major at Chicago, who went to office hours. She sat on the floor since the room was crowded. Her professor offered her a chair. She said she was fine sitting on the floor. He looked at her and said, “I see you like it on your knees; women do.” Oh yes, and he had had to apologize for telling a sexually explicit ‘joke’ in public. He continues to teach undergraduates.[If I ever cross paths with this old nasty man, I will beat the shit out of him.] Economics breaks people and it is broken. I am angry. You should be too.</p>
<p>I mainly share my experiences here. I am NOT special. Many have similar experiences, in some cases worse. I have written documents to back these incidents up. It is awful to have these records in my email inbox, my Twitter, my text messages. Do not tell me, good men are economists too. I do not care. You did not protect the victims. You did not protect me. You had to know something was wrong, and you did nothing. I spend considerable time picking up the pieces of people we break. It is not fair. It is wrong what we do.</p>
<h2><strong><em>Economics destroys its students</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>We discourage undergraduates, women and men from studying economics. The <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/resources/member-docs/final-climate-survey-results-sept-2019">AEA’s first climate survey</a> of economics clearly shows our toxic profession, especially among under-represented groups. The AEA should commission surveys of undergraduates, research assistants, pre- and postdoctoral students. Harassment begins in undergraduate classrooms and often does not stop unless you leave economics.</li>
<li>We do not nurture the next generation. Many graduate students and economists have mental health issues. <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/4/26/econ-grads-peer-support-network/">Research at Harvard</a> found notably higher rates of depression and anxiety among economics PhD students than other PhD students and the general population. Departments often do send students to campus health resources. The faculty place unrealistic expectations on the students. They are aggressive in private and in public settings. They do not mentor, even when they agree to be their advisors. Faculty suffer too. [Krueger, Weitzman, Sandholm, Farhi, rest in peace. I am so sorry.]</li>
<li>Last year, I reviewed several&nbsp;macro job market papers.&nbsp; I read their abstracts, introductions, and tables/charts. I reviewed students from MIT to India to Stockholm to Santa Barbara and everywhere in between. &nbsp;All their papers were technically impressive and they also benefited from better communication. I tried to help. It was advice not an order. They worked hard on every aspect of their research. [I apologize that my original phrasing was not appropriate. It was an honor to be a part of their journey.]&nbsp; They thanked and many said it added to the support from their professors. Some replies suggested that we could do more for our students, such as::
<ul>
<li>You are the first person who has read any part of my job market paper.</li>
<li>I finally understand my paper.</li>
<li>Our department does not teach us how to write.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let me be clear, many advisors including the students&nbsp; (part and not part of my review) have support in their departments. Unfortunately some departments do teach writing. Many do. I got encouragement at Michigan. Some did not. I know too many graduates student that economists hurts. We must do better. Absolutely must. I will do better too.</li>
<li>After I saw some common issues, I wrote a <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/09/29/we-need-to-talk-more/">blog post on writing</a> for all job market candidates. It is my most read post by far. I was surprised. My advisor, Matthew Shapiro, taught me how to write research papers. Many advisors do not. Some do. I <a href="http://macromomblog.com/2019/12/15/joy-to-the-macro-world/">blogged each of the students revised papers</a>. I cheered &nbsp;them on during the job market. Once a woman candidate thanked me. My email came after an exhausting flyout in the middle of an exhausting week of flyouts. None of these students were my responsibility. I was a section chief, managing five economists, two early career, and three research assistants. We can all do more.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><em>Predators target research assistants, graduate students, and early-career economists</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Research assistants and pre-doctoral fellows are particularly vulnerable. Many are considering a career in economics; however, they do know the culture of economics. They have not chosen to navigate our aggressive norms. The explosion of pre-doctoral programs is a looming disaster. Basically, no economists who supervise these young adults have formal management training. The Board now sends every group manager and section chief to a months-long training. Training does not avoid all bad behavior. No training is much worse.</li>
<li>The Board is now recruiting research assistants from under-represented minorities. Even so, Black and Latinx research assistants vastly outnumber the economists of color. Research assistants have the least power at work. They often have bad experiences. One afternoon, a Black woman research assistant at the Board delivered forecast memos to a White officer. The officer thanked her, &nbsp;using the name of another Black woman research assistant. She corrected her. Six weeks later the officer made the same mistake. The research assistant gave up and asked one of the White research assistants to deliver memos to that officer.</li>
<li>Two research assistants, a Black Latinx woman and a Latinx man, designed the first Research Assistant Survey at the Board. I saw the first drafts, as someone who designs surveys. I could see from the start that the results would be uncomfortable. The discomfort of economists should not outweigh, but often does, the discomfort they cause. One striking finding: research assistants were reluctant to offer critical feedback because they were worried that as a result, they would not get a good recommendation for graduate school. Power dynamics are real and early career scholars do not have power. I was in the meeting where they presented the results to the officers and section chiefs. Not surprisingly, the men in the room tried to explain the uncomfortable findings away. It …</li></ul></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>India made over 1.3 billion UPI transactions last month. Spread over 150 banks and hundreds of mobile apps, every single UPI transaction followed the same identical flow—Apps asked for the same set of user inputs, showed the same screens, used a common PIN to authenticate and displayed the same messages. Which begs the question;</p><blockquote><strong>What if loan applications were like this too?</strong></blockquote><p>What if we could dramatically simplify loan applications to make them almost as simple as making a UPI payment? Imagine a world in which every loan application is simplified, standardised, and digitised, regardless of which lender you approached—no more chasing after bank statements <em>(don't forget to get it stamped!)</em>, no more signing every page of endless agreements <em>(in blue ink Saar, black ink not acceptable!)</em>, no more branch manager certificates, no more filling out half a dozen forms, or uploading your grandparents’ kundalis.</p><p>And for those less fortunate among us, no more implicit judgement of a loan application based on arbitrary social status indicators like dark skin, or a poorer grasp of English. When it comes to financial inclusion, human biases and prejudices often come in the way of access to credit to those who need it the most. </p><p>What if we had a standardised fully digital credit flow, powered by a uniform set of open APIs? And what if we used these APIs to make credit available via any and all apps borrowers use—the UPI payment app used by a vegetable seller, the delivery agent partner app used by a food delivery boy, or the accounting software used by an SME—all of them.</p><blockquote><strong>This is OCEN</strong>—the Open Credit Enablement Network. A single API with a uniform flow to power a billion loans for India.</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div><p>

</p>
</div> <!--kg-card-end: html--><hr><h2 id="credit-as-an-sdk-for-indian-apps">Credit as an SDK for Indian apps</h2><p><br>In India, the <strong><em>design</em></strong> of financial products is held hostage by distribution costs. Today large lenders favour larger ticket size loans because they create enough unit margin to cover the costs of distribution, servicing, and collections. The unit-economics of sachet-sized loans can be improved through a digital paperless customer experience. By lowering CAC, op-ex, and collection costs, through digitisation, &nbsp;we can make a small ticket-size loan of around ₹10,000 with a repayment cycle of a few days viable for even the largest banks. </p><p>Further, India needs new ways of <em><strong>distributing</strong></em> these credit products at massive scale. Only deeply-embedded digital distribution at scale can make smaller and affordable credit products economically viable for lenders. We can achieve this by seamlessly embedding lending flows into the very activity the credit is funding:</p><p><em>Credit for fuel for a trucker should be available at the point and time of fuelling.</em></p><p><em>A kirana store needs credit offers at the time of placing orders with their distributor.</em></p><p><em>A B2B SME struggling to collect payments from corporates, needs invoice financing immediately after a completed delivery.</em></p><p>Enabling these flows requires us to move selling loans via generic DSAs, agents, and towards specialised originators that work and transact deeply with the end-borrower in specific business flows. These entities haven't distributed financial products historically and are unfamiliar with existing paper-based processes of lenders, and are unwilling to take them on. </p><p>For specialised origination to work, we need to remove the barriers between lenders and these new-age originators. With <a href="https://lsp-spec.setu.co/">OCEN APIs</a> loan applications will be simplified, standardised, and digitised thus making it easier for new types of distributors to integrate and work with multiple lenders. Thus extending their ability to reach, underwrite, and collect from a borrower anywhere in the country.</p><p>In effect, India needs a new class of loan products—both in terms of design and distribution—to meet the special needs of the trucker, the kirana store and the B2B manufacturer, and to enable specialised lenders to reach these borrowers.</p><hr><figure><img src="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg" alt="" width="5606" height="2035" srcset="https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 1000w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 1600w, https://the-other-side.blog/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/Frame-48.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Setu's OCEN APIs</figcaption></figure><p>The OCEN APIs enable financial institutions to deliver their products to wherever their customers are. A standardised API between a lender and a mobile app provider means the kirana store can get and manage a loan entirely on a non-financial app like WhatsApp—no paperwork, no branch visits, and no phone calls. </p><blockquote>OCEN APIs are <strong>designed for easy plug and play by customer facing platforms and apps</strong>, with minimal integration efforts.</blockquote><p>The OCEN APIs thus create a common interface—like UPI—so that value-chain players who are close to an MSME and financial institutions which have a deep understanding of the MSME’s business can come together to create a new class of loan products.</p><p>At Setu, we have been keen students of OCEN since inception. We've worked hard to be the first place to experience live OCEN APIs, and are excited about accelerating this invention of new loan products to serve the 63 million credit-starved MSMEs of India to unlock an opportunity worth ₹25 lakh crores.

<p><span>I have read a lot of Marx, and always want to read more. Marx is rightly regarded as the greatest social theorist. Marx was legendary synthesiser of thought. In this regard, <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/values-in-economics/">Habermas</a> – the <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/the-most-important-social-scientist-since-keynes/">greatest moral philosopher since Kant</a> – is his true heir. </span></p>
<p><span>Marx also created a framework of making sense of social change, organisation and power which is unrivalled in its completeness and coherence. In addition to his profound perceptiveness, this very coherence and completeness appeals in its own right. But I feel a different form of intellectual affinity with Marx. The coherence he attributes to social evolution is also the weakness in his framework. Marx, if you take his writing as a whole, knew this instinctively. There is a coherent theory of social evolution to be found in his writings, but there is also repeated arbitrary divergence from this theory and creative, chaotic asides that make his writing so absorbing. We can thank Marx for providing a theory of social change, a theoretical ‘ideal type’. It is a model that it almost always pertinent, but – perhaps always – incomplete, and often completely misleading.</span></p>
<p><span>A perspective I have long held about markets I partly attribute to Marx. It is actually an argument for the moral force of markets (not capitalism, per se, but certainly markets) – that free exchange is the antithesis of tribalism. The great French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, put it most succinctly: “In order to trade, we must first lay down our spear”. Marx, too, saw very clearly how global capitalism could be the enemy of tribal nationalism.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps intriguingly, I also want to bring Hayek in here. Hayek, Marx and Mauss view markets in ways which are far more instructive than that present in microeconomic textbooks. And here simplistic economic ideology has hindered understanding. So, one evolutionary function of markets is as a positive-sum method of conflict resolution. Everyone should be aware of this. If we perceive there to be a finite resource – say oil – let us use prices to determine who gets what, and incentivise the invention of substitutes. It’s better than the alternative. </span></p>
<p><span>Hayek diverges from the standard micro-theory of markets by assuming imperfect information – quite rightly – and focussing on the role markets play in processing information. This too is profoundly insightful. In Hayek’s view, capital seeks informational advantages – this is a motivating force. If we already knew everything, we would do nothing. The pursuit of ‘excess return’ is the very lifeblood of innovative and dynamic capital. </span></p>
<p><span>Hayek’s observations on the distribution of information are equally important. His critique of central planning significantly resides in the insight that the most important information is local to the individual and unobservable – it is in our heads. Only the individual knows what they want at any point in time.</span></p>
<p><span>As an aside, it is worth noting that Keynes, unsurprisingly, was the most astute psychologist in this cannon of thinkers on the motives of capital. He was totally open to the likelihood that many of the greatest investors – i.e. those that had the longest time-horizons and made the greatest contributions to human well-being – were motivated by nothing more than fascination at what could be achieved.</span></p>
<p><span>How does any of this bear on my discussion with Chris? My sense is that the motives and forms of capital at work in our societies are more diverse than at any point since the industrial revolution.  As Mark and I argue in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Angrynomics-Eric-Lonergan/dp/1788212797/ref=sxts_sxwds-bia-wc-p13n1_0?adgrpid=100757164789&amp;cv_ct_cx=angrynomics&amp;dchild=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw0_T4BRBlEiwAwoEiAWWpdQP-57O0aMprUkKmpjQbVHNLZX8R0CBQQI7Zar3_prk6eVgopBoCIKEQAvD_BwE&amp;hvadid=435785345402&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=9045955&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=17321262343375037874&amp;hvtargid=kwd-884601278301&amp;hydadcr=24397_1816021&amp;keywords=angrynomics&amp;pd_rd_i=1788212797&amp;pd_rd_r=9a0d48ba-8492-4b48-b95c-ff635870897b&amp;pd_rd_w=RS60x&amp;pd_rd_wg=H99aG&amp;pf_rd_p=9b1a9511-9af9-4d06-8643-d54ebec511ef&amp;pf_rd_r=AP1416WT4M1BSGAJVPF5&amp;psc=1&amp;qid=1595773559&amp;sr=1-1-fdbae751-0fa5-4c0f-900b-865654896618&amp;tag=googhydr-21">Angrynomics</a></em>, deregulation has set capital against capital, and asset price delusions add spice to this chaos. Myopic speculators finance blue-sky infinite-horizon destroyers of capital, such as Elon Musk – the world’s embodiment of a Keynesian investor.  Somewhat hilariously, a new form of elite social status – start-upism – is fantastically anti-capital, and its effects are super-charged by the secular collapse in the cost of semi-conductors. Despite its importance, none of this was predictable.</span></p>
<p><span>I struggle to see capital as the obstacle to progress in this world. If anything, a chaotic series of capitalist motivations – a collapse in the cost of debt to the state and a plethora of extraordinary technological innovations – have provided us with the very <a href="https://www.philosophyofmoney.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/PM-Europe-roundtable.pdf">means to tackle our greatest challenges</a>. The failure of innovation is in public policy and democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span>This leads me in conclusion to more a ominous question. Hayek explained why China could not succeed. Central planning doesn’t work because the most important information is in our heads – only we know what we want to do. Really? Why has China progressed more rapidly and pervasively than any other major economy in AI, machine learning, fintech and social media. Because the contents of our minds is now available to the social planner. Is Marx about to have the last laugh?</span></p>

<p>I’ve been enjoying the ongoing <a href="http://psas.scripts.mit.edu/home/2020-workshop-information/">MIT STAMP workshop</a>. In particular, I’ve been enjoying listening to Nancy Leveson talk about system safety. Leveson is a giant in the safety research community (and, incidentally, an author of <a href="http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/nver-tse.pdf">my favorite software engineering study</a>). She’s also a critic of <em>root cause</em> and <em>human error</em> as explanations for accidents.  Despite this, she has a different perspective on safety than many in the resilience engineering community. To sharpen my thinking, I’m going to capture my understanding of this difference in this post below.</p>



<p>From Leveson’s perspective, <em>the engineering design should ensure that the system is safe</em>. More specifically, the design should contain <em>controls</em> that eliminate or mitigate <em>hazards</em>. In this view, accidents are invariably attributable to design errors: a hazard in the system was not effectively controlled in the design. </p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"The operator's job is to make up for the holes in the designer's work." – Jens Rasmussen (1981)</p>— John Allspaw (@allspaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/allspaw/status/225615911074267136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2012</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>By contrast, many in the resilience engineering community claim that <em>design alone cannot ensure that the system is safe.</em> The idea here is that the system design will always be incomplete, and the human operators must adapt their local work to make up for the gaps in the designed system. These adaptations usually contribute to safety, and sometimes contribute to incidents, and in post-incident investigations we often only notice the latter case.</p>



<p>These perspectives are quite different. Leveson believes that depending on human adaptation in the system is itself dangerous. If we’re depending on human adaptation to achieve system safety, then the design engineers have not done their jobs properly in controlling hazards. The resilience engineering folks believe that depending on human adaptation is <em>inevitable</em>, because of the messy nature of complex systems.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>As demonstrated in the previous articles of this website, I've always been interested into running my own code on consumer devices.</p>
<p>In this series of two articles, we'll have a look at the well-known Google Home Mini.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we'll have to go rather deep into the rabbit hole. Various topics and techniques will be explored.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://courk.cc/running-custom-code-google-home-mini-part1/assets/google_mini_intro.png"></p><p>The Google Home Mini</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr>

<p>First things first, let's start by a general overview of the Google Home Mini Hardware.</p>
<p>Cracking the case open reveal the following PCB. Important components are all annotated. Some RF shields have been removed to expose the components.</p>
<p><a href="#" id="gmini-openseadragon-top-button">Top Side</a> - <a href="#" id="gmini-openseadragon-bottom-button">Bottom Side</a>
</p>


<p>
       The main Google Home Mini MPU. It's a ARM-based SoC manufactured by Marvell and branded as "ARMADA 1500 Mini Plus".
    </p>
<p>
       A TC58NVG1S3HBAI6 256 MB NAND Flash. It contains the entire firmware of the Google Home Mini
    </p>
<p>
       This push button is not accessible without cracking the case open. Pushing it at boot time will force the bootloader to boot from the USB port of the device. However, only signed code can theoretically be executed.
    </p>
<p>
       One of the two MEMS microphone of the device. The acoustic hole is on the other side of the PCB.
    </p>
<p>
       One of the two MEMS microphone of the device. The acoustic hole is on the other side of the PCB.
    </p>
<p>
       The main speaker of the Google Home can be plugged to this two pins connector.
    </p>
<p>
       A LED Driver. It communicates with the MPU via an i2c bus.
    </p>
<p>
       An audio CODEC, driving the main speaker. It communicates with the MPU via i2c and I2S buses.
    </p>
<p>
       A DDR memory, used by the main processor.
    </p>
<p>
       A WLAN/BT module, manufactured by Marvell.
    </p>
<p>
       A mechanical switch, used to disable and enable the microphones.
    </p>
<p>
       A micro USB port. It provides power to the entire system. Data lines are also routed to the main processor.
    </p>
<p><em>Quick side note: So far, I have opened two Google Home Mini. On these two units, the NAND Flash component used isn't the same. However, to keep things simple, this article will expect a <code>TC58NVG1S3HBAI6</code> flash is used all along.</em></p>
<p>Most components are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_grid_array">BGA</a> components. It makes reverse-engineering the system harder: difficult for instance to probe individual signals between two integrated circuits. Further, reliably reworking the board (i.e. desoldering and soldering back a component) requires quite some skills.</p>
<p>I didn't find any active <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG">JTAG</a> interface during my research. Same goes for debug <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a> test points.</p>
<p>Finally, it's important to note that the main CPU comes without public documentation. Very few details about this component are available online. All the juicy technical data is likely protected by a <em>NDA</em>.</p>
<p>To conclude, at first sight, the hardware looks rather annoying to work with and doesn't appear to be very <em>talkative</em>.</p>
<hr>

<p>As you might expect, I'm not the only one who has been studying the Google Home devices. Here is a quick summary of what others have discovered at the time of writing of this article.</p>
<h2 id="chromecast vulnerabilities">Chromecast Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The hardware and software of the Google Home Mini is very close to what is embedded into Google Chromecast devices. Hence, it's interesting to have a look at what have been discovered against this product.  </p>
<p>In 2014, <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/">fail0verflow</a> was able to root Chromecast devices with a vulnerability affecting the bootloader. A buffer overflow vulnerability triggered thanks to a special USB peripheral led to a full secure boot bypass. The vulnerability is detailed <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/2014/hubcap-chromecast-root-pt1/">here</a> and <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/2014/hubcap-chromecast-root-pt2/">there</a>.</p>
<p>The vulnerability has now been patched and the Google Home family was never affected by the issue.</p>
<p>However, the work from <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/">fail0verflow</a> has two interesting takeaways for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many eyes already had a look at the bootloader. It's reducing the likelihood I can still discover something to exploit in it to bypass the secure boot on a Google Home Mini.</li>
<li>The articles highlight that Google has released the source code for the bootloader and Linux Kernel running on the Chromecast. Same goes for the Google Home family. Everything is available <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/0B3j4zj2IQp7MZkplRzRvcERtaU0">here</a>. This source code will be extremely useful in the second article of this series.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="defcon27 presentation">DEFCON27 Presentation</h2>
<p>Another very important piece of information is the presentation given during <a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20presentations/">DEFCON27</a> untitled <em>"Breaking Google Home: Exploit It with SQLite(Magellan)"</em>. The slides are available <a href="https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20presentations/DEFCON-27-Wenxiang-Qian-Yuxiang-Li-Huiyu-Wu-Breaking-Google-Home-Exploit-It-with-SQLite-Magellan.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the presentation, an attack affecting the userspace software of the Google Home is detailed. This led to the result I want to achieve: code execution on the Google Home.</p>
<p>While extremely informative, the attack described by the presentation cannot be used against my own device anymore. The bugs have all been patched already.</p>
<p>However, the presentation contains an interesting slide that summarizes quite well what the attack surface of the Google Home Mini is.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://courk.cc/running-custom-code-google-home-mini-part1/assets/google_mini_attack_surface.png"></p><p>The Google Home Mini attack surface</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <a href="https://fail0verflow.com/blog/">fail0verflow</a> work is shown, as well as possible network attacks that are explored in the presentation.</p>
<p>What's left is to research vulnerabilities on the WiFi/BLE module of the device or to modify the firmware stored in the NAND Flash of the device.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my own goal">My Own Goal</h2>
<p>These studies make very clear that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Google Home Mini is protected by some kind of secure boot. Bootloader and Kernel are cryptographically verified.</li>
<li>Many interesting attack vectors have already been explored.</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering this, I chose to go the the <em>NAND Flash way</em>.</p>
<p><strong>My goal will be to modify the NAND flash content until I can execute my own code.</strong></p>
<p><em>"What's the point?"</em> you might ask. Well, here are a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's the most direct way of achieving code execution on the platform.</li>
<li>Dynamic analysis of the Goggle Home software <strong>running on the actual hardware</strong> becomes possible.</li>
<li>Similarly, it may be useful to explore the WiFi/BT module attack vector.</li>
<li>As explained before, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip">SoC</a> of the Google Home Mini comes without any public documentation. Being able to run custom code on it is valuable to understand it better. Things like dumping the <em>BootROM</em> of the system becomes possible.</li>
<li>Last but not least, it's an interesting challenge that will need me to go down the rabbit hole. The content and structure of the NAND Flash will need to be understood. A exploit could be needed to bypass the secure boot.</li>
</ul>
<p>This path may sound like the easiest way to go to achieve code execution, but an important challenge will first need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Indeed, as I explained in the previous section, the hardware design of the Google Home Mini is not <em>"rework friendly"</em> at all.</p>
<p>The NAND Flash is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_grid_array">BGA</a> component. Desoldering and soldering it back is easier said than done, especially considering I'll likely have to do it multiple times. Some little tricks will need to be used.</p>
<hr>

<h2 id="general concept idea">General Concept Idea</h2>
<p>Repeatedly desoldering and soldering back the NAND Flash would have been annoying and could have caused damage to to the PCB.</p>
<p>Manually soldering thin wires to the BGA footprint for breaking out the NAND Flash lines could have been risky because of signal integrity issues. It wouldn't have been a very clean and, more importantly, reliable solution.</p>
<p>Hence, to overcome this burden, I developed <em>NandBug</em>.</p>
<p><em>NandBug</em> is composed of three boards:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Interposer Board</em> that's soldered to the Google Home Mini PCB, right at the NAND Flash location. This board breaks out the NAND Flash signals to a tiny connector.</li>
<li>The <em>Main Board</em>, that can be connected to both the <em>Interposer Board</em> and <em>Daughter Board</em>. It can communicate with a computer through a USB interface.</li>
<li>The <em>Daughter Board</em>. The delicate BGA NAND Flash IC is soldered to this board.</li>
</ul>
<p>The general concept of <em>NandBug</em> is described by the following diagram.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In a word, thanks to this system, the NAND Flash IC can be accessed from both the Google Home circuit and the electronic of the <em>Main Board</em>.</p>

</div>

</div>
<p>The general idea is in fact to make the NAND Flash of the Google Home <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-system_programming">in-system programmable</a>. It may sound like an over engineered solution and it maybe is. But, hey, I'm doing this project for fun anyway.</p>

</p>


<p>
       An ICE40 FPGA.
    </p>
<p>
       A FT2232H. This component adds Hi-Speed USB connectivity to the board.
    </p>
<p>
       An EEPROM. It contains configuration data for the FT2232H.
    </p>
<p>
       A dual output low dropout voltage regulator, used to provide power to the FPGA.
    </p>
<p>
       Three general purpose red LEDs and associated current-limiting resistors
    </p>
<p>
       Connector for the daughter board PCB. Optionally, a NAND Flash can be directly soldered to the board.
    </p>
<p>
       A micro-USB connector, used for power and data transfer.
    </p>
<p>
       The Interposer Board Connector.
    </p>
<p>The main component of this board is a <code>ICE40HX1K-TQ144</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array">FPGA</a>. This <a href="http://www.latticesemi.com/iCE40">component</a> has been chosen for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's reasonably priced.</li>
<li>Its bitstream format has been <a href="http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/">reverse-engineered</a> and it is now supported by open source toolchains.</li>
</ul>
<p>This FPGA can be configured in different ways: dumping the NAND content as well as programming it is possible. It can also be configured as a pass-through to let the Google Home Mini access to the NAND Flash directly.</p>
<p>A <code>FT2232H</code> is connected to the FPGA. This component adds USB connectivity to the main board and serves two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending various configuration bitstreams to the FPGA. This is done by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface">SPI</a> protocol and a couple of additional GPIOs.</li>
<li>Receiving and transmitting data to and from the NAND Flash. This is done using the <em>Synchronous FIFO mode</em> of the <code>FT2…</code></li></ul></div></div>

<p>Our vision of the smart home today is a series of disaggregated interactions with smart devices that control the domestic flow of a household, from controlling light ambience and temperature control to front door security. However, Big Tech’s move into the smart home space is reflective of a vastly different approach. Consumer-focused Big Tech, Google Amazon and Apple are interested in the smart home as an extension of the consumer’s interaction with the digital world – where their core propositions lie. Currently, a consumer’s interactions with Big Tech’s core propositions whether it is search, commerce or software is through the mobile or the desktop. An individual in the privacy and the comfort of the home represents an opportunity to create a touchpoint that transcends both the desktop and the mobile. However, a disaggregated bundle of smart devices, while utility-driven, don’t tap into the full potential of a truly high tech smart home ‘experience’. So what is the lucrative future big tech is chasing in consumer homes?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Across all three consumer tech companies, their approach to reach the consumer within their home has been through the combination of an AI assistant paired with a smart speaker, a voice portal to the digital world. In thinking about transcending interactions beyond mobile or desktop, voice-based interactions are an almost natural evolution. Voice is both intuitive and hands-free and eminently suited to the quiet and privacy of the home. For this reason, dominating voice-based interactions has become the front line in the battle for a lead on smart homes. While the market is currently segregated largely between Amazon’s Alexa/Echo and Google’s Assistant/Home, Apple has made a tentative first step with the Apple Pod. The real motivator is to become the gatekeeper of our digital interactions in the home insofar as they evolve beyond the mobile and the desktop.</p>



<h3>The voice portal: a defensive and offensive strategy</h3>



<p>For Big Tech the voice portal represents two-fold value. The first it helps to bulwark their existing core propositions from erosion. For example, Google dominates search and will want to ensure that it retains that dominance even as search evolves to include voice-based search. Similarly Google and Apple’s role as gatekeepers of software through the Android and iOS app stores and Amazon’s dominance in e-commerce benefit similarly by capturing and dominating any evolution of these propositions through voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second is the more important value to pursue. It is that the voice portal and all of its interactions represent an opportunity to create new and fertile fields for Big Tech to laterally expand its core proposition. The closest representations of this lateral expansion is perhaps the app store. The mobile app store acted as the gateway to the consumer’s experience of the mobile phone. Similarly, when wearables became mainstream, smartwatch specific app stores focused on leveraging the smart watch’s specific mode of interaction determined the consumer’s experience of wearables. In a similar vein, the AI assistant and speaker combination acts as the app store equivalent for voice specific interactions. Just as existing digital services built for the mobile and the smartwatch, they will build for voice-based interactions by integrating with voice-enabled AI assistants.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Smart home devices versus a smart home experience&nbsp;</h3>



<p>When we’re talking about smart home devices, it can range from a thermostat to a smart fridge – many of the use cases will require specific hardware that results in some type of discrete action. A smart home experience, on the other hand, would require an underlying cohesion that held the home ecosystem together and enhanced the resident’s life – this extends beyond isolated devices that perform isolated functions. We can think of the voice portal as the underlying system that provides cohesion for the smart home, needing to deliver an experience as robust and desirable as the digital experience currently available to us through phones and computers. When users feel notifications on their phone are equal in value to the notifications on their smart speaker, that’s when the portal really opens up to allow for immense value capture. This kind of potential is then able to be channelled profitably through killer applications catered to the voice portal. But let’s take a deeper look at why the experience, as opposed to discrete function, lends itself to greater adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For the voice portal to become accessible to a broad audience, users have to be convinced of the added value in the experience of voice interactions. But in order to do this the voice portal will need applications that demonstrate value-add in a meaningful way – where the convenience and experience outweigh the cognitive expense of the transition to voice. To understand this, we can break down the tiers of voice interaction. While the more complex interactions bear a higher cognitive burden they are also the most lucrative opportunities to create an experience rather than an isolated function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tier 1: Routine one-way interaction</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong>&nbsp; smart device feeds you information based on preset prompts – e.g. Lights turn on at a certain hour, reads the weather every morning etc.</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden: </strong>little to no cognitive expense on the part of the consumer</p>



<p>Tier 2: Two-way interaction:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> you feed information to the device spontaneously and the device reacts – e.g. set an alarm, meeting reminder etc.</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden: </strong>cognitive expense of trusting the device to execute on commands</p>



<p>Tier 3: Consumer interaction</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> purchases through the voice device – e.g. order groceries, pay bills etc</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden: </strong>cognitive expense of trusting the device with the financial element of the consumers life</p>



<p>Tier 4: Push to public interaction</p>



<p><strong>Convenience:</strong> you feed information to platforms on the internet that will be visible to others&nbsp; – e.g. interact with social media through voice dictation&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive Burden:</strong> cognitive expense of trusting the device to signal appropriately to the public, the consumer’s self and reputation</p>



<p>When thinking about the first three types of interaction&nbsp; (one way, two way and consumer) it becomes clear that the original experience remains largely unchanged except for the added convenience of not needing to pick up a device and do it manually. For example, using voice control to turn on the lights, set an alarm, order groceries etc. But ‘push to public interactions’ exhibit characteristics that enhance the existing experience of activities like social media interaction. For example, Facebook might allow for important notifications, status updates, voice dictation for posts etc. More importantly, it could give notifications on social signalling, such as number of likes, comments and other elements that the user would associate with their social capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this way the digital social experience becomes a natural extension of the user’s home life, providing a more plugged in, socially intuitive voice experience that reflects traditional social interactions – the current digital experience of social media is static in the sense that it only exists when the user taps into it. The voice portal would allow users with a preference for it, to integrate their digital and physical social experience in a more seamless way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experience-based functions are superior in being able to deliver additional value capture because they increase touchpoints for existing services while enhancing the experience of those services. ‘User based services’ are then probably best positioned to be the killer applications for voice portals, much like they are for the browser and mobile today. While smart devices and discrete functions are definitely useful, their value add remains scattered without the cohesion of voice enhanced experiences. It then becomes clear why Big Tech is in a race to dominate the home, as they become the gatekeepers to all the value that funnels through the voice portal as users make that transition.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span></h3>
</p>



<h3>1. The execution of voice as a human-centric user interface will determine the adoption of voice-based technologies&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>“Interfaces to digital systems of the future will no longer be machine-driven. They will be human-centric,” explains Werner Vogels, Amazon’s chief technology officer, “We can build human natural interfaces to digital systems and with that, a whole environment will become active.”</p>



<p>“VUI [Voice-user interface] allows for hands-free, efficient interactions that are more ‘human’ in nature than any other form of user interface. “Speech is the fundamental means of human communication,” writes Clifford Nass, Stanford researcher and co-author of Wired for Speech, “…all cultures persuade, inform and build relationships primarily through speech.” In order to create VUI systems that work, developers need to fully understand the intricacies of human communication.”</p>



<p>The benefits of voice as a mode of interaction above traditional user interfaces encompasses the ability to create efficiency and convenience (hands-free), design a more human experience and imbue personality and tone to interactions creating greater brand affinity.</p>



<p>“Google Home is totally au fait with pop culture references, from Star Trek to Sir Mix A Lot, as is Amazon’s Alexa. A more personable tone helps users to forgive those moments when virtual assistants are unable to complete tasks or answer questions that an actual human would have no problem with.”</p>



<p>There are however multiple roadblocks to an immersive and coherent implementation of voice-based technologies.&nbsp;</p>
