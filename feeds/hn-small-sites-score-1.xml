            <p>The most common piece of advice you'll receive if you want to learn programming is that you should do programming to learn it. While this is well-meaning advice, since doing programming is better than reading about it, it's incomplete.</p>

<p>Following this incomplete advice alone can prevent you from falling in love with programming. One of the worst implementations of this advice is learning programming by solving programming riddles.</p>

<h2>Problems with puzzles</h2>

<p>There are many problems with solving riddles, but let's start with isolation. They are isolated from the real world, so once you complete them, you're done with them. They never change. Real-world software does not behave like this. Real-world software has to deal with the only real constant — change. How adaptable your software is to change will tell you how well you're programming. You don't get this feedback by solving puzzles. Change is a great teacher, and it will teach you about the importance of tests early. Riddles can't teach you that.</p>

<p>The next problem with riddles is that they are too focused on algorithms. Unless you plan to work on algorithm-heavy products like Google Search, you shouldn't focus on that. Sure, that knowledge might get handy for technical interviews with companies that emulate FAANG interview practices, but that's a topic for another article.</p>

<p>Another problem with solving riddles is that they give you the wrong picture of programming. Solving puzzles encourages cleverness, while code that's too clever is a smell in real-world software. If it's difficult to understand for people that have to maintain it (this includes your future self, a more forgetful individual than you might think), it's not well written. As Donald Knuth famously said, "Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute. "Good programmers make their code as easy to understand as possible, and solving riddles discourages that. Solving puzzles encourages the most innovative hacks possible, which is excellent if you want to compete in programming competitions, but real-world software is not like that.</p>

<p>Solving riddles can discourage you from learning to program and falling in love with it. I haven't yet met a programmer who said that solving programming riddles made him fall in love with programming. Maybe they exist, but it's usually something else.</p>

<h2>Importance of having a bigger goal</h2>

<p>Solving riddles is the impulsive implementation of this incomplete advice. You are rushing to do some programming, without having a bigger goal. The problem with this is that it's not sustainable. If you don't have a bigger goal, your motivation will be shallow, and you'll be more likely to quit when things get tough. Having a bigger goal will push you through obstacles.</p>

<p>An excellent bigger goal is solving a problem that's currently painful for you. Your local bus has a shitty website, and you have to search like a madman to find the next bus? Scrape their data and build the one yourself, and you'll never have that problem again. You are searching for a new apartment, but you're getting tired of continually refreshing the website for ads? Build a program that does that for you.</p>

<p>Whatever it is, if there's a real-life problem that you would like to get rid of with some programming, that's much better than solving riddles for the sake of it. By doing this, you'll have a much better picture of what programming is and realize how useful it is.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Streaming systems continuously ingest and process data from a variety of data sources. They build on append-only data structures to enable efficient write and read access, targeting low-latency end-to-end. As more of the data sources in applications are machines, the expected volume of continuously generated data has been growing and is expected to grow further [1][2]. Such growth puts pressure on streaming systems to handle machine-generated workloads not only with low latency, but also with high throughput to accommodate high volumes of data.</p>
<p><a href="https://pravega.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pravega</a>&nbsp;(“good speed” in Sanskrit) is an open-source storage system for streams that we have built from the ground up to ingest data from continuous data sources and meet the <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stringent requirements</a> of such streaming workloads. It provides the ability to store an unbounded amount of data per stream using&nbsp;<a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/pravega-concepts/#a-note-on-tiered-storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tiered storage</a>&nbsp;while being <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/pravega-concepts/#elastic-streams-auto-scaling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">elastic</a>, <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/pravega-concepts/#architecture">durable</a> and <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/pravega-concepts/#ordering-guarantees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistent</a>. Both the write and read paths of Pravega have been designed to provide low latency along with high throughput for event streams in addition to features such as long-term retention and stream scaling. This post is a performance evaluation of Pravega focusing on the ability of reading and writing.</p>
<p>To contrast with different design choices, we additionally show results from other systems: <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> and <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/">Apache Pulsar</a>. Initially qualified as messaging systems, both Pulsar and Kafka make a conscious effort to become more like a storage system; they have recently added features like tiered storage. These systems have made fundamentally different design choices, however, leading to different behavior and performance characteristics that we explore in this post.</p>
<p>The main aspects covered in this post and the highlights of our results are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="#pravega-ingestion">Overall ingestion performance</a>.</em>&nbsp;A Pravega writer produces over <strong>1 million events</strong>&nbsp;<strong>per second</strong>&nbsp;<strong>for small events</strong> (100 bytes) and <strong>sustains 350MB/s throughput for large events</strong> (10,000 bytes), both with <strong>single-digit millisecond latency</strong>&nbsp;(at the 95th percentile).</li>
<li><a href="#durability"><em>Durability</em></a>. <strong>Pravega always makes the data durable on acknowledgment</strong>. The write throughput of Kafka is at least 40% less compared to Pravega for a single-segment stream, independent of flushing on every message or not. For a 16-segment stream, the Pravega writer provides comparable throughput to the Kafka writer flushing on every message, but Pravega write latency is lower (<em>i.e.</em>, single-digit millisecond vs. 1+ seconds for Kafka).</li>
<li><em><a href="#dynamic-batching">Dynamically adjusting batches</a>.</em>&nbsp;Pravega <strong>does not</strong>&nbsp;<strong>require a complex configuration for client batching</strong>. The Pulsar client can achieve either low latency or high throughput, but not both. For Kafka, configuring large batches is detrimental for throughput when the application uses routing keys (throughput is 80% lower for a 16-segment stream). In both cases, forcing the user to statically configure batching is undesirable.</li>
<li><em><a href="#high-throughput">Behavior in the presence of large events for throughput-oriented workloads</a>. </em><strong>Pravega obtains up to 350MB/s for a 16-segment stream with 10kB events.&nbsp;</strong>The throughput&nbsp;is 40% higher than the one of Pulsar and comparable to the throughput of Kafka (about 6% difference). However, the latency in the case of Kafka is over 800ms while the one of Pravega is in single-digit milliseconds.</li>
<li><em><a href="#end-to-end-latency">End-to-end latency</a></em>. When tailing a stream, the Pravega reader also provides <strong>single-digit millisecond latency</strong>&nbsp;<strong>end-to-end&nbsp;</strong>while serving data at high throughput. It provides a higher throughput (roughly 80% more) for a single-segment stream when compared to Kafka. For Pulsar, adding partitions and readers leads to lower performance (single-partition case achieves 3.6x the throughput of the 16-segment case).</li>
<li><em><a href="#routing-keys">Use of routing keys</a></em>. <strong>Pravega does not present any significant performance difference when using or omitting routing keys.</strong>&nbsp;For moderate/high throughput rates, Kafka and Pulsar show over 2x end-to-end latency when using routing keys and, specifically for Kafka, a maximum read throughput that is over 37% lower.</li>
<li><em><a href="#historical-catchup">Tiered storage for catch-up and historical reads</a>.</em>&nbsp;Pravega can&nbsp;<strong>catch up with 100GB of historical data dynamically</strong>&nbsp;<strong>while ingesting 100MB per second of new data</strong>. Pulsar with tiering enabled was not able to catch up for the same scenario, inducing a backlog that grows without bounds.</li>
<li><em><a href="#auto-scaling">Performance with auto-scaling</a>. </em><strong>Auto-s</strong><strong>caling is a unique feature of Pravega</strong>. Scaling up a stream provides higher ingestion performance. We show that scaling up a stream using a constant ingestion rate of 100MB/s causes&nbsp;<strong>write latency to drop.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Except when we show time series, we plot latency along with throughput. It is a problem we commonly find across blog posts; they plot either latency or throughput, whereas both are jointly relevant for streaming workloads. For example, the maximum throughput for a given configuration might look very good while the latency is of the order of hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds. We plot latency-throughput graphs to avoid misleading conclusions. We additionally provide tables with the data points used to complement the plots. The tables give more data than the plots (<em>e.g.</em>, different percentile ranks) for completeness.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Pravega is a complex system, and we encourage the reader to investigate further our documentation, including <a href="https://blog.pravega.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous blog posts</a>. Here, we provide a very brief summary of the write and read paths, along with some key points of Kafka and Pulsar.</p>
<h3>The Pravega write path</h3>
<p>Pravega has different APIs for adding data to a stream. In this section, we primarily focus on the <a href="https://pravega.io/docs/latest/javadoc/clients/index.html"><em>event stream API</em></a>.</p>
<p>The <em>event stream writer&nbsp;</em>writes events to a stream. A stream can have parallel segments that can change dynamically according to an auto-scaling policy. When an application provides routing keys, the client uses them to map events to segments.&nbsp; If the routing key is omitted when writing an event, then the client selects a segment randomly.</p>
<p>The client opportunistically batches event data, and writes such batches to a segment. The client controls when to open new batches and close them, but the data for a batch accumulates on the server. The component in Pravega managing segments is called the <em><a href="https://blog.pravega.io/2019/04/22/events-big-or-small-bring-them-on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">segment store</a></em>. The segment store receives such requests to write to a segment, and both add the data to a cache and appends it to a <em>durable log</em>, currently implemented with <a href="https://bookkeeper.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apache BookKeeper</a>. When appending to the durable log, the segment store performs a second round of batching. We have this second level of aggregation to sustain high throughput for use cases in which the message size is small and possibly infrequent.</p>
<p>The log guarantees durability: Pravega acknowledges events once they are made durable to the log, and uses such logs only for recovery. As the segment store keeps a copy of the written data to its cache, it flushes data out of the cache to tiered storage, called <em>long-term storage </em>(LTS), asynchronously.</p>
<p>BookKeeper splits its storage among journal, entry logger, and index. The journal is an append-only data structure, and it is the only data structure critical for the write path. Entry loggers and indexes are used in the read path of BookKeeper. In Pravega, the BookKeeper read path is only exercised during the recovery of segment stores. Consequently, the capacity of the write path depends primarily on the journal and not the other data structures, setting aside any occasional interference they can induce.</p>
<h3>The Pravega read path</h3>
<p>An application reads events individually using instances of the <em>event stream reader</em>. Event stream readers form part of a reader group and internally coordinate the assignment of stream segments. Stream readers read from the assigned segments, and they pull segment data from the segment store. Each time a reader fetches segment data, it fetches as much as it is available, up to a maximum of 1MB.</p>
<p>The segment store always serves data from the cache. If it is a cache hit, then serving the read does not require an additional IO. Otherwise, the segment store fetches the data from LTS in blocks of 1MB, populates the cache, and responds to the client. The segment store does not serve reads reading data from the durable log.</p>
<h3>Pulsar and Kafka</h3>
<p>Both Pulsar and Kafka define themselves as streaming platforms. Pulsar implements a broker that builds on Apache BookKeeper. The broker builds on the abstraction of a managed ledger, which is an unbounded log comprising BookKeeper ledgers that are sequentially organized. BookKeeper is the primary data store of Pulsar, although it optionally enables as part of a recent feature to <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/concepts-tiered-storage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tier data to long-term storage</a>.</p>
<p>Pulsar exposes the topic abstraction, and enables topics to be partitioned. Pulsar producers produce messages to topics.&nbsp; It provides different options for receiving and consuming messages, such as different subscription modes and reading manually from topics.</p>
<p>Kafka also implements a broker and exposes partitioned topics. Kafka does not use an external storage dependency like Pravega and Pulsar; it relies on local broker storage as the primary storage of the system. There is a proposal for <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-405%3A+Kafka+Tiered+Storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding tiered storage to Kafka in open-source</a>, but to our knowledge, it is only available as a <a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/infinite-kafka-storage-in-confluent-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preview feature in the Confluent platform</a>. Consequently, we only compare tiered storage with Pulsar.</p>
<p>Both Pulsar and Kafka implement client batching, and enable the configuration of such batching. For both, two main parameters control client-side batching:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximum batch size</strong>: this is the maximum amount of data that the client is willing to accumulate for a single batch.</li>
<li><strong>Maximum wait time or linger</strong>: this is the maximum amount of time that the client is willing to wait to close a batch and submit it.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is an inherent trade-off between maximum batch size and waiting time: larger batches favor throughput in detriment of latency, whereas shorter waiting times have the opposite effect. If batches can be accumulated fast enough, then it is possible to obtain both high throughput and low …</p></div></div>

<![CDATA[Applying “make invalid states unrepresentable”]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" id="applying-make-invalid-states-unrepresentable">
  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><time itemprop="datePublished">02 October 2020</time></p>

<p>Here are some real life cases of applying one of my
<a href="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/articles/my-principles-for-building-software/">favourite principles</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll try to update this as I come across good examples.</p>

<h2 id="case-1-contiguous-time-periods">Case 1: Contiguous Time Periods</h2>

<p>A straightforward way to represent a period of time is by its start
and end dates (<code>(Date, Date)</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c1.png"></p>

<p>If we need to represent a timeline split in to contiguous periods, it
may be tempting to represent this as a sequence of periods (e.g. <code>List
(Date, Date)</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c2.png"></p>

<p>However, with this representation there can be both gaps in the
timeline and overlapping periods:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c3.png"></p>

<h3 id="improved-representation">Improved Representation</h3>

<p>We can improve this representation so that the contiguous and
non-overlapping constraints always hold, and we can do this in a way
that may remind you of database normalisation - by removing
redundancy.</p>

<p>In a well formed contiguous timeline, the joint start/end
of the adjacent periods are redundant. Contiguous, non-overlapping
splits can simply be represented by a set of dates (<code>Set Date</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c4.png"></p>

<p>You can begin to see how this representation simplifies the system
when you consider how to make a further split in the timeline. In the
list representation, splitting a period requires carefully modifying
the data-structure and ensuring constraints aren’t violated. In the
‘set of dates’ representation you simply add a date to the set.</p>

<p>It is sometimes still useful to represent the periods as a sequence of
start and end dates. It is trivial to project the set of dates in to
this form. As long as the canonical representation is the set, the
constraints will still hold.</p>

<h2 id="case-2-default-contracts">Case 2: Default Contracts</h2>

<p>In this system, a customer pays us a recurring rent based upon a contract.
Contracts last for a fixed amount of time, and when they expire we fall back to
a ‘default contract’. The customer can have many fixed contracts, and can
sign new contracts at any time.</p>

<p>This was represented as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A ‘customers’ table storing
    <ul>
      <li>The customer start date.</li>
      <li>An optional end date, should the customer leave.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A ‘contracts’ table storing
    <ul>
      <li>The contract start date.</li>
      <li>An optional end date, for default contracts that don’t end.</li>
      <li>If it was a ‘fixed’ or ‘default’ contract.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f1.png"></p>
<p>Customer and contract timelines</p>

<p>This representation allows for some undesirable states that are trivial to prevent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The customer may have gaps in their contracts.</li>
  <li>A fixed contract may not have an end date.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f2.png"></p>
<p>Contract gaps</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the API for these contracts allowed you to
modify each individual contract, fixed or default, without guarding against
these states. This shows how a poor choice of
representation propagates itself through the design of a system.</p>

<p>This poor choice was not just a theoretical problem -
gaps in contracts were found on more than one occasion, requiring
hours of engineering effort to hunt down and fix.</p>

<h3 id="improved-representation-1">Improved Representation</h3>

<p>This is easily improved by removing the ‘default’ contracts from the
contract table. If the customer doesn’t have a fixed contract, it is
assumed they are on a default contract:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f3.png"></p>
<p>Inferred default contracts</p>

<p>Now there can no longer be any gaps, and 
the end date of a contract no longer needs to be optional as it only represents fixed contracts.</p>

<p>It’s worth reiterating that this representation can be projected in to the previous
representation using a database view if that form is more convenient. What is
important is that the underlying representation enforces these constraints, it
is not important how you view the data.</p>

<p>As with the first case, a better representation makes the manipulation
of the data structure simpler. In this case, adding a new fixed contract is
greatly simplified. There is no need to create or modify default contracts, or ensure
that the contracts are contiguous.</p>

<h3 id="the-influence-of-object-oriented-thinking">The Influence of Object-Oriented Thinking</h3>

<p>If this improvement seems obvious to you, you may wonder how the
original design happened in the first place.</p>

<p>I think this happens because of atomistic, object-oriented thinking.</p>

<p>In this mindset, the fixed contracts are <em>objects</em>, the default contracts are
<em>objects</em>, and each of these concepts must be reified as a row in a table and
never inferred.
There is a distrust of using any features the database
offers beyond storing or retrieving <em>objects</em>.</p>

<p>This approach is antithetical to quality relational design and
the principle of making invalid states unrepresentable.</p>

<p>It may feel “simpler” on some level, as you don’t really need
to think about your design.
However, as we see here, this lack of forethought inevitably
leads to complexity.</p>

<p>Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon…</p>



<p>Combined, the “Big 4” tech giants are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-valuable-tech-companies-total-worth-trillions-alphabet-stock-record-2020-1">worth over $5 trillion dollars.</a></p>



<p>Humans have a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/grasping-giant-numbers-is-far-from-second-nature-1490952621">problem grasping giant numbers</a>, so to put that figure in perspective, it’s equal to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/insights/worlds-top-economies/">2019 GDP of Japan</a> — and almost a quarter that of the United States.</p>



<p>Despite being <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/the-worlds-most-valuable-brands/#dd07f06119c0">the world’s second-most valuable company,</a> Google’s had a tough month.</p>



<p>The fact that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/technology/google-service-outage.html?">a brief service outage in the US</a> made <a target="_blank" href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/1530213/google-gmail-youtube-hangout-crashed-down/">front-page news worldwide</a> goes to show how dependent people have become on Google and its products…</p>



<p>But far more distressing to the C-Suite must be the news that US Attorney General William Barr is hellbent on bringing an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html">antitrust lawsuit against Google</a> before the election in November — and maybe as early as the beginning of October.</p>



<p>Barr’s Justice Department has set its sights square on Google’s dominance in search.</p>



<p>At the risk of biting the hand that feeds us, I’m going to take a look at what brought Google to this point — and some possible outcomes of the threats to Google’s monopoly on both search and digital advertising.</p>



<h2><strong>Antitrust and Technology</strong></h2>



<p>In the US, antitrust laws <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/antitrust.asp">date back to the Sherman Act,</a> passed in the 1890s.</p>



<p>Antitrust regulations are designed to protect consumers from the adverse impact of one or less than a handful of companies having a monopoly on an essential product or service.</p>



<p>Monopolies represent a barrier to competition — and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/games/off-site/youarehere/pages/pdf/FTC-Competition_How-Comp-Works.pdf">competition is essential</a> in a free-market economy.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="945" height="630" src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic.png" alt="" srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic.png 945w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic-300x200.png 300w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic-768x512.png 768w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic-600x400.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 945px) 100vw, 945px" data-srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic.png 945w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic-300x200.png 300w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic-768x512.png 768w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic-600x400.png 600w" data-src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Monopoly-Graphic.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><em>(Source: </em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thebalance.com/monopoly-4-reasons-it-s-bad-and-its-history-3305945"><em>The Balance</em></a><em>)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Some of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thebalance.com/monopoly-4-reasons-it-s-bad-and-its-history-3305945">commonly cited adverse effects</a> of a monopoly include price-fixing, inferior products and services, and the stifling of innovation.</p>



<p>The first antitrust lawsuits were brought against <a target="_blank" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/274/693">International Harvester</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._American_Tobacco_Co.">American Tobacco…</a></p>



<p>Apparently, both farm machinery and cigarettes were both viewed as essential at the turn of the twentieth century.</p>



<p>Antitrust laws are often used to prevent mergers between large companies that might harm consumers.</p>



<p>When oil giants Exxon and Mobil merged in the late 1990s, they were forced to sell 2,431 gas stations before the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.dividend.com/how-to-invest/5-major-antitrust-mergers/">$80.3 billion deal</a> was allowed to proceed.</p>



<p>Despite this divestiture, Exxon-Mobil was the world’s most valuable company until <a target="_blank" href="https://money.cnn.com/2012/01/25/markets/apple_stock/index.htm">Apple surpassed it in 2012.</a></p>



<p>Digital technology companies have had their fair share of skirmishes over monopoly and antitrust issues with the government, both in the US and around the world.</p>



<p>IBM faced <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_IBM#Twentieth-century_market_power_and_antitrust">over 20 government and private antitrust actions</a> in the 20th century.</p>



<p>On the cusp of the 2000s, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/microsoft-antitrust.asp">Microsoft was sued by the Department of Justice (DoJ)</a> and others to “determine whether the company’s bundling of additional programs into its operating system constituted monopolistic actions.”</p>



<p>These actions were partly a result of the <a target="_blank" href="https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/browser-wars/">“Browser Wars”</a> between Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and their now long-defunct competitor, Netscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Microsoft was accused of intentionally making it difficult for consumers to install software from competitors on Windows machines — and delete Microsoft’s bundled programs.</p>



<p>Microsoft <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theringer.com/tech/2018/5/18/17362452/microsoft-antitrust-lawsuit-netscape-internet-explorer-20-years">lost the case,</a> and the judge called for the company to split into two separate entities called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/babybills.asp">Baby Bills</a>, a reference to the “Baby Bells” created when the government broke up AT&amp;T in the 1980s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Windows OS side of Microsoft’s business was to become a separate corporate entity from the software side.</p>



<p>Ultimately, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/long-antitrust-saga-ends-for-microsoft/">Microsoft settled with the US government</a>, and escaped being split up but it was forced to make <a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/usdoj-antitrust-division-us-v-microsoft-corporation-information-settlement">significant concessions</a> that limited its anticompetitive tactics.</p>



<p>Many observers speculate that the antitrust lawsuits against Microsoft led to Bill Gates stepping down as CEO.</p>



<p>The lawsuits and settlement also fostered a more competitive environment that allowed fledgling startups like Google, Facebook, and Amazon to survive and thrive.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Threats to Google’s Monopoly on Search and Digital Advertising</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Antitrust in the US</strong></h3>



<p>Federal government concerns about Google’s dominance in both search and online advertising really began to pick up steam in summer 2019 when the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html?searchResultPosition=1">opened antitrust investigations</a> into all of the “Big Four” tech giants.</p>



<p>Additionally, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857440/google-antitrust-investigation-attorneys-general-advertising-search">Google finds itself targeted for investigation by 50 state attorneys general</a> for its anticompetitive practices, particularly its dominant share of the digital advertising market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only California and Arizona declined to join the probe.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search.png" alt="" width="720" height="537" srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search.png 560w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" data-srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search.png 560w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search-300x224.png 300w" data-src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Top-5-Companies-Search.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption>(<em>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazon-gaining-google-search-advertising-market-share/">Geekwire</a></em>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 2019, Google accounted for a 31.6% market share of overall digital ad spending and a 73.1% share of search advertising.</p>



<p>Google’s dominance in search is even more staggering…</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="743" src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020.png" alt="" srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020.png 1000w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-300x223.png 300w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-768x571.png 768w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-600x446.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-srcset="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020.png 1000w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-300x223.png 300w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-768x571.png 768w, https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020-600x446.png 600w" data-src="https://seobutler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/statistic_id216573_global-market-share-of-search-engines-2010-2020.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><figcaption><strong>Global Market Share of Search Engines</strong><em> (Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/">Statista</a>)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As of July 2020, Google held an 87% market share in desktop search — its nearest competitor, Bing, accounted for just over 6%.</p>



<p>This disparity has led critics of both major political parties, as well as President Donald Trump, to argue that Google needs to be more strictly regulated — or even split up into smaller entities.</p>



<p>There is precedent for breaking up monopolies in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 1904, John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil controlled <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/doj-and-state-ags-likely-to-file-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-wsj.html">91% of oil production and 85% of oil sales in the US.</a></p>



<p>The Supreme Court ruled in 1911 that Standard Oil was in violation of federal antitrust laws and split the company up into 34 separate entities, including companies that became <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller">ExxonMobil and Chevron.</a></p>



<p>In more recent history, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/att-breakup-spinoff.asp">antitrust lawsuits filed in the early 1970s against AT&amp;T</a> — which operated a legal monopoly on local and long-distance telecommunications for almost a century — broke the company up into seven smaller entities known as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/babybells.asp">“Baby Bells.”</a></p>



<p>In addition to the DoJ and State’s attorney investigations into Google, all of the Big 4’s CEOs were recently summoned to appear remotely before Congress’s <a target="_blank" href="https://judiciary.house.gov/subcommittees/antitrust-commercial-and-administrative-law-116th-congress/">House Judiciary subcommittee on Antitrust.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The subcommittee held the hearing after investigating the Big 4 for over a year.</p>



<p>In the current American political environment, where it often seems like Republicans and Democrats agree on practically nothing, the hearing was surprisingly bipartisan.</p>



<p>By many pundit’s accounts, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/congress-zeroes-in-on-google-during-historic-tech-antitrust-hearing/">Google’s Sundar Pichai faced the most intense scrutiny</a> by lawmakers during the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/T0gJYFX8WVc">almost 6-hour session.</a></p>



<p>Here are the elements of Google’s vast empire that are thought to be most vulnerable to punitive antitrust actions.</p>

<h4>Advertising&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Not only does Google command a lopsided market share in both search advertising and digital advertising as a whole, but it also faces investigation because Google effectively owns and controls every aspect of the online marketplace for selling and purchasing advertising.</p>



<p>Google has achieved its advertising hegemony primarily through acquiring competitors, such as it’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/2008/03/google-seals-do/">2008 buyout of ad-tech firm DoubleClick.</a></p>



<p>Over <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/">70% of Google’s revenue comes from advertising</a> — over $160 billion in 2019.</p>



<p>Any threat to this income stream could have devastating effects on the value of the company.</p>



<p>Investigators and competitors charge that allowing Google to have such complete control over digital advertising is harmful to competition and gives Google an unfair advantage.</p>



<h4>Content</h4>



<p>Content creators and publishers big and small were likely thrilled when Rep. David Cicilline, chairman of the antitrust subcommittee <a target="_blank" href="https://news.yahoo.com/why-does-google-steal-content-201052393.html">straight up asked Pichai,</a> “Why does Google steal content?”</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, Pichai disagreed with the characterization, but Cicilline rejected his response.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congress, he said, has “heard throughout this investigation that Google has stolen content to build your own business. These are consistent reports, and so your testimony that it doesn’t happen is really inconsistent with what we’ve learned during the course of the investigation.”</p>



<p>As Google continually finds new ways to answer search queries using third party content on its own platform, often without attribution or a link to the source, it seems likely that this strategy will come under growing scrutiny.</p>

<h4>Search</h4>



<p>Google’s near-total dominance of search has led to numerous allegations of anticompetition practices — including favoring its own products above competitors in search results.</p>



<p>Founder’s tales of businesses being decimated by Google’s search manipulation and favoritism towards its own offerings abound online — such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/02/14/googles-anti-competitive-practices-decimates-online-shopping-antitrust-column/4718626002/">this one</a> from the founder of comparison shopping site Kelkoo or this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-google-search-favoritism-20150630-story.html">Harvard and Columbia study funded by Yelp.</a></p>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/technology/justice-dept-case-google-search-dominance.html?">According to The New York Times</a>, the DoJ has narrowed its focus to search and may leave action on Google’s advertising practices to the state attorneys, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-google-doj-idUSKBN22R37I">led by Texas Attorney General, Ken Paxton.</a></p>



<p>Paxton says he has not ruled out any possible punishment, including breaking up the company.</p>



<p>By narrowing the focus to search, the DOJ hopes to have a stronger lawsuit that it can file in a more timely fashion.</p>



<p>The federal case is expected to largely drill down on Google’s agreements with Apple and other companies to have Google set as the default search engine on iPhones and other devices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DoJ will likely argue this an anti-competitive practice that puts other search engines at a significant disadvantage.</p>

<h4>Android</h4>



<p>One other possible vulnerability regulators might exploit is the ubiquity of Google’s Android mobile operating system.</p>



<p>Android is by far the most popular mobile OS globally, with a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009/">74.6% market share.</a></p>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-antitrust-google-idUSKBN1XO2UQ">Reports say that the state attorneys</a> are also investigating Android for antitrust violations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EU has already fined Google €4.34 billion for using Android “as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>What is open source</h3><p>Open-source software means that the source code of a software is publicly available. Everyone can read, copy or change the source code which makes the software more trustworthy and long-living than closed source software. Famous and big examples of open-source software projects are the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linux kernel</a>, <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://git.libreoffice.org/core" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibreOffice</a> or <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/?format=HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a> but there are also many many small open-source software projects out there.</p><h3>Benefits</h3><p>If you can read code, you are actually able to understand and evaluate what is happening when you execute that software. Not only what the software pretends to do but rather what it really does.</p><p>This feature also allows everyone to scan the source code for security vulnerabilities or other weaknesses of any kind, which adds to the trustworthiness mentioned above.</p><p>Another main advantage is that you are able to request help from basically every user/contributor of that software which is mostly faster and provides more creative solutions than most commercial support.</p><p>Also, the software is not only dependent on the original author and can be maintained and extended by the community. There can be even different versions of the same software with different features. If the community thinks it would not be a good idea to add a specific feature, someone can copy the source code and release their own version of it.</p><p>You can learn a lot, and I mean really a lot! </p><p>Reading and understanding the source code of other programs may not be easy, especially if the software is relative complex, but you will learn a lot in the progress as you are confronted with ideas and solutions from many other people which spend sometimes hours, days or even longer with a specific problem and came up with a solution.</p><p>If you are also willing to contribute and not only to use the software you gain another few advantages.</p><p>You will be forced to think way more about your problem than with closed source. As the software will be used by many other people, it is not only your specific use case which is relevant. This forces you to gain a deeper understanding of the concrete problem and you are also forced to think of reasonable abstractions and edge cases as well as configurability.</p><p>Another important step, which is often not really recognized is that it is not only important to fix the problem or build that feature, it is also very important to write readable and maintainable code, otherwise no one will be able to touch it and as the software evolves it may be removed eventually because no one understands.</p><p>As everyone knows, good documentation is key, you actually need to write documentation, otherwise, no one will be able to use your cool new feature</p><p>and the community of that project will not be happy and may not even merge your cool new feature. This all may sound difficult, but I think you will learn key skills which are important or beneficial for your whole career as a software engineer.</p><p>It is especially beneficial for job applications because others can really see what you are doing rather than just talking about it or even worse, test your skills on a whiteboard.</p><p>Another major advantage is the joy you feel when others actually use the software you have written, especially if it will be used in ways you don't even consider.</p><h3>Disadvantages</h3><p>What may be viewed as a disadvantage is the monetization of your product. As this is true at the first glance, there are also ways of making money with open-source software.</p><p>If your software is a service you could provide a hosted solution where users would have to pay money to use it, but if they really want and have the resources they could also host it themselves.</p><p>On the other hand, you are an expert in using, customizing and developing the software, so if others need support they could hire you to help them.</p><p>Some individuals or companies are also sponsoring open source software maintainer through <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Sponsors</a> or <a href="https://www.patreon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> for example.</p><p>If your software grows and more and more people are contributing to it you will have no other choice than to set up some processes, like: "When is someone allowed to merge a PR?", "Who decides if something will be added or not?", "Who has the last word in case a conflict arises?", "What documentation is mandatory?", "Do we raise money?"(In case of a non-profit open-source project), "What kind of merchandising are producing?" and there are many many more, that are all questions that came to my mind in less than 5 minutes. To set up such rules and processes will feel cumbersome at the beginning, but you will not be able to grow your project without. There is no silver bullet, you will need to think of processes and rules on your own, what is applicable to your project, but sure you can grab inspiration from other open-source software projects.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Open-source software is very popular because of the trust this gives its users. Contributing to it also has a bunch of advantages for the contributing</p><p>individuals although it is way harder than working on individual and closed source software as you need to pay attention to more and greater details and you can even earn some money with it. </p></div></div>]]>

      <h2>What you could steal from the Kakoune code editor right now, and get away with it</h2>

<p><a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a> is a (fairly) young modal code editor
that has matured for as long and as well as a good red wine. It places
multiple-selections, operability and interactivity at the heart of its
distinctive characteristics. It provides users with an efficient and
comfortable text editing experience — but that’s not what this article
is about.</p>

<p>Now 8 years old at the time of writing, Kakoune has gone through several
iterations that removed a dependency here, optimised a core feature there,
even factorised entire parts of its codebase! And as any long-term user
will tell you, it’s easy to take all that good stuff for granted.</p>

<p>So here it is. I’m stopping time for a couple minutes, and listing in
this article a few things that the Kakoune project does well in several
dimensions. Some are technical, but the rest should hopefully be easily
adaptable to other projects (whether they are code editors or not), and
generic enough to be adopted seamlessly.</p>

<p>Now why does the title of this piece mention stealing? Read on, that’s item
number one.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-licensing-model">From its licensing model</h2>

<p>If something doesn’t belong to anybody, is it stealing if you take it for
yourself? What if it belongs equally to everybody?</p>

<p>Fortunately we don’t need to solve that problem: Kakoune is a public domain
project. Which means that anyone is free to do anything they want with the
source code of the editor, no questions asked.</p>

<p>This has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the tool can be shipped with any distribution or suite, regardless of
licensing</li>
  <li>users can modify the code (to fix bugs, add new features or tweak already
existing ones etc.) and publish it (or compiled binaries) without worrying
about attribution</li>
  <li>it lifts some weight of responsibility of the maintainer for the whole
project, which anyone can re-brand or heavily modify to their liking</li>
</ul>

<p>Users don’t like paying for tools, and when they are free and open-source,
I’d argue that they turn out to be more useful (with several iterations,
over time) in the end if they place no limits on what users are allowed to
do with the code.</p>

<p>I’m not in favour of abolishing licenses, I think it would be more
productive for everyone if specialised tools were in the public
domain. In fact, the Kakoune project <em>is</em> licensed, under the
<a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/">terms</a> of the
<a href="https://unlicense.org/">UNLICENSE</a>, in order to avoid conflicts with
jurisdictions that don’t recognise the <em>public domain</em> model.</p>

<p>As for the small riddle above, that’s a tough one, bordering on the
philosophical, but since we’re talking about replicating data, we can easily
break out of that paradox: copying is not stealing.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-code">From its code</h2>

<p>New comers like to praise Kakoune for having a clean codebase, easy to
navigate and modify. And for good reason! Written in C++, the code uses the
smallest amount of bells and whistles possible to keep the code elegant,
compilable with (reasonably) old compiler versions, but more importantly
convenient.</p>

<p>And when it comes to convenience, Kakoune has some interesting assets your
project could benefit from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a header-only implementation of a diffing algorithm
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/diff.hh">diff.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a regex engine mostly following the ECMA syntax — this implementation
allowed the project to drop
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/regex/doc/html/index.html">boost::regex</a>
as a dependency
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/regex.hh">regex.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a minimal JSON (un)marshaller
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/json.hh">json.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a custom hash map implementation
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/hash_map.hh">hash_map.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>wrappers for string types (e.g. string view) and associated utilities:
join, wrap, split, quote, pad etc.
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/string.hh">string.hh</a>
· <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/string_utils.hh">string_utils.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>various functional range filters: filter, transform, gather, map etc.
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/ranges.hh">ranges.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>an implementation of Go’s defer statement that runs code once the execution
flow leaves the current scope
(<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Defer_statements">Go specification</a>
· <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/utils.hh#L53">utils.hh</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above snippets are not exactly drop-in, as they are still coupled to
custom types defined for the editor, but should nonetheless be adaptable
without much difficulty to other C++ projects.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-user-interface">From its user interface</h2>

<p>Originally an easter-egg that savvy users found out about by reading the
code that handles the terminal client’s user interface, the Clippy character
has become a mascot that is now enabled out of the box. However, although
it’s undeniable that nostalgia for Microsoft Office’s assistant has fuelled
prolonged interest in Clippy itself, the easter egg’s notoriety has cast a
shadow on the larger feature it’s a prisoner of: the auto-info pop up window.</p>

<p>The auto-info window is a big contributor to the general level of
interactivity the editor provide, as it pops up any time the user hits a
key in normal mode or has typed a function name in the command prompt. Its
purpose is to provide instant feedback to the user, communicate usage
information or possible options that are available to the user. Every time
I’m using a terminal program that lets me type commands but never hints
at what parameters they take, I sorely wished more people would steal that
from Kakoune!</p>

<p>Another command prompt related improvement that the editor proposes is
fuzzy matching: the user doesn’t need to type out letters that make up
the name of the command they need in order, which makes for much faster
completion selection, and increased discoverability.</p>

<p>All command names in Kakoune are WORDS that start with the name of the
functionality group they belong to. The examples below follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to figure out what commands interact with the buffer, typing <code>:buff</code>
would return candidates like <code>buffer-next</code>, <code>lint-buffer</code>,
<code>format-buffer</code>…</li>
  <li>to call the <code>lint-buffer</code> command, typing <code>:lb&lt;tab&gt;</code> would insert the
entire command name in the prompt</li>
</ul>

<p>Use Kakoune once, and you’ll wish your browser enabled fuzzy
matching in your history/bookmarks for the rest of your days. But
you might wonder: there are individual tools that handles
fuzzy-matching, like <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy">fzy</a>, what if the user would rather
use them to handle opening, for example, files? Great question! Read on,
that’s the next dimension I want you to steal from.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-philosophy">From its philosophy</h2>

<p>The UNIX philosophy states that tools should focus on doing one thing,
and do it well. The implications are that tools that implement too many
unrelated features end up providing users with an underwhelming experience
because they only allow so much granularity over their behaviour, and that
their maintainers are spread too thin to improve/fix them.</p>

<p>If we re-frame this into the context of text editing, editors should only
worry about exactly that — text editing. And Kakoune does its job as
a UNIX citizen brilliantly, but it also goes one step further: it allows
other tools to interact with it, via shell scripting.</p>

<p>Remember the case of spawning a third-party fuzzy matching program,
above? Without getting into details, in Kakoune you’d implement that by
spawning a new terminal (or pane/tab), which would run the program, and
its output would be interpreted by the editor. Users are free to run any
program they want, any terminal or multiplexer they prefer.</p>

<p>And the concept isn’t bound to terminal programs either, although they are
probably the type of tools that Kakoune users would intuitively want to
interact with, on account of the editor being one itself. For example, do
you want to edit a file using a graphical interface? Try the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>:edit %sh{zenity --file-selection}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If that doesn’t sound anything special, it means that it makes
sense. Unfortunately, the field of text editors on UNIX systems has over
the years turned into an archipelago, in which every editor aims at being an
island. Job management, shell, terminal emulation,&nbsp;window multiplexing…
Text editors have turned into closed ecosystems (or Integrated Development
Environments) that provide many (sometimes cardboard-looking) features
unrelated to editing, which new comers have to buy into, or be left out in
the cold.</p>

<p>So here’s an idea everybody should not feel guilty about stealing, if
applicable to their projects: don’t re-invent the wheel, we have enough
bad imitations already<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> — instead, work on ways to make your tools
interface with others more easily!</p>

channel: #kakoune @ FreeNode.</p>

      <h2>What you could steal from the Kakoune code editor right now, and get away with it</h2>

<p><a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a> is a (fairly) young modal code editor
that has matured for as long and as well as a good red wine. It places
multiple-selections, operability and interactivity at the heart of its
distinctive characteristics. It provides users with an efficient and
comfortable text editing experience — but that’s not what this article
is about.</p>

<p>Now 8 years old at the time of writing, Kakoune has gone through several
iterations that removed a dependency here, optimised a core feature there,
even factorised entire parts of its codebase! And as any long-term user
will tell you, it’s easy to take all that good stuff for granted.</p>

<p>So here it is. I’m stopping time for a couple minutes, and listing in
this article a few things that the Kakoune project does well in several
dimensions. Some are technical, but the rest should hopefully be easily
adaptable to other projects (whether they are code editors or not), and
generic enough to be adopted seamlessly.</p>

<p>Now why does the title of this piece mention stealing? Read on, that’s item
number one.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-licensing-model">From its licensing model</h2>

<p>If something doesn’t belong to anybody, is it stealing if you take it for
yourself? What if it belongs equally to everybody?</p>

<p>Fortunately we don’t need to solve that problem: Kakoune is a public domain
project. Which means that anyone is free to do anything they want with the
source code of the editor, no questions asked.</p>

<p>This has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the tool can be shipped with any distribution or suite, regardless of
licensing</li>
  <li>users can modify the code (to fix bugs, add new features or tweak already
existing ones etc.) and publish it (or compiled binaries) without worrying
about attribution</li>
  <li>it lifts some weight of responsibility of the maintainer for the whole
project, which anyone can re-brand or heavily modify to their liking</li>
</ul>

<p>Users don’t like paying for tools, and when they are free and open-source,
I’d argue that they turn out to be more useful (with several iterations,
over time) in the end if they place no limits on what users are allowed to
do with the code.</p>

<p>I’m not in favour of abolishing licenses, I think it would be more
productive for everyone if specialised tools were in the public
domain. In fact, the Kakoune project <em>is</em> licensed, under the
<a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/unlicense/">terms</a> of the
<a href="https://unlicense.org/">UNLICENSE</a>, in order to avoid conflicts with
jurisdictions that don’t recognise the <em>public domain</em> model.</p>

<p>As for the small riddle above, that’s a tough one, bordering on the
philosophical, but since we’re talking about replicating data, we can easily
break out of that paradox: copying is not stealing.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-code">From its code</h2>

<p>New comers like to praise Kakoune for having a clean codebase, easy to
navigate and modify. And for good reason! Written in C++, the code uses the
smallest amount of bells and whistles possible to keep the code elegant,
compilable with (reasonably) old compiler versions, but more importantly
convenient.</p>

<p>And when it comes to convenience, Kakoune has some interesting assets your
project could benefit from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a header-only implementation of a diffing algorithm
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/diff.hh">diff.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a regex engine mostly following the ECMA syntax — this implementation
allowed the project to drop
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_74_0/libs/regex/doc/html/index.html">boost::regex</a>
as a dependency
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/regex.hh">regex.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a minimal JSON (un)marshaller
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/json.hh">json.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>a custom hash map implementation
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/hash_map.hh">hash_map.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>wrappers for string types (e.g. string view) and associated utilities:
join, wrap, split, quote, pad etc.
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/string.hh">string.hh</a>
· <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/string_utils.hh">string_utils.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>various functional range filters: filter, transform, gather, map etc.
(<a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/ranges.hh">ranges.hh</a>)</li>
  <li>an implementation of Go’s defer statement that runs code once the execution
flow leaves the current scope
(<a href="https://golang.org/ref/spec#Defer_statements">Go specification</a>
· <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/src/utils.hh#L53">utils.hh</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above snippets are not exactly drop-in, as they are still coupled to
custom types defined for the editor, but should nonetheless be adaptable
without much difficulty to other C++ projects.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-user-interface">From its user interface</h2>

<p>Originally an easter-egg that savvy users found out about by reading the
code that handles the terminal client’s user interface, the Clippy character
has become a mascot that is now enabled out of the box. However, although
it’s undeniable that nostalgia for Microsoft Office’s assistant has fuelled
prolonged interest in Clippy itself, the easter egg’s notoriety has cast a
shadow on the larger feature it’s a prisoner of: the auto-info pop up window.</p>

<p>The auto-info window is a big contributor to the general level of
interactivity the editor provide, as it pops up any time the user hits a
key in normal mode or has typed a function name in the command prompt. Its
purpose is to provide instant feedback to the user, communicate usage
information or possible options that are available to the user. Every time
I’m using a terminal program that lets me type commands but never hints
at what parameters they take, I sorely wished more people would steal that
from Kakoune!</p>

<p>Another command prompt related improvement that the editor proposes is
fuzzy matching: the user doesn’t need to type out letters that make up
the name of the command they need in order, which makes for much faster
completion selection, and increased discoverability.</p>

<p>All command names in Kakoune are WORDS that start with the name of the
functionality group they belong to. The examples below follow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>to figure out what commands interact with the buffer, typing <code>:buff</code>
would return candidates like <code>buffer-next</code>, <code>lint-buffer</code>,
<code>format-buffer</code>…</li>
  <li>to call the <code>lint-buffer</code> command, typing <code>:lb&lt;tab&gt;</code> would insert the
entire command name in the prompt</li>
</ul>

<p>Use Kakoune once, and you’ll wish your browser enabled fuzzy
matching in your history/bookmarks for the rest of your days. But
you might wonder: there are individual tools that handles
fuzzy-matching, like <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy">fzy</a>, what if the user would rather
use them to handle opening, for example, files? Great question! Read on,
that’s the next dimension I want you to steal from.</p>

<h2 id="from-its-philosophy">From its philosophy</h2>

<p>The UNIX philosophy states that tools should focus on doing one thing,
and do it well. The implications are that tools that implement too many
unrelated features end up providing users with an underwhelming experience
because they only allow so much granularity over their behaviour, and that
their maintainers are spread too thin to improve/fix them.</p>

<p>If we re-frame this into the context of text editing, editors should only
worry about exactly that — text editing. And Kakoune does its job as
a UNIX citizen brilliantly, but it also goes one step further: it allows
other tools to interact with it, via shell scripting.</p>

<p>Remember the case of spawning a third-party fuzzy matching program,
above? Without getting into details, in Kakoune you’d implement that by
spawning a new terminal (or pane/tab), which would run the program, and
its output would be interpreted by the editor. Users are free to run any
program they want, any terminal or multiplexer they prefer.</p>

<p>And the concept isn’t bound to terminal programs either, although they are
probably the type of tools that Kakoune users would intuitively want to
interact with, on account of the editor being one itself. For example, do
you want to edit a file using a graphical interface? Try the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>:edit %sh{zenity --file-selection}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If that doesn’t sound anything special, it means that it makes
sense. Unfortunately, the field of text editors on UNIX systems has over
the years turned into an archipelago, in which every editor aims at being an
island. Job management, shell, terminal emulation,&nbsp;window multiplexing…
Text editors have turned into closed ecosystems (or Integrated Development
Environments) that provide many (sometimes cardboard-looking) features
unrelated to editing, which new comers have to buy into, or be left out in
the cold.</p>

<p>So here’s an idea everybody should not feel guilty about stealing, if
applicable to their projects: don’t re-invent the wheel, we have enough
bad imitations already<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> — instead, work on ways to make your tools
interface with others more easily!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Recently, I came across a new embedded analytics database, <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> which I found inspired from two of my favorite ones <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> and <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/">ClickHouse</a>. DuckDB looked very interesting since I find that it filled that gap of not having a strong embedded database for OLAP requirements really well.</p>
<p>In this post, we will load one month of <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page">NYC Taxi Dataset</a> in each of these three databases and run some queries to get an idea about each of them.</p>
<p>Don’t take it as a performance comparison in any way since SQLite &amp; DuckDB are embedded databases (they don’t have any separate server running) while ClickHouse runs a separate server, so obviously that won’t be apples-to-apples comparison.</p>
<h2 id="data-loading">Data Loading</h2>
<p>Each of the three databases support loading data from CSV files, we used the feature to import data</p>
<pre><code>$ sqlite3 sqlite3.db
SQLite version 3.33.0 2020-08-14 13:23:32
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite&gt; .mode csv
sqlite&gt; .import yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv taxi
</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ duckdb duckdb.db
SQLite version DuckDB d9bceddc7
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
duckdb&gt; CREATE TABLE taxi AS SELECT * FROM read_csv_auto('yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv');
</code></pre>
<p>For ClickHouse, we need to create the table beforehand with proper schema. In this case, I used all fields as strings since we aren’t thinking about any performance optimization.</p>
<pre><code>$ clickhouse-client
server :) CREATE TABLE default.taxi
(
    `vendor_name` String,
    `Trip_Pickup_DateTime` String,
    `Trip_Dropoff_DateTime` String,
    `Passenger_Count` String,
    `Trip_Distance` String,
    `Start_Lon` String,
    `Start_Lat` String,
    `Rate_Code` String,
    `store_and_forward` String,
    `End_Lon` String,
    `End_Lat` String,
    `Payment_Type` String,
    `Fare_Amt` String,
    `surcharge` String,
    `mta_tax` String,
    `Tip_Amt` String,
    `Tolls_Amt` String,
    `Total_Amt` String
)
ENGINE = MergeTree()
ORDER BY vendor_name
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192

$ cat yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv | clickhouse-client --query="INSERT INTO taxi FORMAT CSVWithNames";
</code></pre>
<h2 id="data-storage">Data Storage</h2>
<p>Let’s have a look how much disk each of these took to store this csv in their native data format.</p>
<p>The csv file which we imported above is around 2.4G.</p>
<pre><code>$ du -sh yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv
2.4G	yellow_tripdata_2009-01.csv
</code></pre>
<p>In SQLite format, it took around 2.7G.</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -lh
Permissions Size User    Date Modified Name
.rw-r--r--  2.7G pradeep  4 Oct 12:30  sqlite3.db
</code></pre>
<p>In DuckDB format, it took around 1.9G.</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -lh
Permissions Size User    Date Modified Name
.rw-r--r--  1.9G pradeep  4 Oct 12:20  duckdb.data
.rw-r--r--    12 pradeep  4 Oct 13:03  duckdb.data.wal
</code></pre>
<p>In ClickHouse format, it took around 780M.</p>
<pre><code>$ clickhouse-client
server :) SELECT
    concat(database, '.', table) AS table,
    formatReadableSize(sum(bytes)) AS size,
    sum(rows) AS rows,
    sum(bytes) AS bytes_size,
    any(engine) AS engine,
    formatReadableSize(sum(primary_key_bytes_in_memory)) AS primary_keys_size
FROM system.parts
WHERE active

    database,
    table

<h2 id="data-query">Data Query</h2>
<h3 id="counting-number-of-rows">Counting number of rows</h3>
<p>Let’s make a simple query to count the number of rows in each of three datastores.</p>
<p>In SQLite, it took around 1 second to complete the query.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; .timer on
sqlite&gt; SELECT COUNT(*) from taxi;
14092413
Run Time: real 1.053 user 0.291249 sys 0.759388
</code></pre>
<p>In DuckDB, the same query took around around 0.043 second.</p>
<pre><code>duckdb&gt; .timer on
duckdb&gt; SELECT COUNT(*) from taxi;
14092413
Run Time: real 0.043 user 0.042005 sys 0.000352
</code></pre>
<p>Wow, that’s around 20x faster.</p>
<p>In ClickHouse, the same query took around 0.006 second.</p>
<pre><code>$ clickhouse-client
server :) SELECT count(*) FROM taxi;

<h3 id="counting-distinct-rows">Counting distinct rows</h3>
<p>Let’s make a query to count distinct rows for column: vendor_name.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT vendor_name) FROM taxi;

<p>Let’s make a query to count distinct rows for multiple columns.</p>
<pre><code>sqlite&gt; SELECT

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Based on above data, we are conclude that DuckDB is a very good fit for analytical purposes. Although, it’s still in early phase of development, I am really excited about it. I am looking forward to use it in my projects soon.</p>

In this issue we’ll be examining how automation can create new problems, especially if the operator is expected to keep track of multiple modes with little support.</p><p>While this paper focuses on the A320 aircraft specifically, the authors are very clear that this is not an issue with this one aircraft or even just aviation in general, but is a problem that can occur when automation doesn’t act as a team player.</p><p>Automation acts as more of a “team player” when it acts in a way that allows humans to keep track of what it’s doing and anticipate what it will do in the future. The authors even suggest that this measure, how much of a team player a given technology is, can even help predict how effective and successful that it is.</p><p>Conversely, when automation isn’t a team player, automation can be clumsy and confusing. This particularly true in this case where there is the possibility of “mode error,” where in one mode some input is ok, but in some other mode unexpected actions occur. This puts a burden on the operator to continue to exercise “mode awareness” to keep track of what state the automation is in. If this mode awareness is lost, then mode error can occur.</p><p>I think this is important for us to keep in mind as we develop tools and systems for others. How often are we expecting users to keep track of what’s going on without giving them more than subtle clues or perhaps nothing at all?</p><p>And keep in mind, that this study was done with experienced pilots. The authors even setup the study on the simulator so it included some “standard proficiency actions” which would have helped reveal if it was simply an issue of inexperience. But none of the pilots struggled in that area. I think its common to see some missteps with our technology especially if we’re familiar with it or even have built it, to say that many things that aren’t outright bugs are “training issues”. But I think this study and this question of how the automation behaves toward them human team and its ability to integrate can help step out of this mindset.</p><p>The 18 experienced pilots were asked to fly 90 minutes on a simulator and were informed about the experiment and had an instructor with them who acted as the captain. Also, pilots were interviewed afterwards and had a chance to ask questions about the experience as well. Aside from the “standard” bits, the authors explain:</p><blockquote><p>All other scenario events and tasks were designed to test pilots’ awareness of the status and behavior of the automation. The events involved a high potential for surprise arising from a mismatch between actual system behavior and pilots’ likely expectations, which are known to guide their system monitoring</p></blockquote><p>I think there’s a temptation to say well, sure, of course if you pick tricky scenarios some pilots will be tricked. But I think that misses the point that the authors didn’t change the system, they used a high fidelity A320 simulator. They were able to create these tricky situations because of the way the system exists today, they didn’t create the system.</p><p>I won’t get into all the different ways the flight automation behaved but one really stood out for me. In one of the scenarios the pilots were asked to use the automation after getting clearance for a landing at a runway, “24L”. Air traffic control gave them clearance and asked them to stay within certain altitude constraints, something which they can program in the flight computer. After doing so, they were informed that they should actually land at runway “24R”. Doesn’t seem like it should be a big change right? But:</p><blockquote><p>When the pilot changed the runway identifier in the MCDU [Multifunction Control and Display Unit] to 24 R, the automation also erased all previously entered altitude constraints, even though they still applied.</p></blockquote><p>Not only did it erase that information, it only communicated this erasure by the <em>absence</em> of two icons that were there previously. 4 pilots never noticed this and another 4 were only able to detect this by looking at a different map display. 10 of the pilots were able to notice almost immediately or even anticipate the issue. But even <em>then</em> of the 14, only 12 were able to recover in time by entering the data again. So not only was it hard to detect it was hard to correct!</p><p>Another scenario involved a “go around,” where a pilot would have to abort a landing and try again, but do so at less than 100 feet of the ground after turning off the flight director. This is something that is rare, but especially challenging during a fast paced event. The automation doesn’t make this any easier. It turns out this is the only situation where doing the normal procedure <em>does not</em> automatically arm the autothrust system. In this case, pushing the thrust lever as normal to the go around position actually <em>disconnects</em> the autothrust system, making the pilot have to control it manually.</p><p>As shocking as this can be to read, especially if we don’t have experience in this domain, it gives us a chance to think about our own systems. How often are we doing similar things on our own automation? How can we better make our automation behave as a team player? Often automation is clumsy and gets in the way, and these tense, high tempo situations are precisely where it <em>doesn’t</em> help, when the support is needed most.</p><h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2><ul><li>As technologies and automation advances <em>new</em> types of errors can be created, even while other problems are fixed</li><li>This means we cannot count on “better” technology fixing the issues that may exist in a given system.</li><li>Without some way for operators to understand the current status of some automation and <em>anticipate</em> it’s future state, mode error (where input that would work in one mode causes different behavior in another) becomes likely.</li><li>Mode error can occur when inputs are valid in one mode, but cause different behavior in another.</li><li>Automation and advancement in technology can create new forms of failure, even while addressing to others.</li><li>The more that automation behaves as a team player, the more this sort of error can be avoided.</li></ul></section></div></div>]]>

<p>Hi folks, It was an outstanding 6 month for us, the <strong>UbuntuDDE Team</strong>, as we had so much love and support from people all over the world. After the 20.04 release, we are amazed by the love and support of hundreds of people across the world. We received a huge download of around <strong>600K+</strong> so far. All thanks to the huge and strong community of Ubuntu, Debian, Deepin, and the entire Linux ecosystem as this wouldn’t be possible without you.</p>



<p>I would like to thank everyone in the UbuntuDDE Remix team, the community, bug hunters, patrons, donors, and everyone who directly and indirectly supported us and the project.</p>

<p>This chapter is an attempt to illustrate what are the core principles of Data Oriented Programming as I understand them.
It is highly influenced by my programming experience in Clojure, but I believe that those principles are language agnostic.</p>
<p>One could adhere to them in an Object Oriented (OO) language like Java or C# and one could break them
in a Functional Programming (FP) language like Ocaml, Haskell, JavaScript (or even in Clojure).</p>
<p>In fact, in this chapter, I am going to illustrate how those principles could be applied or broken
in JavaScript, a programming language that supports both FP and OOP.</p>
<p>The principles of Data Oriented (DO) Programming are:</p>

<p>Each principle is explored in a separate article.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h3><span id="Introduction_%E2%80%93_exploration_of_rational_thought"></span>Introduction – exploration of rational thought<span></span></h3>



<p>K<em>eith E. Stanovich is one of the most cited contemporary psychologists. For example, his classic article from the field of developmental psychology on the “Matthew effect in education” has been quoted more than 1,500 times in the scientific literature. – In recent times, the scientist and his team have focused on human rationality and their special role as cognitive competence in addition to intelligence. In this context, Stanovich coined the term dysrationalia to describe the tendency of individuals to think and act irrationally even though they possess sufficient intelligence. In their last book “The Rationality Quotient: Toward a Test of Rational Thinking”, published in 2016, Stanovich and his colleagues developed the basic concept of a comprehensive test of rational thinking.<br>Key psychological experts are convinced of the validity of this concept, as a statement by Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University – winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics – shows:</em></p>



<blockquote><p>The Rationality Quotient is a significant advance in the psychology of rationality. It presents the best analysis of the cognitive errors in the scientific literature and makes compelling case for measuring rationality indepentently of intelligence.</p><cite>Daniel Kahneman, 2016</cite></blockquote>



<p><em>Some of Stanovich’s psychological colleagues even deduce from his work on rationality that irrational thinking can be effectively limited on the part of cognitive elites. Keith E. Stanovich now contradicts this conclusion in his new book, which is about to be published. In his view, the so-called myside bias often impedes rational thinking and action, especially among political and intellectual elites.<br>Fortunately, I had the opportunity to get to know his analyses in detail and to discuss with Keith E. Stanovich in an interview the consequences for the management of current global crises. </em></p>



<p><em>See for yourself:</em></p>



<h3><span id="Question_1_%E2%80%93_motivation"></span>Question #1 – motivation<span></span></h3>



<p>I would like to start with a question that probably plays a big role in the introduction of your new book:<br><em><strong>How come that after dealing with numerous different biases you dedicate a whole book to the myside bias? In the past, you and your colleagues in your lab had already focused on studying individual differences in myside bias. – Does this bias have a particularly harmful effect?</strong></em></p>



<h3><span id="Keith_E_Stanovich_1_%E2%80%93_pervasiveness_of_myside_bias"></span>Keith E. Stanovich #1 – pervasiveness of myside bias<span></span></h3>



<p>Yes, my group had investigated myside bias since 2000, but my special focus on it began in 2016 after we published The Rationality Quotient. The November 8, 2016 United States presidential election occurred, and the nature of my email suddenly changed. I began to receive many emails that had the implication that I now had the perfect group to study—Trump voters—who were obviously irrational in the eyes of my email correspondents (most of them university faculty in the social sciences).</p>



<p>Subsequent to the election, I also received many invitations to speak. Several of these invitations came with the subtle (or sometimes not-so-subtle) implication that I surely would want to comment—after first giving my technical talk, of course—on the flawed rational thinking of the voters who had done this terrible thing to the nation. One European conference that solicited my participation had as its theme trying to understand the obviously defective thinking not only of Trump voters, but of Brexit voters as well. I—the author of a rational thinking test—was seen as the ideal candidate to give the imprimatur of science to this conclusion.</p>



<p>I wrote an essay explaining to all of these correspondents that I could not give them what they want—that on any definition of rationality, there was no evidence that Trump and Clinton voters were significantly different.</p>



<p>After writing the essay, it occurred to me that my correspondents perfectly illustrated a finding of ours regarding myside bias: that it was not attenuated by intelligence or education. My correspondents were intelligent and highly educated faculty, but their confidence that the Trump voters (or the Brexit voters) were irrational was a perfect illustration of myside bias. They seemed to think that intelligence leads to ideological “correctness”. Such a view is itself highly irrational.</p>



<p>The pervasiveness of myside bias, even among cognitive elites, was what led me to write my new book.</p>

<h3><span id="Question_2_%E2%80%93_characteristics_and_appearance"></span><strong><em>Question #2</em></strong> – characteristics and appearance<span></span></h3>



<p>You probably refer to your essay “Were Trump Voters Irrational”, published in September 2017 on Quillette. Aren’t you?!</p>



<p>Some time ago – when reading the essay – I have to admit – I was shocked at first when you demonstrated that there is no single “party of science”:</p>



<p>You explain with vivid examples how apparently supporters of both parties differ in what scientific findings they accept and what scientific facts do not fit their moral concepts and are therefore ignored. What the supporters of all parties do not differ in is, in your opinion, the fact that they systematically cognitively distort what does not fit their group identity. My shock has made me clearly feel, on the one hand, my own myside-bias and, on the other, the omnipresence of this distortion. </p>



<p><em><strong>So with a view to your new book, the pressing question seems to be: Where does this myside bias regularly occur? – How can it be identified in individuals and in group behavior?</strong></em></p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="833" src="https://a-g-i-l.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fred-moon-swJAv6imPm0-unsplashBrexit-1024x833.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://a-g-i-l.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fred-moon-swJAv6imPm0-unsplashBrexit-1024x833.jpg 1024w, https://a-g-i-l.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fred-moon-swJAv6imPm0-unsplashBrexit-300x244.jpg 300w, https://a-g-i-l.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fred-moon-swJAv6imPm0-unsplashBrexit-768x625.jpg 768w, https://a-g-i-l.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fred-moon-swJAv6imPm0-unsplashBrexit-1536x1250.jpg 1536w, https://a-g-i-l.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fred-moon-swJAv6imPm0-unsplashBrexit.jpg 1900w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>There is no evidence that Brexit supporters were driven by irrationality when they decided not to remain in the EU.

<h3><span id="Keith_E_Stanovich_2_%E2%80%93_omnipresence_of_myside_bias"></span>Keith E. Stanovich #2 – omnipresence of myside bias<span></span></h3>



<p>Yes, you are correct on many counts. I am referring to my 2017 essay in Quillette in which I analyzed voter irrationality claims and found that the literature contained no evidence indicating that the Trump voters would have been any less rational (or less intelligent, or less knowledgeable) than the Clinton voters. In the same essay, I showed that that conclusion is pretty much parallel to the finding that neither political party in the United States is the party of science. They both accept and reject science depending upon whether the conclusion aligns with the political policy that maps their ideological position. Thus, you are completely correct in summarizing the finding as that supporters of all ideologies distort their understanding of scientific findings that do not fit their group identity.</p>



<p>And you are right to react to these findings as suggesting the omnipresence of myside bias. That is one of the key things that I outline in the new book. Research has shown that myside bias is displayed in a variety of experimental situations: people evaluate the same virtuous act more favourably if committed by a member of their own group and evaluate a negative act less unfavourably if committed by a number of their own group; they evaluate the identical experiment more favourably if the results support their prior beliefs than if the results contradict their prior beliefs; when searching for information, people select information sources that are likely to support their own position; and even when told to present balanced arguments, people generate more arguments in favor of their own beliefs.</p>



<p>Even the interpretation of a purely numerical display of outcome data is tipped in the direction of the subject’s prior belief. Likewise, judgments of logical validity are skewed by people’s prior beliefs. Valid syllogisms with the conclusion “therefore, marijuana should be legal” are easier for liberals to judge correctly and harder for conservatives; whereas valid syllogisms with the conclusion “therefore, no one has the right to end the life of a fetus” are harder for liberals to judge correctly and easier for conservatives. I will stop here, because I have not even begun to enumerate the many different paradigms that psychologists have used to study myside bias. As I show in my new book, The Bias That Divides Us, myside bias is not only displayed in laboratory paradigms, but it characterizes our thinking in real life as well. In early May 2020, demonstrations took place in several US state capitols to protest against mandated stay-at-home policies, ordered in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Responses to these demonstrations fell strongly along partisan lines—one partisan side deploring the societal health risks of the demonstrations and the other supporting the demonstrations. Only a few weeks later, these partisan lines on large public gatherings completely reversed polarity when new mass demonstrations occurred for a different set of reasons.</p>

<h3><span id="Question_3_%E2%80%93_realworld_outcomes"></span><strong><em>Question #</em></strong>3 – real-world outcomes<span></span></h3>



<p><em><strong>You have just pointed out that with the myside-bias you are by no means questioning a mere laboratory phenomenon, but something real that influences our thinking in real life. In your last book “The Rationality Quotient” you mentioned this aspect several times. For example, you had compiled an extensive list of “real-world outcomes” of biases. How will it be in your new book? How far will you “step out of the lab” and analyze real-world outcomes of the myside-bias?</strong></em></p>



<h3><span id="Keith_E_Stanovich_3_%E2%80%93_ambiguous_situations_spawn_myside_bias"></span>Keith E. Stanovich #3 – ambiguous situations spawn myside bias<span></span></h3>



<p>I use examples from a variety of domains, but the most fertile domain is in what we might broadly call politics, government policy, and ideology. I describe, for example, debates about capital punishment in the United States. There are many people who believe that capital punishment deters crime and others that think that it …</p></div></div>

<p><span color="#663300">ENCYCLICAL LETTER<i><br> <b><span size="4">FRATELLI TUTTI<br> </span></b></i>OF THE HOLY FATHER<br> <b>FRANCIS<br> </b>ON FRATERNITY AND SOCIAL FRIENDSHIP</span></p> 
 
<p>1. <i><a name="“FRATELLI_TUTTI”">“FRATELLI TUTTI”</a>.</i><a name="_ftnref1" title="" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> With these words, Saint Francis of Assisi addressed his brothers and sisters and proposed to them a way of life marked by the flavour of the Gospel. Of the counsels Francis offered, I would like to select the one in which he calls for a love that transcends the barriers of geography and distance, and declares blessed all those who love their brother “as much when he is far away from him as when he is with him”.<a name="_ftnref2" title="" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> In his simple and direct way, Saint Francis expressed the essence of a fraternal openness that allows us to acknowledge, appreciate and love each person, regardless of physical proximity, regardless of where he or she was born or lives.</p> 
<p>2. This saint of fraternal love, simplicity and joy, who inspired me to write the Encyclical <i> <a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html">Laudato Si’</a></i>, prompts me once more to devote this new Encyclical to fraternity and social friendship. Francis felt himself a brother to the sun, the sea and the wind, yet he knew that he was even closer to those of his own flesh. Wherever he went, he sowed seeds of peace and walked alongside the poor, the abandoned, the infirm and the outcast, the least of his brothers and sisters.</p> 
<p><a name="WITHOUT_BORDERS">WITHOUT BORDERS</a></p> 
<p>3. There is an episode in the life of Saint Francis that shows his openness of heart, which knew no bounds and transcended differences of origin, nationality, colour or religion. It was his visit to Sultan Malik-el-Kamil, in Egypt, which entailed considerable hardship, given Francis’ poverty, his scarce resources, the great distances to be traveled and their differences of language, culture and religion. That journey, undertaken at the time of the Crusades, further demonstrated the breadth and grandeur of his love, which sought to embrace everyone. Francis’ fidelity to his Lord was commensurate with his love for his brothers and sisters. Unconcerned for the hardships and dangers involved, Francis went to meet the Sultan with the same attitude that he instilled in his disciples: if they found themselves “among the Saracens and other nonbelievers”, without renouncing their own identity they were not to “engage in arguments or disputes, but to be subject to every human creature for God’s sake”.<a name="_ftnref3" title="" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> In the context of the times, this was an extraordinary recommendation. We are impressed that some eight hundred years ago Saint Francis urged that all forms of hostility or conflict be avoided and that a humble and fraternal “subjection” be shown to those who did not share his faith.</p> 
<p>4. Francis did not wage a war of words aimed at imposing doctrines; he simply spread the love of God. He understood that “God is love and those who abide in love abide in God” (<i>1 Jn </i>4:16). In this way, he became a father to all and inspired the vision of a fraternal society. Indeed, “only the man who approaches others, not to draw them into his own life, but to help them become ever more fully themselves, can truly be called a father”.<a name="_ftnref4" title="" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> In the world of that time, bristling with watchtowers and defensive walls, cities were a theatre of brutal wars between powerful families, even as poverty was spreading through the countryside. Yet there Francis was able to welcome true peace into his heart and free himself of the desire to wield power over others. He became one of the poor and sought to live in harmony with all. Francis has inspired these pages.</p> 
<p>5. Issues of human fraternity and social friendship have always been a concern of mine. In recent years, I have spoken of them repeatedly and in different settings. In this Encyclical, I have sought to bring together many of those statements and to situate them in a broader context of reflection. In the preparation of <i> <a href="http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html">Laudato Si’</a></i>, I had a source of inspiration in my brother Bartholomew, the Orthodox Patriarch, who has spoken forcefully of our need to care for creation. In this case, I have felt particularly encouraged by the Grand Imam Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, with whom I met in Abu Dhabi, where we declared that “God has created all human beings equal in rights, duties and dignity, and has called them to live together as brothers and sisters”.<a name="_ftnref5" title="" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> This was no mere diplomatic gesture, but a reflection born of dialogue and common commitment. The present Encyclical takes up and develops some of the great themes raised in the Document that we both signed. I have also incorporated, along with my own thoughts, a number of letters, documents and considerations that I have received from many individuals and groups throughout the world.</p> 
<p>6. The following pages do not claim to offer a complete teaching on fraternal love, but rather to consider its universal scope, its openness to every man and woman. I offer this social Encyclical as a modest contribution to continued reflection, in the hope that in the face of present-day attempts to eliminate or ignore others, we may prove capable of responding with a new vision of fraternity and social friendship that will not remain at the level of words. Although I have written it from the Christian convictions that inspire and sustain me, I have sought to make this reflection an invitation to dialogue among all people of good will.</p> 
<p>7. As I was writing this letter, the Covid-19 pandemic unexpectedly erupted, exposing our false securities. Aside from the different ways that various countries responded to the crisis, their inability to work together became quite evident. For all our hyper-connectivity, we witnessed a fragmentation that made it more difficult to resolve problems that affect us all. Anyone who thinks that the only lesson to be learned was the need to improve what we were already doing, or to refine existing systems and regulations, is denying reality.</p> 
<p>8. It is my desire that, in this our time, by acknowledging the dignity of each human person, we can contribute to the rebirth of a universal aspiration to fraternity. Fraternity between all men and women. “Here we have a splendid secret that shows us how to dream and to turn our life into a wonderful adventure. No one can face life in isolation… We need a community that supports and helps us, in which we can help one another to keep looking ahead. How important it is to dream together… By ourselves, we risk seeing mirages, things that are not there. Dreams, on the other hand, are built together”.<a name="_ftnref6" title="" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> Let us dream, then, as a single human family, as fellow travelers sharing the same flesh, as children of the same earth which is our common home, each of us bringing the richness of his or her beliefs and convictions, each of us with his or her own voice, brothers and sisters all.</p> 
<p><a name="CHAPTER_ONE">CHAPTER ONE</a></p> 
<p><a name="DARK_CLOUDS_OVER_A_CLOSED_WORLD">DARK CLOUDS OVER A CLOSED WORLD</a></p> 
<p>9. Without claiming to carry out an exhaustive analysis or to study every aspect of our present-day experience, I intend simply to consider certain trends in our world that hinder the development of universal fraternity.</p> 
<p><a name="SHATTERED_DREAMS">SHATTERED DREAMS</a> </p> 
<p>10. For decades, it seemed that the world had learned a lesson from its many wars and disasters, and was slowly moving towards various forms of integration. For example, there was the dream of a united Europe, capable of acknowledging its shared roots and rejoicing in its rich diversity. We think of “the firm conviction of the founders of the European Union, who envisioned a future based on the capacity to work together in bridging divisions and in fostering peace and fellowship between all the peoples of this continent”.<a name="_ftnref7" title="" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> There was also a growing desire for integration in Latin America, and several steps were taken in this direction. In some countries and regions, attempts at reconciliation and rapprochement proved fruitful, while others showed great promise.</p> 
<p>11. Our own days, however, seem to be showing signs of a certain regression. Ancient conflicts thought long buried are breaking out anew, while instances of a myopic, extremist, resentful and aggressive nationalism are on the rise. In some countries, a concept of popular and national unity influenced by various ideologies is creating new forms of selfishness and a loss of the social sense under the guise of defending national interests. Once more we are being reminded that “each new generation must take up the struggles and attainments of past generations, while setting its sights even higher. This is the path. Goodness, together with love, justice and solidarity, are not achieved once and for all; they have to be realized each day. It is not possible to settle for what was achieved in the past and complacently enjoy it, as if we could somehow disregard the fact that many of our brothers and sisters still endure situations that cry out for our attention”.<a name="_ftnref8" title="" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p> 
<p>12. “Opening up to the world” is an expression that has been co-opted by the economic and financial sector and is now used exclusively of openness to foreign interests or to the freedom of economic powers to invest without obstacles or complications in all countries. Local conflicts and disregard for the common good are exploited by the global economy in order to impose a single cultural model. This culture unifies the world, but divides persons and nations, for “as society becomes ever more globalized, it makes us neighbours, but does not make us brothers”.<a name="_ftnref9" title="" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> We are more alone than ever in an increasingly massified world that promotes individual interests and weakens the communitarian dimension of life. Indeed, there are markets where individuals become mere consumers or bystanders. As a rule, the advance of this kind of globalism strengthens the identity of the more powerful, who can protect themselves, but it tends to diminish the identity of the weaker and poorer regions, making them more vulnerable and dependent. In this way, political life becomes increasingly fragile in the face of transnational economic powers that operate with the principle of “divide and conquer”. </p>

  <p>A basic property of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">digital signature scheme</a> is that it should specify which signatures are valid and which signatures are invalid, so that all implementations can accept only valid signatures and reject only invalid signatures. <em>Unfortunately, Ed25519 signatures don’t provide this property, making their use in distributed systems fragile and risky.</em></p>
<p>Although the scheme was standardized in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032">RFC8032</a>, the RFC does not specify validation criteria, and does not require conformant implementations to agree on whether a particular signature is valid. In addition, because the specification changed validation criteria years after deployment, it is incompatible with almost all existing implementations. Worse still, some implementations added extra ad-hoc criteria, making them further incompatible.</p>
<p>The result is an extremely wide variation in validation criteria across implemententations. The diagram below plots verification results of a \(14 \times 14\) grid of edge cases, with light squares representing accepted signatures, and dark squares representing rejected ones. As the diagram illustrates, verification results are generally inconsistent not just between implementations, but also between different versions and different modes. <img src="https://hdevalence.ca/images/ed25519-comparison.png"></p>
<p>Some protocols may tolerate this variation, but it is unacceptable for any protocol that requires participants to reach consensus on signature validity. A malicious participant can submit signatures that are accepted by some implementations but rejected by others, causing a network partitition or a consensus fork. Having only a single implementation makes this problem less obvious, but it doesn’t go away, since behavior can vary across versions of the ‘same’ implementation. This occurred in practice with the widely used <code>libsodium</code> library, which made breaking changes to validation criteria in a point release.</p>
<p>Finally, although all of these problems occur when verifying signatures individually, they also prevent the use of batch verification, which can provide a significant performance benefit.</p>

<h2 id="the-scope-of-potential-divergence">The scope of potential divergence</h2>
<h3 id="the-ed25519-signing-process">The Ed25519 signing process</h3>
<p>Before explaining the validation criteria, it’s useful to briefly review the signing process. An honest signer generates their signing key, a random scalar \(a\), through a complicated procedure not relevant here. Then, they multiply their signing key by the Curve25519 basepoint \(B\) to obtain their verification key, a curve point \(A = [a]B\). The <em>signing</em> and <em>verification</em> keys are more commonly referred to as the <em>private</em> and <em>public</em> keys, but (following Daira Hopwood), I prefer to use the capability-based terminology, since it more precisely captures the role of the key material.</p>
<p>To sign a message <code>M</code>, a signer first generates a secret random nonce \(r\), through a procedure that is also not relevant here, and then form a public commitment to this randomness by computing \(R = [r]B\). Next, they use a hash function \(H\) to compute a challenge scalar as \( k \gets H(R, A, M) \). Finally, they compute a response scalar as \( s \gets r + ka \).</p>
<h3 id="divergence-in-ed25519-signature-validation-criteria">Divergence in Ed25519 signature validation criteria</h3>
<p>To understand the scope of potential divergence in validation criteria, let’s walk through the steps to verify a signature <code>sig</code> with verification key \(A\) on the message <code>M</code>, noting each step with a possibly divergent behavior choice. Then, in subsequent sections, we’ll look at the scope and implications of each divergence.</p>
<p>Ed25519 signatures are 64 bytes long, structured as two 32-byte components: <code>sig = R_bytes || s_bytes</code>. The first 32 bytes store an encoding of \(R\), and the second 32 bytes store an encoding of \(s\). Ed25519 verification keys are 32 bytes long, storing an encoding of \(A\).</p>
<p>Next, the verifier parses <code>s_bytes</code> as \(s\). It’s always possible to interpret a byte string as a little-endian encoded integer, so parsing \(s\) can’t fail. However, \(s\) is supposed to represent an integer \(\mod q\), where \(q\) is the order of the prime-order subgroup of Curve25519. Honestly-generated signatures will have \(0 \leq s &lt; q\), and implementations can choose to reject \(s \ge q\). Call this check <em>canonical \(s\)</em>.</p>
<p>Next, the verifier attempts to parse <code>A_bytes</code> as \(A\). Not all byte strings are valid point encodings, so parsing \(A\) can fail, causing the signature to be rejected. Points can be encoded non-canonically, although in contrast to the encoding of \(s\), the mechanism is somewhat more complicated and subtle, as will be described <a href="#canonical-a-r">below</a>. Implementations can choose to reject non-canonically encoded curve points. Call this check <em>canonical \(A\)</em>.</p>
<p>The verifier then uses <code>A_bytes</code>, <code>R_bytes</code>, and the message <code>M</code> to recompute the challenge value \(k \gets H(R, A, M)\). (Note that since \(H\) is a hash function, it actually operates on the encodings <code>A_bytes</code> and <code>R_bytes</code>, not their decoded internal representations).</p>
<p>Implementations then make a <em>choice of verification equation</em>, choosing which of two verification equations to check. They can use either the <em>batched equation</em> \[ [8]R = [8]([s]B - [k]A), \] or the <em>unbatched equation</em> \[ R = [s]B - [k]A. \] The naming of <em>batched equation</em> versus <em>unbatched equation</em> suggests that the difference is related to batched versus individual verification, but in fact these give different behavior even in the case of individual verification, as will be explained <a href="#choice-of-verification-equation">below</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, to actually check whichever equation is used, an implementation must choose an <em>equality check</em>. Recall that we didn’t actually decode <code>R_bytes</code> to \(R\) yet. When using the batched equation, an implementation must operate on \(R\), so it must decode <code>R_bytes</code> to \(R\), and check equality of curve points. This also means it must make a choice of whether to require <em>canonical \(R\)</em>.</p>
<p>When using the unbatched equation, however, an implementation can choose to either check equality of curve points, or to compute \(R’ \gets [s]B - [k]A\), encode \(R’\) to <code>Rprime_bytes</code>, and check equality of byte strings. When \(R\) is canonically encoded, these equality checks produce the same result. But because the encoding procedure produces canonical encodings, if <code>R_bytes</code> contains a non-canonical encoding of \(R\), then even if \(R’ = R\) (as curve points), <code>Rprime_bytes</code> may differ from <code>R_bytes</code> (as byte strings).</p>
<h3 id="points-of-potential-divergence">Points of potential divergence</h3>
<p>In summary, there are a number of points of potential divergence between implementations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Whether to require <em>canonical \(s\)</em> or to allow non-canonical encodings.</li>
<li>Whether to require <em>canonical \(A\)</em> or to allow non-canonical encodings.</li>
<li>The <em>choice of verification equation</em>, either <em>batched</em> or <em>unbatched</em>.</li>
<li>The <em>choice of equality check</em>, and the related choice of <em>canonical \(R\)</em>.</li>
<li>Any other <em>ad-hoc checks</em> added by a particular implementation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before comparing the choices made by RFC8032 and actually existing implementations, let’s examine the exact mechanism and implications of each of these points of potential divergence.</p>
<h3 id="canonical-s">Canonical \(s\)</h3>
<p>The values <code>A_bytes</code>, <code>R_bytes</code>, and <code>M</code> are all fed into the hash function, so they cannot be modified without changing the challenge value. However, a third party could replace \(s\) with \(s’ = s + nq\). Because \(s’ \equiv s \pmod q\), the modified signature \((R, s’)\) would still pass verification. Requiring that <code>s_bytes</code> encodes \(s &lt; q\) prevents this.</p>
<p>This check is simple, low-cost, prevents malleability, is required by RFC8032, and is performed by most implementations. The only notable exception is the original reference implementation of Ed25519, which chose to write a paragraph arguing that signature malleability is never a problem instead of performing the check.</p>
<p>Because this check is fairly common, well-known, and unobjectionable, I didn’t focus on it, and didn’t comprehensively test implementation behavior.</p>
<h3 id="canonical-a-r">Canonical \(A\), \(R\)</h3>
<p>While the mechanism for constructing non-canonically encoded scalar values is fairly simple, the mechanism for constructing non-canonically encoded point values is somewhat more complicated, as mentioned <a href="#divergence-in-ed25519-signature-validation-criteria">above</a>. To explain it, we need to describe the “compressed Edwards \(y\)” encoding used by Ed25519.</p>
<p>Curve25519 is defined over the finite field of order \(p = 2^{255} - 19\), so the coördinates of curve points \((x,y)\) are integers \(\mod p\). The curve equation in (twisted) Edwards form is \[ - x^2 + y^2 = 1 + d x^2 y^2, \] where \(d\) is a curve parameter. This means that \[ x^2 = \frac { y^2 - 1} {d y^2 + 1}. \] If the fraction on the right-hand side is nonsquare, then there is no \(x\) so that the right-hand side equals \(x^2\), and the \(y\) value is not the \(y\)-coördinate of a curve point. If it is square, then there is a square root \(x\), and the value of \(y\) is sufficient to recover \(x\) up to a choice of sign.</p>
<p>Because \(p &lt; 2^{255}\), the encodings of field elements fit in 255 bits. The compressed Edwards \(y\) format uses the first 255 bits to store the \(y\) coördinate, and the 256th bit to indicate the sign of the …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>I have broken down “seeing race” into 3 categories:</p>



<ol><li>Seeing race</li><li>Not seeing race</li><li>Seeing race</li></ol>



<p>Where do you fall? Let’s dive in to see. Some examples will also delve into gender, religion and ethnicity, as they follow a similar pattern.        </p>

<h2><strong>SEEING RACE (TO OPPRESS)</strong></h2>



<p>You directly or indirectly oppress an individual or group based on their race through action or thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do you see yourself in any of these examples?</p>



<ul><li>You see a Black man walking alongside the road and call him a racial slur.</li><li>You see a female of Asian descent and tell her to go back to China.</li><li>You see two houseless people of different races (i.e Black vs. Asian) and feel more empathy towards one, and feel the other is more deserving of homelessness.</li><li>You do not hire people of a different race because you believe they are less talented or complacent.</li><li>You police the performances and bodies of female Latina performers on television. (example: <a href="https://www.romper.com/p/uncomfortable-white-women-whats-hiding-in-plain-sight-21776655" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lopez and Shakira Super Bowl halftime show</a>)</li></ul>

<h2><strong>NOT SEEING RACE</strong></h2>



<p>It’s a declaration people seem to wave proudly – “I’m not racist, I don’t see race”.</p>



<p>You rarely directly, or intentionally, wish misfortune on anyone specific.</p>



<p>Do you see yourself in any of these examples?</p>



<ul><li>You may have an Asian, Black, or Latinx co-worker, and would not hesitate to invite them to dinner.</li><li>You have no opinion of your sibling or child dating a different race.</li><li>You hire on the grounds of intelligence, not skin color.</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Effects</strong></h4>



<p>The issue is, not seeing race is complacency in response to the current state of racial injustices and disparities we see in our society. It is accepting the current state of history without any desire for improvement.</p>



<p>Although you may invite a friend of a different race to dinner, it’s possible you may flee your white majority town when it starts to be overwhelmed by another race, in fear that your property value will decrease. (i.e. Chicago suburbs as discussed in Michelle Obama’s <a href="https://becomingmichelleobama.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Becoming</a>).</p>



<p>You may believe citizens should be able to freely practice religion, but become defensive about the pledge of allegiance being taken out of schools (which only supports monotheistic religions).</p>



<p>As a hiring manager you may mistake intelligence with signs of whiteness.</p>



<p>You may sit on a jury, and assume a Black man to be more violent because that’s what you see on TV projected at you every night. You may be more harsh on his verdict. (On average, Black male offenders received federal sentences almost 20% longer than white male offenders for the same crime. <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-RACE/USA/nmopajawjva/index.html#the-justice-system" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Source</a>.)</p>



<p>If you don’t see race and ethnicity, you never get the chance to see the beauty of other cultures – the food, the clothing, the architecture, the music and arts, etc…</p>



<p>Individually, you are choosing not to recognize the subconscious biases that we all have, as we’ve all been socialized to be biased to some degree. It’s not that you “don’t see”,<strong> but rather</strong> <strong>choose to ignore.</strong></p>



<p>Collectively, you are actively allowing racially oppressive systems, built during times of slavery and Jim Crow era, to continue. You are likely a part of them without even knowing (or not, that’s for you to decide), and thus they cannot be stopped. </p>

<h2><strong>SEEING RACE (TO STOP OPPRESSION)</strong></h2>



<p>An attempt to open your eyes to racial inequality in our society. More importantly, the ability to recognize patterns that in isolation seem harmless or unassociated with race, but on a large scale can have devastating and oppressive effects on specific groups of people.</p>



<p>Do you see yourself in any of these examples?</p>



<ul><li>You see neighborhoods are often split by race.</li><li>You notice a <a href="https://acityaway.io/2020/08/30/ask-try-to-see-the-connection-between-socio-economic-status-and-race/" data-wpel-link="internal">connection between socio-economic status and race</a>.</li><li>You see management hires people who look like them.</li><li>You see that Black people are disproportionately incarcerated in America more than any other race.</li><li>You choose to appreciate and welcome all the different aspects of different cultures</li><li>You see differences in cultural values are often critiqued instead of understood.</li><li>You see the difficulties of one freely practicing religion in this country, when our president declared he wants a <a href="https://youtu.be/viDffWUjcBA" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">ban on Muslims coming into the United States</a>.</li><li>In moments of unfamiliarity or discomfort – you ask yourself, why do I feel uncomfortable in this moment? Am I projecting my discomfort onto others?</li></ul>



<h4><strong>Effects</strong></h4>



<p>Being able to see race is the first step to stopping systemic oppression of minority groups. You may be in a position of power (such as a manager or elected official), or have the ability to speak to power to help put an end to racist systems.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Caste-Origins-Discontents-Isabel-Wilkerson/dp/0593230256" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Caste</a> by Isabel Wilkerson explains best the history we have inherited. It serves as a great motivator for me to see race:</p>



<blockquote><p>We in the developed world are like homeowners who inherited a house on a piece of land that is beautiful on the outside, but whose soil is unstable loam and rock, heaving and contracting over generations, cracks patched but the deeper ruptures waved away for decades, centuries even. Many people may rightly say, “I had nothing to do with how this all started. I have nothing to do with the sins of the past. My ancestors never attacked indigenous people, never owned slaves.” And, yes. Not one of us was here when this house was built. Our immediate ancestors may have had nothing to do with it, but here we are, the current occupants of a property with stress cracks and bowed walls and fissures built into the foundation. We are the heirs to whatever is right or wrong with it. We did not erect the uneven pillars or joists, but they are ours to deal with now.</p></blockquote>

<h2><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></h2>



<p>Choosing to see race is in fact a choice. You can live a shielded life, but that will not end racism. Racist systems that whether we like it or not, we are all a part of. We engage, consume, and manage these systems.</p>



<p>Here are just a few examples of these biased patterns and systems:</p>



<ul><li>Over-representation of whiteness on television.</li><li>Violence associated with Black men.</li><li>Perceived monetary value of white neighborhoods as compared to neighborhoods of people of color.</li><li>School systems funded by taxes generated by the perceived value of those same neighborhoods.</li><li>Redlining.</li><li>Criminal justice system giving harsher sentences to certain groups of people.</li><li>Policing of female bodies (often of different races than our own).</li><li>Disparities in access to quality education.</li><li>Disparities in access to healthcare. (<a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-RACE/USA/nmopajawjva/index.html#healthcare" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Source</a>).</li><li>and many others… which have you notice?</li></ul>



<p><strong>How have you viewed race in the past? Have you ever prided yourself on not seeing it?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>PS: if you enjoyed this blog post, you may enjoy an episode of the Code Switch podcast called “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4E3TVtZBLI7R2ovA1JFrRm?si=skVrF-B5QF681_-wXbDQtg" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Puerto Rico, Island of Racial Harmony?</a>”. A great case study on not seeing race.</p>



<p>Episode description: “Many Puerto Ricans grow up being taught that they’re a mixture of three races: black, white and indigenous. But on the U.S. census, a majority of Puerto Ricans choose “white” as their only race. On this episode, we’re looking into why that is, and the group of people trying to change it.”<br></p>

        <p>Static websites are still a hot topic. They are fast, and they’re incredibly secure because there isn’t a CMS to hack. Once you build a static website, however, the question becomes: Where do I host?</p>

<p>In other words: what is the fastest static website hosting provider in 2020? Well, let’s find out!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I did <a href="https://www.savjee.be/2017/10/Static-website-hosting-who-is-fastest/">a similar test in 2017</a>, so it will be curious to see if the hosting providers have been improving.</p>

<h2 id="test-setup">Test setup</h2>
<p>Just like in 2017, I created a simple webpage that I could host on many services. I opted to use my own homepage, including all the images, CSS, and JS files. I then uploaded these files to the following hosting providers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Pay-as-you-go</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">AWS S3</a> (Region: <code>eu-west-1</code>, Ireland)</li>
      <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">AWS CloudFront</a></li>
      <li>
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Google Cloud Storage</a> (regional bucket, <code>europe-west1</code>, Belgium)</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Google Cloud Storage</a> (multi-region bucket)</li>
      <li>
<a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/sites" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Cloudflare Workers Sites</a> ($5/month)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Freemium (some parts free)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Firebase Hosting</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Cloudflare CDN</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Netlify</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Free</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">GitHub Pages</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Quick note</em>: I did not test Microsoft Azure, because I couldn’t sign up for it with my <a href="https://revolut.com/referral/xavierh5x" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Revolut Visa card</a>. Thanks, Microsoft!</p>

<p>To check the performance, I used Pingdom and <a href="https://ohdear.app/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Oh Dear</a>. Pingdom measures uptime and response times from <a href="https://my.pingdom.com/probes/feed" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">their worldwide network of probe servers</a> while Oh Dear is located in a single location.</p>

<p>Some other things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I tested the HTTPS endpoints for all services</li>
  <li>I added <code>index.html</code> to all URL’s, meaning no time wasted resolving the index document</li>
  <li>The services were probed <strong>once every minute</strong> for <strong>10 days</strong>
</li>
  <li>Oh Dear did not only track response times, but also DNS lookup time,  TCP connection time, content download time, and more. Pretty cool! All of the raw data is available at the end of this post.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Pingdom or Oh Dear did NOT sponsor this blog post in any way! <a href="https://ohdear.app/" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">Oh Dear</a>, however, gave me a free trial with enough slots for all the test sites. Thanks a lot!</p>

<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>
<p>My expectations are pretty much aligned to when I did this last time around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I expect paid services to do better than free servers. There must be a reason for the prices they charge, right?</li>
  <li>Firebase and Google Cloud belong to the same company, so I expect them to perform similarly.</li>
  <li>I use CloudFront for my website, so hopefully they don’t come out as a bad option. Otherwise, there’s some additional homework for me ;)</li>
  <li>Netlify performed quite inconsistently last time around. With a few years passing, I hope they were able to address those issues.</li>
  <li>Last time, I didn’t have Cloudflare in the benchmark. I expect them to be a strong contender, given how popular they are and how many edge locations they have.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Here’s a screenshot from the Pingdom dashboard after 10 days of testing:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/pingdom-overview.png" alt="Overview of the Pingdom dashboard">
<em>Overview of the Pingdom dashboard</em></p>

<p>At first glance, it seems that all services perform very consistently, with CloudFront, GitHub Pages, and Google Cloud, leading the pack. But let’s not jump to conclusions.</p>

<h3 id="uptime">Uptime</h3>
<p>Let’s start with uptime. All of these services had 100% uptime, except for Firebase. Pingdom detected 1 minute of downtime. One check returned, “Network is unreachable,” and the other returned “Invalid certificate.”</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/pingdom-error-log.png" alt="Firebase downtime as reported by Pingdom">
<em>Firebase downtime as reported by Pingdom</em></p>

<p>This was not detected by Oh Dear, so I’m willing to give Firebase the benefit of the doubt and say that this was an issue on Pingdom’s side.</p>

<h3 id="response-times">Response times</h3>
<p>Let’s start with some basic statistics: the median, and average response time of each service (including standard deviation):</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-response-times.png" alt="Median response times, measured by Pingdom">
<em>Median response times as reported by Pingdom</em></p>

<p>A few things might catch your attention:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CloudFront &amp; GitHub Pages are speedy and consistent. They have the lowest median, average, and deviation. Interesting because one is a paid service, while the other is completely free.</li>
  <li>AWS S3 is the slowest of them all (but performs consistently). It is kind of expected from a hosting provider that is located only in a single region (in this case Ireland, <code>eu-west-1</code>)</li>
  <li>Google Cloud’s regional and multi-regional buckets perform fairly alike. Interestingly, both are much faster than S3, which is a comparable service. Is Google doing some caching behind the scenes?</li>
  <li>I expected Cloudflare to be much more competitive with the top rankings, but somehow both their CDN and Workers aren’t the top performers. Their Workers product does, however, perform slightly better than their CDN.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since I used both Pingdom and Oh Dear, let’s check the difference in median response times:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-response-times-pingdom-oh-dear.png" alt="Pingdom vs Oh Dear (median response times)">
<em>Pingdom vs Oh Dear (median response times)</em></p>

<p>Interestingly, Oh Dear is reporting much faster response times compared to Pingdom. This is probably related to the fact that they only test from a single (apparently very well connected) location.</p>

<p>Pingdom is testing from various locations around the world, some of which aren’t as well connected, which increases the response times.</p>

<p>Some additional findings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Somehow, AWS S3 is the fastest performer, even though the content is only hosted in a single location. It also outperformed Amazon’s CDN! Wherever Oh Dear is hosted, it must be somewhere in the EU with good connections to the Ireland region of AWS.</li>
  <li>The difference between CloudFront, S3, Firebase, GitHub Pages, and Google Cloud Storage is minimal. Once more, showing that free and paid services compete quite closely with one another.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="time-to-first-byte">Time to first byte</h3>
<p>Oh Dear also kept track of other metrics like how long it took for the first bytes to start being transferred. This can give us an indication of how responsive the webserver is (how long does it need to think before being able to fulfill a request).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-time-to-first-byte.png" alt="Time to first byte: measures responsiveness of web servers">
<em>Time to first byte: measures responsiveness of web servers</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>The “simple” storage services like S3 and Google Cloud Storage are doing very well.</li>
  <li>Once again, GitHub Pages, Firebase, and CloudFront are great performers, delivering the first byte in under 40ms.</li>
  <li>Surprisingly, Cloudflare is taking quite a while to start delivering the first bytes. Maybe this is due to all of their protection services?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="compared-to-2017">Compared to 2017</h3>
<p>Comparing this new data with the one from 2017 reveals that not much has changed. Note that here I’m comparing the data from Pingdom:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-response-times-2017-vs-2020.png" alt="Benchmark from 2017 vs 2020: median response times">
<em>Benchmark from 2017 vs 2020: median response times</em></p>

<p>All providers (except GitHub Pages) have become slightly slower. Most noticeably AWS S3 (+13%) and Firebase (+31%). The others are so close to their 2017 performance that I would consider these differences to be in the margin of error.</p>

<p>Netlify has a slower median response time in 2020 compared to 2017. But it did improve massively on its consistency. Last time around, they had weird spikes in performance but not anymore. Nice!</p>

<p>This could be explained by Pingdom having added additional test servers located in areas that are further away from these providers.</p>

<h3 id="trying-to-find-edge-cases">Trying to find edge cases</h3>
<p>A scatter plot reveals that there aren’t many outliers, and no service is suffering from regular spikes in performance. There are some outliers here and there, but I wouldn’t look into them too much:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-scatter-response-times.png" alt="Scatter plot of all response times">
<em>Scatter plot of all response times</em></p>

<p>If we visualize the response times with a box plot, we see something interesting:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.savjee.be/uploads/2020-05-28-benchmaring-static-website-hosting-providers/chart-boxplot-response-times.png" alt="Box plot of response times, showing some high spikes">
<em>Box plot of response times, showing some high spikes</em></p>

<p>All services, except for AWS, GitHub Pages, and Firebase, have weird spikes. Last time around, this was only limited to Netlify. Not sure what to make of these, but I’m guessing it’s more related to Pingdom’s tests than to the services themselves.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Time to draw some conclusions:</p>

<p>The best all-around performer is <strong>AWS CloudFront</strong>, followed closely by <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>. Not only do they have the fastest response times (median), they’re also the most consistent.</p>

<p>They are, however, closely followed by Google Cloud Storage. Interestingly, there is very little difference between a regional and multi-regional bucket. The only reason to pick a multi-regional bucket would be the additional uptime guarantee.</p>

<p><strong>Cloudflare</strong> didn’t perform as well I would’ve expected. It’s certainly faster than a standard S3 bucket but falls away when compared to other CDN’s like CloudFront. Their Workers product is slightly faster than their CDN, but it’s hard to recommend it when it costs $5 a month, and free products like GitHub Pages perform better.</p>

<p>Netlify has improved big time; the spikes in performance are gone and performs in line with Google Cloud and Firebase hosting.</p>

<h2 id="which-should-you-choose">Which should you choose?</h2>
<p>If you want a fast website without breaking the bank, go for GitHub Pages. It’s completely free and super fast. It does, however, require you to open source your site.</p>

<p>If that’s not doable, CloudFront is a good alternative, but its price depends on how much bandwidth you push around. For most personal sites, CloudFront won’t cost more than a couple of dollars per month. The same thing goes for Google Cloud Storage.</p>

<p>Netlify and Firebase Hosting are pretty solid choices as well. While they don’t perform as well as CloudFront or GitHub Pages, they make up for it with excellent development tools. Everything works out-of-the-box with no configuration required on your end. Just push your website live with their easy to use CLI tools.</p>

<h2 id="download-the-data">Download the data</h2>
<p>The raw CSV data <a href="https://github.com/Savjee/static-website-hosting-benchmark" target="_blank" data-no-instant="data-no-instant">is available on GitHub</a>. Both of 2017 and 2020. Feel free to do your analysis and let me know if you find other interesting things in the dataset. Definitely check out the detailed statistics from Oh Dear!</p>

                                        <p>Much as we wish it were otherwise, the pre-DevOps operations team has not gone away. There are still many companies and organizations across the world that still have old-school Ops teams, some of you may even still be in one. I'm going to call you out (and for the rest of you, explain how cynical-asshole happens).</p>
<p>There is a thing that humans just do, it's emergent in our psychology. <strong>If it's your job to clean up after other people's messes, you get cynical</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are a custodian at a school with kids aged 5 through 9, you're probably cleaning up kid-puke anywhere from 2 to 19 times a day (and on the two days that will live in infamy: 400). You're not salty at the kids, they don't know themselves enough to really know better. No, you get that certain look with your coworkers, and <em>especially</em> with custodians at other schools. You bond through misery, to prove you've seen what each other have seen, and prove you belong to the team of puke-cleaners.</p>
<p>If you are an Animal Control officer, it's your job to respond to animal abuse complaints among all the other crap you have to put up with. You see first hand, more than most, just how callous and cruel humans are to the animals we live with. Not just that, but how certain people simply don't even come close to understanding why what they just did is wrong on <em>so many levels</em>. It's a hard job, and some days you're glad you do it. But around your coworkers, you circle up after someone had a bad call-out and help them through it. Show you've been through the same. Build that empathy. When you meet other ACOs you talk about the good times, but over beers you end up talking stories of your bad call-outs, for bonding. You bond through misery, because not recognizing the bad sells the job wrong.</p>
<p>If you are an emergency room professional, it's your job to deal with people who accidentally tried to kill themselves. You live in dread of Firework Season and the mangled hands and faces that come with it. You have an abiding hatred of band and table-saws sold before the technology to stop lopping off fingers was standard on everything. You privately call motorcycle riders without helmets 'organ donors' because you've had to make that call, many times. You're saving lives, but it would go better if people would stop trying to kill themselves so hard. You'd never say it in front of a patient; but to coworkers, or other emergency professionals, you share (appropriately redacted) stories of epic stupidity. You bond through misery, because showing you <em>understand</em> to another person requires revealing your own pain.</p>
<p>You may be getting my point now.</p>
<p>If you are in old-school Operations, it's your job to deploy the software that Development gives you and keep it running. Only, Development doesn't understand your job, or has terribly wrong assumptions about it, so installs never go quite right. Or the software is buggy in ways that wake you up at night. Or hasn't updated the troubleshooting guide in five years, so two thirds of it have completely wrong resolutions. Or the software comes with a whole bunch of new hardware you have to integrate -- somehow, somewhere -- on a challenging deadline. Or Development can only be reached during business hours, so when something goes wrong at 2am you're improvising on no information until someone wakes up and checks email.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous three examples, you work with the people who are causing you pain; so you have the opportunity to <strong>stop the pain</strong>. If the organization doesn't have official feedback loops (DevOps techniques) the unofficial ones of sarcasm, belittling, quiet swearing, and low voiced rants of just <em>how hard it is</em> are all you have left. You are the dragon in the datacenter. Like the custodians, Animal Control Officers, and ER professionals, you bond with your peers through shared misery and a wish that the world was a better place, so you didn't have to clean up other people's messes so often.</p>
<p>DevOps is all about breaking down silos, getting Dev and Ops actually talking. And not just talking, getting involved in each other's processes.</p>
<ul>
<li>If Operations can change the trajectory of software development to be less painful, it feels less like cleaning up other people's messes.</li>
<li>If Development has some stake in how the software is operated, Ops is more likely to encounter empathy when something goes wrong in production.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's far from perfect, but having official ways to communicate and get effective change is far better than relying on unofficial change-management techniques based around being hard to work with.</p>

A classic book called Foundations of Mechanical Accuracy described this and other concepts in detail. It’s available as a PDF <a href="http://frank.villaro-dixon.eu/public_upload/Foundations%20of%20Mechanical%20Accuracy%20by%20Wayne%20R%20Moore%20-%201970.pdf">here</a> and in print <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006CAKT8/ref=as_li_tl?camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0006CAKT8&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;linkId=9a3b69c12fefcdb4c52fac9cb6d7d37d&amp;tag=eweinhoffer-20">here</a>.</p><p>Typically made of granite, surface plates act as a datum, or the basis upon which precise measurements and movements can be made. They can be finished to a variety of grades of flatness, based on their intended use, and can even be used to <a href="https://youtu.be/sFrVdoOhu1Q?t=378" target="_blank">build up precise structures</a>&nbsp;(that whole video is a must-watch, btw). When dealing with such flat surfaces, tiny imperfections or gradual wear can have drastic effects: using a gauge over the same spot on a surface plate, or leaving it in a space where the temperature varies by more than a few degrees, can negatively affect their flatness. Due to this, calibrating and conditioning your plate is important. The process is really neat, partially because it requires an autocollimator and an incredibly precise repeat-o-meter. Watch a great video from Tom Lipton about the process <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWqThb9Z1jk">here</a>.</p><p>The neat thing about surface plates is that they do not require precision tools to create. By using the “three plate method”, developed by Joseph Whitworth, flat surfaces can be created by using gravity and a simple hand-scraping tool, or by lapping the plates against each other. By starting with three plates of relative flatness, rubbing the plates against each other in alternating pairs to remove the high spots can yield fantastic results.&nbsp;</p><p>The process can be completed in six steps, and then repeated until the desired level of flatness is achieved. In this visual explanation, the surface finishes of the three plates are exaggerated. Before beginning this process, the three plates (Red, Green and Blue) should be machined or ground to as flat a surface as possible, to remove all unnecessary lapping work. In addition, a fine abrasive compound is often used between plates to assist in material removal. Tom also has <a href="https://youtu.be/rHmsQEAx16o" target="_blank">a great video series</a> about this, which includes some compound and technique recommendations.</p><h3><strong>STEP 1</strong></h3><p>To begin, the Red and Green plates are lapped against each other in an alternating manner. That is, one plate remains stationary while the other is lapped against it, and then the opposite is performed:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1501464915476_27886"><div><p>At the completion of this step, the Red and Green plates “agree with” each other, but that is all.</p><h3><strong>STEP 2</strong></h3><p>Next, the Red plate acts as the control (it remains stationary) while the Blue plate is lapped against it:</p></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="61" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1501464915476_70590"><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>My friend asked me an interesting question about what skills are worth learning for Data Management specialists and how to build a <a href="https://github.com/datastacktv/data-engineer-roadmap">grow roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, the question made me think because I haven't had a clear picture in my head. It's just my thoughts on the topic and for the most part, I'm just <strong>speculating</strong> about the current state and the future of Data Management.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In the beginning, as in any other area, there are basic things that any Software Engineer should know.</p>
<p>In short, I assume that the person who came to the Big Data already knows some programming language and has an idea about such basic things as CS algorithms, SQL, VCS, SDLC, Networking fundamentals, Linux basics, <a href="https://luminousmen.com/post/continuous-Integration-continuous-delivery">CI/CD</a>, etc. One way or another the common practices of software engineering do not go anywhere — this is the basis that I think is needed in any field. If you lack them then you better learn them, but perhaps you can argue with me here.</p>
<h2>Big Data Basics</h2>
<p>This is another layer of knowledge that I think is the basic one. Here I could highlight programming languages, for example, because in the Big Data world there are predominant languages without which it's just hard (or impossible) to do something. These are of course JVM languages such as <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Scala</strong> may soon be joined by Kotlin, and, of course, <strong>Python</strong> as the second best language for everything and the de-facto language for Data Science.</p>
<p>Aside from languages, there are some terms and fundamental concepts behind the Big Data that I think should be learned such as horizontal scaling, distributed systems, <a href="https://luminousmen.com/?tag=asynchrony">asynchronous communication</a>, CAP, eventual consistency, consensus problems, availability, durability, reliability, resiliency, fault tolerance, disaster recovery, etc. There is no need for a deep understanding of them but if you want to succeed in the field you better Google it at least.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about how the field is developing, to be more precise, the challenges it faces.</p>
<h2>Data Challenges</h2>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/data-management-skills/data-management-skills-2.jpg" alt="Big Data"></p>
<p>This layer of knowledge in one form or another refers to the problems that have to be solved when working with data and how you can imagine — where you have big data you have big problems.</p>
<p>When you're working on one or another layer of data processing, you'll need some particular set of skills. Let's dive into them.</p>
<p>The majority of Big Data pipelines consist of the following layers:</p>
<h3>Data Layer</h3>
<p>With the increasing amount of stored information, the problem of Data Storage has historically been the first. This is the foundation of any system that works with data — there are many technologies that store massive amounts of raw data coming from traditional sources such as OLTP databases, and newer, less structured sources such as log files, sensors, web analytics, document archives, and media archives. As you can see, these are very different areas with their own specifics and we are collecting data from all of them.</p>
<p>The first thing that immediately pops up is which format to use for storing data, how to structure it optimally, and how to store the data optimally. Here, of course, you can think of <a href="https://luminousmen.com/post/big-data-file-formats">Parquet, CSV, Avro formats</a> that are very common in the Big Data world. Also, the use of codecs such as Bzip2, Snappy, Lzo, etc. can be considered. Well, optimizations are basically either a proper partitioning or some storage-specific thing.</p>
<p>The main technology on which this layer is built on is, of course, <strong>Hadoop</strong> with <a href="https://luminousmen.com/post/hadoop-yarn-spark">HDFS</a> — a classic large-scale file system. It has become popular due to its durability and limitless scale on conventional equipment. However, nowadays, more and more data is stored in the cloud or at least in hybrid solutions — organizations are moving from outdated on-premise storage systems to managed services such as AWS S3, GCP GCS, or <a href="https://luminousmen.com/post/azure-blob-storage-with-pyspark">Azure Blobs</a>.</p>
<p>For SQL solutions, among the popular apps are <strong>Hive</strong> or <strong>Presto</strong> or more interesting Data Warehouse solutions, which I think lie above simple SQL engines. We will talk about them a little bit later.</p>
<p>For the NoSQL solution, it is either <strong>Cassandra</strong> with support for ACID, <strong>MongoDB</strong> for the document data model, and manageable data sizes, or AWS <strong>DynamoDB</strong> for the scalable solution if you are in the AWS cloud.</p>
<p>For a graph database, I can recall only <strong>Neo4j</strong>. It is very well suited for storing graph data or related information such as a group of people and their relationships. Data modeling this type of information in a traditional SQL database is a pain and very inefficient.</p>
<h4>Data Lake</h4>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/data-management-skills/data-management-skills-6.JPG" alt="Data Lake"></p>
<p>A <a href="https://luminousmen.com/post/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse">Data Lake</a> is the company's centralized repository that allows storing all structured and unstructured data about the business. Here we store data as is, without structuring it, and run different types of analytics on top.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the digital transformation is actually about applying a data-driven approach to every aspect of the business in an effort to create a competitive advantage. That's why more and more companies want to build their own data lake solutions. This trend is still continuing and those skills are still in need.</p>
<p>The most popular tools here are still <strong>HDFS</strong> for the on-prem solution and cloud data storage solutions from AWS, GCP, and Azure. Aside from that, there are also some data platforms that are trying to fill several niches and create integrated solutions, for example, <strong>Cloudera</strong>, <strong>Apache Hudi</strong>, <strong>Delta Lake</strong>.</p>
<h4>Data Warehouse</h4>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse-2.JPG" alt="Data Warehouse"></p>
<p>A <a href="https://luminousmen.com/post/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse">Data Warehouse</a> can be described as a relational database where processed business data is stored, but aims to be optimized for aggregation requests. In any case, it is the same foundation for building analytics and data-driven decisions as Data Lake and they do not exclude each other, but rather complement each other.</p>
<p>Data Marts are one of the last layers of Data Warehouse solutions designed to meet the requirements of a specific business function. Their ability to pull data from disparate sources and make it available to business users makes them a growing trend in the field of data warehousing.</p>
<p>Trending data warehouse solution includes <strong>Teradata</strong>, <strong>Snowflake</strong>, <strong>BigQuery</strong>, AWS <strong>Redshift</strong>.</p>
<h4>Data Hub</h4>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/data-management-skills/data-management-skills-4.JPG" alt="Data Hub"></p>
<p>There are Data Warehouses where the information is sorted, ordered, and presented in the form of final conclusions(the rest is discarded), and Data Lakes — "dump everything here, because you never know what will be useful". <strong>Data Hub</strong> is focused on those who do not belong to either the first or the second category.</p>
<p>The Data Hub architecture allows you to leave your data where it is, providing <em>centralization of the processing but not the storage</em>. The data is searched and accessed right where it is located at the moment. But, because the Data Hub is planned and managed, organizations must invest significant time and energy determining what their data means, where it comes from and what transformations it must complete before it can be put into the Data Hub.</p>
<p>The Data Hub is a different way of thinking about storage architecture. And I bet it will gain some attention in the future — all of the enabling pieces are available today.</p>
<h3>Data Ingestion</h3>
<p>To create data storage, you need to ingest data from the various sources into the data layer, whether it is Data Lake or Data Warehouse or just HDFS. The data source can be such systems as CRM like Salesforce, enterprise resource planning systems like SAP, RDBMS like Postgres or any log files, documents, social network graphs, etc. And data can be uploaded either through batch jobs or through real-time streams.</p>
<p>There are many tools for ingestion, one of the common ones is <strong>Sqoop</strong>. It provides an extensible Java-based framework that can be used to develop drivers used to import data into Hadoop. Sqoop runs on the MapReduce framework in Hadoop, and can also be used to export data from Hadoop to RDBMS.</p>
<p>Another one of the common tools is <strong>Flume</strong>. It is used when a data stream is entered faster than it can be used. Typically, Flume is used to ingest data streams in HDFS or Kafka, where it can act as a Kafka producer. Multiple Flume agents can also be used to collect data from multiple sources into the Flume collector.</p>
<p>Another tool gaining popularity is <strong>Nifi</strong>. Nifi-processors are file-oriented and have no schema. This means that some data is represented as a FlowFile (it can be an actual file on disk or some block of data obtained elsewhere). Each processor is responsible for understanding the content of the data to work with them. So if one processor understands format A and the other only understands format B, you may have to convert the data format between the two processors.</p>
<p>And one of the de-facto standards in the message bus world is <strong>Kafka</strong> — an open-source streaming messaging bus that can create a feed from your data sources, partition the data, and stream it to consumers. Apache Kafka is a mature and powerful solution used in production on a huge scale.</p>
<h3>Data Processing</h3>
<p>Thanks to the data ingestion pipelines, the data is fed into the data layer. Now you need technologies that can process large amounts of data to facilitate analysis and crunch this data. Data analysts and engineers want to run queries against big data, which requires huge computing power. The data processing layer must optimize the data to facilitate efficient analysis, and provide a computational engine to execute the queries.</p>
<p>The most popular pattern here is ETL(Extract Transform Load) — a popular data processing paradigm. Essentially we extract data from a source(s), clean it up, and convert it into the structured information that we uploading to a target database, data warehouse, or data lake.</p>
<p>And one of the tools that successfully implements this pattern is <strong><a href="https://luminousmen.com/?tag=spark">Apache Spark</a></strong>. This is one of my most important big data multi-tools which should already be in the hands of anyone who is dealing with large amounts of data. It performs parallelized queries for structured or unstructured data on Hadoop, Mesos, Kubernetes, or others. Spark also provides an SQL interface and has good streaming and built-in ML capabilities.</p>
<h4>ELT</h4>
<p><img src="https://iamluminousmen-media.s3.amazonaws.com/media/data-management-skills/data-management-skills-3.JPG" alt="ETL vs ELT"></p>
<p>Currently, there is movement from ETL to ELT, when the transformations take place inside the data …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regular Expressions</a> are useful for finding patterns within strings of text. For example, you can find all the dates in a blog post with the <code>\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}</code> pattern, which will match strings of the format <code>yyyy-mm-dd</code>. Also, just last week we made an HTTP router in the <a href="https://codesalad.dev/blog/building-a-go-router-from-scratch-3">Building a Go Router From Scratch</a> tutorial that used regular expressions to extract dynamic URL parameters.</p>
<p><strong>This post dives into Go's built-in <code>regexp</code> package</strong> and show examples of some of the most common uses of regular expressions.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-expressions">Compiling Expressions<a href="#compiling-expressions">#</a></h2>
<p>Go's <code>regexp</code> package contains many useful utilities for creating and matching regular expressions. Once imported, expressions can be compiled using either the <code>Compile()</code> or <code>MustCompile()</code> methods.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"regexp"</span>
<span>)</span>

<span>func</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>regexp</span><span>.</span><span>Regexp</span>

    <span>// TIP: Use uninterpereted strings (`...`) instead of </span>
    <span>// interpreted strings ("...") to prevent the need to</span>
    <span>// escape backslashes and other special characters.</span>
    <span>//   regexp.MustCompile("(\\s)pattern")</span>
    <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>regexp</span><span>.</span><span>MustCompile</span><span>(</span><span>`(\s)pattern`</span><span>)</span>

    <span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Match</span><span>(</span><span>"This is a pattern"</span><span>))</span> <span>// true</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<h3 id="compile-vs-mustcompile">Compile() vs. MustCompile()<a href="#compile-vs-mustcompile">#</a></h3>
<p>The only difference between Compile and MustCompile is how errors are handled. When an invalid pattern is given, Compile returns an error while MustCompile panics instead. When using fixed patterns in code—like we'll be doing in this post—we can safely use MustCompile because we know our patterns are valid. However, when generating dynamic expressions or accepting expressions from user input, errors <em>will</em> happen and should be handled accordingly.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>// Create Regexp and error</span>
<span>r</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span> <span>:=</span> <span>regexp</span><span>.</span><span>Compile</span><span>(</span><span>`my\s*regexp`</span><span>)</span>

<span>// Create Regexp or panic on fail</span>
<span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>regexp</span><span>.</span><span>MustCompile</span><span>(</span><span>`my\s*regexp`</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<h2 id="basic-matching">Basic Matching<a href="#basic-matching">#</a></h2>
<p>Now that we know how to compile a pattern into the <code>Regexp</code> type, we can access its methods and functionality. The most common use for regular expressions is to check to see if a pattern matches, and get the value.</p>
<p>All methods have a variant for strings, bytes, and Reader. For example <code>MatchString()</code>, <code>Match()</code>, and <code>MatchReader()</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>regexp</span><span>.</span><span>MustCompile</span><span>(</span><span>`Hello \w+!`</span><span>)</span>

<span>// Check for a match</span>
<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>MatchString</span><span>(</span><span>"Hey, Hello World!"</span><span>)</span>   <span>// true</span>
<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>MatchString</span><span>(</span><span>"Goodbye World!"</span><span>)</span>      <span>// false</span>

<span>// Also check []byte and Reader</span>
<span>b</span> <span>:=</span> <span>[]</span><span>byte</span><span>(</span><span>"Hey, Hello World!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>Match</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>)</span>                        <span>// true</span>
<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>MatchReader</span><span>(</span><span>bytes</span><span>.</span><span>NewBuffer</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>))</span> <span>// true</span>

<span>// Return matched substring</span>
<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>FindString</span><span>(</span><span>"Hey, Hello World!"</span><span>)</span> <span>// "Hello World!"</span>
<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>FindString</span><span>(</span><span>"Goodbye World!"</span><span>)</span>    <span>// ""</span>
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<h2 id="group-matching">Group Matching<a href="#group-matching">#</a></h2>
<p>Regular expression groups provide a useful means for referencing specific parts within a match. Here are some examples showing how to extract year, month, and day from a string.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>// Match "2020-09-30" format</span>
<span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>regexp</span><span>.</span><span>MustCompile</span><span>(</span><span>`(?P&lt;Year&gt;\d{4})-(?P&lt;Month&gt;\d{2})-(?P&lt;Day&gt;\d{2})`</span><span>)</span>

<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>FindStringSubmatch</span><span>(</span><span>"2020-10-04"</span><span>)</span> <span>// ["2020-10-04", "2020", "10", "04"]</span>
<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>FindStringSubmatch</span><span>(</span><span>"yyyy-mm-dd"</span><span>)</span> <span>// nil</span>
<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>SubexpNames</span><span>()</span>                    <span>// ["", "Year", "Month", "Day"]</span>
</code></pre></div>
</div>

<h2 id="replacement">Replacement<a href="#replacement">#</a></h2>
<p>We can also replace matches with new values. Replacement also supports groups using the <code>$</code> character. Groups can either be named (<code>(?P&lt;Year&gt;\d{4}</code>) or unnamed (<code>(\d{4}</code>).</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>// Match "2020-09-30" format</span>
<span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>regexp</span><span>.</span><span>MustCompile</span><span>(</span><span>`(?P&lt;Year&gt;\d{4})-(?P&lt;Month&gt;\d{2})-(?P&lt;Day&gt;\d{2})`</span><span>)</span>

<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>ReplaceAllString</span><span>(</span><span>"2020-10-30"</span><span>,</span> <span>"yyyy-mm-dd"</span><span>)</span>              <span>// "yyyy-mm-dd"</span>

<p>Regular expressions are extremely powerful tool to have in your programming tool belt. They work very similarly in most languages, so mastering them is time well spent. In this post, we covered some of the most common use-cases, but there are many other features of the pattern syntax that are useful to know.</p>
<p>For example, you can define a case-insensitive expression using the <code>(?i)</code> flag.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><code><span>r</span> <span>:=</span> <span>regexp</span><span>.</span><span>Compile</span><span>(</span><span>`(?i)Case InseNsitIve`</span><span>)</span>
<span>r</span><span>.</span><span>MatchString</span><span>(</span><span>`THIS IS CASE INSENSITIVE`</span><span>)</span> <span>// true</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>These days, I <em>almost</em> exclusively run Arch Linux in my homelab and personal machines.
Had I the brain cells to spare, I’d try and get NixOS running on ARMv7, but in the meantime, a mix of vanilla x86_64 Arch and Arch Linux ARM is my chosen flavor just to keep things consistent.
I’ve run Arch as my primary server OS for almost a decade now, and although I’m sure some will balk at the idea, I’ve found that the distribution has performed wonderfully for me, even in contrast to traditional “server” distributions like CentOS.
It sounds counterinuitive, but the simple model of Arch Linux has, overall, helped mitigate some maintenance burdens.</p>

<p>Here’s some of best practices I’ve accumulated over the years of personally administering ~20 Arch Linux machines in my homelab.</p>

<h3 id="prelude-why-arch">Prelude: Why Arch?</h3>

<p>I don’t want to get into a distribution holy war here; there’s endless forums for that debate.
However, I <em>will</em> get into the reasons why I now default to Arch Linux when provisioning hosts, as many of those reasons naturally flow into why I include certain best practices.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A “rolling release” distribution is a nice methodology for server maintenance.
<a href="https://rootco.de/2020-02-10-regular-releases-are-wrong/">See this other blog post enumerating why rolling releases make sense within the context of openSUSE</a>.
Want a “version”? Use the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux_Archive">Arch Linux Archive</a> to pinpoint a moment in time.
(I still begrudge that CentOS 6’s upgrade path to 7 discourages in-place upgrades)</li>
  <li>In contrast to “kitchen sink” distributions, when I <em>do</em> need to bolt on additions to my install, I know exactly how I’ve done it, so fixing problems and building systems isn’t a game of guesswork about how the distribution chose to configure those services.
I’m the one that did it, so I can better maintain it.</li>
  <li>The catalog of packages, when you factor in the AUR, is almost complete for most people.
When I can’t find an Arch package, which is very seldom these days, I package it on the AUR and move on - <code>PKGBUILD</code>s aren’t terribly difficult to write.</li>
  <li>The aforementioned simplicity of Arch systems is also reflected in the Arch-specific software projects like <code>pacman</code>.
Setting up a private pacman repo within my LAN was so easy I thought I was doing something wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pacman-hygiene">Pacman Hygiene</h3>

<p>One of the trickiest aspects of Linux distribution maintenance that I didn’t understand was keeping configuration files up to date.
By that I mean catching and updating files somewhere like <code>/etc/</code> so that when package <code>foobar</code> upgrades from 1.0 to 2.0 and the default configuration file <code>/etc/foobar.conf</code> adds the setting <code>telemetry = true</code>, you can merge in the new configuration files and optionally set them to desired values.</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman/Pacnew_and_Pacsave">The Arch Wiki has a good page about this</a> but the most important thing to remember is that, in the vast majority of cases, an interactive process (via a human at a terminal) is needed to judge which parts of your existing configuration file needs to be edited.
I suggest using <a href="http://kmkeen.com/pacmatic/">pacmatic</a> for this.
The pacmatic web site outlines how to use the utility, but in short: <code>pacmatic</code> will a) alert you to any announcements from the Arch Linux project in case there’s news about needed intervention in the course of normal system operations and b) automatically prompt and help update configuration files.
I like this method because it’s closely linked to <code>pacman</code> operations so you can’t forget to update these files and the <code>pacmatic</code> command is a drop-in replacement for <code>pacman</code>.</p>

<p><code>pacmatic</code> is starting to age a little, but you can still get the same effect by using the <code>pacdiff</code> command from the <code>pacman-contrib</code> package.</p>

<h3 id="aur-automation">AUR Automation</h3>

<p>Using Arch for non-trivial use-cases is almost certainly going to lead you towards relying on some <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">AUR</a> packages.</p>

<p>Unlike official packages that are curated by Arch Linux Trusted Users, the AUR has less control surrounding submission of packages.
Validating the legitimacy of a <code>PKGBUILD</code> is <em>always</em> a good idea, and for first-time users, building and installing an AUR package is typically comprised of a) downloading the package snapshot, checking out the <code>PKGBUILD</code>, and building it with <code>makepkg</code>.</p>

<p>That’s all well and good, but if you use a non-trivial number of AUR packages, this process is <em>way</em> too manual.
You really want some automation in place around this, but I’m not talking about a tool like <code>yay</code> that automates the fetching and building for a package’s source.
You need a tool that handles all update steps as part of a schedule so that installing updated AUR packages is inlined as part of the normal <code>-Syu</code> process.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the most reliable option here is <a href="https://github.com/alexheretic/aurto">aurto</a> (which, in turn, uses <a href="https://github.com/AladW/aurutils">aurutils</a> under the hood).
Why should you use something like <code>aurto</code>?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scheduled updates. <code>aurto</code> comes bundled with systemd timers to check for package updates, so you don’t burn time checking for updates and building packages manually.</li>
  <li>Custom repositories. Following the Arch paradigm of building and indexing packages into proper repositories means that you don’t think about pulling in updates, they just happen for you. You can also easily share built packages across a network (which I rely on heavily).</li>
  <li><code>aurutils</code> follows lots of good operational hygiene (for example, building in clean chroots and explicitly trusting maintainers as a build step).</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that, like any sort of AUR automation, you’re trusting the maintainer of the packages you track to not bundle malicious code, but that’s a risk you take with any sort of interaction with the AUR.</p>

<h3 id="snapshotting">Snapshotting</h3>

<p>If you’re using Linux in 2020, there’s no reason why you can’t be using a modern, advanced, copy-on-write filesystem.
Are you comfortable relying on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support">dkms</a>?
Then use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenZFS#Distributions">ZFS on Linux</a>.
Honestly, it’s fantastic, and you get copy-on-write, snapshots, compression, and more.
It’s the current best-of-breed filesystem for Linux, in my opinion.
If you want, <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Btrfs">btrfs</a> can fit a similar role, but I trust ZFS more.</p>

<p>Providing a point-in-time backup before system upgrades becomes <em>extremely</em> easy on these filesystems.
Run a snapshot as a pacman hook before you make changes, and you can rollback to a known good state easily.
There are some ready-made packages out there that stitch together ZFS/btrfs with pacman hooks so you don’t even need to write the automation yourself.</p>

<p>If you’re already snapshotting a filesystem, cheap (as in effort) backups are just a small extra step if you want to replicate the snapshot images somewhere else.
My ZFS and btrfs filesystems get duplicated offsite over simple <code>ssh</code> commands as added disaster recovery insurance, which means that not only do you have system backups saved outside your network, but your whole history of backups if you need to restore from a point in time.
There are actually a wide variety of projects that do this, but personally, I use <a href="https://github.com/khenderick/zfs-snap-manager">zfs-snap-manager</a> for my zpools and <a href="https://github.com/csirac2/snazzer">snazzer</a> for my btrfs volumes.
Both automate retention and incremental backups, which are the tricky parts.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some of these suggestions eat up disk space.
I’d definitely suggest using filesystem compression to help with that.</p>

<h3 id="grab-bag">Grab Bag</h3>

<p>The preceding three points have had the greatest impact on my Arch Linux system maintainability, but there are a few minor mentions just for sake of completeness:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remember to run <code>pacman -Sc</code> every once in a while.
Those old packages take up space.</li>
  <li>A periodic <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Reflector">reflector</a> script can be handy in keeping your mirrorlist healthy.</li>
  <li>Using <code>aurto</code> and <code>aurutils</code> to host a repository of local AUR packages? Share it on your network easily:</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>  $</span><span> </span><span>sudo </span>pacmatic <span>-S</span> darkhttpd
<span>  $</span><span> </span><span>sudo </span>systemctl edit darkhttpd
<span>  [Service]
  ExecStart=
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/darkhttpd /var/cache/pacman --ipv6 --uid http --gid http --chroot --mimetypes /etc/conf.d/mimetypes
</span><span>  $</span><span> </span><span>sudo </span>systemctl <span>enable</span> <span>--now</span> darkhttpd
<span>  </span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then just add the following section to your other machines’ <code>pacman.conf</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="ini">  <span>[aurto]</span>
  <span>Server</span> <span>=</span> <span>http://&lt;hostname&gt;/aurto</span>
  <span>SigLevel</span> <span>=</span> <span>Optional</span>
  </code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Edits</strong>: rhysperry​111 <a href="https://forum.tjll.net/t/tyblog-industrial-strength-arch-linux/235/4">caught</a> a <code>systemctl</code> typo, and AladW <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/j4hqj2/industrial_strength_arch_linux/g7j7im6/">noted I conflated</a> <code>aurto</code> and <code>aurutils</code> in a few places.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-74174200445ef6e30546"><div><p>This blog post is very late. It’s well over a year since<a href="https://twitter.com/colmmacc/status/1153727018896244736"> I posted a coding challenge on twitter</a>. The idea was simple, I’ve always felt that code readability is undervalued so I figured I’d put cold hard cash up. I announced a $1,000 pot, divided into $500, $300, and $200 prizes for the most readable implementations of <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2019/06/06/nearly-divisionless-random-integer-generation-on-various-systems/">Daniel Lemire’s nearly divisionless algorithm for selecting a random number from an interval.</a> I now have winners to announce and congratulate, and they’re in this blog post, but there’s more to this story.</p><p>I didn’t know it at the time but I’d end up reviewing the entries with colleagues to see if they could follow what was happening (spoiler: they couldn’t). When people got stuck, we’d whiteboard&nbsp;our way through so that we could better understand why and where people were getting stuck. Oh, to be able to whiteboard in person again!  </p><p>I learned a lot about how people think through problems, and that process led to me writing a seperate implementation of Lemire’s Algorithm, with a twenty-to-one comment to code ratio (that’s a lot of comments), and finding a sort-of security issue with the algorithm in the process. I say “sort of” because you really have a ridiculously enormous struggle to find a case where it’s going to be practical to exploit. But it still surprised me, and you probably can’t use Lemire’s algorithm in Vegas.</p><h4>Why Lemire’s Algorithm?</h4><p>I chose Lemire’s algorithm because it is brilliant. When I read Lemire’s code I get that kind of brain-tingling and gawk at the sheer “How on earth did someone think of this” of it all. Lemire has a mastery of code and how code is executed, and then pairs that with transcendent creativity and concision.  Lemire also writes well, and the papers that accompany his code and algorithms are easily some of the most cogent and approachable you’ll find in academia. They are short and clear and avoid the jargon and obtuseness that plagues the field, while containing just enough formalism to be rigorous.</p><p>Lemire’s algorithm is a solution to the problem “Give me a random number between 0 and N, not including N itself”. For simulating a dice, N would be 6 and you’d get back either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 with equal probability. Computers like to start at zero. We can always add one to the result to get the familiar results you’d get on a real dice. I’ve worked on random number generators and written quite a few. In 20 years of doing that, I’d never come across a solution as cool as Lemire’s.</p><p>Before Lemire, the best-known solutions to this problem required one or two divisions per number generated. You probably learned long division when you were quite young. You may remember that it can be get pretty tedious and cumbersome. It’s the same for computers. Division is actually one of the slowest things we can ask a computer to do. Lemire avoids division by translating numbers into a much larger number “space” and using binary-friendly powers-of-two operations instead. His technique almost always avoids needing a division.</p><p>The second reason I chose Lemire’s algorithm is that it is impenetrable upon first reading. There are lucky few people who are so practiced and conversant in number manipulation that they can see inside of algorithms like Neo in the matrix, but I don’t mean them. To the average reader, myself included, it’s not clear what’s going on and why.</p><p>Lemire’s reference code is fourteen lines long, like a sonnet. Twelve of the lines are simple, and any proficient programmer could tell <em>what</em> they are doing. Two specific lines of the code are pretty hard to decipher.. But the real difficulty is how hard it is to understand <em>why</em> all 14 lines are doing what they are doing, and <em>why</em> it results in a fair and correct algorithm for choosing a random number.</p><div><p>As a case in point, if you read the comments to Lemire’s blog, you’ll find several misunderstandings of the code. That’s within an audience of primed Lemire fans and critics who are familiar with the field. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10941">Lemire’s accompanying paper</a> is great and very readable, but it still takes effort and concentration to follow everything. I work on cryptography and write cryptographic code for a living and I’m not ashamed to tell you it took me about 3 readings to really get it. The algorithm is based on an interaction between two modular spaces, one of which is sized 2 to power of 64, and the other is “N” sized, and if I just totally lost you there, I beg forgiveness and if you bear with me I promise there’s a link to my detailed dissection of how and why everything works. </p><p>All of this makes Lemire’s algorithm a really good challenge for creating a more readable version. Ideally something that an average coder can read in one pass, understand, and agree that it’s correct. </p></div><h4>Why does readability matter?</h4><p>Code readability is the most important pillar of code correctness and maintainability. When code is unreadable, it is harder to spot errors. That’s true when you’re doing a code review and it’s even more true when you’re adding more code to an existing code base. Great testing can compensate for some of the correctness challenges, but it doesn’t do as much for maintainability. </p><p>In s2n, one of our <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/s2n/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md">development principles</a> is to write clear readable code with a light cognitive load. We’re serious about it, and I wasn’t going to try and use Lemire’s algorithm in s2n without a very readable implementation.</p><p>Working in software development I’ve heard the opinion more than once about how programmers and coders should be more familiar with the fundamental mathematics of logic and number theory that underpin their field, and that academic style papers and explanations should be sufficient. I happen to work with teams that are made up of both expert coders and expert mathematicians, and even there I don’t think this is a good idea.</p><p>Software engineering is engineering, which means translating science into solutions that work in the real world.  To wildly generalize, there are better dividends to be found in focusing on deepening ones understanding of the “real world” part of that, the users, the customers, the business models, usability, ergonomics, and so on, than on the “science” part of that. Some science is needed, but there’s a shallow limit. Just as a civil engineer doesn’t need too detailed an understanding of the chemistry of concrete. PHs and setting times, but not quantum numbers.</p><p>Code should be self-documenting. The average programmer, including someone straight out of college, should be able to understand and work on a well put-together codebase. This greatly improves the odds of finding problems, and that’s what matters. </p><h4>The contest</h4><p>One of the reasons I’ve been so tardy about this blog post is that the contest didn’t go as I’d expected. </p><p>Let’s start with the great thing that happened. I got several submissions, more than enough to pick winners from. Many of these submissions are good and do improve upon Lemire’s code. The most common improvement was to use more descriptive names for the variables. Lemire uses variable names such as “s”, “t”, “l” which seemingly don’t correspond to much. In such a short piece of code, this actually isn’t too big an offense. I kept these terms in my own implementation, because I want to be consistent with the paper, but it’s absolutely a valid improvement. Another great improvement is to write and include tests, which is really an essential part of software development. </p><p>The first place <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/98183e47436699f6e5eab200061c46eec342806e/std/rand.zig#L74-L118">winner</a> did both of these, and also cleared up some of the confusing lines of code by making an implicit truncation explicit. According to GitHub the winner had 5 contributors, but twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/komu_wairagu/status/1161643573223317504">komu_wairagu</a> submitted it, so that’s who I’ll be contacting to Venmo $500.</p><p>The second place <a href="https://github.com/nimia/Lemire_RNG">winner</a> comes from <a href="https://twitter.com/NimrodAviram">Nimrod Aviram</a>, who I know professionally as the discoverer of the DROWN vulnerability and fun person to hang out with at RealWorldCrypto. Nimrod’s implementation includes some great testing too.</p><p>The third place winner wants to stay anonymous, and cheated their way to some bonus points by writing a great implementation in LISP. How can you not love that? If they change their minds about anonymity I’ll update this post with a link. The sha256 checksum of their implementation is ae008644b2f0b10eddbbce3a0508b103b19925e4e0c9354c569ff0816acb760c. </p><p>Now on to the not as great, and one of the reasons I’ve taken this long to write. It doesn’t feel right to criticize any of these efforts, made in spare time and as part of a fun challenge I put out there, but none of them actually explained Lemire’s algorithm or broke down how and why it worked. I asked several colleagues to look through these implementations and tell me if they understood what was going on, and the response was a uniform zero. Noone could fully understand even one of the implementations, or Lemire’s original.  When I asked people to also read the paper, things got a bit better, but everyone still seemed to trip on some issues.  These are smart people who absolutely know what they are doing. I’m sure given more time they could fully understand everything, but that wasn’t the goal. The goal was to have understanding after one or two, or at most just a few, readings.</p><h4>What did people find hard to follow?</h4><p>Talking through things with people I found some common problems. Some directly in the code, and others in the paper. The first line of code that threw people was:</p><pre><code>uint64_t l = ( uint64_t ) m;</code></pre><p>This line of code does an unusual operation called truncation. It takes a 128-bit value “m” and truncates that to its least significant 64-bits. All of this is implicit in the code, rather than explicit. Reading the code, you have to recall that m is 128-bits. Then there’s also the question of why are we doing this truncation? I’ll leave that for a minute. </p><p>The next problematic line of code was:</p><pre><code>uint64_t t = -s % s;</code></pre><p>This line of code is using an unusual combination of unary negation, on an unsigned int, and the modulus operator.  Nobody remembers what unary negation does to an unsigned int - and why should they …</p></div></div></div>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The sky over California is reddish brown. An army of nearly 20,000 firefighters has been battling against wildfires that have already charred over 3 million acres, destroyed over 6,000 houses and driven thousands of residents to flee. How could this happen?</p>


<p><strong>Pyne:</strong> California is built to burn, to burn explosively. That is a condition of its physical geography. And then we have decided to meet that implacable force with another one, a society that wants to live there&nbsp;-- and how it chooses to do so. We have relied on firefighting agencies to stand between&nbsp;those two forces. And I think they are reaching the point that they cannot do that.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Were the fires triggered by climate change?</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> Climate change is one factor among many others; it acts as a performance enhancer for fires. This is the fourth year of serial conflagrations. and that is quite remarkable. California would have a bad year and then five or seven or 10 years would pass. Now, we're four years running and there's no reason to think it's going to end.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Can the cooling off in the fall calm the situation?</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> No, the dry katabatic winds like the Santa Ana and the Diablo, especially, increase the wildfire risk, and the wind season is just beginning. The losses could double before the calendar year ends.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Even without climate change, California would be burning just as badly as it does now, Danish academic&nbsp;Bjørn Lomborg&nbsp;recently wrote in an editorial. Much bigger wildfires than today were already raging over a hundred years ago.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Pyne:</strong> No, it’s nonsense, to dismiss climate change, of course it plays a role as a performance enhancer. It is true, especially in the 19th century, there was a whole wave of huge mega fires, which often claimed many more lives than today. But at that time, the driving force was the new railroad lines, which opened up the land and triggered a wave of settlement,&nbsp;accompanied by the immense load of debris or slash left by land-clearing and logging. Sometimes more than 400 people died in a single fire. This phase continued into the 1930s. Since then,&nbsp;those conditions have passed&nbsp;and wildland fire fighting has been professionalized and expanded, and California is probably the world leader in this field. So, it looked like the problem was solved, but it wasn't. There are many reasons for this, including the fact that California’s&nbsp;wildfire season now lasts over a month longer than it did then.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> President Trump remarked that the fire crisis could have been averted by simply "cleaning your floors” and clearing out some trees and dead underbrush that can act as fuel for a fire.</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> That is not&nbsp;wholly&nbsp;wrong.&nbsp;But&nbsp;even if we improve the forest, we're going to be dealing with a worsening climate. In the current political situation, the fires are being misused to redirect to a political agenda. For some, it is all about climate change, for others it is all about logging more. But the issue is much more complex. We are all gathering around the fire, so to speak, everyone is commenting on it, but they all have their backs to the flames. Many people are just using the fire to animate some other message for their particular group. And that does nothing to solve the fire problem.&nbsp;What we need is for everybody to turn around, look at the flames.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Would it make sense to start regularly controlled fires to reduce the dry biomass, as is done in Florida, for example?</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> Yes, prescribed burning makes&nbsp;sense. Florida has&nbsp;a culture of burning that was never extinguished because of ranchers&nbsp;and&nbsp;a lot of favorable conditions.&nbsp;They don't have mountains. They don't have Santa Ana winds. They don't have the concentration of people in the interior.&nbsp;In fact, the&nbsp;saying&nbsp;was Florida burned twice a year because they would burn the same place more than once. So, the state forester of Florida once declared that 100 and 115 percent of the state had burned last year.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>In California, on the other hand, there are many mountainous regions, there are these strong Santa Ana winds, and many people live inland, in the Central Valley, in the Los Angeles basin, where the air quality is notoriously bad, even without fires. And now we're going to put millions or tens of millions of acres to deliberate burning?</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> If prescribed fires can prevent the big conflagrations, where does the strong aversion come from?</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> A very important impulse came from&nbsp;Europe. Bernhard Eduard Fernow, a Prussian forestry official who&nbsp;married an American,&nbsp;came to the United States in 1876, and was soon naturalized. He headed the Bureau of Forestry, which was a small agency in the Department of Agriculture. When&nbsp;America’s&nbsp;National Forests were actually transferred to its jurisdiction,&nbsp;it was renamed the Forest Service and headed by Gifford Pinchot, an American who trained in forestry in Europe.&nbsp;But Fernow also brought with him his Central European convictions. The problem was that&nbsp;the place he grew up in&nbsp;is a temperate climate. It's very unusual in the world because it does not have wet and dry periods regularly. So, the only fires that occur in your part of the world are ones set by people. So, fire was seen as a social problem, a problem of social order and disorder. Fernow looked at the American fire scene and declared that it was all a problem of "bad habits and loose morals.” Well, that’s a great phrase. But it was totally inappropriate.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> But Fernow is celebrated in America as a pioneer of forestry science.</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> Yes, he and his colleagues were smart, committed people, but they had no sense of how fire actually functioned&nbsp;outside of Europe. He didn't understand the ecological role of fire. Many Europeans regarded landscape as a kind of garden and&nbsp;contained fire by intensive cultivation. There's a tradition in European agronomy that really dislikes fire because it's messy. Potentially dangerous. It seems irrational. And there was a very clear distinction made by the 18th century that if you use fire, you are primitive. But in many regions of the world, fire simply belongs to the landscape. And relying exclusively on keeping fire out of the landscape does not work in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How did you become a fire historian?</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> When I started, the subject didn’t exist yet.&nbsp;It began for me when&nbsp;I was 18, just out of high school, and&nbsp;I worked&nbsp;as a firefighter on the north rim of the Grand Canyon. A lot of people did it for two years. Very few people did it for three. I did it for 15,&nbsp;moving between the&nbsp;wildfire season&nbsp;and the university. I didn't see any reason why I should&nbsp;not&nbsp;continue as long as I&nbsp;went&nbsp;to graduate school and the rest of it. We were a small team&nbsp;that did&nbsp;initial attack (the initial response to a wildfire). At that time,&nbsp;our&nbsp;biggest forest fires were perhaps 300 acres (about 200 soccer fields). That's ridiculously small by today’s standards. Most forest fires were triggered quite naturally by lightning.&nbsp;The part of firefighting I enjoyed most was what&nbsp;is&nbsp;called "size up.” It's when you first reach the fire and you have to make quick judgments. There would be two of us. Can we contain this fire? Do we need to call for some retardant? Do we need reinforcements? If so, what kind?&nbsp;If we&nbsp;can't contain the fire, where do we stop it next? Where do we make a stand?</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> How did that shape your thinking?</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> We developed a very close relationship with fire as part of the landscape: How will it behave? We often sat around the campfire at night and talked endlessly about fire. But what I learned was there was a kind of relationship with fire. And I learned to talk about fires the way most ordinary people would not. You know, there&nbsp;were&nbsp;really sweet fires. There were miserable fires. This was a fun fire. This was a real gut-wrenching fire. You know, this one&nbsp;just kicked us up and down the hill for a week. We were quite isolated at the rim,&nbsp;although there were many tourists and accommodations. It&nbsp;may be&nbsp;hard for people&nbsp;today to appreciate our isolation. We had newspapers that were two or three days old. We certainly had no television. We had no Internet. We had no private phones. It&nbsp;was a great life. Who cared? I&nbsp;learned&nbsp;about the lunar landing in 1969 from <em>Time</em> magazine, which I read days later.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The coronavirus pandemic is often compared to a forest fire. Is that an apt metaphor?</p><p><strong>Pyne:</strong> Yes. Maybe this metaphor even works the other way around: To me, Fire is the <em>other contagion</em>.&nbsp;Wildfires can be described as a kind of infection! But fire is a lot like&nbsp;a&nbsp;virus. It's not alive, but it depends on the living world to spread.&nbsp;And if we start controlled fires to prevent bad fires with good fire, it is similar to an annual flu shot or herd immunity. And then how do we respond to it? Well, you are wearing masks that protect against ember spread. Social distancing. Well, that's like defensible space. Unfortunately, fire research is dominated by physicists and chemists, and we would need biologists to study how fire behaves in an ecosystem -- and how to contain fire with ecological interventions. The corona epidemic can help to find a new language to talk about fire.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Having a personal server can have a lot of advantages, but also a lot of weakness:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are running a server <strong>all the time</strong>, even when no one is using your product.</li>
<li>You have to pay, <a href="https://www.webhostingsecretrevealed.net/website-hosting-cost/#5">sometimes a lot</a>.</li>
<li>You have to configure everything yourself and do some <em>sysadmin</em> work.</li>
<li>Resources allocated to your server are limited, and if you have a spike in usage, it may crash.</li>
</ul>
<p>For these reasons, building a WEB API can be unnecessarily long and expensive.  </p>
<p>The truth is that you may not need any server at all.<br>
What if I told you that it’s possible to code and deploy a performant WEB API  in seconds, without any cost?</p>

<p>To show you how, we are going to build a Serverless API and deploy it on Vercel.</p>
<p><strong>But what’s Serverless?</strong><br>
<a href="https://serverless-stack.com/">Serverless Stack</a> describes Serverless as “<em>an execution model where the cloud provider is responsible for executing a piece of code by dynamically allocating the resources</em>”. In other words, <em>Cloud Providers</em> such as <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> take care of everything, from resource management to deployment.</p>
<p>In this article, you’ll learn how to build a simple WEB API which send random lyrics from <em>Pop Smoke</em> (R.I.P 🕊).
We’ll code it in <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.Js</a> and use the <a href="https://genius-lyrics.zyrouge.gq/">genius-lyrics API</a>.
Again, all this in seconds, without paying anything.</p>

<p>As you can see, no need to add an API key to make <a href="https://genius-lyrics.zyrouge.gq/">genius-lyrics</a> work. But adding a Genius API key will unlock some cool features! You can see a more complete code <a href="https://github.com/LucasLeRay/serverless-vercel">here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Deployment 🍾</h2>
<p>The most interesting part, and yet the easiest one.  </p>
<p>To deploy on Vercel, install <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/cli">Vercel CLI</a> first:</p>
<pre><code>yarn global vercel
</code></pre>
<p>Then, deploy with the following command in the root of your project:</p>
<pre><code>vercel --prod
</code></pre>
<p>If it’s the first time you use the CLI, you’ll need to login to Vercel.<br>
You’ll be then prompted to add some infos to your project (default options are fine).</p>
<p>Here's the response you should have:</p>
<pre><code>Vercel CLI 20.1.1
🔍  Inspect: DETAILS-URL [3s]
✅  Production: https://YOUR-PRODUCTION-URL [copied to clipboard] [14s]
</code></pre>
<p>And voilà !<br>
Go to <code>https://YOUR-PRODUCTION-URL/api</code> to see it live!<br>
You can take a look at my live version <a href="https://serverless-vercel-eta.vercel.app/api">here</a>.</p>
<pre><code>{
  "status": 200,
  "lyrics": "Oh, oh, oh, oh"
}
</code></pre>
<h6>So deep lyrics 👀</h6>
<p>Here are some advantages of our fresh new Serverless API:</p>
<ul>
<li>It only runs when called.</li>
<li>It’s free, forever. <a href="https://vercel.com/pricing">Vercel’s paid plans</a> are for team projects.</li>
<li>Vercel scales the allocated resources according to your needs. So you don't have to worry if your API will resist x100 usage.</li>
<li>Vercel offers a lot of configuration. For example, you can deploy your API from a GitHub repository. Take a look at your new dashboard on <a href="https://vercel.com/dashboard">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Serverless Drawbacks 🤔</h2>
<p>As we saw, Serverless is awesome, but it’s not perfect, though. Here’s some common critics about it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://dashbird.io/blog/can-we-solve-serverless-cold-starts/">Cold Start</a></strong>: Your API may be a bit slower than a regular server. It's because your Serverless function needs to warm up when it’s called, whereas your server is always up.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/what-is-serverless/9781491984178/ch04.html#idm140542862552224">Loss of Control</a></strong>: The <em>Cloud Provider</em> operates your API and not you. So, you depend on them for the reliability of your API.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-monitoring-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">Difficult Monitoring</a></strong>: In general, Serverless apps are harder to test and monitor. It can be a problem when you need to have critical insight about your functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The great thing is that Serverless community is working to make it even better! Weaknesses are becoming less common and Serverless can be used on a growing number of problems.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion 🎉</h2>
<p>For most of your backend needs, Serverless may be a great opportunity. Coupled with a <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">SSG (Static Site Generator)</a> such as <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.Js</a> you can build complete applications without server or financial costs.</p>
<p>The sky is the limit, and we only saw a very minimal use of what is possible to do with Serverless or Vercel.</p>

<p>This chapter is an attempt to illustrate what are the core principles of Data Oriented Programming as I understand them.
It is highly influenced by my programming experience in Clojure, but I believe that those principles are language agnostic.</p>
<p>One could adhere to them in an Object Oriented (OO) language like Java or C# and one could break them
in a Functional Programming (FP) language like Ocaml, Haskell, JavaScript (or even in Clojure).</p>
<p>In fact, in this chapter, I am going to illustrate how those principles could be applied or broken
in JavaScript, a programming language that supports both FP and OOP.</p>
<p>The principles of Data Oriented (DO) Programming are:</p>

<p>Each principle is explored in a separate article.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-org418e909">
<p>
Remember how I mention that we use shell in two distinct ways, interactively and programmatically.
I’ve shown my idea for the first, let’s chat about the second.
</p>

<p>
While I’ve been thinking about this for many years, not long ago, I came across a Reddit Question:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/piper-presentation-a.png" alt="Lisp people: What's your go-to language for when you want to write a quick script.  Python seems to be the default for me, but I do genuinely find Lisp joyful to write in." width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
To which I responded that as a Lisp, Emacs Lisp is great as integrating any good idea that comes along, and stealing good ideas has made this system from the twentieth century still useful and almost modern.
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/piper-presentation-b.png" alt="After many years of shell and Perl scripts that grew in complexity, I switch to writing scripts where it is easiest to call, Emacs Lisp.  With modern libraries and completing libraries like Helm and Ivy, I just found a nice go to language." width="1000">

</figure>


<figure id="orgd91c85c">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-12.png" alt="I skipped showing a couple of slides that I just described.  This slide is titled, Emacs as a Go To Scripting Language" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
The old adage that Emacs is an operating system is pretty true, it is just an operating system of functions, and as such, it really good for the hacker.  You want to either overwrite or just advice every function.  Global variables, normally a bad thing when you are sharing code with others, turns out to be really easy to prototype ideas when it is just you.
</p>

<p>
But think about all the really great libraries and support that we have that are new.  I didn’t have these in the 1980s:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Common Lisp library</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/magnars/dash.el">Dash library</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/magnars/s.el">S library</a> for strings</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rejeep/f.el">F Library</a> for files</li>
<li>Web-focused Libraries for JSON, Yaml, XML</li>
</ul>

<p>
But I think the most compelling argument for using Emacs functions instead of shell scripts is the improved user interface.  I’m serious.  Think about all those command line options to each command you use, and how no amount of tab completion helps.  In emacs, we can easily bind functions to keys, use two great completing systems (<a href="https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper">Ivy</a> or <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm">Helm</a>) that can give you history of the arguments, just not the command.
</p>

<p>
Finally, think of using Hydra and Magit’s interface, <a href="https://github.com/magit/transient">Transient</a>, to really have a flexible approach to running commands.
</p>


<figure id="org5b922cc">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-13.png" alt="Shell scripts are both good and bad" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
Shell scripts, especially small ones can be really readable, and they are good as running commands and connecting them with streams, however, any script that grows to any size seems to become completely unreadable.  The other issue is that since everything is a string, we can have conversion issues into numbers or needing to escape white space.  Sure, modern versions of the shell have arrays, but they’re pretty kludgy at best.
</p>

<p>
So, can we take the best of both Lisp and Shell scripts?
If we could, this could be a win for us using Emacs, as calling a <i>function</i> is better than a <i>script</i>.
</p>


<figure id="org55b36c0">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-14.png" alt="Maybe we could bring the good parts of shell scripts into Emacs." width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
What should we <i>bring over</i> from shells?  The <code>format</code> function is fairly good, but the shell, along with most modern languages, have variable substitution within strings.  This seems more readable.  Also, since the shell has embedded itself in my DNA, I am comfortable with <code>mkdir</code> and <code>cp</code>.  Besides, since Emacs doesn’t have namespaces, our functions tend to be pretty lengthy, which often makes our code is little more difficult to read.
</p>

<p>
But when we do, we can get a slew of Lispy goodness, like data structures, better iterations, logical variable scoping, and more functions than you can shake a stick.
</p>


<figure id="org08050f7">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-15.png" alt="Desired Features" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
The magic starts with a couple of macros that will convert the <i>forms within</i> to be more script-like.  I have five specific goals for how this macro should behave.  Let me explain each of these in details.
</p>


<figure id="orgfb3be37">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-16.png" alt="Shell Executables should just Work" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
Should be easy to call a shell command, using the <code>shell</code> form:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>piper-script</span>
 <span>(</span>shell <span>"ls /tmp"</span><span>))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This should also work well with files that have spaces:
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>piper-script</span>
 <span>(</span>shell <span>"ls"</span> <span>"~/Google Drive File Stream/My Drive/"</span><span>))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Give the <code>shell</code> form function multiple strings, and it will assume that all strings are parameters, and not do any parsing, but this function will split single strings on spaces.
</p>

<p>
How about making an alias for the <code>shell</code> function name?
</p>
<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>piper-script</span>
 <span>(</span>$ <span>"ls /tmp"</span><span>))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Looks like a prompt character.
</p>


<figure id="orgef93771">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-17.png" alt="Pipes and Data Transformations" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
I use the same technique described earlier of using a temporary buffer, and running shell commands such that the contents of the buffer become <i>standard in</i> to a shell command, and the results of the command replace the contents of the buffer for the next command.  This allows an obvious pipe-like approach:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>piper-script</span>
 <span>(</span>$ <span>"ls"</span> <span>"-1"</span> <span>"/tmp"</span><span>)</span>
 <span>(</span>| <span>"grep Temp"</span><span>)</span>
 <span>(</span>| <span>"tr [a-z] [A-Z]"</span><span>))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Keep in mind you can use any Emacs function that works with buffers.
</p>



<figure id="org1476641">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-18.png" alt="Wildcard Expansion" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
File expansion should work as expected:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>piper-script</span>
 <span>(</span>$ <span>"ls"</span> <span>"~/.emacs.d/*.el"</span><span>))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Keep in mind that the <code>piper-script</code> looks at <i>every string</i>, so to make this work, if an expansion fails to find matching files, I just return the original string.
</p>


<figure id="org0331f2e">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-19.png" alt="Embedded Strings" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
While <code>format</code> is fine, <i>string-variable substitution</i> is more readable, plus I want to be able to insert both Emacs variables as well as environment variables:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span>some-var <span>"fooey"</span><span>))</span>
  <span>(</span><span>piper-script</span>
   <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span>nudder-var <span>"chop"</span><span>))</span>
     <span>(</span>echo <span>"$HOME/projects/${nudder-var}/${some-var}"</span><span>))))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Should return:
</p>
<pre>"/home/howard/projects/chop/fooey"
</pre>

I’m not convinced, but perhaps when converted shell script should have shorter, more shell-like function names.  In others words, I could use the function <code>grep</code> instead of <code>keep-lines</code>.  In this case, if <code>grep</code> were in quotes and passed to the <code>shell</code> function it would call out to the executable, and if not, to the Emacs function, so maybe this would be more confusing.
</p>

<p>
However, I do need to write <i>some functions</i>, like <code>sudo</code> is a <code>let</code> wrapper around a modification to convert the <code>default-directory</code> variable to reference Tramp.
</p>


<p>
Let me run through a couple of examples, and for each, I want to show my original shell script, and how I converted it.

<p>
First, let’s see if I can get the resident memory size of two running browsers.

<p>
While the <code>ps</code> has a lot of command line options, I’m going to use grep to look for the top-level process, that is, the ones where the parent process is <code>1</code>, and I want to ignore all the extra service frameworks that Chrome starts:
</p>

<div>
<pre>ps -u $<span>USER</span> -o ppid,rss,command | egrep <span>'Chrome|Firefox'</span> | grep <span>'^ *1'</span> | grep -v Frameworks
</pre>

</figure>

<p>
The most prominent advantage is the use of Emacs’ <code>rx</code> macro for the regular expression (which I pass to the <code>keep-lines</code> alias):
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span>browsers      <span>(</span><span>rx</span> <span>(</span><span>or</span> <span>"Chrome"</span> <span>"Firefox"</span><span>)))</span>

<p>
I’ve installed Ubuntu on an old Macbook laptop, and I noticed that after closing the lid, the computer would repeated turn itself on and off.  The reason is that some devices are set to wake up the system, and magic process entry can be used to both read the state of all these devices, but if you write the name of the device back to this process entry, it will turn it off.
</p>

<p>
Why yes, this does seem like a job for a script, eh?
</p>

<p>
My original script uses <code>cat</code> to expose all the entries, which text I can massage with a little pipe sequence.
Eventually storing each enabled device in a variable, and writing the value of that variable back into the process entry.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
The <code>piper-script</code> version starts by looking a lot like the original, but I use a Lisp-looking looping macro I call <code>for</code> and a function that converts all the lines in this temporary buffer into a list of strings for it to consume:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>piper-script</span>
 <span>(</span>sudo
  <span>(</span>cat <span>"/proc/acpi/wakeup"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>grep <span>"enabled"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>replace-regexp <span>" .*"</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span>for <span>(</span>device <span>(</span>read-all-lines<span>))</span>
    <span>(</span>write-into device <span>"/proc/acpi/wakeup"</span><span>))))</span>
</pre>
</div>



<figure id="org7fd16be">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-27.png" alt="Show us the Magic" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
The magic is obviously a nifty macro.  I simply use a function from the dash library to analyze and possibly change every element I find in the forms given to it, without changing the structure of those forms:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span><span>defmacro</span> <span>piper-script</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;rest</span> forms<span>)</span>
  <span>"Runs the FORMS in a shell-like DSL."</span>
  <span>(</span>cons 'with-temp-buffer
        <span>(</span>-tree-map #'piper--script-transform forms<span>)))</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Since all command works with a buffer, we create one, run through the converted forms, and not shown here, but we return the contents of the buffer as a string.
</p>



<figure id="org55639ce">
<img src="http://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/piper-presentation-slides/slide-28.png" alt="Piper Script Transform" width="1000">

</figure>

<p>
The followup magic happens with a function that returns a potentially changed version of the form.  It is just a lengthy <code>cond</code> statement, but you can see that at first, I change strings, so that I can expand any wildcards or variable substitution.  Then I just swap out various function names for their alias.  The way it is currently written, I can’t use any variables with matching names as I don’t currently distinguish their position.  Did I mention that this was a proof of concept?

October 4, 2020 | https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="contentdiv">

<p>As developers, we frequently use keyboard shortcuts. Some enthusiasts know hundreds, others are contempt with the essential ones. But every developer does know some. It is unthinkable to browse the Web, searching for a solution to your CSS alignment problem without using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>f</kbd>. Debugging would be tedious if we couldn’t pause and resume a program’s execution with the keyboard.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, I have been able to significantly expand my keyboard shortcut knowledge with my new side-project web app <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">KeyCombiner</a>.<br>
In particular, I knew only a few shortcuts for the web-based tools I am using in my daily work. This post describes how it took me less than 1 hour to learn <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/shared/76f3eec4-d45d-4d15-b521-6798addbba4e">50 new key combinations</a>. Fortunately, KeyCombiner keeps a detailed history of a user’s learning progress, so that I could write this post retrospectively.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the 42 minutes of learning time was interrupted by breaks, and the process involved some other tasks, such as creating the collection of shortcuts I wanted to learn. However, I did, in fact, spend only 42 minutes practicing the shortcuts and have had similar results with other shortcut collections.</p>

<p>The first step to learning new keyboard shortcuts is to define which. I don’t think it is efficient to try and learn all shortcuts for a particular application. You will end up with many that you do not use in your daily work and that you will soon forget again.</p>
<p>Creating custom collections of keyboard shortcuts is perhaps the greatest strength of KeyCombiner and sets it apart from any other tool. Within minutes or less, you can have a personal collection by importing shortcuts from popular apps. I like to compare its approach to how you build playlists in music software. Instead of browsing your favorite artists’ albums, you browse categories of your favorite applications. Instead of adding songs to your playlists, you can add keyboard shortcuts to your collections.</p>
<p>For this challenge, I created a new collection named “<a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/shared/76f3eec4-d45d-4d15-b521-6798addbba4e">50 to learn</a>”.
Then, I browsed KeyCombiner’s <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/">public collections</a> and started to import everything I wanted to learn. As my goal was to get better with web application shortcuts, I focused on the public collections for Gmail, GitHub, GDrive, Docs, Slack, and Twitter. Importing the combinations into my new shortcut collection looked like this:</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Additionally, I added a few shortcuts for <a href="https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/">Smartgit</a> manually. It is a graphical Git client that I am using extensively. For some reason, I never learned its shortcuts. Unfortunately, KeyCombiner does not yet have a public shortcut collection for Smartgit that I could rely on. However, manual input does the job:</p>

</figure>
<p>You can browse the resulting collection with 50 keyboard shortcuts here: <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/shared/76f3eec4-d45d-4d15-b521-6798addbba4e">50 to learn</a>.</p>
<p>I am afraid you will have to trust me that I did not know these shortcuts already before this experiment. However, as reassurance, you can check <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/a-collection-of-all-keyboard-shortcuts-i-use/">my previous blog post</a> covering all the shortcuts I was using until a few weeks ago. The list there does not include these new ones.</p>
<p>To validate the success of this experiment, I will simply use KeyCombiner’s confidence metric. It will analyze my performance and tell me which shortcuts are already etched into my muscle memory during practice. So, the challenge will be completed successfully once this card says <strong>50/50</strong>:</p>

</figure>

<p>Learning new shortcuts with KeyCombiner is dead simple. You click on the practice button for a particular collection, and the software does the rest. It will create 60-seconds training exercises where you are supposed to type the shortcuts of a collection as fast and as correct as possible.</p>
<p>With every input, KeyCombiner remembers if it was correct and how long you took. It will use this information along with some machine learning to calculate a so-called confidence value for each key combination in your collections. A high confidence value means that you mastered a combination. Key combinations with a low value will occur more often in practice sessions, so you are not stuck repeating what you know already.
There are a few additional aspects to it, but the good thing is that users do not have to bother with the learning algorithm’s internal workings. Repeatedly doing practice runs is enough.</p>
<h2 id="starting-to-remember-the-keys">Starting to remember the keys</h2>
<p>The very beginning of learning a new collection is the hardest part. While I do not yet know any of the shortcuts, I have to rely on KeyCombiner’s delayed key hints to type any. Sometimes, I just skip combinations immediately to see what the keys are.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This is how results for such a practice run look like:</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Surprisingly, even in the first practice run, I got a couple of combinations right without key hints. This means that they occurred multiple times already or simply that I was able to guess them correctly. The latter is often the case for <em>go to</em> shortcuts, which have been made popular by Gmail and are now used in many web applications.</p>
<p>After a few practice runs, I started to disable key hints and only relied on skipping combinations where I couldn’t remember the keys. KeyCombiner will then display the skipped combination’s keys, so I have a shot at remembering them next time.</p>
<p>The statistics for the 10th practice run looked as follows:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/how-i-learned-50-new/after10.png" alt="After just 10 minutes of practice, I already know some of the shortcuts."> <figcaption>
<p>After just 10 minutes of practice, I already know some of the shortcuts.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>KeyCombiner recognizes 9 shortcuts as mastered. So far, so good.</p>
<h2 id="building-muscle-memory">Building muscle memory</h2>
<p>After another 10 practice runs, statistics showed that I knew already most of the shortcuts:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/how-i-learned-50-new/after20.png" alt="Statistics for my 20th practice run."> <figcaption>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However, KeyCombiner punishes errors quite heavily and is hesitant to show keys as mastered that I have just recently mistyped.
At this stage, it starts to get interesting to check the collection and see which specific shortcuts have very low confidence values. Usually, it is obvious to see some patterns:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/how-i-learned-50-new/after20-problems.png" alt="The combinations with lowest confidence values after 20 practice runs."> <figcaption>
<p>The combinations with lowest confidence values after 20 practice runs.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The figure shows that I had problems knowing which modifiers to use for GSuite shortcuts (Gmail, GDrive and Docs). Some use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> , some <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> and some don’t have a modifier at all (e.g. forwarding a mail in Gmail). I found that having a good look at such problems between practice runs can speed my progress, but it is not required.</p>
<p>All that is needed is to keep hitting the practice button. At this stage, muscle memory starts to build, and the average time I need for each combination goes down quickly. KeyCombiner considers the average time metric for its confidence values.</p>
<h2 id="completing-the-challenge">Completing the challenge</h2>
<p>After 35 practice runs, things started to look very good:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/how-i-learned-50-new/after35-lowest-confidence.png" alt="Only few shortcuts with low confidence values remain."> <figcaption>
<p>Only few shortcuts with low confidence values remain.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A confidence value of 3 means that I mastered a particular combination.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at the combination with the lowest confidence value. Surprisingly, it is the relatively simple <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>:
</p><figure>
<img src="https://tkainrad.dev/images/keycombiner/how-i-learned-50-new/after35-shift-a.png" alt="Aggregated statistics for a specific combination."> <figcaption>
<p>Aggregated statistics for a specific combination.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A combination is not guaranteed to appear in every practice. Furthermore, it can appear multiple times, especially when it has a low confidence value compared to the other shortcuts of a collection. Consequently, the above figure shows only 11 practice runs but 15 correct occurences and 3 errors.</p>
<p>I made quite a few mistakes with this combination in the beginning. Therefore KeyCombiner’s algorithm is skill skeptical about my skills. Errors usually mean that I thought I knew the shortcut but then typed a wrong combination. In this case, I suspect it is because I was hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> instead or missing the <kbd>a</kbd> key. <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> is a bit tricky to type if you are used to hit both <kbd>shift</kbd> and <kbd>a</kbd> with your little finger. However, my performance has been much better recently. Just a couple more practice runs to go and KeyCombiner will forgive my earlier mistakes.</p>
<p>Then, finally, after another 7 practice runs, I had reached my goal:</p>

</figure>
<p>Practicing on this collection looks much different now than in the beginning:</p>

</figure>

<p>It is straightforward to do a similar challenge. Simply go to <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">https://keycombiner.com</a>, create an account, import some shortcuts from public collections, and start practicing. However, I would like to share some additional
tips that make learning new shortcuts more pleasant for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a bit more fun in the beginning if you throw in some shortcuts that you already know. Even better, just extend one of your existing collections with new shortcuts that you want to learn. KeyCombiner will automatically show the new ones more frequently during practice.</li>
<li>I sometimes activate key hints <em>without</em> delay, which brings some variety to the learning experience and can help build muscle memory. If you are a good typist, you will be able to type a lot of shortcuts within the 60 seconds time limit.</li>
<li>KeyCombiner will try to filter out shortcuts than cannot be captured during training. Those are marked with a yellow background in your collections. However, sometimes an invalid combination may still make it into your practice session, for example, if a browser extension does not pass it on to KeyCombiner. Simply append an underscore to any of the keys, e.g. <kbd>shift_</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd>, so that KeyCombiner will recognize it as invalid.</li>
<li>Depending on how frequently use a shortcut in your daily work, your memory may fade over time. To counter this, I suggest practicing also mastered collections from time-to-time. A couple of one-minute practice sessions can be a nice break from work.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have already learned many new keyboard shortcuts with KeyCombiner before this challenge. However, I never kept track of how long it took exactly until I knew them. I am thrilled with finding out that I could learn …</p></div></div>

The API server is a component of the Kubernetes&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?all=true#term-control-plane" target="_blank">control plane</a>&nbsp;that exposes the Kubernetes API. The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.</p><p>Now you can understand why the Kubernetes cluster audits are originating from the API server.</p><figure><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7016517375d10c702489167e704dcb99e570df85/7bb53/images/docs/components-of-kubernetes.png" alt="High level look at the Kubernetes control plance" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7016517375d10c702489167e704dcb99e570df85/7bb53/images/docs/components-of-kubernetes.png"></figure><p>Credit: Kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documentation</a></p><p>The API server decides <strong>what to audit </strong>by evaluating a <strong>policy</strong>. This policy tells the API server what the administrator wants to audit and at what level of detail (more on that later).</p><p>That is one reason to why Kubernetes audits are <strong>disabled by default </strong>– the API server cannot decide for itself what data <strong>you</strong> want to audit. Another reason for it being disabled by default is because the auditing feature increases the memory consumption of the API server. Additionally, <strong>memory consumption depends on the audit policy.</strong></p><h2>The audit policy</h2><p>When defining a policy, the first thing to understand is when exactly an event is triggered. We now understand that the API server is the main component of the Kubernetes cluster. So, every request that a person or a component makes to the API server is considered as an <strong>event</strong>.</p><p>An event is generated when a request goes through one or more&nbsp;<strong>stages</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>RequestReceived</strong> – The audit handler has received the request.</li><li><strong>ResponseStarted</strong> – The response headers have been sent, but the response body has not been sent.</li><li><strong>ResponseComplete</strong> – The response body has been completed, and no more bytes will be sent.</li><li><strong>Panic</strong> – There was an internal server error, and the request did not complete.</li></ol><h4>Audit = an event that was recorded</h4><p>The policy specifies whether an event should be recorded as an audit and if so, <strong>what data should it include</strong> (that is the <strong>level</strong>).</p><p>The audit policy consists of a <strong>list of rules</strong>. When the policy is being evaluated, the first rule which matches an event generates an audit and determines the <strong>level</strong> of detail that the audit should include.</p><p>A rule can specify one of these audit levels:</p><ul><li><strong>None</strong> – Do not create a log entry for the event.</li><li><strong>Metadata</strong> – Create a log entry. Include metadata, but do not include the request body or the response body.</li><li><strong>Request</strong> – Create a log entry. Include metadata and the request body, but do not include the response body.</li><li><strong>RequestResponse</strong> – Create a log entry. Include metadata, the request body and the response body.</li></ul><p>Before moving to examples, all of the possible policy rules fields and definitions are <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/apis/audit/v1/types.go#L184">available here</a>.</p><h2>Policy examples</h2><p>The simplest policy would look like this:</p><pre><code lang="yaml">apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
rules:
- level: Metadata</code></pre><p>This policy generates audits on every request at a metadata level.</p><p>A bit more complex policy:</p><pre><code lang="yaml">apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
rules:
# Don't log these read-only URLs.
- level: None
nonResourceURLs:
  - /healthz*

Since you don’t have control over the master node, and as a result over the API server, you cannot define the configuring flags and have the policy or backend you wish for.</p><p>Instead, these are predefined by the cloud providers. They usually have a good enough policy and the backend is routed to their logging services. For example you can take a look at the<a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/release-1.10/cluster/gce/gci/configure-helper.sh#L710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> GKE policy script</a> and the backend is routed to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/operations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Operations (formerly Stackdriver).</a></p><h4>Managed clusters audits structure</h4><p>Another point to note regarding managed clusters is that they change the way the audits are constructed, so you should expect a different JSON structure (with more and possibly different fields). For example, you can take a look at the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry" target="_blank">Operations audit structure</a> and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/audit/auditlog/rest/Shared.Types/AuditLog" target="_blank">payload structure</a>.</p><h4>Restarts</h4><p>A restart to the API server is required every time you change the audit configuration via flags.</p><h4>Configuration</h4><p>In my opinion, getting the right policy which generates <strong>only</strong> the audits you really care about is not that easy. The go-to solution for this issue is using a 3rd party application to aggregate, visualize and alert on specific audits.</p></div></div>]]>

      <p><strong>Leonard
      Adleman</strong>: <a href="http://teacher.scu.edu.cn/ftp_teacher0/chjtang/teach/adleman.htm">Interview</a>
      with Diane Krieger.

      </p><blockquote>
	<strong>Q:</strong> They say the most creative and challenging
	part of research is finding the right question to ask. Do you
	agree with that?
	
	<p>
	  <strong>LA:</strong> I wouldn't characterize it as the most
	  challenging thing, but it's of critical
	  importance. Sometimes it's not hard to find the 'right
	  question'. For example the mathematics literature is full of
	  very important unanswered questions. In this case, the real
	  issue is: Has that question's time come?  Have we reached a
	  point where developments in the appropriate area of science
	  give us some chance of breaking the problem?  For example, I
	  worked on a famous centuries old math problem called
	  "Fermat's Last Theorem". I was not 'strong' enough to solve
	  it, but I find some solace in the fact that my intuition
	  that its 'time had come' was right. The problem was finally
	  solved two years ago by Andrew Wiles of Princeton. It was
	  one of the major events in the history of mathematics.

	</p><p>
	  The other side is to generate new questions. That's a funny
	  process. The way I seek to generate new questions is to
	  start to look at whole new fields, like biology, immunology
	  or physics. Since I come from a different field,
	  mathematics, I bring an unusual point-of-view that sometimes
	  allows me to generate questions different from the classical
	  questions in those areas. Like the question of DNA
	  computing.

	</p><p>
	  For the young scientist, this question of choosing the right
	  question to spend your valuable limited intellectual
	  resources on is critical. I often sit for months and do no
	  productive work that anybody can see, because I don't feel I
	  have a good enough question to work on. Rather than take on
	  some lesser question, I would prefer to read a mystery
	  novel. The point is, sometimes it's important to lie fallow
	  for a time waiting for the 'right question' to appear,
	  rather than to engage in uninspiring work and miss the
	  important opportunity when in comes.

	</p><p>
	  But in the end, the real challenge of science is to make
	  progress - to succeed, to contribute knowledge.

	</p><p>
	  <strong>Q:</strong> Of course, in an academic setting,
	  there's that drive to publish or perish...

	</p><p>
	  <strong>LA:</strong> Yes, that's a problem, because you have
	  to feed your family. But I always tell my students and
	  junior faculty that they are better off following their
	  inspiration and their hearts in what research they do, that
	  they should always try to take on the most interesting and
	  important problems, that they should not waste their time on
	  little problems just to make another line on a vitae.

	</p><p>
	  My philosophy is that it's important, in a curious way, for
	  scientists to be courageous. Not physically courageous, but
	  courageous in an intellectual way. I believe that by working
	  on extremely hard problems, by being courageous, you may
	  succeed. But even if you fail, you fail gloriously. And you
	  will have learned immense amounts, you will have extended
	  the envelope of what you can do. As a byproduct of failing
	  on a great problem, I have always found that I could solve
	  some lesser but still interesting problems - which then fill
	  your vitae.

      <p><strong>Jonathan Blow</strong>: Reply to a programmer seeking advice

      </p><blockquote>
	I am 42-year-old very successful programmer who has been
	through a lot of situations in my career so far, many of them
	highly demotivating. And the best advice I have for you is to
	get out of what you are doing. Really. Even though you state
	that you are not in a position to do that, you really are. It
	is okay. You are free. Okay, you are helping your boyfriend's
	startup but what is the appropriate cost for this? Would he
	have you do it if he knew it was crushing your soul?

	<p>
	  I don't use the phrase "crushing your soul" lightly. When it
	  happens slowly, as it does in these cases, it is hard to see
	  the scale of what is happening. But this is a very serious
	  situation and if left unchecked it may damage the potential
	  for you to do good work for the rest of your life. Reasons:

	</p><p>
	  * The commenters who are warning about burnout are
	  right. Burnout is a very serious situation. If you burn
	  yourself out hard, it will be difficult to be effective at
	  any future job you go to, even if it is ostensibly a
	  wonderful job. Treat burnout like a physical injury. I
	  burned myself out once and it took at least 12 years to
	  regain full productivity. Don't do it.

	</p><p>
	  * More broadly, the best and most creative work comes from a
	  root of joy and excitement. If you lose your ability to feel
	  joy and excitement about programming-related things, you'll
	  be unable to do the best work. That this issue is separate
	  from and parallel to burnout! If you are burned out, you
	  might still be able to feel the joy and excitement briefly
	  at the start of a project/idea, but they will fade quickly
	  as the reality of day-to-day work sets in. Alternatively, if
	  you are not burned out but also do not have a sense of
	  wonder, it is likely you will never get yourself started on
	  the good work.

	</p><p>
	  * The earlier in your career it is now, the more important
	  this time is for your development. Programmers learn by
	  doing. If you put yourself into an environment where you are
	  constantly challenged and are working at the top threshold
	  of your ability, then after a few years have gone by, your
	  skills will have increased tremendously. It is like going to
	  intensively learn kung fu for a few years, or going into
	  Navy SEAL training or something. But this isn't just a
	  one-time constant increase. The faster you get things done,
	  and the more thorough and error-free they are, the more
	  ideas you can execute on, which means you will learn faster
	  in the future too. Over the long term, programming skill is
	  like compound interest. More now means a LOT more
	  later. Less now means a LOT less later.

	</p><p>
	  So if you are putting yourself into a position that is not
	  really challenging, that is a bummer day in and day out, and
	  you get things done slowly, you aren't just having a slow
	  time now. You are bringing down that compound interest curve
	  for the rest of your career. It is a serious problem.

	</p><p>
	  If I could go back to my early career I would mercilessly
	  cut out all the shitty jobs I did (and there were many of
	  them).

	</p><p>
	  One more thing, about personal identity. Early on as a
	  programmer, I was often in situations like you describe. I
	  didn't like what I was doing, I thought the management was
	  dumb, I just didn't think my work was very important. I
	  would be very depressed on projects, make slow progress, at
	  times get into a mode where I was much of the time
	  pretending progress simply because I could not bring myself
	  to do the work. I just didn't have the spirit to do it. (I
	  know many people here know what I am talking about.) Over
	  time I got depressed about this: Do I have a terrible work
	  ethic? Am I really just a bad programmer? A bad person? But
	  these questions were not so verbalized or intellectualized,
	  they were just more like an ambient malaise and a
	  disappointment in where life was going.

	</p><p>
	  What I learned, later on, is that I do not at all have a bad
	  work ethic and I am not a bad person. In fact I am quite
	  fierce and get huge amounts of good work done, when I
	  believe that what I am doing is important. It turns out
	  that, for me, to capture this feeling of importance, I had
	  to work on my own projects (and even then it took a long
	  time to find the ideas that really moved me). But once I
	  found this, it basically turned me into a different
	  person. If this is how it works for you, the difference
	  between these two modes of life is HUGE.

	</p><p>
	  Okay, this has been long and rambling. I'll cut it off here. Good luck.

	<strong>Brian Eno</strong> on the conservatism of success

	</p><blockquote>
	  I'm afraid to say that admirers can be a tremendous force
	  for conservatism, for consolidation. Of course it's really
	  wonderful to be acclaimed for things you've done - in fact
	  it's the only serious reward, because it makes you think "it
	  worked! I'm not isolated!" or something like that, and it
	  makes you feel gratefully connected to your own culture. But
	  on the other hand, there's a tremendously strong pressure to
	  repeat yourself, to do more of that thing we all liked so
	  much. I can't do that - I don't have the enthusiasm to push
	  through projects that seem familiar to me ( - this isn't so
	  much a question of artistic nobility or high ideals: I just
	  get too bloody bored), but at the same time I do feel guilt
	  for 'deserting my audience' by not doing the things they
	  apparently wanted. I'd rather not feel this guilt, actually,
	  so I avoid finding out about situations that could cause
	  it. The problem is that people nearly always prefer what I
	  was doing a few years earlier - this has always been
	  true. The other problem is that so, often, do I! Discovering
	  things is clumsy and sporadic, and the results don't at
	  first compare well with the glossy and lauded works of the
	  past. You have to keep reminding yourself that they went
	  through that as well, otherwise they become frighteningly
	  accomplished. That's another problem with being made to
	  think about your own past - you forget its genesis and start
	  to feel useless awe towards your earlier self: "How …</blockquote></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is all the rage nowadays. It doesn’t matter if you want to play <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/">Atari 2600 games</a>, to master <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/">go</a> (<a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/">twice</a>) or even <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815">chess</a>, you should probably use RL. Almost two years ago <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/">Andrej Karpathy</a> wrote an excellent post <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/">“Pong from Pixels”</a>. He did a wonderful job at explaining the RL problem and a specific RL algorithm (Policy Gradient) by the example of learning to play Pong. Here we extend his work, and compare multiple approaches to learn Pong. In contrast to the work of Kaparthy or DeepMind, we do not solve Pong “from pixels”, but from the actual internal state of the game. It’s easier, and allows us to focus on the RL part of the problem rather than the image processing part.</p>

<p>We rely on deep learning as a building block within classical RL algorithms. Solving Pong is not a very challenging task. The focus of this project is on understanding the merits and pitfalls of RL algorithms when combined with deep learning.</p>

<p>The structure of this website is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In the <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/introduction">Introduction</a> we give a very short introduction to RL, to make sure we’re all on the same page, and expand on what are we trying to do here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Perhaps the simplest approach to solve RL problems is by imitating an expert. In <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/chapter1">Chapter 1</a> we describe this approach and underscore its limitations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/chapter2">Chapter 2: When You Know the Model</a> we present the most common mathematical formulation of the problem (MDP), and some classic solutions. We also show how they actually work when applied to Pong.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/chapter3">Chapter 3: AlphaZero</a> we present DeepMind’s breakthrough algorithm AlphaGo Zero, and our own implementation, AlphaPong Zero.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/chapter4">Chapter 4: Learning While Playing Part 1</a> we move on to learn how to play Pong without knowing the rules in advance, and present the Policy Gradient algorithm. We also give a variant of this algorithm with improved peformance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/chapter5">Chapter 5: Learning While Playing Part 2</a> we present DeepMind’s Deep-Q-Learning algorithm, and some previously published variants and some of our own making.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/chapter6">Chapter 6: Learning While Playing Part 3</a> we present Actor-Critic methods: methods that attempt to combine the other algorithms we described. This combination does indeed obtain the best results in our experiments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, there are some <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/references">References</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Should you read this article? If you’re interested in RL, but can’t find your feet in all the mess of concepts and algorithms, you should certainly read this. If you’re an RL expert, you probably already know most of it, but you might find some of the empirical results interesting. If you’re not at all interested in RL, then you should most certainly not read this article. Here, play some Pong instead:</p>

<p>Anyway, we hope you’ll enjoy reading through. And if you don’t know yet where to begin, simply start at the <a href="https://jonathanfiat.github.io/ApproxiPong/introduction">Introduction</a>.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A <strong>Turing machine</strong> (TM) can be defined formally as the collection of the following objects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a finite, non-empty set 𝑸 of <em>active states</em>;</li>
  <li>a distinguished state 𝒒<sub>0</sub> ∈ 𝑸, the <em>initial state</em>;</li>
  <li>an object 𝒒<sub>H</sub> ∉ 𝑸, the <em>halt state</em>;</li>
  <li>a finite set with quantity &gt; 1 𝜞 of <em>symbols</em>;</li>
  <li>a distinguished symbol 𝜸<sub>0</sub> ∈ 𝜞, the <em>blank symbol</em>;</li>
  <li>a 2-element set 𝑫, the <em>shifts</em>; and</li>
  <li>a <strong>total</strong> function 𝜹 : 𝑸 × 𝜞 → 𝜞 × 𝑫 × 𝑸 ∪ { 𝒒<sub>H</sub> }, the <em>transition function</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few remarks about this definition:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Some presentations of TMs allow the transition function to be <strong>partial</strong>, but this difference is inessential; a partial function can be made total by adding a catch-all default case.</li>
  <li>Although the halt state is stipulated to be distinct from the “active states”, it is occasionally convenient to group together the <strong>set of all states</strong>, 𝑸 ∪ { 𝒒<sub>H</sub> } (for instance, in the range of the transition function). The expression “active states” is used in cases where the halt state is not under consideration</li>
  <li>An element of 𝑸 ∪ { 𝒒<sub>H</sub> } × 𝜞 × 𝑫 is known as an <strong><em>action</em></strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Alternative “architectures”</strong> can be obtained by modifying this definition. The architecture described here is the <em>quintuple variation</em>, so called because its transition function can be represented as a set of 5-tuples. Another common architecture is the <em>quadruple variation</em>, with the transition function of the form 𝑸 × 𝜞 → 𝑸 ∪ { 𝒒<sub>H</sub> } × 𝜞 ∪ 𝑫. Whereas the quintuple variation prints and moves at each step, the quadruple variation does one or the other but not both. (In other words, the transition function prescribes different kinds of actions.)</li>
  <li>TMs are typically <strong>grouped by number of active states and symbols</strong>. An <em>n-state, m-symbol</em> TM has <em>n</em> active states and <em>m</em> symbols.</li>
  <li>It has become customary to represent states with capital Roman letters starting with <code>A</code>, with the halt state as <code>H</code> (or something else if it’s needed for the active states), <em>m</em> symbols with the numbers <em>0 … m-1</em> (with <em>0</em> as the blank symbol), and the shifts with <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> (or something else, if these letter are needed for the active states). In the old days, numbers were used for states, symbols, and shifts, and TM programs were much, much harder to read.</li>
</ol>

<p>Individual TMs are typically <strong>identified</strong> with their transition functions, or with <strong>representations thereof</strong>. These represenations may also be referred to simply as <strong><em>programs</em></strong><sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. Transition functions are often represented as tables, with actions indexed by state and symbol:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>A</th>
      <th>B</th>
      <th>C</th>
      <th>D</th>
      <th>E</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0</td>
      <td>1RB</td>
      <td>1RC</td>
      <td>1RD</td>
      <td>1LA</td>
      <td>1RH</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1LC</td>
      <td>1RB</td>
      <td>0LE</td>
      <td>1LD</td>
      <td>0LA</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>What this says is: if the machine is in state <code>A</code> and scanning a <code>0</code> on the tape, it will print <code>1</code>, shift to the right, and transition to state <code>B</code>, and so on. Less transparently but more compactly, TMs can also be represented as <strong>simple strings</strong>. The actions are laid out, delimited by spaces, in such a way that actions from earlier states go earlier than later ones, and actions from the same state are ordered by the symbol they come from. Thus the table above comes out as <code>1RB 1LC 1RC 1RB 1RD 0LE 1LA 1LD 1RH 0LA</code>.</p>

<p>Table notation is easier to read than string notation, but since it’s not possible in general to tell what a TM does just by looking at it, this is of little benefit. On the other hand, string notation is excellent for <strong>ease of communication</strong>; a string TM description can easily be dropped into an email or a blog comment. String notation is also amenable to the use of <strong>standard text manipulation tools</strong>. For instance, a file of line-separated TMs in string form can be editted with <code>sed</code> and searched with <code>grep</code>.</p>

<p>Given two distinct TM strings, it might be asked if they represent <strong>meaningfully different</strong> programs or if they are only <strong>superficially different</strong>. This question can be answered by defining a canonical representation. A TM string is in <strong><em>lexical normal form</em></strong> iff the following conditions obtain:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first shift is <code>R</code>.</li>
  <li>The non-initial active states (𝑸 ∖ 𝒒<sub>0</sub>) first occur in ascending order.</li>
  <li>The non-blank symbols (𝜞 ∖ 𝜸<sub>0</sub>) first occur in ascending order.</li>
</ol>

<p>The first condition rules out the possibility of two TMs being identical except for <strong>“mirror images”</strong> of each other. The second and third conditions rule out TMs that are the same except for <strong>permutations of states and symbols</strong>. Note that the second condition is trivially true for 1- and 2-state TMs, and the third condition is trivially true for 2-symbol TMs.</p>

<p>It’s <strong>easy</strong> determine whether or not a given TM is in normal form, and reasonably short TMs can be judged as normal or not by <strong>eyeball</strong>. It’s also straightforward, though a little more difficult, to <strong>generate</strong> the corresponding normal form for an arbitrary non-normal TM (doing so requires permuting graphs, which can be tricky).</p>

<p>There is another “normal form” that has been in use since the 60s. A TM string is in <strong><em>tree normal form</em></strong> iff the following conditions obtain:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The first shift is <code>R</code>.</li>
  <li>When run on a blank tape, the TM enters its non-initial active states in order.</li>
  <li>When run on a blank tape, the TM prints its non-blank symbols in order.</li>
</ol>

<p>Tree normal form is so-named because it is what results from the <strong>tree generation procedure</strong>. In that procedure, a partially-specified TM is partially run and its transition function “holes” are filled in as needed in a “tree” fashion. New states and symbols are added in order, yielding some kind of canonical form.</p>

<p>Notice that the definition of lexical normal form considers only to the TM string itself, and therefore belongs to <strong>static analysis</strong>. In contrast, the definition of tree normal form makes reference to the actual <strong>runtime behavior</strong> of the program represented by the TM string. Unfortunately, this means that it is <strong>not generally decideable</strong> whether a particular TM string is in tree normal form or not, or whether two distinct TM strings have the same tree normal form or not. Without impugning the tree generation procedure, which has been successfully used by researchers for decades, it’s safe to say that “tree normal form” is a <strong>misnomer</strong>.</p>

<p>For the reasons above, I propose that <strong>lexical normal form should be considered the canonical representation of TMs, and TM should be communicated and published in lexical normal form</strong>.</p>



<ol>
  <li>Which of the following are in lexical normal form? Which are in tree normal form?
    <ul>
      <li><code>1LB 0RB 1RA 0LC 1RC 1RA</code></li>
      <li><code>1RB 0LB 1LA 0RC 1LC 1LA</code></li>
      <li><code>1LC 0RC 1RB 1RA 1RA 0LB</code></li>
      <li><code>1RC 0LC 1LB 1LA 1LA 0RB</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Can a program be in both lexical and tree normal forms at once? If so, give an example. If not, why not?</li>
  <li>Write a program to determine whether or not an arbitrary TM string is in lexical / tree normal form.</li>
  <li>Write a program to convert an arbitrary TM string to lexical / tree normal form.</li>
  <li>There are <em>(2m(n+1))<sup>mn</sup></em> <em>n</em>-state <em>m</em>-symbol TMs. How many are there in lexical normal form? How many are there in tree normal form?</li>
</ol>

<p>The following questions have to do with Pascal Michel’s <strong><a href="http://www.logique.jussieu.fr/~michel/ha.html">historical survey of Busy Beaver candidate machines</a></strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Determine <em>by eyeball</em> which programs in the list are in lexical or tree normal forms.</li>
  <li>Use your program from exercise 2 above to determine which programs in the list are in lexical or tree normal form.</li>
  <li>(Extra credit) Go through the list and convert every program to lexical normal form, then email Pascal Michel and politely ask him to update the list to be lexical-normal.</li>
</ol>



<p><sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> In some philosophical quarters a sharp distinction is drawn between <strong>“use” and “mention”</strong>. However, it’s both practical and instructive to let one’s eyes go out of focus when looking at the difference between a “Turing machine” and its “representation”.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re trying to get into game development as a Software Engineer, finding
learning materials with the right level of context can be challenging. You’ll
likely face a choice between following materials introducing you to basic C# and
OOP concepts while also describing Unity concepts, or starting with advanced
tutorials and be left to figure out the core concepts deductively.</p><p>To fill that gap, I’m writing a series called
<strong><a href="https://blog.eyas.sh/tag/unity-for-software-engineers">Unity for Software Engineers</a></strong>. This is
the first piece, and I’ll be releasing additional installments over the next few
weeks, so <a href="http://eepurl.com/gVgusL">make sure to subscribe</a> for updates. The
series is intended for folks already comfortable with programming and software
architecture, especially those who learn best as I do: starting with first
principles and working your way upwards.</p><hr><p>I started my programming journey around 17 years ago by picking up
<a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker">Game Maker</a>. Countless hours spent coding
little games and tools led me to a bigger passion for programming. Eventually, I
was at a point where I focused mainly on Software Engineering. From my peers, I
know this is quite a common path that many of us took to find programming.</p><p>Yet the game development scene has changed significantly from those days. When I
went to pick up Unity after a long absence from game development, I was mostly
interested in understanding the basic concepts: what are the fundamental
building blocks of a game? What do I need to know about how these building
blocks are represented in memory or on disk? How is idiomatic code organized?
What patterns are preferred?</p><p>In the first article in the series, we’ll focus on those first two questions.</p><h2 id="scene">Scenes</h2><p>A <strong>Scene</strong> is the largest unit of organizing your objects in-memory. Scenes
contain the objects making up your game.</p><p>In basic use, one scene represents a <strong>single level</strong> in your game, where one
scene is loaded at any given point. In more “advanced” use, you can have two or
more active scenes at a time. Scenes can be loaded additively and unloaded <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.
Having multiple scenes loaded during gameplay comes especially handy when
building a massive world; keeping far-away areas on-disk rather than in-memory
will help you stay within your performance budget.</p><div><figure><p><span>

“Car” can be an object, with code that controls the car’s speed and rotation as
a whole. But individual child objects might represent the four wheels (these
would spin independently), the car body, windows, etc. Moving the parent car
object would move all the child objects, keeping their relative orientation to
the parent (and each other). We might want the player to interact with a door
separately from the rest of the car, for instance.</p><h2 id="component">Components (&amp; MonoBehaviors)</h2><figure><p><span>

“Inspector” window. Each illustrated section (e.g., Animator, Rigidbody,
Collider) are <em>Components</em> making up this object.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Every Game Object is comprised of <strong>Components</strong>.</p><p>A Component implements a well-defined set of behaviors for a GameObject to
execute. Everything that makes an object what it is would come from the
components that make it up:</p><ul><li>A single “visible” piece of a car will have a <em>Renderer</em> component that
paints it, and likely a <em>Collider</em> component that sets up its collision
bounds.</li><li>If a car represents the player, the car object itself might have a <em>Player
Input Controller</em> that takes key input events and translates these to code
moving the car around.</li></ul><p>While you can write large and complex Components that correspond 1:1 to an
object (e.g., a player component codes the entire player, while an enemy
component codes the enemy as a whole), it’s typically common to factor out your
logic into streamlined pieces corresponding to individual <em>traits</em>. For example:</p><ul><li>All objects with <em>health</em>, whether a Player or an Enemy, might have a
<code>LivingObject</code> component that sets an initial health value, takes damage,
and triggers a death event once it dies.</li><li>A player might additionally have an input component controlling its
movement, while the enemy might have an AI component that controls its
movement instead.</li></ul><p>Components receive various callbacks throughout their lifetime, known in Unity
as <em>Messages</em>. Examples of Messages include <code>OnEnable</code>/<code>OnDisable</code>, <code>Start</code>,
<code>OnDestroy</code>, <code>Update</code>, and others. If an object implements an <code>Update()</code> method,
this method will automagically be called by Unity in every frame of the game
loop while the object is active, and the given component is enabled. These
methods can be marked <code>private</code>; the Unity engine will still call them.</p><p>Components can also expose public methods as you’d expect. Other components can
take a reference to a component and call these public methods.</p><h2 id="asset">Assets</h2><p><strong>Assets</strong> are the on-disk resources that make up your game project. These
include meshes (models), textures, sprites, sounds, and other resources.</p><p>When serialized to the disk, your scenes are represented as assets made up of
the Game Objects inside of them. We’ll also discuss in the next section how you
can make Game Objects that are reused often into an asset known as a

    </span></p></figure><p>Game Objects, their Components, and their input parameters exist as individual
<em>instances</em> in a scene. But what if a particular class of objects is commonly
repeated? Such objects can be made into a <strong>Prefab</strong>, which is effectively the
object in asset form.</p><p>Instances of a prefab in a scene can have local modifications that distinguish
it (e.g., if a <em>tree</em> object is a prefab, you can have tree instances of
different heights). Instances of a prefab all inherit and override data from
their prefab.</p><h3>Nested Prefabs</h3><p>Starting with Unity 2018.3, Prefabs can be nested just as you expect:</p><ol><li>A parent object with prefab child objects can be a prefab itself. In the
parent prefab, the child prefab instance can have its own modifications. In
the scene, the entire prefab hierarchy is instantiated, and scene-specific
modifications can layer on top.</li><li>A prefab instance in a scene with its own local modifications can be saved as
its own “Prefab Variant” asset. A variant is a prefab asset that inherits
from another prefab, applying additional modifications on top.</li></ol><p>These concepts compose; a prefab variant of a nested prefab, or a prefab variant
of a prefab variant, for instance.</p><h2 id="serialization">Serialization &amp; Deserialization</h2><p>Your project’s assets, scenes, and objects are all persisted on-disk. When
editing your game, these objects are loaded in memory and saved back to disk
using
<a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/06/24/serialization-in-unity/">Unity’s serialization system</a>.
When playtesting your game, the objects and scenes in-memory are loaded through
the same serialization system. This system also maps between assets in your
compiled bundle and the loaded/unloaded scene objects in-memory.</p><p>The Unity Engine’s Serialization/Deserialization flow loads on-disk assets into
memory (in your project: for editing/playtesting; in-game, when loading a scene)
and is responsible for saving the state of your edited objects &amp; components back
into their scenes and prefabs.</p><p>Therefore, the serialization system is also at the core of the Unity Editor
experience itself. For a <code>MonoBehavior</code> to take an input on construction when
instantiated in a scene, those fields must be <em>serialized</em>.</p><p>Most core Unity types such as <code>GameObject</code>s, <code>MonoBehavior</code>s, and asset
resources are
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.serializableattribute">Serializable</a>
and can receive initial values on creation from within the Unity Editor. Public
fields on your <code>MonoBehavior</code> are serialized by default (if they’re of a
serializable type), and private fields need to be marked with Unity’s
<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SerializeField.html"><code>[SerializeField]</code></a>
attribute to be serialized as well.</p><figure><p><span>

<p>According to <a href="https://thelogic.co/news/exclusive/apple-sues-ontario-electronics-recycling-firm-claiming-it-stole-nearly-100000-products-for-resale/"><em>The Logic</em></a>, an Ontario electronics recycling firm is being sued by Apple, alleging the company stole and resold iOS and watchOS devices instead of destroying them.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>GEEP Canada is being accused of reselling 100,000 iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches, according to Apple’s lawsuit.</p>
<p>Apple says Barrie-based GEEP and members of its senior management team were aware of its activity. GEEP denies all wrongdoing and says when it discovered the reselling ring, it shut it down immediately.</p>
<p>As for damages, Apple is seeking $31 million from GEEP, plus proceeds made from selling iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches.</p>
<p>GEEP was hired by Apple back in the fall of November 2014 to assist in recycling old products instead of being discarded into landfills.</p>
<p>Apple says it sent 531,966 iPhones, 25,673 iPads and 19,277 Apple Watches to GEEP to be recycled from the start of 2015 to the end of 2017, according to lawsuit, seen by <em>The Logic</em>.</p>
<p>“At least 11,766 pounds of Apple devices left GEEP’s premises without being destroyed – a fact that GEEP itself confirmed. These misappropriated devices were then subsequently sold at a significantly higher price than other recycled materials to downstream vendors who refurbished and resold the devices to consumers,” explains Apple’s suit, filed in January.</p>
<p>Apple discovered GEEP was moving devices into areas not under camera surveillance after auditing the Ontario company’s warehouse. The iPhone maker found 18% of devices shipped to GEEP were active on wireless carrier networks.</p>
<p>While some devices like Wi-Fi iPads won’t show up on carrier networks, which Apple says makes the total number of stolen products higher.</p>
<p>GEEP says the reselling ring was due to three “rogue” employees, Roger Micks, Edward Cooper and Steven White, who sold the devices to Fu Yuan Yang at Whitby Recycling. Yang then sold these Apple devices to people in China.</p>
<p>GEEP’s third-party claim from July says it wants these employees, Yang and Whitby Recycling to pay damages if Apple wins, plus cover its legal fees.</p>
<p>The Ontario recycler says it has suffered “extensive business losses” due to the incident and its reputation, to go with Apple cancelling its contract.</p>

So, as a technical leader, how do you spot when your team is lost in the weeds, and is there anything you can do about it?</p><p><em>“Teams get toxic when you have multiple factions forming. People who feel bullied team up with others in defence, and it all gets nasty quite quickly.”</em></p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1601384089325_8479"><div><p><a href="https://michaelthomas.co/"><span>Mike Thomas</span></a> is a highly experienced engineering manager and team leader with over 15 years in the web development industry, and he’s someone who knows a lot about finding and rescuing failing teams. Over the years he’s identified some key ways to tell if your team is in trouble, and he has some practical hints for tech leaders on how to get your paddle back and start reversing out of the particular creek you’re stuck in. He kindly agreed to share them with me for the blog.</p><p><em>“Sometimes, it’s the completely mundane things that have been driving people crazy. I’ve literally spent weeks mediating complaints of hot food in confined spaces.”</em></p><h3>Give it to me straight, Doc. What are the signs that my team might be failing?</h3><p>Feeling anxious and stressed about your business, a nagging feeling that everything needs to happen much, much quicker, and your developers/engineers must work harder and longer. Maybe deployments are tricky, and you find the team making excuses to not do that on a Friday. Agile is known as the ability to Yoda-flip between daily customer demands. Your go-to guy goes on holiday and the boat stops. You <em>have</em> a go-to guy. You <em>only</em> have <em>guys</em>.</p><p>Of course some people might think that this makes for a fantastic team, especially if you work in customer success or sales. And you might coast on that for a few years - you had early success - and the customer is number one. But customer led roadmaps leave no headspace for innovation. Overworked developers write short-term code with long-term consequences. Even if you have performance metrics, the figures are invariably used as a stick to beat them with. High bug rate. Technical debt. No new features get shipped, customers eventually leave because the competition is more innovative. They’re failing. <em>You’re</em> failing.</p><p><em>“Call out good work, and please, please, please find a way to reward it.”</em></p><h3>What sort of metrics would you expect a team to be able to produce?</h3><p>Cycle time of releases, up-time, rough date and cause of the last outage, average age of backlog items, critical bug rates - there’s so many things that should just rattle off the tongue of anyone in the technical team if they’re engaged and paying attention to their performance. This cannot be a one-way street though. It’s important that the rest of the business is focused on their own performance, because their inefficiencies can often morph into backlog tickets, creating awful feedback loops.</p><h3>Where should I start if I don’t have any of those?</h3><p>Assuming your business is concerned with time and money (extensive studies prove most of them are!) then I’d go with bug rates - not just as a measure of “failure”, but because they provide clues as to where you’re going wrong. Then the cycle time from requirement to release; this can lead to insights about your process bottlenecks.</p><p>Google has an excellent article called “<a href="http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/2011/12/bug-prediction-at-google.html"><span>Bug Prediction at Google</span></a>”, which gives you some great ideas about how to make bug metrics useful, as opposed to just headlining bad news. Here’s a snippet:&nbsp;</p><p><em>“They found that simply ranking files by the number of times they've been changed with a bug-fixing commit (i.e. a commit which fixes a bug) will find the hot spots in a code base. Simple!”</em></p><p>So, identify the hotspots, and put warning comments in the file(s) for unwitting developers. I love the simplicity of that.</p><h3>You’ve talked about ‘factionalism’ as a challenge for software teams. What is that, and what does it look like?</h3><p>It’s quite an insidious problem that you’ll likely miss if you’re not keeping your team close. Issues can start where there’s a void of leadership, and unhappy individuals band together in an attempt to forge some common goals and unity which are sorely missing either in the team or business. Common goals and unity is not a bad idea if it involves the entire team, but it quickly gets toxic when you have multiple factions forming. Individuals start to feel snubbed—or worse, bullied—then they team up with others in defence, and it all gets nasty quite quickly with different groups pulling in different directions.</p><h3>How on earth do you fix a team that’s so badly broken?</h3><p>Fill that missing void of leadership. Start talking, start 1:1s, start retrospectives, and get some common goals on the table that everyone can agree upon.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you start talking to people, you start to figure out the root cause of their negativity and frustrations. If no one has been listening to these people, they’ll eventually let it all out, but sometimes you need to really home in and press a point to get to the bottom of it. Sometimes, it’s the completely mundane things that have been driving people crazy. I’ve literally spent weeks mediating complaints of hot food in confined spaces. Sometimes it’s less mundane: skipped code reviews, unscheduled refactoring. Sometimes it’s just plain bad: bullying, being unapproachable, general bad attitude behaviour.</p><h3>Should I ask for help from senior management, or get HR involved?</h3><p>Having a fellow manager to talk strategy with can help a lot when things are slightly toasty. I’d only really involve HR, if you have it, if someone has blatantly stepped over a line, or doesn’t show improvement. I think it’s important to say that although <em>some</em> of those things mentioned sound bad, a great deal of it can be perpetuated by good, but frustrated people acting out.</p><h3>What’s your view on 1:1s? Do you have a set process?</h3><p>I tend to rely on a more rigid process for new teams or team members.

And that’s the point, really: the 1:1 is about them, and what you can do for them to get the best return on their time and commitment. Plus I like the fact that it’s a cartoon instead of a pretentious blog article.&nbsp;</p><h3>What are the key things people should be doing to prevent teams from getting lost, and to get them back on track?</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Have a strategy, make it visible, and shout about it often.</p></li><li><p>Have frequent "Town Halls”.

<p><strong>Bedroom</strong></p>
<p>For all the high-tech sex toys in my collection, the ones I feel most connected with—my strapon, some silicone dildos, perhaps a steel plug or two—are decidedly analog. They’re simple, adapt to fit my evolving style, and last long enough to make some memories. So far, only one vibrator has ever joined these particularly well-loved ranks: the Magic Wand Rechargeable.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="583" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW0-1-1024x583.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW0-1-1024x583.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW0-1-300x171.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW0-1-768x437.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW0-1-1536x875.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW0-1-2048x1166.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW0-1-1200x683.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><figcaption>My beloved Magic Wand Rechargeable</figcaption></figure>
<p>Manufactured by Hitachi and distributed under the Vibratex name, The Magic Wand Rechargeable is an update to the original Magic Wand vibrator first sold in the early ‘70s.&nbsp;&nbsp; It adds more power settings, vibration patterns, a silicone head, and, most importantly, freedom from the wall socket, while keeping the original’s beloved power and industrial design.</p>
<p>By doing one thing—rumbly vibration, and doing it <em>breathtakingly </em>well, the Magic Wand Rechargeable is infinitely useful. I love using mine to add vibration to dildos and plugs, turning up the power to balance on the edge of overstimulation in predicament bondage, and even taking the silicone head internally! I tested its battery life at a clit-ruining 3 hours and 20 minutes on the highest vibration setting, more than enough for anything I’ve dreamt up so far. Though the toy isn’t officially waterproof, every seam is gasketed, so it easily shrugs off all the lube and squirt my partners and I can throw at it.</p>
<p>I love the wand in part because it helped me to re-discover my body’s sexual response as it changed over the course of gender transition, all while bringing me to a boatload of affirming orgasms along the way 😉 &nbsp;Unlike more complicated alternatives, it doesn’t require any particular body type, position, or adjustments—it’s just an easy way to put as much vibration as I want wherever I want it.</p>
<p>Basically, this toy is one of the best and most popular on the market, which is why I wanted to make it the inaugural teardown on this blog. It’s not perfect, but we can think of it as a baseline for successful engineering.</p>
<p><strong>Workshop</strong></p>
<p>The Magic Wand Rechargeable has two main sections—the head, covered by a white silicone sleeve, and the beige ABS handle, joined by a flexible, silicone-sleeved neck that connects the electronics and motor in the handle to the mechanical vibration mechanism in the head while isolating the handle from too much hand-jarring vibration.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="351" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW3-2-1024x351.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW3-2-1024x351.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW3-2-300x103.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW3-2-768x263.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW3-2-1536x527.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW3-2-2048x702.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW3-2-1200x412.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><figcaption>Reverse view of wand with screws removed</figcaption></figure>
<p>Removing a few Phillips-head screws (all conveniently exposed) allowed me to pull the chrome plastic collar up and separate the handle, revealing the sexy engineering secrets within.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="457" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW4-1024x457.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW4-1024x457.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW4-300x134.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW4-768x343.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW4-1536x686.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW4-2048x914.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW4-1200x536.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><figcaption>Screws removed to reveal electronics inside the handle.</figcaption></figure>
<p>And here’s where the surprises begin—this this is MODULAR! The bottom half of the case holds a standard Sanyo 18650 li-ion cell housed in its own plastic enclosure and connected to the main board in the top half with a crimped connector, glued lightly in place. This is extremely surprising, not only because the connector adds significant cost over simple solder joints but also because it will likely be more prone to failure in a vibrating device like this. While easy pluggability is fantastic from a repair or recycling perspective, it’s still a confusing choice here.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1475" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW5-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW5-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW5-edited-300x173.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW5-edited-1024x590.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW5-edited-768x442.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW5-edited-1536x885.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW5-edited-2048x1180.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW5-edited-1200x691.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><figcaption>Sanyo 18650 Battery cell</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the top half of the case, our journey continues with the main control board, a tiny board for the DC jack, and the motor and its safety thermistor, both also connected to the main board with socketed connectors. The main PCB is double-sided, but all the action is happening right here on top.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="482" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW7-1-1024x482.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW7-1-1024x482.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW7-1-300x141.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW7-1-768x362.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW7-1-1536x724.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW7-1-2048x965.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW7-1-1200x565.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><figcaption>Main control PCB (front)</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>On the right, we see the brains of the operation—an impressively full-featured Elan EM78-series microcontroller, which handles everything from the Magic Wand’s button inputs to generating PWM signals to control the different vibration modes. It even includes analog-to-digital converters to monitor thermocouple temperature sensors on both the motor and battery. While this microcontroller might not as well-documented or easy to hack on as an AVR or PIC, another microcontroller could easily be grafted in for custom patterns and control modes (stay tuned…).</p>
<p>Next, the two middle chips are a MEM2309 P-Channel MOSFET [<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://datasheetspdf.com/datasheet/MEM2309.html" target="_blank">datasheet</a>] and an A308 (the 14-SOIC package), which appears to be a charge monitoring device. These work together to manage and protect the lithium ion battery.</p>
<p>Finally, we have two more MOSFET’s on the left—an Alpha and Omega 4803 dual P-channel [<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.aosmd.com/pdfs/datasheet/AO4803A.pdf" target="_blank">datasheet</a>] (though only one of the two is used) and a NCEPower 3010 N-channel [<a href="http://www.datasheet-pdf.com/PDF/NCE3010S-Datasheet-NCEPOWER-837177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">datasheet</a>], which switch current to drive the motor.</p>
<p>The reverse side of the board is much simpler, with a sea of passive components, a few small transistors and voltage regulators, and buttons for user inputs. Though relatively well-protected by a silicone cover, these surface-mounted buttons introduce the potential for solder joint failure due to repeated board flex from heavy-handed presses. This may be a nitpick, but it’s a notable departure from the original Magic Wand’s simple, case-mounted rocker switch.</p>

<p>The only user feedback (other than vibration, of course) is provided by LED’s here on the back of the board, which interface with a dual-shot injection molded light pipe assembly to shine through the outer enclosure.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="627" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW11-1024x627.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW11-1024x627.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW11-300x184.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW11-768x470.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW11-1536x940.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW11-2048x1253.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW11-1200x734.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><figcaption>Main Enclosure (bottom), button cover assembly (top left), and light pipe (top right)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now here’s where things really get movin’—once its board connectors are separated, the motor and head assembly can be pulled and separated for a closer look.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="424" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW8-2-1024x424.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW8-2-1024x424.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW8-2-300x124.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW8-2-768x318.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW8-2-1536x635.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW8-2-2048x847.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW8-2-1200x496.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><figcaption>Motor and head assembly removed from handle</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The DC motor is rated for 7400rpm at 8.4 volts. The original Magic Wand was plagued with overheating issues, and the lessons learned from that are very evident here— after all, a lithium-ion battery fire on your genitals is definitely the <em>wrong </em>kind of hot. To help keep temperature under control, a small plastic fan is mounted to the motor’s output shaft, and both a thermocouple and automatically resetting thermal cutoff are mounted to the motor casing to shut it off in case things get toasty. The fan may not be terribly effective inside a sealed enclosure, but redundant thermal cutoffs are definitely enough to put my mind at ease.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="394" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW13-1024x394.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW13-1024x394.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW13-300x115.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW13-768x295.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW13-1536x590.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW13-2048x787.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW13-1200x461.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px"><figcaption>Head assembly and motor with thermocouple, thermal cutoff, and fan</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The motor shaft connects to the vibrating mechanism in the head through a round spring acting as a drive shaft, which helps to isolate the handle from vibration and allows the head to flex a bit.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW15-1024x769.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="406" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW15-1024x769.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW15-300x225.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW15-768x577.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW15-1536x1153.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW15-2048x1538.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW15-1200x901.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 85vw, 541px"><figcaption>Neck flange and drive shaft spring connecting to head assembly</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>While the teardown to this point is easy and entirely reversible, things get a bit more complicated and… umm… <em>destructive</em> when it comes to the head. Let’s just say that I spent a few hours wailing and twisting on this thing with every tool on my bench before just giving up and cutting around the edge of the silicone head cover. It still works, I just have to be a bit more careful of fluids getting in.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW18-1-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="397" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW18-1-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW18-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW18-1-768x510.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW18-1-1536x1019.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW18-1-2048x1359.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW18-1-1200x796.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 85vw, 598px"><figcaption>Head assembly with silicone and foam cover removed (right)</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Pulling the head cover off reveals a dense foam inner-lining and the beautifully molded nylon body of the vibration mechanism itself. Even after removing a few screws and sawing off a section in frustration, cleanly separating the translucent nylon head from the springy metal neck and its silicone cover proved impossible. Unwilling to completely destroy the toy (it’s just that good…), I opted to just pry to the head open to get a look inside.</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW20-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="587" height="391" srcset="https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW20-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW20-768x512.jpg 768w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW20-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW20-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://insidesextoys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MW20-1200x800.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 85vw, 587px"></figure></div>
<p><em>This </em>is the magic behind the magic wand. Regardless of whether you’re turning it with a battery or mains power, this mechanism has been getting people off for decades, and it’s not hard to see why.</p>
<p>Two rubber-jacketed bearings hold a shaft with a <strong>BEEFY </strong>asymmetrical punched steel weight. Pretty much all vibrators work by swinging an unbalanced weight around, but sheer mass of this one is what makes the Magic Wand and other rumbly vibrators special. The bearings ultimately transmit that vibration to the outer shell, and smaller, cheaper ones can wear out quickly from the high radial load of a powerful vibrator.

          <p>So you’re applying for a designer role at Codelitt, I can’t wait to meet you! After being part of more than a few rounds of hiring throughout the years, I put together a few pointers that candidates should be aware of:</p><ul><li><strong>ALWAYS include a link to your portfolio.</strong> No matter how incomplete you think it is, how outdated, how rusty, if you don’t include a link to your portfolio it is extremely likely that your application will be de-prioritized. Moreover, between the time it takes for us to get in touch with you and receive your portfolio, we likely will have already had a bunch of interviews! Help us get to know you, and give us all the information we ask for from the get go.</li><li><strong>Add your real physical location.</strong> I’ve seen candidates who use cutesy terms for where they are. &nbsp;Saying your location is “Earth” just doesn’t help us at all - unless you’re Elon Musk and you’re applying from Mars! Hey, we're space fanatics here at Codelitt, but we appreciate you being a little more precise!</li><li><strong>Take time to fill out the application correctly.</strong> If English isn’t your first language, it’s not the end of the world to have some spelling mistakes! A good portion of the team at Codelitt call English their 2nd language. But make sure you understand the questions being asked. I’ve seen candidates answer with a “Yes” or “No” to questions that required numeric values.</li><li>Speaking of the application, <strong>make sure it’s in English.</strong> We’re a remote company with lots of languages spoken in our teams, but the company’s primary language for all communication is English.</li><li><strong>You’re probably applying to multiple places at once, but make sure to tailor your application to me/Codelitt.</strong> If you’re including a cover letter, be genuine! Don’t just copy/paste from others you’ve sent - we can tell when this happens. Try to personalize it a bit and make the hiring team feel that you’ve done your homework on the company, and know the details about the job listing.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/2-designcandidates.jpg.jpg"></figure><h2 id="about-portfolios">About portfolios</h2><ul><li><strong>Make sure the images included aren’t pixelated or low-res</strong> if you’re including a PDF as a portfolio. If you’ve built a website of your own (kudos to you!) make sure that the website is up to par with your other pieces of work. It is, at the end of the day, part of your portfolio! Make sure the UX is good, and that you’ve designed the layout for it.</li><li><strong>Show off from the get go!</strong> Make any thumbnails in your website portfolio a screenshot of the product <em>and not</em> a banner with the name of the project. I sift through lots of portfolios all day and it helps give me a much better understanding of what I’ll see if the thumbnail introduces me to the product. Names don’t really matter that much - I need to see your skills! </li></ul><h2 id="as-a-general-rule">As a general rule</h2><p>Be yourself, and humbly, <em>sell</em> yourself. Our job listings will highlight the amazing culture we have, the benefits you’ll get from joining our team, and all the amazing things you’ll be able to.</p><p>I hope to see your application in our inbox when the next job pops up! Thank you for reading - I hope it was helpful.</p><figure><img src="https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hepw4b4yn/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/3-designcandidates.jpg.jpg"></figure>

	<div>
		
<p>I recently decided to get a wireless speaker for our Kitchen. Sonos seems like an obvious choice these days. The sound quality and aesthetics were very appealing. So I ordered a Sonos One SL speaker.</p>



<p>In terms of sound quality and looks, I was very pleased. I’m not an audiophile but the sound quality seemed superb and the speaker just looks fantastic. A very clean and unassuming look.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="768" height="1024" src="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_6571-1-768x1024.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_6571-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_6571-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_6571-1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px"><figcaption>what’s hiding underneath ?</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>As I later discovered, a dirty beast hides under the cool exterior.</strong></p>



<p>My concerns started to grow almost immediately as I was setting up the new speaker. I downloaded the app, and started the setup process, soon to realize that I need to register with my email just to set up the device on my network… And of course, I had to accept the terms and conditions …. hmmm… ok, I guess.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_92F6A34207E1-1-576x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="236" height="420" srcset="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_92F6A34207E1-1-576x1024.jpeg 576w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_92F6A34207E1-1-169x300.jpeg 169w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_92F6A34207E1-1.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px"></figure></div>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_31E9A893CD62-1.png" alt="" width="203" height="361" srcset="https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_31E9A893CD62-1.png 375w, https://blog.gingerlime.com/assets/IMG_31E9A893CD62-1-169x300.png 169w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px"></figure></div>



<p>I was then asked to allow sharing my location as well, which raised another alarm bell. <strong>Why does my speaker need my location?</strong> I’m not 100% sure, but if I recall, I had to allow it to access my location, or else I couldn’t continue.</p>



<p>Once the device was finally set up, I went through the settings, to explore and see what else is there. I was rather disappointed to find that <strong>“Additional usage data” was turned on by default</strong>. I live in Europe, and I thought that the EU regulations should prevent this kind of behaviour. They should explicitly ask my permission to track my usage, especially if it isn’t necessary for the device to function.</p>



<p>I could opt-out of it luckily, but it didn’t feel right to me.</p>



<h2>What data is Sonos collecting, and why?</h2>



<p>Digging into the <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en/legal/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sonos privacy policy</a> made my hair stand… </p>



<div><div>
<h5>Functional Data:</h5>



<div><p>This data is absolutely necessary for your Sonos Product or Service, including Sonos Radio, to perform its basic functions in a secure way and <strong>you will not be able to opt out from this data collection, sharing, and/or processing</strong> if you want to continue to use your Sonos Products.</p><p><strong>We collect:</strong></p></div>



<p><strong>Registration data.</strong> This data includes your email address, location, language preference, Product serial number, IP address, and Sonos account login information (as described above).<br><strong>System data.</strong> This data includes things like Product type, controller device type, controller operating system, software version, content source (audio line in), signal input (e.g. whether your TV outputs a specific audio signal such as Dolby to your Sonos system), information about WiFi antennas, system settings (such as equalisation or stereo pair), Product orientation, names of the music service(s) you added/enabled on your Sonos product, the names you have given your Sonos Product in different rooms, whether your Product has been tuned using Sonos Trueplay technology, system performance metrics (e.g. the temperature of your Product or WiFi signal strength) and error information.</p>
</div></div>



<p>(emphasis not mine)</p>



<p>So this is <em>just</em> the data that you <strong><em>cannot</em></strong> opt-out of. The data <strong>absolutely necessary to perform basic functions.</strong>  And in case you wonder why they track this data, here’s what the privacy policy says</p>



<div><p><strong>Why we collect Functional Data:</strong> We collect this information to help ensure that your Products are working properly, to provide you with customer support, to honour your audio preferences, and to guide product improvement and customer support decisions. We also collect this information to guide product improvement and customer support decisions which is <strong>our legitimate interest</strong>.</p></div>



<p>emphasis mine… we’ll go back to what <em><strong>legitimate interest</strong></em><strong> </strong>actually means later on.</p>



<p>I’m not sure what basic functions for a speaker might be, that they require to share so much data with Sonos. And if this not enough, there’s also the (optional) Usage data that Sonos happily collects, by default, without asking for permission</p>



<div><div>
<div><div>
<h5>Additional Usage Data:</h5>



<p>In order to improve your experience with Sonos Products and to offer better, personalised Sonos Products and Services, including Sonos Radio, that meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we collect the following Additional Usage Data. The processing of this information is in our legitimate interest as further set out below (under Why). You can opt out of sharing this data by following the steps listed <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en/legal/privacy#data-opt-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong>We collect:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Performance Information.</strong> This includes things like the temperature of your Product, WiFi information like signal strength, how often you use music services you have connected to your Sonos system (including, for some services, your login username, but not password), information about how often you use the Sonos app versus other control mechanisms, flow of interactions within the Sonos app, how often you use the physical controls on the unit, the flow of interactions within the Sonos app, duration of Sonos Product use, and, as required for certain Services, location-based data using GPS (or similar technology, where available) and crowdsourced WiFi access points and cell tower locations collected from your third party device when the Sonos app is in use.</li><li><strong>Activity Information.</strong> This includes duration of music service use, Product or room grouping information, command information (such as play, pause, change volume, or skip tracks), information about playlist or station container data including listening history (‘Recently Played’), and Sonos playlist or Sonos favourites information; each correlated to individual Sonos Products and your interactions with them. If you enable voice control or use Sonos Radio, we will additionally collect information about track data when using those features.</li></ul>



<blockquote><p><strong>Why:</strong> We collect this information so that we can help ensure Sonos Products are functioning properly, provide a personalised experience for our customers, determine what types of Product or feature improvements would please our customers most, and to help predict potential problems with Sonos Products. Additionally, to provide Sonos Radio, we collect location-based information for licensing and reporting purposes. <strong>Collecting this data is our legitimate interest</strong> to support a user-friendly experience that meets your needs and help you with issues you may experience. It is your choice if you want us to collect this information, and therefore you can opt out of sharing this data by following the steps listed <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en/legal/privacy#rights-choices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> personalisation services (e.g. Recently Played), Sonos Radio, Voice Control, and Direct Control functionality require Additional Usage Data to function. If you decide to use any of these features and/or Services, the <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en/legal/privacy#additional-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Additional Usage Data</a> becomes functional. You can always clear all Recently Played by following the instructions in the Sonos app.</p></blockquote>
</div></div>
</div></div>



<p>Again, the legitimate interest emphasis is mine…</p>



<p>If you read their privacy policy further, you could spot the real incentives and potential uses of the data, but I won’t dive into it here. I do recommend reading it though.</p>



<h2>(il)legitimate interest</h2>



<p>So what is this all about? Well, if you’re familiar with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you might guess the answer. I’m not a lawyer, so without going into too much detail, here’s my brief understanding of it.</p>



<p>First off, the GDPR is the regulation that aims to protect the privacy of all EU citizens. It’s meant to reduce privacy invasive practices, force companies to protect private data, and encourage companies to treat private data with care and respect.</p>



<p>But what’s “legitimate interest”, and why is it important?</p>



<p>Essentially, companies aren’t simply allowed to store any customer data they want. They need a “good reason” to do so. Or in other words, they need to have a legitimate interest in storing such data. Otherwise, they’re simply not allowed to store it at all.</p>



<p>So now, can I just ask someone who accesses my website “What’s your home address”? and store it, if they give it to me. I need to have a real reason to ask for this address. It can be my legitimate interest to ask it if, for example, I’m going to send you a free gift. I obviously can’t send you a gift without knowing your address.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, “legitimate interest” can be interpreted in many different ways. Is it legitimate interest to ask for an email address in order to send marketing emails? well, actually it might be. There’s no black and white answer here.</p>



<h2>Putting it to the test</h2>



<p>There are <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/legitimate-interests/what-is-the-legitimate-interests-basis/#balancing_test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 tests for “legitimate interest”</a>:</p>



<div><div>
<div><div>
<ul><li><strong>Purpose test</strong> – is there a legitimate interest behind the processing?</li><li><strong>Necessity test</strong> – is the processing necessary for that purpose?</li><li><strong>Balancing test</strong> – is the legitimate interest overridden by the individual’s interests, rights or freedoms?</li></ul>
</div></div>



<p>Whilst Sonos tries very hard to meet those first two tests with their policies (but in my opinion, have a very weak position there), I think it clearly fails the balancing test. Sonos blatantly violates its customer privacy by excessively tracking, analysing and making use of very detailed information about them. They capture their listening preferences, their location, neighbouring Wifi access points and lots more. And worse of all, they do it without asking for explicit consent. It’s all hidden in the privacy policy, and set to expose all this data by default.</p>



<p>What’s the <strong>purpose</strong> of collecting all this data? Sonos claims that their purpose is “[To] help ensure Sonos Products are functioning properly, provide a personalised experience for our customers, determine what types of Product or feature improvements would please our customers most, and to help predict potential problems with Sonos Products”. This seems fairly clear as a purpose. Still rather widespread and invasive, but there’s a purpose.</p>



<p>But is collecting all this data <strong>necessary</strong> to meet this purpose? I don’t think so. I think they collect far too detailed information, and they could meet the same purpose with far less data, or by using non-private / anonymised data. </p>



<p>For example: how does the IP address of the customer help with any of those stated purposes? Or why do they need to map neighbouring Wifi access …</p></div></div></div></article></div>

		<p>For as long as I can remember the defining qualities of a good person seemed obvious: competence and integrity. Competence not only contributes and makes possible, but reduces mistakes, inefficiencies, and unfair burdens. Integrity not only underpins ethics and guides competence, but reduces distrust, hostility, and selfishness. Competence and integrity give to the world while their opposites drain from it.</p>
<p>These qualities demand a lot of individuals. They must learn to delay gratification and endure discomfort, inconvenience, and difficulty. They must develop high standards, be self-critical, respect truth, and loathe <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2019/01/23/circumstances-agency-and-just-deserts/">excuses</a>. They must prioritize performance and potential over perceptions, emotions, and costs.</p>
<p>These qualities bring risks to society. Competence unbalanced by other considerations is, among other things, dangerous.<sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_1" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1');">1</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1514342022/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=growwiser-20">Psychopaths</a> offer an extreme example of this.</span> Integrity unbalanced by other considerations is, among other things, impotent. And many otherwise reasonable combinations are, among other things, overconfident and judgmental. </p>
<p>It is a challenge to embrace these qualities despite their arduous nature and to intertwine their development with enough wisdom to apply and balance them well. This challenge is at the core of classical philosophy. It is prominent in religion, military, science, and engineering. It animates intensive educational experiments by the likes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill#Biography">James Mill</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/041547373X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=growwiser-20">Bertrand Russell</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262730081/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=growwiser-20">Leo Wiener</a>, and <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/07/31/book-review-raise-a-genius/">Laszlo Polgar</a>. It finds expression in the idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Soviet_man">New Soviet Man</a>. Its essence is to instill maximal striving to develop one’s potential, live honorably, and contribute to a larger purpose – and to organize society to aid in this task. </p>
<p>This goal depends on assumptions. It presumes existence of better and worse, possibility of agency and coherence, inescapability of causation and responsibility. Its implementation ties worth to choices and promises evaluation on the basis of efforts and achievements. </p>
<p>On these foundations it erects the expectation of judgment and the desire to prove oneself. It then provides tools to do one’s best: to strive for perfection and accept responsibility; to focus on understanding how things work; to control impulses that might lead one astray; to think carefully about intentions and take care in action; to find it dishonorable to hide behind excuses and ignorance or to get away with carelessness and incompetence. It fundamentally depends on, and encourages, individual pride based on contribution, integrity, and effort.</p>
<p>There are many disagreements about implementation details, but they mostly share prerequisites. And each of these prerequisites has come under growing scrutiny over time. It increasingly feels like the ethos itself is under an unrelenting attack from all sides. And perception of such attacks seems to underlie many vicious <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2019/01/23/circumstances-agency-and-just-deserts/#conflict">disagreements</a> of our time.</p>
<p>These attacks are rooted in societal and personal risks, justified through postmodernism, and emboldened by prosperity.</p>

<h2 id="attacks">Attacks on Competence and Integrity</h2>
<p>Attempts to implement visions of better and worse have been fraught with authoritarianism and abuse. And people of competence and integrity have been used to advance agendas of unscrupulous leaders. <sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_2" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2');">2</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2">Orwell’s fictional account of the hapless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxer_(Animal_Farm)">Boxer</a> in <em>Animal Farm</em> is based on the competence-focused <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakhanovite_movement">Stakhanovite movement</a> of the nascent New Soviet Man era.</span></p>
<p>We can blame <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office/">gullibility</a> of loyal workers for enabling abuse and choose to encourage less perfectionism and more rebellion, but we can also blame immorality of the leaders and choose to emphasize importance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_education">moral education</a>. We can accept amoral, <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/competition-between-persons-competition-between-groups/">competitive</a> interactions between different interests and choose to embrace self-centered solidarity regardless of its justification or optimality,<sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_3" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_3');">3</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_3">Scott Alexander’s post on <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/">mistake theorists</a> highlights the logic.</span> but we can also notice the pull manipulation has over emotional and self-interested <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism">masses</a> and come full circle to blame those traits for empowering unscrupulousness in pursuit of influence.</p>
<p>Leadership abuses allow us to blame competence and integrity for horrific events. But they also offer reasons to double-down on these qualities among experts, leaders, and everyday people.</p>
<p>Leadership abuses aren’t the only risk. Competence enables and accelerates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress">progress</a>, but progress has brought with it a long list of ills from the rat race to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_alienation">alienation</a>, from complexity to rapid change, from loss of meaning to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk">existential risks</a>.</p>
<p>These challenges allow us to blame competence and integrity for competitiveness, callousness, fragility, confusion, and stubbornness we see. But they can also push us to emphasize the importance of those very qualities for solutions. </p>
<p>Still, if the purpose of progress is to enable comfortable, happy lives then it seems reasonable to enjoy comforts available today instead of pushing ever further – even if we accept this as being <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2017/08/15/on-the-shoulders-of-contemptible-giants/">unfair</a> to our predecessors. Plus by striving less we won’t make things worse. </p>
<p>But it is also reasonable to argue that such hedonism and risk-aversion robs our successors of a still better life and that resulting incompetence places unfair <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2015/03/02/banality-of-problems-and-the-limits-of-scalability/">burdens</a> on our contemporaries.<sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_4" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_4');">4</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_4">These days it is fairly common to be reminded – correctly – of contributions from flawed people and taken-for-granted jobs.

The goal should be to maximize your resource-adjusted contribution, not to minimize your resource use.</span></p>
<p>We could counter that this trade-off will exist as long as there is progress and we should not make ourselves slaves to the means when we can enjoy the ends. But we could also emphasize curiosity and striving as quintessential human qualities that offer a <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2017/10/25/two-paths-towards-happiness/">nobler path to happiness</a> and defend the process of discovery, understanding, and improvement as a worthy end in itself – with positive external effects merely adding to its superiority. </p>
<p>Such concerns and choices about societal progress interact with questions targeting individual excellence and pride. </p>
<p>High standards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology)">threaten</a> risk-aversion, closed-mindedness, burn out, and extremism.<sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_6" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_6');">6</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6">Engineers, for example, are susceptible to <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/11/theres-a-good-reason-why-so-many-terrorists-are-engineers/">terrorism and conservatism</a>.</span> We can downplay perfection to encourage open-mindedness and creative risk-taking, but we can also attempt to mitigate the risks with even higher expectations and even more sophisticated capabilities.</p>
<p>Pride makes compromise and teamwork difficult. We can treat getting along as an essential skill, but we can also try to engage the energy and perfectionism of pride through teams with <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2014/08/10/plurality-of-absolutes/">shared values</a>. </p>
<p>Striving is judgmental: it evaluates and ranks the quality of effort, the extent of accomplishment, and the importance of endeavors. We can emphasize tolerance, sympathy, support, and self-love, but we can also strive to develop abilities to accept judgments productively and emphasize the importance of making them fair. </p>
<p>Who has the right to judge which skills and endeavors are better anyway? And who can accurately <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2019/01/23/circumstances-agency-and-just-deserts/#assessment">assess</a> the peculiar circumstances of others and hence the quality of their effort? Such thinking tempts authoritarianism and has been responsible for all manner of gross injustices. We can simply discourage judgments, but we can also keep trying to resolve these <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2017/03/01/laws-of-absolute-belief-and-plurality/">challenges</a>.</p>
<p>And isn’t happiness the point anyway? If pursuit of excellence and pride threatens stress, exertion, conflict, loneliness, and unhappiness then why do it? We can reject happiness as the ultimate purpose or claim that pride and accomplishment are necessary for truly human flourishing. But we can also endorse <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2017/10/25/two-paths-towards-happiness/">baser happiness</a> to make it more accessible. We can strive to become what Nietzsche predicted and feared most: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_man">last persons</a>. </p>
<p>Every societal and personal concern can be answered at least as well by increasing the importance of competence and integrity as by diminishing them. This is where <a href="https://www.growwiser.com/2015/08/17/magical-foundations-of-agreement/">doubt</a> that&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism">postmodern</a>&nbsp;arguments slip into concepts like truth, coherence, agency, goodness, responsibility, and purpose is necessary to legitimize lapses in competence and integrity – or to undermine the superior standing competence and integrity requires to be taught.</p>
<p>The practical reality is that most living beings will take the easiest defensible path available to them. It takes concerted effort to curtail ignoble paths and to promote temperament and skills to resist natural inclinations. Yet the trend has been towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumos#Thymos_and_democracy:_megalothymia_and_isothymia">isothymia</a> – the desire to be recognized as equal on the basis of being human – at the expense of megalothymia – the desire to be recognized as superior on the basis of accomplishment.<sup id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_7" onclick="footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7');">7</sup><span id="footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7">Francis Fukuyama presents a compelling case for desire for recognition being a major driver of individual action and human history starting with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743284550/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=growwiser-20"><em>The End of History and the Last Man</em></a> through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684825252/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=growwiser-20"><em>Trust</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374533229/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=growwiser-20"><em>Origins of Political Order</em></a>.

<p>If we asked a room full of product managers what was keeping them up at night, the most common answer would be a version of “building product that doesn’t get used,” more concisely known as “Value Risk.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In <a href="https://svpg.com/four-big-risks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Four Big Risks</a>, Marty Cagan calls out the major risk categories products face:</p>



<blockquote><ol>
<li>value risk (whether customers will buy it or users will chose it)</li>
<li>usability risk (whether users can figure out how to use it)</li>
<li>feasibility risk (whether our engineers can build out what we need with the time, skills, and technology we have)</li>
<li>business viability risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business)</li></ol></blockquote>



<p>Of the four risks, “value risk” is the most fundamental: does this product effectively solve a meaningful pain point for users?&nbsp; Usability, feasibility, and business viability risks are only relevant if we’re confident in the product’s value.</p>

<p>With value risk looming largest, identifying strategies to quickly assess and mitigate value risk is one of the most important jobs of product teams.</p>



<h2>B2C Painted Door Tests</h2>



<p>B2C brands often use <a href="https://medium.com/@crstanier/a-product-managers-guide-to-painted-door-tests-a1a5de33b473" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Painted Door Tests</a> to evaluate interest in a new capability.&nbsp; Painted Door Tests are designed to measure a user’s appetite for a feature without requiring that the feature be built.</p>



<p>For example, let’s imagine that a social network is considering adding a feature that shows which of your friends are discussing a topic a user recently posted about.&nbsp; The social network might add a “See Who’s Talking About This” button and measure the number of clicks the button receives.&nbsp; By adding a placeholder version of the button, the team can begin to assess whether there’s enough interest or value (proxied by clicks) to consider building the new feature without actually having to build out the functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once a feature passes the initial Painted Door Test, there’s still more work to do in evaluating the feature’s impact. For example, we would probably want to measure whether sessions including the “See Who’s Talking About This” button lead to long-term engagement.&nbsp; Still, the Painted Door Test provides a quick read on user interest.</p>

<h2>Challenges of B2B Painted Door Tests</h2>



<p>For B2B companies, Painted Door Tests are tricky to execute for a couple of reasons:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Smaller user base:</strong> while it’s not uncommon for B2C products to have thousands or millions of active users, B2B brands typically have fewer users.&nbsp; The smaller user base can make it hard to see clear directional results from Painted Door Tests.</li><li><strong>Disruptive to users:</strong> users often depend on B2B software to do their jobs and might be annoyed if they click on an exciting new feature that turns out to be a mirage.</li><li><strong>Draws attention to functionality gaps in the product:</strong> Painted Door Tests in B2B products can draw attention to missing functionality in a product that a user might be paying a high price tag for.&nbsp; This can be especially problematic if the feature offered by a Painted Door Test is not ultimately integrated into the product.</li><li><strong>Greater complexity in measuring business critical outcomes:</strong> In a B2C setting, clicking on a Painted Door feature is a signal that a feature is desired, but it still might not translate into a business critical result, like increased time in an app.&nbsp; The gap between expressing interest and desired long-term behavior is often larger and more complex for B2B products.&nbsp; For example, desired B2B outcomes might include behaviors like setting up a tracking event on a website, increasing ad spend, or setting up a new data feed.&nbsp; Because many of these B2B outcomes are preceded by a series of events that occur within the four walls of the client (budgeting changes, internal approvals, etc), the link between a Painted Door Test and its desired result can be challenging to measure.</li></ul>



<p>With a little creativity, we can take the spirit of rapid validation from Painted Door Tests and apply it to a B2B setting.&nbsp; We’ll quickly create a prototype to get direct customer feedback and measure whether there’s interest in the feature and whether that interest translates to a business critical action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Symbiotic Prototyping</h2>



<p>Since Painted Door Tests can draw attention to functionality gaps, potentially create friction for B2B users, and suffer from small sample sizes, any attempt to run these tests in a B2B context must mitigate these obstacles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter <strong>symbiotic prototyping</strong>, a validation technique designed for insights-focused B2B products.</p>



<p>All good relationships need an element of symbiosis, and the relationship between product managers and users is no different.&nbsp; Symbiotic prototyping creates value for the user in the form of business insight and creates value for the product manager by enabling the direct observation of product usage in a complex B2B setting.</p>



<p>During symbiotic prototyping, we take a new product idea, and prototype that idea with client data, resulting in an insight about the client’s business.&nbsp; We share that insight with a user in the course of normal business communication and work with them as they take the insight and turn it into an action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this process we’ll receive implicit and explicit feedback from the user.&nbsp; Since the feedback isn’t tied to an existing product feature, and instead is framed as a helpful insight shared in an email, responses are likely to be more candid and the product manager has the opportunity to change directions based on the feedback.</p>



<p>After working through the symbiotic prototyping process, we’ll have a read on whether the insights our potential product surfaces, provide value and drive impact for users.</p>



<p>Here are the steps to get a symbiotic prototype up and running:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Define the target outcome:</strong> what specific metric or action is the potential new product intended to drive?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Prototype:</strong> the “prototype” is a few sentences sharing the key insight on the client’s business and maybe a graph or two for illustrative purposes.&nbsp; The idea is to move quickly and clearly communicate information to the user, not to think about interactions in the product or to perfect the design. The design will become critical only if the potential product passes the value test.</li><li><strong>Test:</strong> share the prototype with the user, keeping an ear to the ground for questions and feedback, and observe whether the user drives to the target outcome.</li><li><strong>Iterate:</strong> based on both explicit and implicit feedback from the customer, iterate on the prototype and share with a few more users.</li></ol>



<p>Let’s walk through a case study illustrating how we’d apply these four steps in a real world setting.</p>



<h3>The Scenario</h3>



<p>Let’s imagine that our product is an on-site analytics tool.&nbsp; We’re considering adding a feature that highlights the demographics of users contributing to the growth or decline of key actions on the website.&nbsp; We are prototyping the feature for a robo-advisor client.</p>



<h4>Target Outcome</h4>



<p>We’ve observed that the number of A/B tests set up on our on-site analytics platform is a strong indicator of client retention.&nbsp; The key outcome we’re optimizing for is whether the client sets up an A/B test based on the information we provide.</p>



<h4>Prototype</h4>



<p>Looking at the client’s account, we see that the “Increase Deposit” action on the website is an event that they are consistently analyzing and that the event was triggered 15% less frequently this week relative to last week.&nbsp; Furthermore, we notice that 75% of the decline resulted from users aged 25-35.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Iterate</h4>



<p>During the exchange with Carlos, it’s clear that we’ve hit on a meaningful customer pain point (he too is concerned that the “Increase Deposit” event is down) and our product hypothesis of highlighting which customer segments are responsible for the decline in events seems promising. However, Carlos alluded to a couple of potential product improvements:</p>



<ul><li>Highlighting whether the engagement decline from 25-35 year olds was due to fewer users in that age range coming to the website or whether they visited the website but were not engaging with the “Increase Deposit” action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Identifying website changes that coincided with the decline in the key event.</li></ul>



<p>Based on Carlos’s feedback, we would reply with the data on session decline for the 25-35 age range and information on other changes that Carlos’ team had recently made to the website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, we would partner closely with Carlos as he root causes and addresses the decline in the “Increase Deposit” event by observing and asking questions to inform our product direction.&nbsp; Here are a couple areas we should pay special attention to:</p>



<ul><li>Does Carlos launch the A/B test?&nbsp; Why or why not?&nbsp; How could we have accelerated Carlos’ ability to launch the test?</li><li>What information is Carlos hoping to understand after launching the A/B test?</li><li>How does Carlos share information on the decline of the “Increase Deposit” event with his colleagues at work?&nbsp; How might we make sharing that information easier?</li><li>What questions does Carlos ask us along the way?</li></ul>



<p>After walking through the symbiotic prototyping process with Carlos, we would take our new and improved prototype based on Carlos’s feedback and repeat this same exercise with a few more customers, integrating their feedback with each cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once we’ve reached a place where clients consistently launch A/B tests based on the insights we’ve provided, we would move into the product specification and design process.&nbsp; During this phase, we’d determine how to surface the key customer segments driving changes in event frequency within our product, and go through another validation process focused on product usability.</p>



<p>If we aren’t ultimately able to consistently drive towards the A/B outcome, that’s also a success.&nbsp; The ability to quickly toss out product ideas that don’t provide value to the user is the mark of a great product manager.</p>

<p>Taking a step back, there are several benefits to the symbiotic prototyping process:</p>

  <p><span>04 Oct 2020</span></p><p>Architecting a platform to enable deployments and maintenance of machine learning models is not as straightforward as conventional software architectures. The most common misconception among software developers and data scientists is that a machine learning project lifecycle consists of just training a single successful model and deploying it in a service. The real world scenario is much more complicated than this. In fact, assuming that there would always be a single model in service for a particular problem statement is fallacious.</p>

<p>While conventional software architectures take into account that multiple versions of services will be in-effect at any given point of time and provide processes such as blue-green or canary deployments, these processes cannot be directly imported to a Machine Learning Development Lifecycle. In this blog post, I will attempt to explore the Rendezvous Architecture, which addresses most of the problems associated with deploying machine learning models into production.</p>

<h2 id="requirements-for-the-architecture">Requirements For The Architecture</h2>

<h3 id="1-ability-to-support-large-number-of-models">1. Ability to support large number of models</h3>
<p>Realistically, any team would be working on multiple models for the same problem statement and multiplied with the number of problem statements and the number of teams, the number of models in productions explodes to hundreds. Moreover, the same model needs to retrained daily, weekly or monthly in order to be relevant. The architecture should be able to support having hundreds of models in production at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="2-staging-environments-for-the-models">2. Staging Environments for the models</h3>
<p>Multiple models will be in <em>“staging”</em> mode that are in queue waiting to replace current models in production. How do we enable hot-swapping of models in production without affecting the performance of the service?</p>

<h3 id="3-automated-fallback">3. Automated Fallback</h3>
<p>If the deployment of the new model fails, we need to have an automated fallback system in place where the model is rolled back and the older version takes over. This also applies to scenarios where the main model fails or does not respond in time in production. We should have a fallback strategy where an inferior/stable model is picked up in case the main model fails.</p>

<h3 id="4-making-room-for-business-requirements-and-feature-creep">4. Making Room for business requirements and feature creep</h3>
<p>We need to be able to handle feature creep. Although a particular model might be deployed to address a particular problem statement, that problem statement tends to expand rapidly due to the nature of tech business. We need to have the capability to enhance current models or deploy different models in short succession.</p>

<h3 id="5-logging">5. Logging</h3>
<p>We need to build an infrastructure that captures and logs live production data that is fed as input to the models. Training new models is only effective if they’re trained on actual live data instead of a curated training set. Moreover, live inputs tend to “drift” as time passes and the current models might become obsolete sooner than you think. Logging live production data, as the current models see, is paramount in detecting drift, to train new models and to debug existing models.</p>

<h3 id="6-multi-tenancy">6. Multi-tenancy</h3>
<p>Multi-tenancy in machine learning. Any SaaS company will be supporting multiple clients at the same time. Expecting the data science team to train a single model that caters to all the clients is intractable. Having client specific trained models in production is a common scenario. This means that we are looking at having hundreds, if not thousands, of models in production and they should provide basic multi-tenancy capabilities such as data separation, independent model upgrades etc.</p>

<h3 id="7-monitoring">7. Monitoring</h3>
<p>Monitoring and telemetry of the current models in production. We do not want to wait until the users start noticing the degraded model before we push out a new version.</p>

<h3 id="8-deployment-strategies">8. Deployment Strategies</h3>
<p>Similar to the blue-green/canary strategies in conventional service deployments, we need to have a robust strategy for model deployment as well.</p>

<h2 id="rendezvous-architecture">Rendezvous Architecture</h2>

<p><img src="https://sujayskumar.com/assets/rendezvous_architecture/rendezvous_architecture.jpeg" alt="img"></p>

<h3 id="a-overview">A. Overview</h3>
<p>The first interesting thing about the Rendezvous Architect is the stream processing of the requests and responses. The advantages of a stream based architecture is the low latency, decoupling of producers and consumers and a pull-based architecture that sidesteps complicated service discovery conundrums. Moreover, using persistent streams such as Kafka also enables logging and monitoring of the input data.</p>

<p>The incoming request is published to an input queue (with a unique request ID) that all the models are subscribed to. The results of the models are then subsequently published to an output stream. Since there are multiple outputs (or <em>scores</em> for each request, how do we decide which result to send back to the client? This is where the Rendezvous Service fits in.</p>

<h3 id="b-rendezvous-service">B. Rendezvous Service</h3>
<p>The key component of the Rendezvous Architecture is the Rendezvous Service since this service acts as a orchestrator between all the models in production. The Rendezvous Service maintains an internal queue for each request in the request stream. As each model publishes the results to the results stream, the Rendezvous Service reads these responses and queues them in the request-specific queue. Now, Rendezvous Service needs to make a decision as to which result to be sent back to the client. This is decision making addresses most of the requirements outlined in the previous section. Based on the latencies of each model, the Rendezvous Service can change the priorities of the responses and eventually chooses one result as the response and posts it to the final results stream.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Staging Models:</strong> Rendezvous Service can be instructed to ignore the results of the new version and log them instead to monitor how well the new model is performing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Latency Guarantees:</strong> Rendezvous Service can be configured to send whatever result is available if the main model fails to respond in time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Automated Fallback:</strong> Rendezvous Service can pick the results from a baseline model if the main model fails</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A/B Testing:</strong> Rendezvous Service can pick version A model output for certain users and version B model output for other users.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="c-stateful-and-stateless-models">C. Stateful and Stateless Models</h3>
<p>Models that output the same results for the same input are defined as stateless models. For example, an image recognition model always outputs the same softmax output for a particular input irrespective of when the model was run. Only a change in the model results in a change in the output.</p>

<p>Stateful models are models that are dependent on a particular state at the time of input. Defining this state is model dependent. For example, recommendations are stateful models. The primary input can be the input query that the user is typing in the searching box. State can the previous <em>search history</em>, <em>order history</em>, <em>buying pattern</em> and <em>positive click reinforcements</em>. The state can be internal state (<em>user profile</em>) or external state (<em>geography</em>, <em>time-of-day</em> etc. For example, the <em>buying pattern in the user’s country</em>).</p>

<p>The key distinction between the internal and external states is: if the state values are specific only to the particular model and the model has all access to the desired state and/or can compute these state values at run-time, then this state is called as internal state. State values that are common to all models or values that are not accessible to the models themselves constitute external state.</p>

<p>In Rendezvous Architecture, external states must be injected into the input before being fed into any model. External states must be injected in the pipeline before feeding it to the models so that all models receive the exact same input for reproducibility purposes.</p>

<p>Internal states can be injected right before feeding to the particular model.</p>

<h3 id="d-decoy-models">D. Decoy Models</h3>
<p>Logging live production data, as the input models see, is critical as outlined in the Requirements section above. The simplest way to ensure that we are seeing what the models are seeing is to deploy a decoy model at the same hierarchy as other models that does nothing other than logging the inputs. This is extra critical in case of stateful models where the state is injected at real-time.</p>

<h3 id="e-canary-models">E. Canary Models</h3>
<p>Canary models are baseline models that are deployed to analyse the input data and is used to detect drift in the input data and to provide a baseline benchmark to the other models in production.</p>

<h3 id="f-containerize">F. Containerize</h3>
<p>“But, it works on my system!” is no longer an excuse for software engineers. Same holds true for data scientists as well. Debugging different results on the production and development environments is complicated. Moreover, every container can come pre-built with necessary scaffolding required for operations, monitoring, logging, security etc. Hence, every single component in the Rendezvous Architecture must be containerized.</p>

<h3 id="g-replication-for-development">G. Replication for Development</h3>
<p>The development environments must be as close to the production environment as possible. This can be achieved through stream replication.</p>

<p><img src="https://sujayskumar.com/assets/rendezvous_architecture/rendezvous_replication.jpeg" alt="img"></p>

<h3 id="h-monitoring">H. Monitoring</h3>
<p>Rendezvous Architecture enables multiple types of monitoring</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Model Monitoring:</strong> Monitoring of the performance of the models themselves such as accuracy, F1 scores etc</li>
  <li><strong>Data Monitoring:</strong> Data monitoring looks at the input data and the output data and ensures that there is no drift.</li>
  <li><strong>Operations Monitoring:</strong> Assuming the models are performing as expected, operations monitoring focuses on the services themselves. This involves latencies, concurrent requests etc. This monitoring does not involve looking into the data being passed between the services.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pitfalls-of-rendezvous-architecture">Pitfalls of Rendezvous Architecture</h2>

<p>Rendezvous Architecture assumes that every model runs in isolation (i.e) no model is dependent on any other model. If this assumption breaks down and data coupling between models occur, then Rendezvous Architecture does not have a straightforward solution. Such situations must be avoided as much as possible and if they do occur, careful attention must be bestowed while upgrading/retiring these models.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
<p>Self Supervised Learning is an interesting research area where the goal is to learn rich representations from unlabeled data without any human annotation.</p>
<p>This can be achieved by creatively formulating a problem such that you use parts of the data itself as labels and try to predict that. Such formulations are called pretext tasks.</p>
<p>For example, you can setup a pretext task to predict the color version of the image given the grayscale version. Similarly, you could remove a part of the image and train a model to predict the part from the surrounding. There are many such <a href="https://amitness.com/2020/02/illustrated-self-supervised-learning/">pretext tasks</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-pretext-tasks.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By pre-training on the pretext task, the hope is that the model will learn useful representations. Then, we can finetune the model to downstream tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation with only a small set of labeled training data.</p>
<h2 id="challenge-of-evaluating-representations">Challenge of evaluating representations</h2>
<p>So pretext tasks can help us learn representations. But, this poses a question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to determine how good a learned representation is?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently, the standard way to gauge the representations is to evaluate it on a set of standard tasks and benchmark datasets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linear classification</strong>: ImageNet classification using frozen features</li>
<li><strong>Low Data Regime</strong>: ImageNet Classification using only 1% to 10% of data</li>
<li><strong>Transfer Learning</strong>: Object Classification, Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation on PASCAL VOC</li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that the above evaluation methods require us to use the same model architecture for both the pretext task and the target task.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-pretext-target-challenge.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This poses some interesting challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For the pretext task, our goal is to learn on a large-scale unlabeled dataset and thus deeper models(e.g. ResNet) would help us learn better representations.</p>
<p>But, for downstream tasks, we would prefer shallow models(e.g. AlexNet) for actual applications. Thus, we currently have to consider this limitation when designing the pretext task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s harder to fairly compare which pre-text task is better if some methods used simpler architecture while other methods used deeper architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can’t compare the representations learned from pretext tasks to handcrafted features such as HOG.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may want to exploit several data domains such as sound, text, and videos in the pretext task but the target task may limit our design choices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model trained on pretext task may learn extra knowledge that is not useful for generic visual recognition. Currently, the final task-specific layers are ignored and weights or features only up to certain convolutional layers are taken.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="knowledge-transfer">Knowledge Transfer</h2>
<p>Noroozi et al. proposed a simple idea to tackle these issues in their 2018 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00385">“Boosting Self-Supervised Learning via Knowledge Transfer”</a>.</p>
<h3 id="intuition">Intuition</h3>
<p>The authors observed that in a good representation space, semantically similar data points should be close together.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-good-vs-bad-representation.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In regular supervised classification, the information that images are semantically similar is encoded through labels annotated by humans. A model trained on such labels would have a representation space that groups semantically similar images.</p>
<p>Thus, with pre-text tasks in self-supervised learning, the objective is implicitly learning a metric that makes the same category images similar and different category images dissimilar. Hence we can provide a robust estimate of the learned representation if we could encode semantically related images to the same labels in some way.</p>
<h2 id="general-framework">General Framework</h2>
<p>The authors propose a novel framework to transfer knowledge from a deep self-supervised model to a separate shallow downstream model. You can use different model architectures for the pretext task and downstream task.</p>
<p><strong>Key Idea:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cluster features from pretext task and assign cluster centers as pseudo-labels for unlabeled images. Then, re-train a small network with target task architecture on pseudo-labels to predict pseudo-labels and learn a novel representation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The end-to-end process is described below:</p>
<h4 id="1-pretext-task">1. Pretext task</h4>
<p>Here we choose some deep network architecture and train it on some pretext task of our choice on some dataset. We can take features from some intermediate layer after the model is trained.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-step-1.png" alt=""><br>
Figure: Training on Pre-text Task (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00385">Source</a>)</p>
<h4 id="2-k-means-clustering">2. K-means Clustering</h4>
<p>For all the unlabeled images in the dataset, we compute the feature vectors from the pretext task model. Then, we run K-means clustering to group semantically similar images. The idea is that the cluster centers will be aligned with categories in ImageNet.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-step-2.png" alt=""><br>
Figure: Clustering Features (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00385">Source</a>)</p>
<p>In the paper, the authors ran K-means on a single Titan X GPU for 4 hours to cluster 1.3M images into 2000 categories.</p>
<h4 id="3-pseudo-labeling">3. Pseudo-labeling</h4>
<p>The cluster centers are treated as the pseudo-label. We can use either the same dataset as the above step or use a different dataset itself. Then, we compute the feature vectors for those images and find the closest cluster center for each image. This cluster center is used as the pseudo-label.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-step-3.png" alt=""><br>
Figure: Generating Pseudo-labels (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00385">Source</a>)</p>
<h4 id="4-training-on-pseudo-labels">4. Training on Pseudo-labels</h4>
<p>We take the model architecture that will be used for downstream tasks and train it to classify the unlabeled images into the pseudo-labels. Thus, the target architecture will learn a new representation such that it will map images that were originally close in the pre-trained feature space to close points.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-step-4.png" alt=""><br>
Figure: Re-training on pseudo-labels (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00385">Source</a>)</p>
<h2 id="advantage-of-knowledge-transfer">Advantage of Knowledge Transfer</h2>
<p>We saw how by clustering the features and then using pseudo-labels, we can bring the knowledge from any pretext task representations into a common reference model like AlexNet.</p>
<p>As such, we can now easily compare different pretext tasks even if they are trained using different architectures and on different data domains. This also allows us to improve self-supervised methods by using deep models and challenging pretext tasks.</p>
<h2 id="how-well-does-this-framework-work">How well does this framework work?</h2>
<p>To evaluate the idea quantitatively, the authors set up an experiment as described below:</p>
<h3 id="a-increase-complexity-of-pretext-task-jigsaw">a. Increase complexity of pretext task (Jigsaw++)</h3>
<p>To evaluate their method, the authors took an old puzzle-like pretext task called “Jigsaw” where we need to predict the permutation that was used to randomly shuffle a 3*3 square grid of image.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-jigsaw-plus-plus.png" alt=""><br>
Image Modified from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00385">Paper</a></p>
<p>They extended the task by randomly replacing 0 to 2 number of tiles with tile from another random image at some random locations. This increases the difficulty as now we need to solve the problem using only the remaining patches. The new pretext task is called “Jigsaw++”.</p>
<p><img src="https://amitness.com/images/kt-jigsaw-plus-plus-goal.png" alt=""><br>
Image Modified from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00385">Paper</a></p>
<p>In the paper, they use 701 total permutations which had a minimum hamming distance of 3. They apply mean and standard deviation normalization at each image tile independently. They also make images gray-scale 70% of the time to prevent the network from cheating with low-level statistics.</p>
<h3 id="b-use-a-deeper-network-to-solve-pretext-task">b. Use a deeper network to solve pretext task</h3>
<p>The authors used VGG-16 to solve the pretext task and learn representations. As VGG-16 has increased capacity, it can better handle the increased complexity of the “Jigsaw++” task and thus extract better representation.</p>

<p>Most code running on the web is event-based, garbage-collected, and dynamically typed.
In stark contrast, Rust is a compiled language with static type- and memory-safety without a garbage-collector.
What are the implications for a project that compiles Rust to WebAssembly?
I try to answer this question with a fictive story and hands-on code examples.
<!-- and I introduce a Rust library which helps to overcome some of the worst obstacles. --></p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Today, I tell a tale of a cultural clash.
Programming culture, that is.
The JavaScript culture on one end, and the Rust culture on the other.
<!-- But it is a culture nevertheless. -->
<!-- What do I mean by *programming culture", I hear you ask. -->
<!-- For me, this is a set of programming paradigms that are often used together. -->
<!-- As an example, take object-oriented programming -->
<!-- Some programmers are very attached to their programming language of choice. -->
<!-- Usually, because that language turned out to be very suitable for  --></p>

<p>To lay down the necessary foundation, I start by talking about what makes the two ecosystems unique and different from each other.
This leads to the suggestion that it might be difficult to write idiomatic Rust code that runs in the browser.
I want to find out how viable it is and when it makes sense to use Rust in the browser.</p>

<!-- I sketch a possible solution to the proposed dilemma with some Rust code. -->
<!-- Using these idea, I will alVery briefly, I will introduce a new publish-subscribe library called *Nuts*, which I have been working on in the last months. -->
<!-- A full coverage of the library will follow in the next blog post. -->

<h2 id="the-land-of-javascript">The land of JavaScript</h2>
<h3 id="how-the-browser-was-intended-to-be-used">How the Browser was Intended to be Used</h3>
<!-- I am definitely not an expert on the history of browsers, I was too young to program when browsers first saw the light of day.  -->
<!-- light of day? -->
<!-- But to make a point about the fundamentally different approach of JavaScript compared to Rust, I have to write a little bit about the fundamental design elements of JavaScript as the main programming language for browsers. -->

<p>When browsers have first been created, people were very excited.
Text and images could be placed and styled with dozens of possibilities.
It is a second Gutenberg Revolution, everyone gets access to an infinite amount of information that was previously unreachable. What a great achievement!</p>

<p>Then, those elements became interactive with the addition of a scripting language that can run directly in the browser and modify what is displayed.
Suddenly, the browser looks less like a book on a screen and more like newspapers from Harry Potter.</p>

<!-- Code running in the browser was added as an additional nice-to-have feature. -->
<p>Fast-forward to 2020, browsers are the doorstep to so much more than just animated books.
Everyone uses them for everything.
Be it watching videos of cute cats or managing stock portfolios. It all happens in the browser nowadays.
JavaScript evolved to support all these different use cases.</p>

<!-- To make the transition from 1995 to now, JavaScript had to address several major points.
Back then, programming complex code JavaScript was *cumbersome* and the results in the browser *slow* and *insecure*.
We are blessed that this topic received so much attention by browser developers that, by and large, the issues have been resolved. -->

<h3 id="the-javascript-core-features">The JavaScript Core Features</h3>
<p>The inhabitants of JavaScript land, let us call them <em>JavaScriptler</em> from now on, are very open people.
It is one of their greatest strengths that they cooperate with many other JavaScriptlers.
Communication between them has to be easy and without any road blockers.
This idea is at the heart of JavaScript’s culture.</p>

<p>The downside is that they naively run anyone’s code.
To avoid major damage being inflicted by an adversary JavaScriptler, a code running in JavaScript land had to be limited in what it can do.
We also say it executes in a sandbox within the browser.
While other languages like C or Python communicate directly with the host operating system (OS), JavaScript can only communicate with the browser.</p>

<!-- As a result, modern websites are full of code and there are highly dynamic interactions between DOM elements. -->

<!-- To address the speed problems that come with such a sandbox, just-in-time (JIT) compilers [BOOKMARK TODO] put traditional compilers to shame with their crazy-efficient compilation times and remarkable optimizations at runtime. -->

<p>A huge number of libraries and frameworks in JavaScript land have tried to make programming more accessible and simple.
Their combined power is really what defined modern life in JavaScript land.
Arguably, the sheer number of frameworks made it more complex than it has simplified thing.
But there is always just the basic JavaScript without frameworks as the baseline.
For today, I want to talk only about that fundament of JavaScript and its interactions with the browser.</p>

<p>Memory management is a big differentiator of programming languages.
Any language has to provide means to allocate and release memory but the approach can vary.
In JavaScript, it is all done silently in the background.
And sharing memory between functions and closures could not be simpler, it just works.
This fits very well in the general philosophy of JavaScript land, enabling easy communication.</p>

<p>Simple memory management is enabled by the garbage-collectors, which are a bunch of very busy inhabitants of the land.
They clean up all the leftover memory by fast-paced communication of busy programs that cannot be bothered to tidy up behind themselves.
<!-- Running in an execution environment provided by the browser allows to make design choices like using a garbage-collector. -->
<!-- Natively compiled languages, like Rust, basically have to cope with what ever the hardware and operating system provides them. -->
<!-- The designers of JavaScript have had a bit more freedom here. -->
<!-- Another important choice has been made when the JavaScript event loop has been defined. -->
<!-- -T-O-D-O-: Example of JS with easy data sharing, that will not go well with Rust. --></p>

<p>This should give you an idea of how a JavaScriptler thinks.
But there is one more very important topic to cover, the <em>event loop</em>.
Let me explain what the event loop is in the next section, it will be important in the comparison to Rust.</p>

<h3 id="the-javascript-event-loop">The JavaScript Event Loop</h3>
<!-- and how it Prevents Race Conditions -->
<p>The land of JavaScript is ruled by a thing called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop"><em>the event loop</em></a>, which schedules different tasks (threads) to run orderly.
It defines several rules that all code living in the browser has to obey.
For simple JavaScript programming, it is usually okay not to worry about them.
But then there are also quite basic cases in which it matters a lot.</p>

<p>Below is a JavaScript example with a promise, a timeout of 0 seconds, and some console logging.
If you can tell me with confidence in what order the output appears, you have studied the event loop laws well.</p>

<p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/2oL4s7km/6/">JS Fiddle</a></p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// Create promise which resolves after a timeout of 0ms.</span>
<span>// This forces the promise to be enqueue as a new thread in </span>
<span>// the event loop instead of executing immediately in this thread.</span>
<span>// The function within the timeout acts very much like</span>
<span>// a thread in other programming models.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>promise</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>((</span><span>resolve</span><span>,</span> <span>reject</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span>
    <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>[A] Inside Promise</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
      <span>resolve</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>DONE</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}),</span>
  <span>0</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>// Add another message after promise has been resolved.</span>
<span>promise</span><span>.</span><span>then</span><span>(</span>
  <span>result</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>[B] Promise returned: </span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>result</span><span>),</span>
  <span>error</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>[C] Promise failed: </span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>// Write to the console when this code block finshes executing.</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>[D] End of code</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>

<span>// SOLUTION</span>
<span>// Output order: D, A, B</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If the output comes as a surprise to you, you should learn about rule number one of the event loop.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Once a thread is running, it runs to completion without interruptions of other threads.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the example above, this means that even though the timeout has been set to be resolved immediately, it has to wait in the queue until the currently running thread is done.
If you have understood this one rule, you know enough about the JavaScript to follow the rest of the article.</p>

<p>But why does this rule exist?
Would it not be more efficient to start executing the second thread of the example immediately?
Especially, considering that virtually all modern consumer devices have multiple cores which could work on the two threads in parallel.
I am glad you asked.</p>

<h3 id="race-conditions-not-with-javascript">Race conditions? Not with JavaScript!</h3>
<p>When the result of some code depends on the order in which the threads access the same data, we call that a <em>race condition</em>.
Sometimes, this is intended and perfectly fine.
But in other cases, the programmer does not even know that there is a race condition, hence not all possible outcomes will be accounted for. In that case, race conditions are bad.</p>

<!-- Complicated bugs may occur only in very specific timing conditions. -->
<!-- This is the kind of bug ticket your typical lazy programmer would just close as *not-reproducible*. -->
<!-- Until it happens when someone important watches, when it suddenly becomes the focus of the entire team for days if not weeks. -->

<p>There are different solutions to avoid the risk of race conditions.
The founders of JavaScript thought about this carefully. 
They came to a drastic conclusion and decided that no concurrency between threads is allowed, for the safety of everybody.</p>

<p>This resolves the race conditions by removing the possibility that multiple threads ever run at the same time.
However, the existence of multiple threads should still be allowed, or otherwise, it would be very annoying to write code.
So they came up with the event loop, which sequentially runs one thread after another without interleaving them.</p>

<h3 id="clicker-game-example-in-javascript">Clicker Game Example in JavaScript</h3>

<p>Here is some example code in JavaScript for a simple clicker game where a player collects apples.</p>



<p>The variables <code>apples</code> and <code>trees</code> in this example are allocated automatically and they are easily accessible from other functions and threads, just like JavaScriptlers are used to.
There is also no race condition here, thanks to the event loop.
Without it, (A) <code>apples -= 1;</code> within the <code>buy()</code> function would have a race condition with (B) <code>apples += trees;</code> in the closure given to <code>setInterval()</code>.</p>

<p>How is it a race condition?
Assume <code>apples</code> is 10 and <code>trees</code> is 5;
In the normally intended timing, after both statements execute, the result should be 14 apples and 6 trees.
But with one possible timing of a multi-core processor, A reads 10 and B reads 10,too before A has a chance to write.
Then A writes 9, which is immediately overwritten by B writing 15, so we end up with 15 apples and 6 trees. (Buying the tree was for free.)
This is possible because <code>+=</code> is not an atomic operation in hardware, it will be compiled into a read, add, and write operation executed sequentially.</p>

<p>Times have changed but the traditions of our ancestors have remained unchallenged within the browser. Most people in JavaScript have probably forgotten about the problem with race conditions because the problem has long been solved for them.
But there are other regions, outside the browser, which have found different solutions to race condition problem.</p>

<!-- ### Asynchronous and Parallel Code in JavaScript
The demonstrated behavior in the previous example is a direct consequence of the concurrency model used in JavaScript.
It has proven itself to be very useful for event-based programming.
For example, when registering two event-listeners on HTML UI elements, the registering code will not be interrupted by the first event being fired. This avoids a lot of tricky cases which are easily forgotten by programmers.

```js
TODO: Example with jQuery initilization
button A: set text to AAA and remove listener on B
button B: set text to BBB and remove listener on A
```

The problem of the model is that multi-core machine (desktops, laptops, phones, ...) cannot easily use all their cores to parallelize the workload because all asynchronous tasks are executed in sequence.
It is of course possible to do parallel programming in JavaScript, but it is a bit more involved.

I think it is fair to say that JavaScript has not initially been designed with parallel programming in mind.
There was simply no reason for it just to manipulate a few hundred DOM nodes.
But the world has moved on from the 90s. Browsers are used for more than just displaying text and static images. Devices use many cores. 
Thus, it is time to enable easier parallel programming. -->

<!-- 
 - JS
    - Portable (Not compiled)
    - JIT for performance (JS magic)
    - Single-threaded with run-to-completion scheduling on the event loop(?)
 - DOM
    - Code mostly just manipulates DOM
 - Events
    - Closures everywhere
    - Many cross references for shared data
 - Garbage collection -->

<h2 id="the-land-of-rust">The land of Rust</h2>
<!-- ### What Rust was Designed for -->
<!-- 
 - Compiled to CPU native assembly
 - Lots of type information to support compile-time optimizations (Rust magic)
 - Memory safety without garbage collection
    - Compiler needs to know a lot about memory usage
    - Data sharing avoided as much as possible
    - single root of execution tree
 - Multi-threading built into the language/std -->
<!-- Ah, where should I even start with Rust. -->
<!-- I am definitely a bit of a fanboy for the language but I will try to stay factual. -->

<p><img src="https://www.jakobmeier.ch/assets/img/20/private_drive.jpg" alt="Image: A private road with a friendly sign."></p>

<p>A Rust citizen, also known as Rustacean, is very picky about its program code, as opposed to the openness found in JavaScriptlers.
All programs have to be scanned by the compiler and nothing is executed before all checks are done.</p>

<p>And rules to get in Rust land are very strict indeed.
Trying to smuggle through an ordinary <code>7</code> as an <code>f32</code>?
Nope, the <code>7</code> only qualifies for integers, you would have to use <code>7.0</code> instead.
That type of narrow thinking is very typical in Rust land.
<!-- Everything has to be compiled completely into native instructions.
compiles it code to native instructions  with a strong type system.
Zero cost abstractions allow for high-level concepts to be compiled into native binary code that requires no dedicated runtime environment. --></p>

<p>Many of the early Rustaceans are refugees from C++, which is one of the countries impacted the hardest by race conditions.
It is therefore deeply engraved into Rustaceans that they want to prevent any future race condition disasters.
But they are used to build very performance-oriented stuff for a living.
Operating systems, numerical libraries, and world simulations are daily business for a Rustacean.</p>

<p>Naturally, they depend a lot on the benefits of multi-processors. They cannot do without.
The single-threaded approach as seen in JavaScript is not an option in Rust land.</p>

<p>“Civil Rap Song,” a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/9392471/japan-dos-monos-civil-rap-song-taiwan-digital-minister-audrey-tang-watch-new-video">track</a> by the Japanese hip-hop trio Dos Monos, begins not with an MC’s rhymes but a faraway voice speaking slow, bureaucratic English. The deconstructed audio is sampled over gloomy synth:<em> “If you overemphasize … amplifying the public and private sector … where is the civic sector? … where is the social sector?”</em> Made in less than a week during Japan’s state of emergency over Covid-19, the track was intended to be “culturally empowering,” according to a band member — a way to remind the public that it still had choices, even in the midst of a crisis.</p>



<p>The speaker in the song is 39-year-old Audrey Tang, a prodigy hacker turned activist turned digital minister in the Taiwanese government. Tang, who wears rimless glasses and dark, baggy clothes by Issey Miyake, does not fit the profile of a rapper’s muse. Yet over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, which her country has managed with singular, tech-enabled ease, she has become an international messenger of Taiwan’s “radically transparent” “digital democracy.” For Tang, the Taiwanese model offers an imitable middle ground: between the internet and personal privacy; between corporate interests and the welfare state.</p>



<p>Before Covid-19, you may have heard of Tang if you followed Taiwanese news, tech gossip, or transgender politics. She is considered one of Taiwan’s top coders, having taught herself the programming languages Haskell and Perl before developing software for Apple that would be used in Siri. In the spring of 2014, when news that Taiwan’s then-president Ma Ying-jeou had threatened the island nation’s independence by attempting to force through a trade deal with China, Tang quit a job at Socialtext, where she worked on Google Suite–like productivity software, to join a scrum of hackers gathered outside the main government building in Taipei. This was the beginning of the Sunflower Movement, a popular uprising against the prospect of national absorption, and Tang helped broadcast the protests and debates online. After a nearly monthlong occupation, Ma was forced to abandon the pact, and the Sunflower activists turned to political organizing. They successfully ran progressive candidates in the 2014 local elections and, in 2016, elected Tsai Ing-wen as president. Tsai’s administration recruited Tang to become the first out transgender person in Taiwan’s executive cabinet.</p>



<p>While Tang’s title is “digital minister,” she is a minister without a ministry. As one of nine <a href="http://www.politicseastasia.com/research/audrey_tang_interview/">“horizontal ministers,”</a> she advises other parts of the government on all things tech — and, because she happens to be obsessed with the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals — environmental overlaps. In 2017, for instance, she and her staff worked with the Ministry of the Interior and a risk-management agency to combine separate systems used to prevent and respond to natural disasters. Upon Tang’s recommendation, the government agreed to implement a new cloud-based interface to trim costs and give the public quick, easy access to information on floods, fires, and extreme weather. Last year, during the second <a href="https://www.roc-taiwan.org/uk_en/post/6295.html">“presidential hackathon,”</a> an annual event that invites startup-style ideas for governance, she helped facilitate the development of a solar-powered device that can measure and log water-pollution levels on an open-source blockchain. Soon, any citizen worried about downstream industrial waste will be able to buy a few of these monitors, drop them in a creek, and create a dataset to hold corporations and local officials accountable to environmental regulations.</p>



<p>This is clearly government work, but Tang, at her core a hacker iconoclast, bristles at the notion that she works <em>for </em>Taipei. She still prefers to see herself as a liaison, or, in her words, “a moderator or editor,” between the public and the state. This explains why Tang — though not a doctor or epidemiologist — found herself at the center of Taiwan’s response to Covid-19.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When rumors of a dangerous flu emerged from Wuhan, China, last December, the Taiwanese reacted fast. Carrying the memory of the 2003 SARS epidemic, they rushed to buy face masks, threatening to deplete local supplies. In the city of Tainan, an engineer named Howard Wu created a fix: a mapping system to track available masks, using Google GPS and Places API. The platform was an immediate hit. Tang reached out to Wu and secured funding from Google to support and extend the project, which eventually inspired a similar system in South Korea. By spring, the Taiwanese government was managing the supply and distribution of cheap N95-type masks through neighborhood pharmacies. All 24 million residents of Taiwan could buy a certain number per week, at any pharmacy, based on their national health insurance card. Long lines got shorter, and people went about social distancing with confidence. The success of this model — Taiwan has had fewer than 500 total cases and just seven deaths — was what attracted the Dos Monos rappers to Tang.</p>



<p>It helped that, in East Asia, masks were “already ‘natural’ before the pandemic; we didn’t have to invent new things,” Tang said. In response to the common, mostly Western critique that East Asian technocracy relies too much on digital surveillance, Tang explained that Taiwan’s containment method involved “a deep but very narrow and time-limited privacy infringement: You either, when flying back, go to the quarantine hotel for 14 days, or you can choose the digital fence,” that is, submit to strict tracking. “We do not collect new data,” she added. “It’s not a new app. It’s not GPS. People understand it’s proportional.” Taiwan also invested in fact-checking startups and enlisted comedians to craft lighthearted responses to Covid-19 disinformation and consumer misbehavior. In a public-service announcement intended to stem panic-buying of toilet paper, a cartoon version of Tang’s boss, Premier Su Tseng-chang, shimmies his rear end beneath the <a href="https://qz.com/1863931/taiwan-is-using-humor-to-quash-coronavirus-fake-news/">words</a>, “You only have one butt.”</p>



<p>When I spoke with Tang via Skype in July, she referred to Taiwan as “post-pandemic.” The country had never shut down completely, and its streets, markets, and schools were beginning to feel normal. She had just made her morning commute in downtown Taipei, a 15-minute walk from Da’an Park, past the Jianguo flower market, to a broad concrete complex surrounded by lush trees. There, in an open-air arcade that once belonged to the air force, is the Social Innovation Lab, the headquarters of Tang’s digital non-ministry. She dialed in from her office, which resembled the lounge of a coworking space. A vertical Chinese scroll hung over her right shoulder: “More and more graceful every day.”</p>



<p>Tang had been holding public “office hours” on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and was booked through September to chat with locals about tech and government policy, entrepreneurship, and sustainability. Nearly all her interactions, including media interviews and meetings with lobbyists, are subject to a “radical transparency” policy: They are recorded, transcribed, and posted online for all to see. Tang also holds regular virtual visits with communities all over Taiwan.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“<strong>Any top-down, coercion, whether it’s from the capitalists or from the state, is equally bad.”</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>During a recent one, entrepreneurs from Taiwan’s indigenous community pressed for changes to the business code. Tang listened and recalled a solution she helped devise last year, when Taiwan became the first Asian country to legalize same-sex marriage. Many older, conservative Taiwanese could accept that gay people should have equal rights but felt reluctant to have their extended-family registries — official, patrilineal records stretching back to the early 20th century — reflect LGBT unions. The fix was a “hyperlink act” that, with a single click, would amend relevant sections of the civil code to give queer couples the same rights and duties as anyone else but would not, as with straight marriages, “hyperlink to the in-laws,” meaning that the families of the same-sex couple wouldn’t be permanently bonded in the eyes of the state. “Their families don’t wed. It’s the individuals that wed,” she told me. “It’s a social innovation that convinced both generations that the values that they cherish are not disrupted when we pass marriage equality. It’s marriage equality with intergenerational solidarity.”</p>



<p>It’s also a compromise. Tang, whose mother was active in Taiwan’s cooperative movement before the country transitioned to democracy, much prefers collaboration to battle. This might relate as well to another aspect of Tang’s childhood: she was born with a heart defect and often talks about the virtues of unhurried observation. “If you’re slow in your motion, you tend to notice other, nonhuman beings,” she told me — trees, rivers, computers. As digital minister, she invoked this cooperative ideal to implement Pol.is, an online discussion board where Taiwanese people can engage in a “rough-consensus process” about social issues, such as what sorts of rules should govern Uber or how best to combat the spread of revenge porn. To prevent trolling, the platform functions without a reply button.</p>



<p>Taiwan’s constitution prohibits private businesses from acting against “the balanced development of national wealth and people’s livelihood,” yet the country’s most famous corporation is high-tech Apple supplier Foxconn, which gained notoriety for driving its mainland Chinese factory workers to suicide. I asked whether the cruelties of big businesses hadn’t dimmed Tang’s faith in the possibility of social equilibrium. “The manufacturing companies, they learned, of course, not to do [things with] adverse effects within Taiwan proper,” she replied, referring to Foxconn’s compounds in mainland China. But the next generation of Taiwanese entrepreneurs, she said, will use robotics to reduce worker exploitation, embrace “worker associations,” and pursue …</p></div></div>

<p>While I was browsing social media, I came across a tweet that said, “You’re too junior [in software development] if you’re using the mouse.” My initial reaction was just an eye-roll. But then, I realized that there’s more to talk about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keyboard and Mouse are tools, just like VSCode, Vim, Emacs, Rails, Ruby, JavaScript, you name them. They are essential because they help us to get things done faster and more reliably.&nbsp;<br>I see many developers spending significant amounts of time debating the right choice (why emacs is better than vim, JavaScript is trash, you name it). <br>I’m not here to weigh in on any of these specific discussions and arguments instead of getting the discussion on a higher level.</p>



<p>As software developers, we spend time talking about how <strong>we</strong> feel using this particular language, framework, or tool. <strong>We</strong> can get stuff done so much faster in Vim than Sublime Text, using tabs instead of spaces, etc.</p>



<p>But what if you would make the choice based on the optimal end result for your customer? Imagine you’d choose Rails over Sinatra or vice versa because you could ship six months earlier than planned. Or you could add offline support to your web application without breaking a sweat, and your customers’ productivity would go through the roof.</p>



<p><em>How does that feel?</em></p>



<p>Getting there means to look at your tooling from a different point of view. Do you understand how a particular tool fits into your company infrastructure and workflows?&nbsp;<br>For instance, I’ve seen Developers choosing something very sophisticated but hard to learn and use. Why? Because it might express their intellectual prowess, thinking that this makes them more senior. In reality, it’s not the case.</p>



<p>What makes you more senior is team-enablement. Instead of having everyone else put in the effort to get to your level, you put in the effort to help your teammates level up.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>How does that look like?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>For instance, your company uses a build system that’s currently challenging to use with time-intensive maintenance.&nbsp;<br>Everybody comes to you if they are struggling with getting builds to work. Every one of these support requests takes away your and your teammate’s time to deliver value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If this accumulates too much time spent on maintenance, let’s find a way to reduce this again. You could write additional documentation that explains steps better, or, if that doesn’t cut it, lead efforts internally to replace this system with something more user-friendly.&nbsp;<br>Whatever you do, and the more senior you become, the more it is your responsibility to get roadblocks out of the way for others so they can deliver value to your customers and users.&nbsp;<br>Once you deliver your product to the end-user, they won’t know, nor would they care how much effort you put into it. Sophisticated terminal setups and cutting-edge technologies don’t matter. They need to know that it works on their devices, that they can do what they’re good at reliably with your software.</p>

    <p>RSS: </p> <p><a href="https://reyammer.io/blog/index.xml"><img src="https://reyammer.io/rss.png" width="23px"></a></p>

  <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/reyammer/status/1311338230139232258" target="_blank">news is out</a>: I left France, I'm no longer a professor at EURECOM, I joined the Malware Research Team at CISCO Talos, and I moved to beautiful Vienna. Big change :-)</p>
<p>I have been a professor for a bit more than three years, but I have had contrasting feelings about the "prof job" for a long time (even before finishing my PhD), it took me a couple of years to realize that I would eventually have needed to move on, and it took even more (mental) effort to actually make the call and leave. Despite being <em>very</em> excited for what's next, oh boy, this was tough :-) But independently of the concrete next step, it was time to move on. Even if Talos realizes the mistake and kicks me out next week, I'm still confident that moving on was the right call.</p>
<p>Especially when it comes to take big decisions, I tend to obsess about trying to stay rational, and I spent years collecting notes on the various pros/cons. Many of these thoughts often started surfacing as "feeling something is not right", without consciously understanding what was going on. But by keep thinking and writing notes down, patterns of thoughts started to emerge and I was eventually able to pinpoint some more defined thoughts on what kept me on the current job and what pushed me to change. Once these reasons were clear, it was much easier to take the decision.</p>
<p>This is a very long blog post, and I don't expect more than a very few people to actually read it. I wrote it mostly for selfish reasons: before changing to a new life, I wanted to wrap up all these notes in something more structured. I can't be certain I took a good decision, but systematizing these thoughts allowed me to move on with enough confidence to know I'm likely making a step forward.</p>
<p>With that being said, I know that someone may be actually interested in hearing these thoughts and my experience. When I was a PhD student and I needed to take the notorious academia vs. industry decision, I would have paid big bucks to read more thoughts on the various pros/cons. One of the stupidest things you can do is to take big decisions based on what other people do and think, but reading about other people's thought process has helped me a lot. It is time I do my part.</p>
<p>The target audience for this post is, other than myself, PhD students / postdocs that are about to decide what to do next and junior profs that somehow feel that "something is wrong". I also expect some senior academics and industry people to read this post, but I guess they will find themselves skipping directly to the academic rant part and mostly agree with much I have to say :-) Anyways, I tried to stay away from the "very known things" (e.g., 👀-level BS when writing proposals, generally "more limited" immediate impact of your work, different compensation level, etc.), and I tried to focus on thoughts I have not seen much discussed around (at least not in this depth).</p>
<p>So, if you feel clueless and you want to hear more from an equivalently clueless random dude on the Internet, here we are :-) If you think this is <em>the</em> blog post that will make everything clear, I have a bad news for you: it's all about tradeoffs and in my opinion there is no clear-cut winner. And, unfortunately, the problem with tradeoffs and balancing many aspects is that figuring out which one to weigh more is yet another very personal decision in its own way. So, you will not find any answer in this post and you will eventually need to figure this thing out on your own, but I hope this will help you forming your own opinion.</p>
<p>This post is organized in three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job">Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job</a></li>
<li><a href="#part-2-the-bad-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-leave-the-job">Part 2: The Bad — What pushed me to leave the job</a></li>
<li><a href="#part-3-the-bye-bye-mdash-the-decision-to-leave">Part 3: The Bye Bye — The decision to leave</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>Mandatory disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm talking about, and these are personal takes/opinions anyways. Unless you are a bad person, please don't take anything personal. Please feel free to reach out, ping me on twitter, or shoot me an email: I'm of course happy to share more thoughts if you have any question. And if you disagree with something, bring it on! I love to argue, especially with people with strong and different opinions :-)</em></p>
<br>
<h2 id="part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job">Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job</h2>
<p>Before I discuss why I left, I want to touch on what pushed me to keep the job. I want to make sure it's a balanced post despite the upcoming mega rant, so that my overall opinion is more closely reflected. And I really don't want to discourage anyone to take this path, I still think it is a great one.</p>
<p>Note that some of my "reasons to stay" are good, but some are bad. Also note that many of these refer to my personal situation at EURECOM, working in the field of systems security, and not all these points can be generalized to all universities. As they say, your mileage may vary.</p>
<h3 id="its-a-very-good-job">It's a very good job</h3>
<p>The first pros is... 🥁: "it's a very good job". At first, I was shocked to find out that it's an actual job. When I joined this prof thingy I thought that this would be a "job" (note the double quotes). But, while it's true that you don't have a direct boss that tells you what to do, at the end of the day you need to deliver, and you actually work very hard: If your PhD students are in trouble or you teaching sucks, you will run into problems. This doesn't necessarily mean "they kick out", but if you value being a professional (and I do), failing at your core tasks will make you feel bad, even without additional pressure from your superior, and even if you have tenure.</p>
<p>And now that we got this "it's an actual job" out of the way, I can tell you: it's a very good one. There is <em>a lot</em> of freedom in what you do and how you structure your time. Research-wise I felt very free (but you eventually work on what your students like to work on — as it should be), and the department values the right things (I've heard some BS in other schools where, in the context of systems security research, they pressure you to "publish more journal papers..." 🤦‍♂️). I really like teaching and mentoring, and there were many opportunities to do so. They let me create and teach my own class on mobile security, <a href="https://mobisec.reyammer.io/" target="_blank">MOBISEC</a>, and the teaching load is overall very low (1 or 1.5 classes per year). I love playing CTFs and I was even <em>encouraged</em> to spend time and push for NOPS, the EURECOM CTF team (after winning <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/647" target="_blank">HXP CTF 2018</a> and after being referred to as "<a href="https://youtu.be/j0taw78tCYs?t=968" target="_blank">probably a top team</a>" we are mostly enjoying our eternal and well-deserved glory).</p>
<p>The environment is extremely relaxed, informal, and friendly. You are surrounded by top-skilled colleagues and humans, from MS students to profs. I felt in a family from day 1. Last very good point: since in France positions come with tenure, there were not even problems in terms of pre-tenure stress, a real luxury. And on this aspect, EURECOM delivered: I never felt any sort of pressure (but: I did work my ass off... so if you stop doing anything, bad things may happen :-)).</p>
<p>[BTW, EURECOM is frantically trying to replace me, you should apply :-)]</p>
<h3 id="you-are-surrounded-by-students">You are surrounded by students</h3>
<p>When I took my decision to remain in academia, my top reason was for teaching and mentorship. Probably the best perk of the job is that you are surrounded by people eager to learn, from MS to PhD students to postdocs. It is extremely fulfilling and rewarding. Working with my students has been the highlight of my time at EURECOM, from traditional teaching, to suffering through the various rejections, to celebrating defeats of Reviewer #2, to cluelessly getting CTF-close in many stego CTF challenges. I feel very lucky that during these years we found enough interesting ideas that we enjoyed working on together, and that my next job will allow me to keep advising them until they graduate. As a prof, I believe the net output of my work is to see students becoming independent researchers, not the actual papers — I can't wait to see the bright careers I'm sure they will have :-)</p>
<h3 id="i-have-deep-respect-for-the-role-of-profs-in-society-and-it-felt-great-to-be-one">I have deep respect for the role of "profs" in society, and it felt great to be one</h3>
<p>I somehow have a profound admiration for the role that professors have in society and that had in my life. For their hard work, knowledge, passion, patience, and ultimately their service to the community. I'm referring to all teachers and mentors (from elementary schools to universities), who spend their life helping others, while at the same time often being asked to do many useless things and being massively underpaid. I admire and deeply respect these efforts: my most sincere thank you to all past, present, and future profs!</p>
<p>And, to be frank, it felt great to be one. I have been in love with the idea of being a prof for many years. In part, I think it is because some of the people who impacted me the most are professors, and I wanted to do my part in helping others. And after all the uncertainties that one has during a PhD, I think I was even more in love with the idea of having finally found my place in society. [Narrator: LOL, this clueless dude did not find his place. [Answer to narrator: But I've surely found it <em>now</em>!!1!]]</p>
<p>Overcoming all these positive emotions and feelings attached to this job was likely the biggest challenge I faced in coming to terms with the several problems and cons I did have during these three years. As mentioned, I have no intention to give up on this teaching/mentoring thing (taking the time for this long blog post is part of this!), but it will surely not be the same thing. I'm very grateful I had a chance to try this job out. Thanks to all who made it possible, from family to advisors, colleagues, and students ❤️. I owe you big time.</p>
<p>[Of course, being a prof does not necessarily make you a smart or great person. Some profs I know are some of the dumbest people I have ever met (by far) and they would not survive one day in the real world. And some profs I know are the most asshole, selfish, egomaniac, and delusional humans I have ever heard of (Are you pushing your students to stay in the lab …</p></div></div>

                    <p>In today's world of social media, connecting directly with a large audience has never been easier. Donald Trump has 86 million followers, allowing him to talk directly to voters, bypassing political parties. Elon Musk has 39 million followers, allowing him to talk directly to car buyers, bypassing car dealerships.</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cybertruck, ATV, Roadster &amp; Semi<br>C A R S <a href="https://t.co/4Aq1A5cYkH">pic.twitter.com/4Aq1A5cYkH</a></p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1308563749888864257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Their cases are extreme, but social media is indeed a super power that allows anyone to be their own media company. </p><p>Why is this important? </p><p>As <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">software eats the world</a>, the nature of work is changing. First we got the gig economy. This work is flexible, but highly interchangeable. One Uber driver or Instacart delivery person is easily substitutable for another. </p><p>Now we have the <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/">passion economy</a>, where monetization is based on building an audience and delivering digital products and services based on creativity and individuality. In the passion economy, you don't have to be Elon Musk to be successful, but you do need to be able to build an ongoing connection with <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1,000 true fans</a>.</p><p>Publishing is an industry where star writers have long generated the majority of revenue, subsidizing everyone else. <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a> is a platform that allows these writers to build a business going direct to readers. Casey Newton, a tech writer for The Verge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/business/media/substack-newsletters-journalists.html">just left to start a subscription newsletter</a> on <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>. It's easy and free to start a newsletter on Substack, and the top writer <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/10/08/passion-economy/">earns over $500,000</a> a year from reader subscriptions. In this new model, the best writers might be paid 10x what they're used to, but poor or average writers will be paid much less, if at all.</p><p>K-12 education today in the US is a state-sponsored monopoly designed mainly around teachers, not students. Great teachers are paid little more than average or poor teachers. That said, star teachers like <a href="https://astroathens.com/">Athena Brensberger</a>, <a href="https://science.mom/">Jenny Ballif (Science Mom)</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mathgarden?lang=en">Sunil Singh</a> have gone outside the system and have become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber">Youtubers</a> (or streamers). They broadcast their classes live online, and students engage with them in real-time, asking and answering questions via chat (like <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/formedia/solutions/facebook-live">Facebook Live</a>). <a href="https://www.joindexter.com/">Dexter</a> is a platform that makes it easy for these streamers to build a business by packaging up their classes with small group Zoom learning coaches and handling all the other tasks required to deliver complete virtual school. In this new model, the best teachers might be paid 10x what they're used to, but poor or average teachers will be paid much less, if at all.</p><p>In the passion economy, value capture shifts from a normal distribution to a power law distribution, where the #1 worker in a segment earns an order of magnitude more than the #2. The good news is the long tail of micro-segments to build your 1,000 true fans in is massive. But you need to be your own media company to do it.</p><p>If great writers can build a business without a publication and great teachers can build a business without a school, where else might we see this happen? </p><p>Is it part of the <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/the-future-of-finance-is-self-driving-money/">future of finance</a>?</p><p>We're already starting to see it happen in venture capital. <a href="https://nbt.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-solo-capitalists">Solo capitalists</a> have started leading large rounds that would normally have been led by venture firms. And <a href="https://angellist.com/">AngelList</a> has strong traction behind their platform that makes it easy for anyone with an audience of accredited investors to launch and run a venture fund. This is a huge unlock and market expansion for both people who want to invest in a venture fund and for people who want to run a venture fund. </p><p>If AngelList has built the platform that allows any good startup investor to run their own venture fund, who's building the platform that will allow any good money manager to run their own hedge fund? Or mutual fund? Or ETF?</p><p>Could a rising money manager build an audience and go direct without needing a Fidelity or a Blackrock or a Goldman Sachs? Could this be the future of what today is called <a href="https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/digital-asset-prime-brokerage">Prime Brokerage</a>?</p><p>Good software might level the playing field and enable a Cambrian explosion of fund styles and strategies. We could see micro-segments by geography, company size, sector or approach that simply don't exist today. </p><p>How could this work?</p><p>One version is the SAAS platform. It provides the tools, you supply the customers and the product. A better version is the <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/defining-aggregators/">aggregator</a>. An aggregator consolidates demand by being the best and easiest place to buy from. It provides the customers and the SAAS platform, you supply the product. Aggregators are multi-sided networks with increasing returns, giving them natural monopolies. But unlike a typical monopoly, they usually increase consumer surplus massively, both by expanding supply and demand but also by reducing producer surplus. Can someone do for funds what Google did for web pages?</p><p>Of course, it's no longer a given that an aggregator is a single centralized company like Google or Facebook. An aggregator can also be a protocol. A crypto network like <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/why-the-market-for-bitcoin-may-be-bigger-than-you-think/">Bitcoin is also a multi-sided network</a>. With the right incentives in the software, they too can have increasing returns and be just as defensible in their own domain.</p><p>It's hard to know when the passion economy will come to financial services. But it is clear that it will come. Who will enable it? What will it look like? And how will it re-shape the value chain?</p><p>Only time will tell.</p><p><em>Did you like this article? <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/services/#subscribe" rel="nofollow noopener">Subscribe now</a> to get content like this delivered free to your inbox.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        <p>It’s been two years since I started working as a software engineer.
I sometimes tell my colleagues about a student project I did in my junior year of university,
and it’s so well-received that I’m writing this post.
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Now, let me ask you a question. Have you ever designed your own ISA, built a processor of that ISA on FPGA, and built a compiler for it?
Furthermore, have you run an operating system on that processor?
Actually, we have.</p>
<p>In this post, I’m going to talk about my undergraduate days in 2015,
our four months of building a home-built CPU of a home-built RISC ISA,
building a home-built C toolchain, and porting Xv6, a Unix-like OS, to that CPU.</p>
<h2 id="cpu-experiment-at-the-university-of-tokyo">CPU Experiment at the University of Tokyo</h2>
<p>It was all done as a student experiment project called CPU Experiment.
So, let’s start with what is CPU experiment.</p>
<p>CPU experiment is a little famous exercise held in the winter of the junior year in my department,
the Department of Information Science at the University of Tokyo.
In the experiment, students are divided into groups of four or five students.
Each group designs an own CPU architecture, implements it on an FPGA,
builds an OCaml subset compiler for that CPU, and then runs a given ray-tracing program on the CPU.
Typically, one or two people are responsible for each of the CPU, FPU, CPU simulator and compiler.
I was in charge of the CPU in my group, Group 6.</p>
<p>This exercise is well known for the high expectation of self learning.
The instructor only asks the students to “take this ray-tracing program written in OCaml and run it on your CPU implemented on an FPGA”, and the class ends.
He/she doesn’t tell much about the concrete steps of how to write CPU and compilers.
The students learn for themselves how to embody the general knowledge of CPUs and compilers learned in previous lectures to the level of real circuits and code.
Well, this is a very tough exercise, but very exciting and educational.</p>
<h2 id="lets-run-operating-system-on-our-own-cpu">Let’s run Operating System on our own CPU.</h2>
<p>As some of you may have noticed, I didn’t talk about operating system at all.
I’ll add a little explanation.</p>
<p>Typically, the experiment proceeds as follows.
First, you make a CPU that works reliably, no matter how slow it is.
If you can make a working CPU and successfully run the ray-tracing program, you can earn the credit of the experiment.
After that, your team has a free time.
The traditional way to spend this free time is to further speed up their CPU.
In past experiments, students have made out-of-order CPU, VLIEW CPU, multi-core CPU, or even superscalar CPU, which is amazing.</p>
<p>However, some teams put more energy into doing fun such as running games or playing music by connecting a speaker with their CPU.
Group 6, to which I belonged, was a group of such people who loved entertainment,
and we decided to run an OS as our team goal.</p>
<p>As a result of other groups showing interest in this idea, a joint group of about 8 people, Group X,
was formed, and their goal was “Let’s run an OS on our own CPU!”</p>
<p>Although I was in charge of creating a CPU in Group 6,
this time I chose to be the leader of the OS team in the Group X.
So this post is written primarily from the perspective of the OS team,
but of course I also introduce the overall group’s results.</p>
<h2 id="xv6">Xv6</h2>
<p>As the OS to be ported, we chose Xv6, a simple Unix v6-inspired OS created by MIT for educational purposes.
Xv6 is written in ANSI C, unlike Unix v6, and it runs on x86.
Xv6 is an educational OS, so its features are a bit poor, but it has sufficient features as a simple Unix-like OS.
You can find more information of Xv6 on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xv6" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>

 or <a href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public" target="_blank">the GitHub repository</a>

.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>In porting xv6, there are a lot of challenges on the software side alone because we were trying to create everything from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>1. C Compiler and tool chain for Xv6</strong></p>
<p>In the CPU experiment, we usually create an ML compiler. Naturally, you can’t compile C codes of Xv6.</p>
<p><strong>2. What kind of CPU features required for operating system?</strong></p>
<p>Privilege protections? Virtual address? Interrupt?
Yes, we had overall understanding of what operating system does by lectures,
but we didn’t have solid enough understanding to explain what specific CPU features could make that happen at that time.</p>
<p><strong>3. What about the simulator?</strong></p>
<p>We had a simulator made in the core part of CPU experiment,
but it was a simple one that executes one instruction by instruction,
and there was no interruption or no virtual address conversion.</p>
<p><strong>4. Low portability of xv6</strong></p>
<p>Xv6 was not very portable.
For example, it assumes the <code>char</code> is 1 byte and <code>int</code> is 4 bytes, and manipulates the stack heavily.
Well, the name “Xv6” I guess comes from x86 and Unix “v6”, so it’s kind of natural.</p>
<p>We had a lot of concerns, but started the Group X’s OS porting project in December.<br>
From here I’m going to write about what we did in roughly chronological order.
It’s a little bit long, so if you want to look at our final products quickly, <a href="#march---xv6-runs">please jump to March</a>

.</p>
<h2 id="late-november---starting-the-compiler">Late November - Starting the compiler</h2>
<p>The first problem that we saw the answer to was the compiler and tool chain.
To be surprise, our decision was to build the C89 compiler from scratch.
To be honest, I hadn’t imagined that we would choose this way.
I remember I talked with Yuichi, who became in charge of CPU of Group X, about doing a gcc or llvm port at first.</p>
<p>However, one of the team members, Keiichi, suddenly said he had written a C compiler and showed us a prototype of a compiler with a simple parser and emitter.
It seemed more fun to write the toolchain from scratch, so we decided to write a compiler by ourselves.</p>
<p>Yuichi and Wataru from Group 3, who had already finished the core part of the experiment that year, joined Keiichi, and the Group X compiler team was born.
We later named our compiler Ucc.</p>
<h2 id="mid-december---the-os-team-is-up">Mid-December - The OS team is up!</h2>
<p>At the beginning of December, I completed my CPU, and Group 6 completed the core part of the CPU experiment.
So, we moved on to the fun part, Group X’s OS porting task.
At this time, myself and Shohei from Group 6 started working in Group X and became the OS team. Masayoshi joined it at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="core-part-of-the-experiment-writing-a-cpu">Core part of the experiment: Writing a CPU</h3>
<p>By the way, I guess not so many software engineers have ever written a CPU, so let me talk a little bit about making a CPU as well.</p>
<p>Nowadays, making a CPU doesn’t mean wiring every single jump wire on a breadboard; you write the circuitry in Hardware Description Language.
Then you synthesize that HDL into a real circuit using Vivado or Quartus.
This process is called logic synthesis, not compilation.</p>
<p>HDL and programming language are similar but different.
Think of it like writing a function that maps the signal state of registers to another signal state, triggered by a clock or input signal.
If you want to experience real reactive programming, I suggest you try writing an HDL.
Please also remember to write HDLs, always worrying about whether the signal propagation of the HDLs you write really ends up in one clock.
Otherwise, the behavior of your circuits would be incomprehensible to humans.</p>
<!-- You'd write a CPU state machine that decodes the machine instructions each time the clock rises, and then performs ALUs and branches accordingly, and updating the state of the exposed registers as an interface to the assembly. -->
<p>The hardest part of the actual development was that this logic synthesis took a ridiculous amount of time.
It was not uncommon for us to have to wait up to 30 minutes after starting the synthesis,
so once I started the synthesis,
I was often playing Smash Bros. Melee with the other CPU guys who were also waiting for the synthesis to finish.
FYI, my character was Sheik.</p>
<h2 id="late-december-to-mid-january---learn-by-porting-xv6-to-mips">Late December to mid-January - Learn by porting Xv6 to MIPS</h2>
<p>We began to find the answer to “What kind of CPU features required for operating system?”</p>
<p>After the OS team was born, we started weekly rounds of Xv6 source code reading.</p>
<p>At the same time, I started porting Xv6 to MIPS.
This was partly to learn how an OS works at the implementation level, and partly because there appeared to be no Xv6 port to MIPS.
I completed the port until the process scheduler started in about a week.
I did a lot of research on MIPS during this porting process,
and on x86 to understand how xv6 works.
Thanks to that, I understood mechanisms around interrupts and MMU at the implementation level.
At this stage I got a solid understanding of the CPU functionality required for Xv6.</p>
<p>Also, in mid-January, we worked hard to compile the entire Xv6 code by commenting out the various parts.
As a result, Xv6 on the simulator of our homebrew architecture showed the first message of the boot sequence,</p>
<pre><code>xv6...
cpu0: starting...
</code></pre><p>At the same time, this meant that by this time Ucc had already grown enough to compile most of xv6, which was awesome.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="february---our-cpu-gaia-was-born">February - our CPU, GAIA was born!</h2>
<p>In the MIPS port, I completed the initialization of the PIC, which was a real pain,
and also completed the implementation of the interrupt handler.
As a result, the porting of Xv6 to MIPS was completed until just before the first user program started.</p>
<p>Based on this experience, I made the draft specifications of the interrupt and virtual address translation for our homebrew CPU.
In order to keep it simple, we decided to omit hardware privilege mechanisms like Ring protection.
For virtual address translation, we decided to use a hardware page-walking method, just like x86.
It may seem difficult to implement in hardware, but we thought it was cheaper if we sacrificed the speed and omit TLB implementation.
After all, Yuichi made an excellent CPU core later, and it installed TLB from the beginning though.</p>
<p>Yuichi completed the overall design of the ISA of our CPU.
He named our CPU GAIA.
In typical CPU experiment projects, we don’t implement interrupt nor MMU.
However, Yuichi started to implement them for Xv6, based on the refactored version of the CPU of Group 3.</p>
<p>I’ll note the weekly records as the rapid progress begins from then on!</p>
<h2 id="1st-week">1st Week</h2>
<p>Instead of just commenting boot sequences out, Masayoshi started implementing actual initialization of our CPU,
and Shohei rewrote the x86 assembly of Xv6 into our homebrew architecture’s.
I added interrupt simulation capability to our simulator which Wataru had made …</p></div></div>

<p>In recent years, democratic governments have had their fair share of troubles. The US presidential election of 2016 was probably one of the most shameful and toxic political events to date, with both Democrats and Republicans verbally abusing each other on social media. In France, the 2017 presidential election saw the fall of the major parties (LR and PS) and the rise of the nationalist party led by Marine Le Pen and a newly-born unaffiliated movement created by Emmanuel Macron: La République en Marche, and, in late 2018, the Yellow Vests protests broke out and outlasted even the protest of May 1968. Many more examples could be cited, such as Brexit, Viktor Orban’s erosion of the rule of law in Hungaria, Jair Bolsonaro’s election in Brazil, the Hong Kong protests, and many more. Worldwide, democracies seem to be crumbling: how can we restore and reassert their legitimacy? We will not be so bold as to declare we have found a silver bullet to the rise of authoritarian regimes, but we will nevertheless try and suggest promising ideas.</p>

<p>First of all, if we are to overhaul the building blocks of our democracies, we must gain fundamental understanding of how politics work. Why do some countries take the authoritarian road while other ones become hosts to governments with free elections?</p>
<h2 id="the-rules-for-rulers">The Rules for Rulers</h2>
<p>The power of a king is not to act but to <strong>get others to act for him</strong>, often through the help of money. In dictatorships, three rules prevail: dictators must get the key supporters - that is, the people who have financial or military power - on their side, and they must control the treasure and buy the key supporters’ loyalty. Then, they have to minimize the number of key supporters, since key supporters needed to gain power are not the same as the ones needed to maintain it.</p>
<p>In democracies, <strong>power is fractured and earned with words</strong>, not violence. Citizens are divided into blocks which politicians can reward as groups. For instance, farming subsidies have no correlation with how much food a country needs, but instead with how much influence farmers have on elections. That’s why populists sometimes manage to garner substantial support despite being disliked by a large part of the population: they cater to a specific subset of the voters which is receptive to their shenanigans. For instance, Donald Trump’s target is mainly the rural, white and low-educated American population.</p>
<p>The main difference between both cases is that <strong>dictators have no need to please the crowds</strong>, especially when the nation’s wealth comes from natural resources (minerals, oil…). On the contrary, <strong>elected representatives need productivity</strong> to increase treasury and therefore to increase the money they can give to their keys, hence they create hospitals, universities… Representatives generally last longer than dictators because their goals are generally more aligned with those of the population. When a dictator is replaced by the people, it is because their keys let the people do so. The people never replace the ruler: the court does. That’s why the following ruler is generally even worse, because they need to keep the keys’ loyalty. In stable democracies, aspiring dictators struggle to gain support because the potential key supporters, more educated, have to weigh the probabilities of making it through the revolt. The more the wealth of a nation comes from the productivity of the citizens, the more the rulers have to redistribute that wealth to the citizens. Democracies typically fall when the treasure becomes empty or when natural resources which dwarf citizen’s productivity are discovered.</p>
<p>Therefore, we will reduce the scope of our reasoning to states which are already democratic, that is most of the Western world. It would be a pipe dream to imagine being able to turn China or Saudi Arabia into a democracy as of today. However, we may reasonably gather ideas which would improve existing democratic systems.</p>
<h2 id="de-mesquitas-principle">De Mesquita’s Principle</h2>
<p>Bruce Bruno de Mesquita offers a very insightful take on politics. According to him, all politicians follow a very basic desire which consists in only two things: to <strong>get hold of power</strong> and to <strong>keep it</strong>. A politician is not “good” or “evil” per se: they will make different choices based on the incentives provided by their environment. From this fundamental principle, many other principles can be deduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corollary 1: what a politician really thinks is irrelevant. What matters to them are the other politicians, lobbies and voters they owe.</li>
<li>Corollary 2: merit and responsibility are bad predictors of politics.</li>
<li>Corollary 3: politicians are not stupid. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have won at the game of politics.</li>
<li>Corollary 4: to be “right” is irrelevant in politics. What matters is to get the support of the population.</li>
<li>Corollary 5: it is extremely difficult to introduce new ideas in politics because voters and other politicians will most likely not heed them.</li>
<li>Corollary 6: voters should not vote for ideals or individuals; they should take into account the incentives that will be provided to the different political parties and vote for the political party that will receive the incentives most aligned with their own values.</li>
</ul>
<p>A very natural question follows from those rules: how do politicians attain power? Through <strong>elections</strong>. Let us then examine the current ballot systems of Western democracies.</p>

<h2 id="the-current-distribution-of-voting-systems">The Current Distribution of Voting Systems</h2>
<p>Voting systems can be divided in three main categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plurality systems</strong> are systems in which the candidate(s) with the highest number of votes wins, with no requirement to get a majority of votes, such as the US first-past-the-post ballot.</li>
<li><strong>Majoritarian systems</strong> are systems in which candidates have to receive a majority of the votes to be elected, although in some cases only a plurality is required in the last round of counting if no candidate can achieve a majority, such as instant-runoff voting (Australia) or two-round systems (France).</li>
<li><strong>Proportional systems</strong> are systems in which divisions in an electorate are reflected proportionately in the elected body. Party-list proportional representation is the single most common electoral system for national legislatures, being used by 80 countries, and involves voters voting for a list of candidates proposed by a party.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most common system used for presidential elections around the world is the <strong>two-round system</strong>, being used in 88 countries.</p>

<h2 id="ballot-properties-and-theorems">Ballot Properties and Theorems</h2>
<p>Unbeknownst to most voters, the single most important factor in election results is, in fact, the choice of the ballot. However, it so happens that two of the most used voting systems - the first-past-the-post and two-round systems - are arguably flawed ballots, at least more so than others. Indeed, they are <strong>dependent on irrelevant alternatives</strong>, which is an intuitively bad mathematical property, as opposed to independence from irrelevant alternatives which is defined as such: if one candidate (X) would win an election, and if a new candidate (Y) were added to the ballot, then either X or Y would win the election. Independence from irrelevant alternatives is an intuitively reasonable assumption, but both systems do not have that property. A good example of dependence on irrelevant alternatives is illustrated by this example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After finishing dinner, Sidney Morgenbesser decides to order dessert. The waitress tells him he has two choices: apple pie and blueberry pie. Sidney orders the apple pie. After a few minutes the waitress returns and says that they also have cherry pie at which point Morgenbesser says “In that case I’ll have the blueberry pie.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are also exposed to the <strong>tactical voting dilemma</strong>: voters support another candidate more strongly than their sincere preference in order to prevent an undesirable outcome. This is partly what happened in the 2017 French presidential election: many voters chose either Mr. Macron or Ms. Le Pen during the first round rather than another candidate which had fewer chances to win.</p>
<p>Mathematicians have in fact devised theorems which put strict boundaries on what we can expect from a ballot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arrow’s impossibility theorem</strong>: no rank-order electoral system can be designed that always satisfies these three “fairness” criteria:
<ul>
<li>If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.</li>
<li>If every voter’s preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group’s preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).</li>
<li>There is no “dictator”: no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group’s preference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, Arrow’s theorem states that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), <strong>no ranked voting electoral system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem</strong>: for every voting rule, one of the following three things must hold:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rule is dictatorial, i.e. there exists a distinguished voter who can choose the winner; or</li>
<li>The rule limits the possible outcomes to two alternatives only; or</li>
<li>The rule is <strong>susceptible to tactical voting</strong>: in certain conditions some voter’s sincere ballot may not defend their opinion best.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gibbard’s 1977 theorem</strong> is an extension of the previous theorem when including random strategies. The only voting scheme which satisfies anonymity, unanimity and is strategy-proof is a random dictatorship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-randomized-condorcet-method">The Randomized Condorcet Method</h2>
<p>Although the aforementioned theorems guarantee that a perfect ballot doesn’t exist, it is possible to build a ballot which exhibits better properties than the first-past-the-post and two-round systems. We will here advocate for the <strong>random…</strong></p></div></article></div>

But looking at the “Direct” channel, we see a dramatic increase in my interview rates.&nbsp;At zero years of experience, cold e-mails increased my odds by nearly 5x compared to direct.

You want minimize the amount of time you spend to maximize your ROI (offers). We all know that <strong>getting referrals is the best strategy</strong>.

									Welcome to the second interview on 'The Observer Effect'. We are lucky to have one
									of the most influential founders/CEOs in technology and media - Daniel Ek, Founder
									and CEO of Spotify.

							</em></p><p><em>Daniel does things very differently from other business leaders and was generous to go
								deep with us on his leadership style, time management, decision making, Spotify's impact
								on the world and much, much more. Enjoy!
								</em>
							</p><p><b><a href="https://sriramk.com/">Sriram Krishnan</a></b><br>
								<em><strong>Let’s start with the basics. Walk me through a typical day in the life of
										Daniel Ek.</strong></em>
							</p><p><strong>Daniel Ek</strong><br>
								So, this will sound incredibly lazy compared to some leaders. I wake up at around 6:30
								in the morning and spend some time with my kids and wife. At 7:30, I go work out. At
								8:30, I go for a walk – even in the winter. I’ve found this is often where I do my best
								thinking. At 9:30, I read for thirty minutes to an hour. Sometimes I read the news, but
								you’ll also find an ever-rotating stack of books in my office, next to my bed, on tables
								around the house. Books on history, leadership, biographies. It’s a pretty eclectic mix
								– much like my taste in music. Finally, my “work” day really starts at 10:30.
							</p><p>
								Many people make big decisions early on in the day, I make them later in the day--at
								least later in the day here in Europe. Ironically, it's not actually because I'm more
								productive then, rather because we have so many of our staff in the US, and as a result,
								I've kind of primed myself to work that way.
							</p><p>
								So the earlier part of my day is focused on coaching, one-on-ones, and planning. Then, I
								typically tackle one topic a day which takes a lot of my time. That's my big thing for
								the day. Before we go into a live team discussion on that particular topic, I invest
								time to prepare beforehand – reading and talking to members of the team who are either
								part of the decision-making process or who have insights and context. I sometimes even
								get external perspectives.
							</p><p>
								I also think about what my role is at that meeting. Sometimes I'm the approver. Other
								times, I'm supposed to come with a thoughtful perspective on whether an initiative makes
								sense or not.
							</p><p>
								I’ve found that creating this clarity of role for myself is critical. It’s something I
								challenge my direct reports to think about as they engage with their own teams. I remind
								them that all meetings are not the same. Even when we are meeting to discuss really,
								really complicated topics I always ask myself: “What am I going to do in this meeting?
								What does my involvement really need to be?”
							</p><p>
								The truth is: it's entirely contextual. I find it crucial to be upfront about everyone’s
								role in different meetings, I think this is super, super important. Often that's my
								number one thing: to make sure I know what role I'm playing.</p><p>
								<b><i>Wow, okay, there are multiple things in there ranging from how you choose to spend
										your time to how you handle meetings. To work backwards, what makes a good
										meeting in your mind?
									</i></b></p><p>A great meeting has three key elements: the desired outcome of the meeting is clear ahead
								of time; the various options are clear, ideally ahead of time; and the roles of the
								participants are clear at the time.
							</p><p>
								I often find that meetings lack one of those elements. Sometimes they lack all those,
								which is when you have to say, “This is a horrible meeting, let's end it and regroup so
								it can be more effective for everyone.”
							</p><p>
								To clarify outcomes, options, and roles ahead of time, we sometimes rely upon a preread.
								Prereads are a great way to share context so that attendees can quickly get into the
								meat of the issue and not waste time getting everyone up to speed. What I find is when
								you use a tool like a Google Doc, you can take in a great deal of information by reading
								comments, assessing options, and understanding how opinions have evolved over time. With
								this uniform background and context, attendees can focus on discussing the matter at
								hand versus getting on the same page. When the latter happens, the meeting becomes an
								incredible waste of time.
							</p><p>
								I think that's the single largest source of optimization for a company: the makeup of
								their meetings. To be clear, it's not about fewer meetings because meetings serve a
								purpose. Rather, it’s key to improve the meetings, themselves. A lot of my efforts focus
								on teaching people this framework. Ironically, I find that most people are just
								challenged by that stuff.
							</p><p>
								Candidly, that’s my role as leader: to coach others on how best to make use of their
								limited time. Not only is time the most precious resource the company has, it’s also the
								most precious resource they have! It’s crucial that they approach the use of their time
								with a holistic perspective. By way of example, I had a recent call with one of my
								directors who had not taken a vacation in six months. Our conversation delved into why
								this person thought that they could not be away for two weeks, and me arguing for why
								the person had to take two weeks to recharge!
							</p><p>
								There is never enough time – for work, for family and friends – and it takes work to
								make the best use of it. It's all about fostering a holistic perspective in life.

							</p><p>
								<b><i>
										That’s fascinating. Let’s turn to your team.

										Your direct reports are highly accomplished people; what are the common mistakes
										you see executives at that level make when it comes to personal time management?
									</i>
							</b></p><div>
							<div><p>
								I don’t think most executives dedicate enough time to thinking. They spend too much time
								in meetings. By the way, I will say as a caveat, I do know people who are incredibly
								organized and succeed with a lot of “do time.” Shishir Mehrotra [Co-founder and CEO of
								Coda] is a great example. If you've seen the docs on how he organizes his time...
								</p><p>

								<b><i>Oh yeah, he has a lot of very well-organized docs! [laughs]</i></b></p></div><p>
								He is a source of inspiration. For a while, I tried to mimic his style because I was so
								impressed with his thinking behind it. But in the end, it just wasn’t for me. It
								actually drove me nuts. <i>[Sriram laughs]</i>
								But I respect him. I would say he's a highly effective executive. His system works for
								him. It's not one size fits all. Some of my direct reports thrive on lots of meetings.
								But, in general, I would say the largest mistake is that they conflate meetings with
								productivity. Often fewer meetings and better decisions drive the business forward.

							</p>
							<h2 id="opencalendar"><b>On Creating an Open Calendar</b></h2>
							<p>


								<b><i>This dovetails nicely with something that fascinates many of your colleagues: how
										do you have so much open time on your calendar?

										This drastically differs from your typical “successful CEO” who is booked from
										8:30am to 6pm. Walk us through your calendar and how you manage to create this
										open space.
									</i></b>

							</p>

							<p>

								My friends know me well! I do keep a lot of open time. I understand this comes from a
								place of privilege and I’m very lucky to have this flexibility.
							</p>
							<p>

								I feel like synchronous time is very costly; asynchronous time is better. I know there
								are some leaders who prefer to have all executive decisions travel through them. But
								then, you have to wait until the leader has availability to review things. Sometimes you
								run into delays in that process.
							</p>
							<p>
								I typically don't have more than really three or four meetings per day. There are
								exceptions; when I travel, I book in a lot more and I don't keep to my normal schedule.
								That said, most of the time it's three or four meetings a day.

							</p>
							<p>
								My way is to plan long term and do so ahead of time so that people better understand the
								direction in which they're going. You have to be incredibly crisp and clear when doing
								that. For instance, right now we're finalizing our five year plans and long range
								planning. These are actual, real targets fueled by real insights. They are made up of
								lots of super-detailed quarterly and annual goals. I don’t spend much time on the
								quarterly goals and instead focus on our so-called “big rocks.”

							<h2 id="bets"><b>On Company Bets</b></h2>
							<p>
								At Spotify, we have something called “Company Bets.” These are large-scale initiatives
								that we believe will have a significant impact on the business within a relatively short
								period of time. I find that these bets are a much better use of my time. Our Company
								Bets typically update every six months, so I'm not needed that much in between. This
								way, I can constantly be thinking: “Where are we headed in the next six months?” Right
								now, I am thinking more about H2 2021. From a timeline perspective, that's the earliest
								place where I focus most of my time.
							</p>
							<p>
								It’s also my role to think far beyond that. For instance, I’m immersing myself in our
								2025 plans. I trust my team to manage the day-to-day, shorter-term initiatives and
								iterate as needed based on data and insights. They’re the best at that and I appreciate
								that this then frees me up to think about the long term.

October 4, 2020 | https://alastairreid.github.io/a-year-of-papers/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://alastairreid.github.io/a-year-of-papers/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>This is an overview of <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/papers">the papers that I have read over the last 12 months</a>
since I <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/joining-google/">joined Google Research</a>.
Over the last year, I have read 122 papers and I have added 364 to my paper
backlog.
You can read <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork">my summaries of all the papers</a>,
read <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes">notes on common themes in the papers</a>,
and download <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/RelatedWork.bib">BibTeX</a> for all the papers.
As the number of papers grew, I reorganized several times and
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork">the site</a> became a bit like a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing">Zettelkasten</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-organize-my-notes-about-papers">How I organize my notes about papers</h2>

<p>I started the year by trying to define a few topics that the papers I read
would fit into and trying to maintain overviews of each topic that linked to
each paper.  This is how I used to organize papers in filing boxes, filing
cabinets, stacks on my desk, etc. but it doesn’t work very well.  The most
obvious reason that it doesn’t work is that some papers span multiple research
topics so, whichever topic I assign them to, it will be wrong.
More seriously though, I am often reading because I don’t understand the field so
how can I possibly know how to organize papers when I first start
reading.
I also found that I was not updating the overviews because each time I read
a paper, I would need to restructure the overview to accomodate what I had just
learned.</p>

<p>After a few months, the original system was starting to fail, and I learned
about the <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing">ZettelKasten</a> method of making
notes about papers and concepts. I have not fully adopted this method
but I have adopted some of the ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If a paper introduces an important looking concept, I create a new
page in my <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes">notes</a> and link the paper to the note.
This avoids duplication of the information and, by adding links to
all the referring pages, it makes it easy to find all the papers
related to the concept.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I vigorously add links between papers and notes: going back to previously
read papers and adding links when I add a new concept.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I rely on the links to define the structure of the site.
That is, I allow topics to emerge and evolve organically as I read
papers instead of trying to impose structure on a topic before
I even understand it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The main way that my approach differs from <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing">ZettelKasten</a> is that
a true ZettelKasten would create notes for every concept whereas
I tend to create notes only if I think multiple papers will link
to the concept.
I should probably follow the ZettelKasten approach more closely
and move a lot of the information I currently put in paper summaries
into notes about concepts.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-read">What I read</h2>

<p>Over the last year, I have mostly been reading about software verification
and security including
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/information-flow/">Information flow control</a>,
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/topics/os/">Operating Systems</a>,
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/topics/tools/">Verification tools</a>,
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/separation-logic/">Separation logic</a> (and, more generally, <a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/permission-logic/">permission logic</a>),
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/rust-language/">The Rust language</a>,
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/fuzz-testing/">Fuzz testing</a>,
the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/BugWorkshop05/">2005 Bugs workshop</a>,
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/property-based-testing/">Property-based testing</a>,
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/test-generation/">Test generation</a>,
and
<a href="https://alastairreid.github.io/RelatedWork/notes/google/">Google</a>
(in, more or less, chronological order).</p>

<p>Each paper links to my summary of the paper.
A few caveats about my summaries:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Paper summaries are written fairly quickly, in a single pass, with little/no revision.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notes about concepts are always in a state of flux and often contain ‘todo’ comments
about how they should be restructured when I find the time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Especially when I am reading about a new topic, the summaries will contain errors
because I don’t understand that topic well enough to write a good summary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Since the summaries are mostly intended to help my understanding they may skip explaining
concepts that I already understand well.
Reading other papers in the same topic may help, or it may not.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The summaries are not a substitute for reading the paper yourself and forming your own
understanding and opinion.
I encourage you to write your own paper summaries and maybe only use my list as one
source of ideas of what to read.</p>

<p>Morning routine has been one of the most important parts of success of the most successful human beings in the world.</p>
<p>Every time I read something about how a proper routine can change once life, I doubt it straight away. </p>
<p>After waking up at 5:00 every day for 2 months I can tell you that it has changed my perspective on my day and goal in general.</p>
<p>You will not be able to wake up early if you have no clear-cut goal or some responsibility. You need to have some commitment.</p>
<p>I want to say straight away that I am writing this out of my personal experience, and I am in no case a licensed professional in any of the fields discussed below.</p>
<p>Most of the information is taken from books and public speeches.</p>
<h2>Morning</h2>
<p>When did you wake up today? 12:00, 10:00, 8:00? It doesn’t matter really at first what time you wake up. You can change your sleeping pattern with in a week.</p>
<p>The main question is, why did you wake up? </p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://i.gyazo.com/ab8642d57411973125786ba8a1e6fcff.jpg"></p>
<h3>Do you have nothing to do at that day and you allowed yourself to sleep in?</h3>
<p>Sometimes you do need to catch up on sleep, but if this type of sleeping behaviour is your norm, you need to change it.</p>
<p>The best way is to make sure you have your week or day planned. If you know what you will be doing and where and when, you will have to prepare and wake up with the correct outlook on the day.</p>
<p>There is no way of being productive when you are doing busy work without actually focusing at most important matters at hand. Those tasks that you don’t want to do, but you will have to do them anyway.</p>
<p>After successful 2 months of waking up correctly, I moved to another country. We did it with my whole family. Since then I had been struggling to wake up as early as 5:00 as I have fewer things to do in the new city that I know of. Mornings lost its structure and so did my sleeping schedule.</p>
<h3>Did you wake up just in time to go to work?</h3>
<p>If you woke up right before work and you only had time to take a shower and eat breakfast(I can probably make a hole post about why having breakfast, launch and dinner is a bad idea) you shoot yourself in the foot as now you only have to do your day job with no ability to grow personally.</p>
<p>Have you noticed what happened right before work and straight after work?</p>
<p>I have. For me, the worst time productivity wise is 30 minutes before a start of a working day and the whole evening after work.</p>
<p>I get no personal growth done in that time. Even time during the launch is a better option for self reflection, studying and creativity.</p>
<p>After work what do you want to do? Unwind, calm down and relax. If I force myself to do more work, I will be crashed the next day with no way of focusing and giving my all to tasks.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that nothing productive gets done after 19:00? You either drink a glass of wine and watch a movie, or you go out with friends and socialise or you get sucked into social media with Instagram/Facebook/<em><strong>Name your social network of choice.</strong></em></p>
<p>That is exactly why I choose to do everything before work. Anything work or socialising related will have to wait until after work when I am only half as engaged.</p>
<p>What would you rather do, think about crazy ideas and being 100% engaged with your friends while regretting that you are not doing any productive work? OR be half as engaged and more relaxed with your friends but with the benefit of knowing that you have done everything that you planned and more. You will know that you DESERVED this relaxation time.</p>
<p>So in order to do anything to grow, you need to <strong>make time</strong> for yourself. </p>
<h3>How to create time for yourself?</h3>
<p>Creating time is by changing your life schedule from unproductive time to sleep, and mornings(the most productive time) to self-growth work.</p>
<p>As an example you work 9:00-17:00. If you used to wake up at 8:00 for work than by getting up at 7:00 you created 1 hour of time that you can spend on anything that you desire.</p>
<p>Do you know that by spending 30 minutes daily on a language grantees you proficiency in 6 months?
Do you know that spending 1 hour daily on a language guarantees fluency in 1 year?</p>
<p>So by just waking up 1 hour early lets you speak 10 new languages in 10 years, is it not worth it?</p>
<p>What if you woke up at 5:00? Isn’t that making time for 3 more hours for <strong>ANYTHING</strong> you want?</p>
<p>You see where I am going with this. Have a reason to wake up early. You get that reason and motivation boost only if you are real with yourself.</p>
<p>As a disclaimer, I am sure each one of us heard about different type of early bird and late bird stereotypes of how humans are. Those are not true. Every human being can make themselves an early bird if needed. What you need to do is go to sleep earlier.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://i.gyazo.com/8d0a2b097cc9fff115d340c1984d261c.jpg"></p>
<h2>Going to Sleep</h2>
<p>Arguably it is the most important time. </p>
<p>In the book Magical Morning there was a research confirming that the thoughts that you have before going to sleep will impact the way you sleep and how you will sleep. The prior thoughts will even have impact on your sleeping cycles giving you more light and low-energy sleep or deep and reenergising.</p>
<p>What you need to do is tell everyone in your surrounding, be it your roommates or parents or a loved one or even children that you need to make time for yourself. That time is at 20:00.</p>
<p>I usually lie in bed strictly at 20:00 and I put all the devices away. If I am travelling I also set an alarm on my phone.</p>
<p>After that I set an alarm on my sundial alarm clock, the clock that imitates the rise of sun 30 minutes before the scheduled alarm so that it is much easier to wake up as the body aligns the natural clock of the body with wake up time. I will for sure write another post on this.</p>
<p>This routine tells my body that I will sleep very well and that there is no reason to worry. Just go to sleep and you will be energised.</p>
<p>After that I start reading a book of my own. It has to be fantasy or some novel that I like but has no deep history or self-growth type plot. It needs to take worries of you, not put more in.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I am feeling extra energised or in the bad mood, I choose to make myself some tea. Usually camomile but sometimes black tea.</p>
<p>Combination of each of this small things allows me to fall asleep and feel amazing before and after it.</p>
<p>The way you wake up is going to be the way you felt when going to sleep.</p>
<p>Try this today. Before going to sleep, think about something that makes you happy and say out loud(preferably) that you will feel energised and happy when you wake up.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="https://i.gyazo.com/fe628a4a27a515ebe9fca9d76105cf4e.jpg"></p>
<p><a href="https://klimy.co/blog/twitter.com/yadrintsevklim">Tweet at me how you felt.</a></p>
<h2>Weekend is More Time for yourself</h2>
<p>Remind yourself, after a busy week was there a weekend after which you felt even more tired? If yes than that means that probably you do not know how to spend your free time efficiently.</p>
<p>How do you spend your weekends? Is it relaxation without any particular plan?</p>
<p>I will need to write a full blog post on this as well but just remember. Waking up early in the weekend and planning your time of relaxation is going to give you an extra week each week. You will feel that the weekends are too long and you wouldn’t be able to wait until you can do your work.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, I hope I helped with my personal takes and experiences. All of this I got from studying the way very successful people behave in the mornings and why.</p>
<p>Cheers

<p>It’s been brought to the attention of many people in the game development industry that you can use fibers to parallelize your engines and games. This one presentation in particular:
  <a href="http://twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/gdc2015/presentations/Gyrling_Christian_Parallelizing_The_Naughty.pdf">Parallelizing the Naughty Dog engine using fibers</a> has been a talking point since it came out in 2015. However, it doesn’t quite go into the details enough to really explain why fibers are a good fit or how to actually implement them. In my pursuit to educate myself and take a stab at implementing them, I’ve concluded that there’s a distinctive lack of good information online. In response to the lack of literature on this topic, I’ve decided to explain it from multiple angles, and provide less known information on the subject. This document serves as a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourcebook">Sourcebook</a> for those who really want to determine if it’s a right fit for them and how to go about actually doing it.</p>
<h2 id="disambiguation-of-terms">
  Disambiguation of terms.
  <a href="#disambiguation-of-terms">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Before we get started I want to define three distinctive terms.</p>
<ul>
<li>OS-thread (the thread given to us by the OS)</li>
<li>Hardware-thread (the actual physical thread on a CPU)</li>
<li>Fiber-thread (the thread of execution that is our fiber)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-fibers">
  What are fibers?
  <a href="#what-are-fibers">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Fibers are a lightweight thread of execution similar to OS threads. However, unlike OS threads, they’re cooperatively scheduled as opposed to preemptively scheduled. What this means in plain English is that fibers <em>yield</em> themselves to allow another fiber to run. You may have used something similar to this in your programming language of choice where it’s typically called a <em>coroutine</em>, there’s no real distinction between coroutines and fibers other than that coroutines are usually a language-level construct, while fibers tend to be a systems-level concept.</p>
<p>Other names for fibers you may have heard before include:</p>
<ul>
<li>green threads</li>
<li>user-space threads</li>
<li>coroutines</li>
<li>tasklets</li>
<li>microthreads</li>
</ul>
<p>There are very few and minor differences between fibers and the above list. For the purposes of this document, we should consider them equivalent as the distinctions don’t quite matter.</p>
<h2 id="scheduling">
  Scheduling
  <a href="#scheduling">#</a>
</h2>
<p>At any given moment the OS is running multiple processes all with their own OS threads. All of those OS threads need to be making forward progress. There’s two classes of thought when it comes to how you solve this problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking">Cooperative scheduling</a></li>
<li>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemption_%28computing%29">Preemptive scheduling</a></li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important to note that while you may observe that all processes and OS threads are running in parallel, scheduling is really providing the <em>illusion</em> of that. Not all threads are running in parallel, the scheduler is just switching between them quickly enough that it appears everything is running in parallel. That is they’re <em>concurrent</em>. Threads start, run, and complete in an <em>interleaved</em> fashion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is possible for multiple OS threads to be running in parallel with
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing">symmetric multiprocessing</a> (SMP) where they’re mapped to multiple hardware threads, but only as many hardware threads as the CPU physically has.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="premptive-scheduling">
  Premptive scheduling
  <a href="#premptive-scheduling">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Most people familiar with threads know that you don’t have to <strong>yield</strong> to other threads to allow them to run. This is because most operating systems (OS) schedule threads <strong>preemptively</strong>.</p>
<p>The points at which the OS may decide to preempt a thread include:</p>
<ul>
<li>IO</li>
<li>sleeps</li>
<li>waits (seen in locking primitives)</li>
<li>interrupts (hardware events mostly)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first three in particular are often expressed by an application as a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call">system call</a>. These system calls cause the CPU to cease executing the current code and execute the OS’s code registered for that system call. This allows the OS to service the request then resume execution of your application’s calling thread, or another thread entierly.</p>
<p>This is possible because the OS will decide at one of the points listed above to save all the relevant state of that thread then resume some other thread, the idea being that when this thread can run again, the OS can reinstate that thread and continue executing it like nothing ever happened. These transition points where the OS switches a thread are called
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch">context switches</a>.</p>
<p>There’s a cost associated with this context switching and all modern operating systems have made great deals of effort to reduce this cost as much as possible. Unfortunately, that overhead begins to show itself when you have <em>a lot</em> of threads. In addition, recent cache
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">side channel attacks</a> like:
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_%28security_vulnerability%29">Spectre</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meltdown_%28security_vulnerability%29">Meltdown</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_%28security_vulnerability%29">Spoiler</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreshadow_%28security_vulnerability%29">Foreshadow</a>, and
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitectural_Data_Sampling">Microarchitectural Data Sampling</a> on modern processors has led to a series of both user-space and kernel-space mitigation strategies, some of which increased the overhead of context switches significantly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can read more about context switching overhead in
  <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/expcs07/papers/2-li.pdf">this paper</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cooperative-scheduling">
  Cooperative scheduling
  <a href="#cooperative-scheduling">#</a>
</h3>
<p>This idea of fibers yielding to each other is what is known as cooperative scheduling. Fibers effectively move the idea of context switching from kernel-space to user-space and then make those switches a fundamental part of computation, that is, they’re a deliberate and explicitly done thing, by the fibers themselves. The benefit of this is that a lot of the previously mentioned overhead can be entierly eliminated while still permitting an excess count of threads of execution, just in the form of these fibers now.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-multi-threading">
  The problem with multi-threading
  <a href="#the-problem-with-multi-threading">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There’s many problems related to multi-threading, most obviously that it’s difficult to get right. Most proponents of fibers make false claims about how this problem goes away when you use fibers because you don’t have parallel threads of execution. Instead, you have these cooperatively scheduled fibers which yield to each other. This means it’s not possible to
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition">race data</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock">dead lock</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock#Livelock">live lock</a>, etc. While this statement is true when you look at fibers as a N:1 proposition, the story is entierly different when you introduce M:N.</p>
<h3 id="n1-and-what-it-means">
  N:1 and what it means
  <a href="#n1-and-what-it-means">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Most documentation, libraries, and tutorials on fibers are almost exclusively based around using a single thread given to you by the OS, then sharing it among multiple fibers that cooperatively yield and run all your asynchronous code. This is called N:1 (“N to one”). <code>N</code> fibers to <code>1</code> thread, and it’s the most prevalent form of fibers. This is how Lua coroutines work, how Javascript’s and Python’s async/await work, and it’s <strong>not what you’re interested in</strong> doing if you actually want to take advantage of hardware threads. What you’re interested in is M:N, (“M to N”) <code>M</code> fibers to <code>N</code> threads.</p>
<h3 id="mn-and-what-it-means">
  M:N and what it means
  <a href="#mn-and-what-it-means">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The idea behind M:N is to take the model given to us by N:1 and map it to multiple actual OS threads. Just like we’re familiar to the concept of thread pools where we execute tasks, here we have a pool of threads where we execute fibers and those fibers get to yield more of themselves on that thread.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I should stress that M:N fibers have all the usual problems of multi-threading. You still need to syncronize access to resources shared between multiple fibers because there’s still multiple threads.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-thread-pools">
  The problem with thread pools
  <a href="#the-problem-with-thread-pools">#</a>
</h2>
<p>A lot of you may be wondering how this is different from traditional task based parallelism choices seen in many game engines and applications. The model where you have a fixed-size pool of threads you queue tasks on to be executed at some point in the future by one of those threads.</p>
<h3 id="locality-of-reference">
  Locality of reference
  <a href="#locality-of-reference">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The first problem is <em>locality of reference</em>. The data-oriented / cache-aware programmers reading this will have to mind my overloading of that phrase because what I’m really talking about is the resources that a job needs access to are usually local. The job isn’t going to be executed immediately, but rather when the thread pool has a chance to. Any resource that job needs access to, needs to be available for the job at some point in the future. This means local values need their lifetime’s extended for an undefined amount of time.</p>
<p>There’s many ways to solve this lifetime problem, except they all have overhead. Consider this trivial example where I want to asynchronously upload a local file to a webserver</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>upload_file</span>(<span>const</span> String<span>&amp;</span> filename) {
  thread_pool<span>-&gt;</span>add_job([<span>&amp;</span>] {
    <span>auto</span> file <span>=</span> open_file(filename);
    <span>auto</span> data <span>=</span> read_file(file);
    post_binary_data(data);
  });
}
</code></pre></div><p>Do you see the bug?</p>
<p>The issue is that the string passed to <code>upload_file</code>, i.e the local <code>filename</code>, only has a lifetime of the body of the function. When this function returns, <code>filename</code> no longer is a valid string. However, at some point this lambda function will be executed and try to access <code>filename</code> in it’s local context and it’ll be a dangling reference by then.</p>
<p>This can be surprsing to those more familiar with dynamic languages, since they support this functionality with something called a closure. The closure will actually extend the lifetime of <code>filename</code>. In native languages like C or C++ though, this isn’t the case and all lifetime extension needs to be done explicitly with obvious runtime which introduces overhead.</p>
<p>What you could do is <strong>copy</strong> the string. The copy will then have the lifetime of the lambda. However, if we had a much larger resource to share with this job that couldn’t be as cheaply copied, we would have to use something like a <strong>reference count</strong> instead. As you can see, the solutions to the resource problem involve a great deal of overhead in many cases and requires you to really think and reason about lifetimes here when you didn’t have to, nor should you have to.</p>
<p>We’re experiencing a lot of friction here already and it’s only a few lines of code. My personal rule of thumb is if you find yourself experiencing friction like this, it’s usually indicative of bad design and the problem needs to be rethought.</p>
<h3 id="nested-induced-deadlocks">
  Nested induced deadlocks
  <a href="#nested-induced-deadlocks">#</a>
</h3>
<p>The other significant problem with thread pools is what I call <em>nested induced deadlocks</em>. No matter how you slice and dice it, jobs are going to want to schedule other jobs and need the result before they themselves can continue.</p>
<p>Let me set up a real world example because it’s easier to …</p></article></div>

So I thought I might as well compile that list for others to use. If you are not familiar with AutoML <a href="https://www.danrose.ai/blog/automl-is-it-useful">read this post</a> for a quick introduction and pros and cons.</p><p>I haven’t been able to test them all and make a proper review, so this is just a comparison based on features. I tried to pick the features that felt most important to me, but it might not be the most important for you. If you think some features are missing or if you know an AutoML solution that should be on the list, just let me know.</p><p>Before we go to the list I’d just quickly go through the features and how I interpret them.</p><h3>Features<br></h3><p><strong>Deployment</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Some solutions can be auto deployed directly to the cloud with a one-click deployment.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
    <div id="intro">
      <div>
        <div>
          <div>
            
            <p>We are happy to announce LibrePCB 0.1.5 with several long awaited new features
in the library-, schematic- and board editors!</p>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<h4 id="copypaste-in-schematic--and-board-editors">Copy&amp;Paste in Schematic- and Board Editors</h4>
<p>Finally the clipboard functionality cut, copy and paste are available in the
schematic- and board editors
(<a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/724">#724</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/754">#754</a>)! Just use the keyboard
shortcuts Ctrl+X to cut, Ctrl+C to copy and Ctrl+V to paste schematic- or board
items. In the board editor, it’s even possible to paste polygons copied from a
footprint in the library editor.</p>
<h4 id="usability-improvements-in-all-editors">Usability Improvements In All Editors</h4>
<p>This release contains a lot of usability improvements, which makes creating
library elements, schematics and boards much easier. Especially drawing traces
and placing vias was one of the weaknesses of LibrePCB – until now! The tools
to draw traces and place vias have been heavily improved, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traces snap to pads and vias even if they are off the grid</li>
<li>The layer can be switched while drawing a trace, vias are inserted
automatically</li>
<li>Vias automatically take the closest net while placing</li>
<li>Inserted vias are automatically connected to the traces underneath</li>
<li>Trace and via properties can be changed with keyboard shortcuts while drawing
a trace</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://librepcb.org/img/board_editor_draw_trace.gif"><img src="https://librepcb.org/img/board_editor_draw_trace.gif" alt="Draw Trace"></a></p>
<p>Another inconvenience was that the outline of planes and polygons could only
be modified by specifying the exact vertex coordinates. Now this is much easier
since vertices can be moved, inserted and removed graphically right in the
editors.</p>

					<div><h4>Why does online privacy matter?</h4><p><span>Privacy is a means of protecting yourself from exploitation by actors who are using your data in ways that are often not disclosed to you. And this isn’t just at the individual level – we need to think about privacy and its impact on our communities, neighbourhoods and countries.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>One of the things that should matter to us is thinking about what kind of behaviours does data collection at this scale encourage, what kind of societies does this create? What information is being served to us that shapes how we conceive of the world around us? How have we been living under the guise of democracy since so much power has been amassed under Facebook and Google, for example? Can we really call that democracy? Or is this a techno-authoritarian state-of-being that we’re living through?</span></p><h4><b>What do you think are the biggest risks to online data privacy at the moment?&nbsp;</b></h4><p><span>I think our understanding of data privacy at a general level is quite one dimensional. I don’t think that we necessarily have the right tools or education to fully understand. We’re not just talking about what is convenient, we’re talking about people’s ability to access information, about economic rights, about questions around life and death for especially vulnerable populations, many of whom rely on anonymous identities. That’s one of the major risks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Another risk is the concentration of the means to classify individuals, which is done by a handful of tech giants and data brokers. That’s a determining factor of how you’re treated and what information you’re served. And then thirdly, is the fact that our behaviour and data make up lucrative business models.</span></p><p><span>I don’t think this is just about awareness. Even though The Social Dilemma [a new documentary on Netflix that Amnesty International was involved with] does a great job at creating awareness, it’s not like we weren’t aware that this could happen. Cambridge Analytica happened not too long ago. The Snowden revelations also happened not too long ago. But are you someone who believes that you are fundamentally affected by how your data is surveilled? Does this have a consequence in your everyday life? Those are the questions that will impact how we think about data and tech.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><b>You’ve also spoken about the dangers of surveillance technology – particularly facial recognition software. How do you think the Covid-19 pandemic has shifted the public view on tracking technologies?&nbsp;</b></h4><p><span>Global emergencies are conditions under which states of exception become possible. During the pandemic, we’ve seen a rollout of contact tracing, we’ve seen a rollout of not just facial recognition, but also in some contexts emotion recognition, and really quite diverse forms of biometric identification that we haven’t really seen used at the scale before. Covid-19 has almost created an innovation race for surveillance technologies. However, that crisis element also intersects with our nature to adapt and move on and try to make normal what we can in exceptional circumstances. Before we know it, the invasive measures that were put into place during the pandemic could outlive it. I think the contact tracing debate has opened a lot more discourse around this issue, but it’s not at the same level as the response to the Cambridge Analytica scandal or the Snowden revelations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We had those great debates. Those debates were never settled. They made us worried, but at some point, we just accepted that some surveillance is ongoing. Things like contact tracing risks significantly stifling our ability to freely move. There are so many things that can go wrong when you’re dealing with a centralised means of controlling people’s movement. The ways in which these technologies can be used are not kept in check. And I think that is one of my biggest grievances around contract tracing and around facial recognition. But we won’t have the kinds of regulatory frameworks that we need as long as there isn’t outrage at the scale that we saw before.</span></p></div>

					<div><h4>Talking about outrage, it was interesting to see the uproar over the A Level results fiasco recently – where else are algorithms being used that we might not be aware of?&nbsp;</h4><p><span>There are many other contexts to think about. The A Levels moment gave some hope to the cynical minds of people like myself who are waiting for people to challenge this notion of deferring human judgment to a machine. Algorithms are often used to quantify unquantifiable things, and where there should really be a more extensive consultative process of figuring out what the truth is and how to best respond.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There was another example recently in the Netherlands, where a particular algorithm was used to try and predict who was more likely to commit tax fraud and used dual citizenship as a variable. That largely resulted in it finding that people with dual nationality, often ethnic minorities, were committing tax fraud even though there was no evidence to say so. Other examples are predictive policing, which tends to double down on existing prejudice, and welfare assessments, which often come down to indicators designed to encourage reductive decision-making, rather than augmenting the expertise of a caseworker or social worker.&nbsp;</span></p><h4>You recently co-authored a book called <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/digital-witness-9780198836070?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;">Digital Witness</a> about using open source information for human rights investigation and accountability. I wondered what your thoughts are around whether technology leaves people more open to human rights abuses when it comes to the use of their data?&nbsp;</h4><p><span>I don’t think that we can make an unequivocal assertion that technology leaves people open to greater human rights abuses. They do. Of course they do. But they also lead to greater ways for people to contest oppressive power relations and systems that are authoritarian. Contexts in which we’ve used technology to accomplish that includes Amnesty’s reporting on war crimes, human rights atrocities and crimes against humanity. Some of the same technologies that allow for heavy surveillance and the abuse of human rights, also enable the effective pursuit and fight for human rights.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So I do think it’s double edged. I think the way that we shift that dial is by challenging the circumstances under which these technologies exist. Technology should not be operating according to a surveillance business model, which privileges the abuses of human rights over the fight for them.&nbsp; Does the tech industry have to be based on generating an income from our online behaviour and the data that we share, in ways that we don’t always understand? Are we willing to accept that society should be commodified in this way? In lots of ways, this is an exercise in imagining a different world. One we should not shy away from.</span></p><h4>Do big technology companies have a responsibility to be more ethical when it comes to handling our data?&nbsp;</h4><p><span>I think social media platforms tend to rely on the language of ethics to justify their model. Ethics can do a lot to steer the conversation in the right direction and there are incredible digital ethicists, scholars and activists out there doing fantastic work on this. However, my fear is that it can also be a normalising discourse when deployed from within the corporate responsibility side of things, where there is very little accountability.</span></p><p><span>It’s taken for granted, for example, that these asymmetric relations of power are birthed by tech and merely need a tech fix in order to be corrected, which is simply not enough from my perspective. Not only do we need social media platforms to do better when it comes to ethical practice, but at the same time we need stronger and stricter regulation that acknowledges the structural inequities within which the technology industry is embedded.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em>Your data should not be for sale. We’re taking Oracle and Salesforce to court for illegally selling millions of peoples data and we need your help! If you believe that tech giants should be held accountable for their use of people’s data please <span><strong>support our claim by “liking” our support button. </strong></span></em></p><p><em>We’re fighting for change, because your privacy matters.&nbsp;</em></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24679435">Q&amp;A on Hacker News about this project</a></p>
<p>As we're driving out to our launch site in Leesburg, VA, my wife turns to me and asks, "did you intentionally wear a yellow and blue striped rugby shirt to match your yellow and blue striped rocket?" I look down, and realize that, yes I had indeed accidentally dressed exactly like my rocket. I wonder if that ever happens to Elon?</p>
<h2>Launches</h2>
<p><img src="https://johnjonesfour.com/images/rocket/launch.jpg" alt="Launch images"></p>
<p>Very special thank you to my exceptionally patient wife who tagged along, captured these great pictures, and ended up actually having a lot of fun with her very nerdy husband.</p>
<p>Ida Lee Park in Leesburg, VA allows rocket launches up to 400 feet with a permit, so I applied earlier in September for an October 3rd launch and received fast approval. With the day upon us, my wife and I made the 40 minute drive to Leesburg (apparently in uniform?), set up in our designated part of the park, and got to work.</p>
<h3>Launch 1</h3>
<p><img src="https://johnjonesfour.com/images/rocket/telemetry.gif" alt="Telemetry"></p>
<p><img src="https://johnjonesfour.com/images/rocket/launch1.png" alt="Launch 1"></p>
<p>The first launch was a huge success. The rocket reached 110.3 meters (~362 feet), which beat my simulation's prediction of 90 meters, and it reached a peak velocity of 41.69 meters per second (~93 mph) at 1.44 seconds into the flight. We can see the rocket started to descend very quickly after apogee, and the chute deployed successfully 7.5 seconds into the flight. From there, the chute allowed for a linear rate of descent to a gentle field landing.</p>
<h3>Launch 2</h3>
<p><img src="https://johnjonesfour.com/images/rocket/launch2.png" alt="Launch 2"></p>
<p>Launch 2 was less of a success. While the ascent went smoothly, telemetry was lost 4.57 seconds into flight and the ejection charge ripped the shock cord causing the two rocket components to separate with no parachute to slow their descent. This incident also knocked out the battery cable causing inboard video and data capture to also fail. Unfortunately no video data could be recovered.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p><img src="https://johnjonesfour.com/images/rocket/recovery.jpg" alt="Rocket after launch"></p>
<p>The second launch revealed three major issues that need to be resolved: </p>
<ol>
<li>The shock cord is not strong enough to absorb the force caused by separation, likely because of how heavy the payload is. In a future upgrade I will need to double-up the cords OR use two parachutes for each component to let them descend separately.</li>
<li>When the payload section hit the ground, it drove the coupler way into the body tube. Upon impact, the battery bracket absorbed the force and shattered. However all of the electronics survived. Part of the coupler also broke off when I attempted to pull the it out of the payload section, so this will all need to be redesigned to better absorb hard landings.</li>
<li>There must be a buffer that holds a certain amount of camera footage before saving it to disk. Because the battery disconnected in-flight, no flight video saved. I'd like to figure out how to write video data more frequently in case the battery issue happens again.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to those major issues, I'd also like to make the following improvements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The software performed well, but I'd still like to increase the data capture rate. There are Adafruit libraries for the components I'm using in C++, so I'm considering rewriting <code>air.py</code> in C++, but I'd really love it if someone talked me out of that.</li>
<li>Between launches I manually rebooted the ground computer so that it would clear the visualizations and start logging to a new file. To make this easier, I plan to add the option to the dashboard to start new "capture sessions" without needing to restart the system.</li>
</ol></div></div>]]>

</p></div></div><div><p>These little humans sure are cute, but they are not able to look after themselves. They are slow. They are weak. They are not very clever. They <strong><em>need</em></strong> other people to take care of them if they are to survive. [And I really want you to think about the word need here. I'm not using it in the casual sense, like "I need a glass of water" or "I need those new shoes" etc. I'm using it in its strongest possible sense. As if you found yourself trapped underwater, you would quickly start to scramble your way to the surface because you and your body know you <strong><em>need</em></strong> air to survive. Or if you had been walking in the desert for days you would <em>actually</em> <strong><em>need</em></strong><em> </em>that glass of water, in a way that you normally don't.]</p></div><div><p>So the problem the species faces is: given that every single human out there starts off needing the care and protection of other people, <strong>how do I maximise the probability that weak little humans keep their caregivers around (and keep their caregivers happy, or at least keep them paying enough attention that the little humans survive)?</strong>
</p></div><div><p>And the brain has an excellent solution, or rather a solution that works perfectly well given the limitations on the infant brain. </p></div><div><p>Let's first imagine you were an adult and you had this same problem, you could <strong><em>think</em></strong><em> </em>about what the other person wants and <strong><em>act</em></strong><em> </em>in a way that might keep them around. It might be a bit annoying to feign interest in what an uninteresting person says, or to keep the conversation light with someone you know to be easily irritable, but it would be a primarily intellectual exercise - i.e. you would have an internal monologue saying "oh my gosh, this person is soooooo boring" or "damn, this person is so touchy", a comfortable separation between your external expressions and your internal emotions - so while it would be a bit annoying, it (hopefully) wouldn't be too stressful. </p></div><div><div>

</p></div></div><div><p>Little kids "hiding"*. <em>They can't see you, so how could you see them?! </em>Little kids do not have very good "<a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/theory-of-mind-4176826">theory of mind</a>", that is the psychological term for ability to think about someone else's mental state. It normally develops seriously between the ages of three and five, and even though that sounds like it's very on in life, it still leaves a healthy chunk of time before it's present; a time when you are at your most vulnerable. So if an infant <strong>can't think</strong> well, it<strong> can't act</strong> well. So the intellectual exercise method (described above) of keeping people there is too big of a risk for the species when it's dealing with its infants. Very little kids can't be trusted to keep themselves alive using that plan, and being alive is what the species wants**</p></div><div><p>*<em>This is a slightly exaggerated example, as I have read that when things are really scary and kids do need to hide, they can do so effectively - but the point about lower levels of cognition when it comes to intellectually predicting the behaviour/thoughts of others is very much true. The "hiding" is just a neat visual example. </em>
</p></div><div><p>**I'm using the "wants" of the species to represent the general theme of evolution: species tend to optimise for their own survival.</p></div><div><p>So, another plan is needed. And that plan, unfortunately for the adult versions of us that are forced to deal with its consequences, is a distortion of the emotional map.</p></div><div><p>The process behind this is quite simple. In the same way that it would be <strong>extremely</strong> stressful if you were trapped underwater, missing the air you <strong>need </strong>to breath, as an infant it is <strong>extremely</strong> stressful if you feel the caregiver you <strong>need </strong>to take care of you is not able to do so in a way that feels right. And the magical trick the infant brain pulls is to attach moments of high stress to deep memory formation***. It does this by filling our brains with certain neurotransmitters (chemicals that help our brains and body adjust to what is going on) when we are stressed, and, as well making our mind's and our body's reaction appropriate, these neurotransmitters result in memories being created.</p></div><div><p>I am sorry this is so long winded, but we must pause for a moment to discuss what memories mean in this context too. I am not talking about your "first memory", I'm talking about a basic reaction forming in your brain. The type of reaction you naturally develop when you burn yourself with a candle flame; flame = bad, avoiding flame = good. It hurts, it's stressful, so don't do it.</p></div><div><p>So now we are about to get to the interesting stuff, and the stuff that <em>might</em> relate to your situation. Let's say you have a parent who (because of their own strange internal stresses and confusions) can't help but overreact when a child is "bad", and is therefore nice and calm when the child is "good". Even though it might look innocent enough from the outside, as the infant <strong>needs</strong> contented caregivers, the overreaction is going to feel traumatic. A break down in the relationship needed for survival; like someone turning the air off. Traumatic moments mean high stress, and we know that high stress means memory formation. If this pattern of behaviour repeats (the caregiver always acts this way when you are "bad"), this is going to teach the child a very strong lesson: you being bad causes terrible stress ðŸ˜°, and you being good means things calm ðŸ˜Š; being bad is forbidden, and being good is the only thing that's accepted.</p></div><div><p><strong>We can watch all this play out on our emotional map:</strong></p></div><div><p>Let's say that the map had territory which made it like so:</p></div><div><div>

She reiterated the importance of physical distancing, proper hand hygiene and mask-wearing, and attempted to&nbsp;dispel any&nbsp;notion&nbsp;that a vaccine will make life go back to the way it was in a couple of months.</p>  <p>"We can't at this stage just put all of our focus [on a vaccine] in the hopes that this is the silver bullet solution," said Tam.</p>  <p>"We're going to have to manage this pandemic certainly over the next year, but certainly [we are]&nbsp;planning for the longer term of the next two to three years during which the vaccine may play a role but we don't know yet."</p>  <p>Tam said it's unclear at this stage how effective a vaccine will be. She said key questions remain about the degree and duration of immunity a vaccine will provide, the dosage that will be needed&nbsp;and whether it will prevent people from getting infected altogether or simply prevent severe illness requiring hospitalization.</p>  <h2>More than 150&nbsp;under development</h2>  <p>There are <a href="https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/coronavirusvaccinetracker/">more than 166 vaccines</a> at various stages of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/vaccine-clinical-trials-1.5580436">preclinical and clinical (human) testing</a>&nbsp;across the globe right now, the World Health Organization says. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/us-azar-vaccine-global-supply-1.5571264">U.S.</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/coronavirus-vaccine-1.5569165">European</a> experts say under an optimistic scenario, the first of those vaccines could complete testing and get approval for distribution next year.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Tam warned that even once a vaccine is tested and deemed to be both safe and effective, there will be challenges with distributing it widely to those who need it.</p>  <p>"It's likely that there won't be enough vaccines for the population," said Tam. "So there'll be prioritization and we're looking at that."</p>  <p>Tam said she agreed with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the&nbsp;top infectious disease specialist in the U.S., who told Congress last week that he was "cautiously optimistic" that a safe and effective vaccine will be available by the end of the year.</p>  <p>Despite that, she said&nbsp;public health officials are planning for a scenario in which measures that have been put in place thus far, including physical distancing to limiting crowd sizes,&nbsp;could be required even after a vaccine is found.</p>  <p>"[A vaccine] is one important layer of protection," said Tam. "It is a very important solution if we get a safe and effective vaccine,&nbsp;but I would say that the public health measures that we have in place&nbsp;— the sort of personal, daily measures that we take — is going to have to continue."</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH: Tam on&nbsp;how Canadians should psychologically prepare for the future:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div role="button" tabindex="0" title="Tam questioned about how Canadians should psychologically prepare for the future"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/385/450/ftr%20TAM%20looking%20forward_frame_167.jpg" alt=""></p></div></div></div><span>Canada's chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam spoke with reporters, including the CBC's Tom Parry on Parliament Hill Tuesday.<!-- --> <!-- -->2:19</span></span></span></p>  <h2>Recommends masks for children over 10</h2>  <p>Tam said one of the busiest areas of planning for officials&nbsp;is the reopening of schools in September, for which,&nbsp;she said, the Public Health Agency of Canada will be publishing detailed guidelines later this week.</p>  <p>The guidelines will include a recommendation that children over the age of 10 be required to wear masks, said Tam, in French. Extra consideration should be given for children under the age of 10, she said.</p>  <p>"The recommendations will undergo evolution as the evidence changes and we'll also have to see what happens as we understand transmission in different age groups&nbsp;and what happens in schools." said Tam. "We may have to adapt this recommendation as we go along."</p>    <p>Tam also addressed criticism of another layer of protection the federal government rolled out last week&nbsp;— the COVID Alert exposure notification app&nbsp;— which is meant to tell users if their phones have recently been close to a phone registered to someone who volunteers that they've tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>  <p>The app&nbsp;works only on phones released in the last five years or so because it needs a relatively recent operating system.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/covid-alert-app-accessibility-1.5672881">Critics say that will leave out poorer and older Canadians</a>, who are more likely to use older devices and suffer worse effects from the virus.</p>  <p>Tam said&nbsp;the app is&nbsp;one of many tools available to fight the pandemic, and that people should use them even if they aren't perfect.</p>  <p>"Despite these gaps, we need to have a go at using it," said Tam. "As many people who can download it and use it as possible will make the app more successful."</p>  <p>The government said Monday that more than 1.1 million people had downloaded the app.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

									<p>At least five bar owners in Grenoble, France have been arrested for providing WiFi at their businesses without keeping logs. The bar owners were arrested under a 2006 law that technically classifies WiFi hotspot providing establishments as ISPs, and requires them to store one year’s worth of logs or connection records for anti-terrorism purposes. This requirement is in place even if the WiFi network is password protected.</p>
<p>The law No. 2006-64&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/des-patrons-de-bars-en-garde-a-vue-a-cause-du-wi-fi-offert-a-leurs-clients_AN-202009290142.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extends</a>&nbsp;the traditional ISP logging requirements “to all persons who, in respect of an activity primary or secondary professional, offer the public a connection allowing on-line communication via network access, including free of charge.” Violating this crime means that the owner of a small cafe that offers WiFi to patrons could face up to one year in prison and up to a 75,000 euro fine.</p>
<h2>All businesses in France providing WiFi to the public are required to log</h2>
<p>That all public WiFi hotspots in France are required by law to be logging shouldn’t be too surprising.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/des-patrons-de-bars-en-garde-a-vue-a-cause-du-wi-fi-offert-a-leurs-clients_AN-202009290142.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BFM Business</a>&nbsp;noted that most large providers of free WiFi like hotels, conference centers, airports, and such do so with business packages that include this logging. However, it seems that most people aren’t aware that even small businesses like bars, cafes, nightclubs, and restaurants that offer WiFi to their patrons are faced with these logging requirements. One of the arrested bar owners noted that the relevant organization, Umih, never noted this requirement when renewing his license:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Nobody, not even the professionals of Umih who provide compulsory training as part of a license IV resumption, to me never said I should keep this history.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to questions by BFM Business, Umih admitted that the training doesn’t mention WiFi logging but noted that Umih members should have known about this important requirement because it was mentioned in a newsletter.</p>
<p>If anything, this piece of dystopian news highlights the state of surveillance in France and the desperate need for online privacy there, as well. Small business owners in France need to make sure that they are in compliance with the laws; similarly, public WiFi users in France need to make sure they never connect without a VPN.</p>

Not more. </p><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2864034/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2864034/</a></p><blockquote><strong>Working memory storage capacity</strong> is important because cognitive tasks can be completed only with sufficient ability to hold information as it is processed. The ability to repeat information depends on task demands but can be distinguished from a more constant, underlying mechanism: <strong>a central memory store limited to 3 to 5 meaningful items in young adults.</strong> </blockquote><p>For music production this means that you should have at max 4 main elements. </p><p>A typical combination could look like this: </p><ol><li><strong>Rhythm:</strong> Kick + Percussion</li><li><strong>Lead:</strong> Vox/Synth/etc.</li><li><strong>Melody:</strong> Bass/Pads/etc.</li></ol><p>Many times a track will have more elements, but the idea is to understand which sounds are the most important ones.</p><p>It's a good rule of thumb to think about relative importance of elements. Focus most of your time on them.</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> This helps to avoid too many elements competing in similar frequency bands <em>(example: vox; guitar; piano; synth in the same Hz range)</em>.</p><hr><h3 id="-2-a-little-goes-a-long-way">#2 "A Little Goes a Long Way"</h3><p>Listen and trust your ears. </p><p>When making changes in the arrangement, mix, or master it is usually enough to make a small change.</p><blockquote>One of the biggest mistakes people make is that they change too much and it tilts the balance of the entire track. Then you have to rework again. That's why 'a little goes a long way'.</blockquote><hr><h3 id="-3-an-instrument-is-a-combination-of-many-sounds">#3 An Instrument Is a Combination of Many Sounds</h3><blockquote>Many people think that an instrument is only composed of a single sound, but <strong>that's an illusion</strong>. Think of a guitar, it is a combination of the following sounds: the pick hitting the string, the hand grabbing the frets, the vibration of the string, the vibration of the guitar's body, and so much more.</blockquote><p>Once you understand the various frequency ranges at which each instrument works you can start to play with those to create the desired sound.</p><p>A great primer for this concept is the video below:</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wx_kugSemfY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><hr><h3 id="-4-something-for-the-hip-and-something-for-the-head">#4 "Something for the Hip and Something for the Head"</h3><p>You can think about music in two basic layers: </p><ol><li><strong>[</strong>Foundation<strong>] Something for the Hip:</strong> A groove and rhythm that makes you want to dance and shake your booty. Usually it is the kick drum, the percussive elements and the bass sounds. </li><li><strong>[</strong>Embellishment<strong>] Something for the Head:</strong> Melodic elements that make your head pay attention. Usually it is the vocals/vox, keys, string instruments, synthesizers, etc.</li></ol><hr><h3 id="-5-tension-release">#5 Tension &amp; Release</h3><p>Tension and release is my favorite principle, since it has many applications beyond music:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/george__mack/status/1292206039576780806?s=20">Professional/physical performance</a></li><li>Physical exercise</li><li>Negotiation</li><li><a href="https://www.duarte.com/presentation-skills-resources/move-presentation-audience-with-story-techniques-in-presentations/">Story telling</a></li><li><em>... the list goes on</em></li></ul><p>For music you can think about tension and release in the following terms: </p><ul><li><strong>Composition:</strong> Harmonic sequences that form a story <em>(watch the video below for a good introduction👇)</em></li><li><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> Soft vs. harsh instrument; deep vs. high pitch; left vs. right <em>(= panning)</em></li><li><strong>Arrangement:</strong> Verse/Chorus vs. Intro/Outro/Bridge/Breaks</li><li><strong>Mixing:</strong> Compression of sounds <em>(release)</em> based on trigger inputs <em>(tension)</em></li></ul><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eRkgK4jfi6M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><hr><h2 id="techniques-practical-insights-for-music-production">Techniques: Practical Insights for Music Production</h2><p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdUXHZU8dSs">basic understanding</a> of mixing is required to understand the content below.</p><h3 id="-1-mixing-sequence-and-focus">#1 Mixing Sequence and Focus</h3><p>Similar to the first principle <em>(<strong>#1 Identify the Main Elements of the Track</strong>)</em> you should focus most of your time mixing the main elements.</p><p>You would do that like so: </p><ol><li>Identify main elements</li><li>Group similar elements <em>(e.g. Kick + off-Kick)</em> into Sub-/Mixing-Groups</li><li>Start mixing <em>(levels; compression; FX; etc.)</em> those main elements and mute all other tracks</li><li>Once main elements are mixed you unmute and mix the rest</li></ol><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> <a href="https://www.musicianonamission.com/mixing-mono/">Start Mixing in Mono</a></p><hr><h3 id="-2-pulling-the-listener-into-the-mix">#2 Pulling the Listener Into the Mix</h3><p>Great tracks pull the listener into the music. </p><p>This is done via presentation of a noticeable element <em>(example: lead synth)</em> and a gradual reduction of volume of that element relative to the rest of the instruments. It's almost like pulling the listener's attention by its hand and '<em>dragging them into the mix'</em>.</p><p>A great example of that technique is the following statement by producer Maya Jane Coles from her <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3558">Resident Advisor interview</a>: </p><blockquote>I often layer multiple different sounds that cover four frequency ranges, especially with bass. There'll be a very filtered low, low sub below 100 Hz that sounds very muted, then the more solid, mono mid-range sound. If I'm creating a wobble bassline, then I'll make the cutoff frequency of the filter vary to create some movement. On top of that I'll have a more high-frequency, low-cut bass sound, and I'll filter that in and out throughout the whole track. <strong>I'll record the automation from start to finish so that there's never a static part and it's always changing a little bit.</strong><p>That's especially important when the track revolves around a bassline, as with a lot of Nocturnal Sunshine stuff. I'll try and make sure that there's never eight bars where the bass is all flat and the movement is the same. Say automation is controlling the filter of one of the layered parts of the bass. <strong>Even if all the other three layered parts stay the same, it creates movement within that sound.</strong> A listener wouldn't necessarily know that that sound's created with three or four layers. It just gives it a slightly fuller sound with the movement.</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id="-3-mixing-depends-on-context">#3 Mixing Depends on Context</h3><p>The world is changing, and so are the expectations to what music should sound like. </p><p><em>(This is an entire rabbit hole in itself and I can recommend "<strong>How Music Works</strong>" by David Byrne [<a href="https://amzn.to/2GkJAkU">affiliate link</a>] where he discusses this at length)</em></p><p>One of the first feedbacks I received from Kilian was the following:</p><blockquote>Your tracks are very beautiful and nicely arranged. The one thing that I noticed was that the mix was very symphonic - meaning it had a very large dynamic range. <p>Usually this happens when people listen to a lot of organically produced music - like classic - and when they mix on headphones.</p></blockquote><p>Both was true.</p><blockquote>If the context of the music would be to have these tracks only as silent background for a movie it would work, but if you want the tracks to work in a club setting then we need to make some adjustments. <p><strong>Modern music has an unnatural amount of <a href="https://www.artlapinsch.com/hearing-protection/">sound pressure</a></strong> - particularly in the lower frequencies. </p><p>On top, there is a loudness war, every producer wants her tracks to be as loud as the references from beatport. </p><p>The reference tracks on beatport are compressed to death and therefore are consistently loud - on headphones and most importantly in the club.</p></blockquote><p>Since my goal was to have tracks that could be played in a club/festival setting we needed to do some extra work.</p><hr><h3 id="-4-sequential-sidechain-compression">#4 Sequential Sidechain Compression</h3><p><a href="https://blog.liveschool.net/breakdown-kaytranada-crafts-beats/">Many producers use sidechain compression</a> to give more space for their kick drum. </p><p><u>Example:</u> Kick drum hits and triggers a sidechained compression of another element <em>(in most cases a sub-bass or a synth)</em>.</p><p>But... it gets interesting once you start using sidechain compressions on multiple mix groups in similar frequency bands.</p><p>Let's assume you have vox, …</p></div></div>

<p>
	   This little book is in Basic English. It is a first attempt to put some  chief parts of the science which has rightly been named ' the key to knowledge  ' into the new language which is becoming month by month the international  language of the Earth. For those who have no knowledge of Basic, a list of  books about it has been printed on the last page. The rules for working the 850  words here used (all of which are printed at the front, on one side of a bit of  business notepaper) are given in <i>Basic English</i> and in the <i>ABC</i> ;  and the different forms and uses of the words themselves are made clear in <i>The  Basic Words.</i> </p>
<p><br>
    As to my experience in using this language ; I am not conscious  that at any point I have said anything which is in any way different from what  I had in mind to say, or that I have been forced to say it in a way which is  less clear, or less in harmony with my purpose than the other ways which would,  with a longer Word List, have been open to me. In fact, very frequently the  opposite has been true ; the simple language has been better for this sort of  work than a more complex language. About half of the book is an account of  views with which everyone who has any experience with these questions will be  in agreement. The other half is only a statement of my opinions about points on  which agreement is unhappily not possible in the present conditions of  knowledge. But when what is said is wrong, the error is to my thought, not in  the language, and may be put right without the use of more or different words. </p>
<p><br>
   For suggestions on points of detail in the writing I am in debt to  Miss Lockhart of the Orthological Institute. <br>

<h2 id="language-machine">Langage Machine</h2>
<div><p><i> An idea in the mind is to a Natural Law as the power of seeing is to  light.</i>  S. T. Coleridge, on  Shakespeare's use of language.</p><p>
     
    The purpose of this book is to give a clear account of how we may  best put our thought in order, of if we are not able quite to do this, how we  may best make a serious attempt in this direction. To put our thoughts in order  is to make them come into agreement with things, to make them give us a truer  picture, a representative map or instrument for guiding our acts, so that men  may give effect to as great a number of their desires as possible. The name of  the general theory of how to do this is ' Logic '. As Bentham said, ' Logic is  the art which has for its end (or purpose) the giving, in the best way,  direction to the mind '. This direction is chiefly a power of keeping the divisions  between our thoughts in the right places, and the right places are only the  places in which, for the purpose in view, we have a need to put them, and the  places in which other for their purposes have put them. </p></div>
<div><p>
    Another very great authority -- Charles Saunders Pierce -- gave  as his account of Logic : that it is the theory of good behaviour in thought,  in the sense in which good behaviour is the use of self-control for the purpose  of making our desires come about. (His words were, "Logic is the ethics of  thinking, in the sense in which ethics is the bringing to bear of self control  for the purpose of realizing our desires.") Because we are only able to  put and keep our thoughts in control by the help of language, and because of  control of language, for this purpose, is the control of the senses of our  words, a great part of Logic, as Bentham and Pierce saw it, becomes the theory  and right use of the senses of our chief words -- those upon which the ordering  of the senses of our other words is dependent. The senses of these chief words  -- and their ways of working with or against one another -- are the rules of  reason There are not (1) the sense and (2) rules for putting them together ;  but the senses themselves give us, in their ways of acting, the rules of  reason. </p><p>
    
    p. 10 . . . . . . (more) . . . for 11 pages . . . </p><p>
    
    After these first pages about the purpose and need of a better  apparatus for controlling the senses of our words, we may go on freely to the  necessary work.</p></div>

<h2 id="theory-of-knowledge">Theory of Knowledge</h2>
<p>   Let us take the most important word, in the theory of the comparison of  senses and in the work of taking statements to bits for the purpose of  comparison, and make lists of their chief senses. We will give numbers to these  senses, so that we may put a finger on them, without trouble, when in the  process of discussion it becomes necessary to give them separate attention. We  will be able to see -- together and on one page -- the chief senses which may  be coming into use at this point in the discussion. We will then see not only  which tricks and twists we will have to keep in mind, but -- and this is more  important -- the other possible theories. </p>
<p>
    The first reaction of most readers to number (12-112, 3-24 and so  on) in pages put before them is normally fear mixed with disgust. It is hoped,  however, that here the great help which such numbering gives in keeping  different things separate will make you more kind to them. Without them I would  be forced to make the discussion at least three times longer, and to say the  same thing even more frequently than I do. A numbered list at the end of the  book in which lists of all the senses of the key-words are printed together in  their numbered order will make the necessary looking forward and back as little  trouble as possible. These numbers are only names for the sense, names which  make their positions in relation to one another clear to the eye. A number like  5-12 makes us see that the sense it is a name of is a division of sense 5-1 ;  9-211 and 9-212 are different divisions or special forms of 9-21 and so on.</p>
<p> <br>
    I give in my account only some of the reasons for making the  divisions where I do. The apparatus is a machine for separating the senses of  other words when it is necessary to do so. The test of the value of our  divisions is the amount of help they give us. It is important to keep in view  this fact that we are not here putting on paper something which is given to us,  so much as making a machine -- a machine for controlling thought which will let  us do some things and keep us from doing other things. It is a good machine if  it is of use to us ; any changes which will make it of more use to us will make  it better. They are not able to be tested in any other way than this. If the  reader is troubled by this word <i>use</i> here, a look at <i>necessary,</i> sense 17-12, in the list at the end of the book, may make the point clearer. </p>
<p>
    On the other hand, if it is to be of use, it is necessary to keep  some of the divisions in the places in which our minds normally put them. The  attempt to make a machine like this is, in fact, a way (and the best way) to  the discovery of how our minds do their work. But, as we will see, our minds do  their work in a number of different ways. They put the chief divisions, upon  which all the other are dependent, in a number of different places for  different purposes. </p>
<p>So a number of different machines are possible and  necessary. Very little of the theory of the connections between these possible  machines has been worked out. The history of thought is still waiting for such  a theory. The experts have had enough to do putting their machines together or  attacking the machines of other experts. They have not made the right sort of  comparisons, and their machines have not been put together for this purpose.  This sad condition of our theories will seem very strange in the future,  because the work is important. The histories of different nations make their  ways of thought different ; and the fact that they are different will, in the  end, be of value to us all. But there is no need for them to be out of all  relation to one another ; as they are now. The machine which is put together in  these pages is for the connection of different systems of thought -- of  different men, nations, governments, sciences, religions, societies -- with one  another. To get things into clear relations to one another we have first to  take them to bits. But the purpose is new knowledge and new buildings, not  destruction. This machine is only one of a number of possible machines ; it  will be tested by the work which it lets us do. </p>
<p>
    The most important words in this machine are :  </p>

    I take them in these three groups because the sort of discussion  I give them is changed from one group to another. The senses of the words int  he last group, for example, have not quite the wide and free ways of being  different from one another which those in the first group have. A group is a  unit, but senses from all three of them have at times to be kept in view  together. </p>
<p>
    With accounts of the chief senses of these key-words before us on  paper in clear lists, the worst troubles of all discussion will in a short time  be seen to give the best chances for new discoveries. they will no longer be,  as they are now causes of unfertile doubt and complex errors. The lists in this  book will at first not be complete and clear enough to give us every sense  which is needed. But even list which are not complete will let us see much  which we do not now naturally see without them. Even a bad attempt will be much  better than no attempt at all. </p>
<p>
    In giving lists of the senses of those words which I take first I  have to make use, in special senses, of those which come later. The numbers put  with these …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="what-is-azure-kubernetes-service-aks"><span>What is Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</span></h2><p>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes offering in Azure which lets you quickly deploy a production ready Kubernetes cluster. It allows customers to focus on application development and deployment, rather than the nitty gritties of Kubernetes cluster management. The cluster control plane is deployed and managed by Microsoft while the node and node pools where the applications are deployed, are handled by the customer.</p><p>The AKS cluster deployment can be fully automated using Terraform. Terraform enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. It also supports advanced AKS configurations, such as availability zones, Azure AD integration, and network policies for Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="aks-features-in-focus"><span>AKS features in focus</span></h2><p>Let’s take a look at the key AKS features we’ll be covering in this article.</p><h3 id="aks-deployment-across-multilpe-availability-zones">AKS deployment across multilpe availability zones</h3><p>Ensuring high availability of deployments is a must for enterprise workloads. Azure availability zones protect resources from data center-level failures by distributing them across one or more data centers in an Azure region.</p><p>AKS clusters can also be deployed in availability zones, in which the nodes are deployed across different zones in a region. In case of a data center failure, the workloads deployed in the cluster would continue to run from nodes in a different zone, thereby protecting them from such incidents.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.codersociety.com/uploads/AKS%20-%20Overview%20of%20availability%20zones.png">
<em>Overview of availability zones for AKS clusters</em></p><h3 id="azure-active-directory-integration">Azure Active Directory integration</h3><p>With identity considered the new security perimeter, customers are now opting to use Azure AD for authentication and authorization of cloud-native deployments. AKS clusters can be integrated with Azure Active Directory so that users can be granted access to namespaces in the cluster or cluster-level resources using their existing Azure AD credentials. This eliminates the need for multiple credentials when deploying and managing workloads in an AKS cluster.</p><p>This is of even greater benefit in hybrid cloud deployments, in which on-premises AD credentials are synced to Azure AD. It delivers a consistent, unified experience for authentication and authorization. Figure 1 below shows this high-level AKS authentication flow when integrated with Azure Active Directory.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.codersociety.com/uploads/AKS%20-%20Authentication%20flow.png">
<em>Figure 1: High-level AKS authentication flow integrated with Azure AD</em></p><h3 id="pod-traffic-control-through-network-policy-implementation">Pod traffic control through network policy implementation</h3><p>By default, all pods in an AKS cluster can communicate with each other without any restrictions. However, in production, customers would want to restrict this traffic for security reasons. This can be achieved by implementing network policies in a Kubernetes cluster. Network policies can be used to define a set of rules that allow or deny traffic between pods based on matching labels.</p><p>AKS supports two types of network implementations: Kubenet (basic networking) and Azure CNI (advanced networking). Customers can also choose between two types of network policies: Azure (native) or <a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/" size="3">Calico</a> network policies (open source). While Azure network policies are supported only in Azure CNI, Calico is supported in both Kubenet- and Azure CNI-based network implementations.</p><h2 id="deployment-prerequisites"><span>Deployment prerequisites</span></h2><p>Following are the prerequisites for the deployment of the AKS cluster:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Azure subscription access:</strong> It is recommended that users with contributor rights run the Terraform scripts. During deployment, an additional resource group is created for the AKS nodes. Restricted permissions may lead to deployment failures.</p></li><li><p><strong>Azure AD server and client application:</strong> OpenID Connect is used to integrate Azure Active Directory with the AKS cluster. Two Azure AD applications are required to enable this: a server application and a client application. The server application serves as the endpoint for identity requests, while the client application is used for authentication when users try to access the AKS cluster via the kubectl command. Microsoft offers a step-by-step guide for <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-ad-integration-cli" size="3">creating these Azure AD applications</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Terraform usage from Cloud Shell:</strong>  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview#:~:text=Azure%20Cloud%20Shell%20is%20an,work%2C%20either%20Bash%20or%20PowerShell.&amp;text=Try%20from%20Azure%20portal%20using%20the%20Cloud%20Shell%20icon." size="3">Azure Cloud Shell</a> has Terraform installed by default in the bash environment.

<![CDATA[You Need a Service Registry]]>

October 4, 2020 | https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/service-registry/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/service-registry/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Building a service registry, a structure that tracks all people, services and
systems that interact with your infrastructure, can be extremely powerful.</p>

<p>If you pick the right format, it can be the glue between totally distinct
toolchains. Placing the registry at the heart of all your other tools means you
no longer need to worry about keeping it up-to-date: the registry defines what
is created, rather than describing it.</p>

<p>By distributing the registry so every developer, infrastructure component or
one-off script can easily read it, you’ll find use cases for this data
everywhere. You can even push this data into systems like your monitoring stack,
allowing automated systems to make decisions on the ownership information it
provides.</p>

<p>As part of a revamp of our infrastructure tooling, we’ve introduced a service
registry into GoCardless. This post explains how we built the registry and some
of the use cases we’ve found for it.</p>



<p>The GoCardless service registry is a <a href="https://jsonnet.org/">Jsonnet</a> library, stored as a
file inside the same Git repository that contains our infrastructure
configuration. Jsonnet, for those not familiar, is an extension to JSON that
aims to support flexible reuse and customisation of data structures.</p>

<p>Jsonnet files evaluate to JSON, and the service registry is no different:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>jsonnet registry.jsonnet
<span>{
  "clusters": [...],
  "services": [...],
  "teams": [...],
  "projects": [...],
  ...,
}
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Perhaps you thought a service registry was a webserver, maybe hooked up to a
database, serving the data via a REST API? That wouldn’t be strange, and there
are many systems that do just that, but I’d suggest the approach of building a
registry out of a single JSON file (compiled from whatever templating language
you choose, be it Jsonnet or otherwise) has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>JSON files are so universally compatible that you’ll be able to use this
anywhere</li>
  <li>If you’ve already adopted Git-ops workflows, tracking changes to the registry
in Git should feel very natural</li>
  <li>It’s just data, and your registry is only as good as the data you put in it.
Removing the distraction of building an API means you encourage a focus on
building the right data model, which is what really matters</li>
</ul>

<p>From the output of the <code>jsonnet registry.jsonnet</code> command, you can see we’re
tracking our Kubernetes <code>clusters</code>, any <code>services</code> that we run, organisation
<code>teams</code> who interact with the services, and Google Cloud Platform <code>projects</code>.</p>

<p>You don’t need to start by tracking all these types, but the simplicity of a
Jsonnet library means it costs very little to add a new type. We began with
<code>services</code>, then wanted to ensure no service referenced an invalid team. It was
a natural evolution to add <code>teams</code>, and this pattern has happened many times
over.</p>

<h2 id="service-entry-make-it-rain">Service entry (make-it-rain)</h2>

<p>Our registry began as a list of services, where each service had a
<code>metadata.jsonnet</code> that defined its service entry.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this post, imagine we have a (fake) service called
<code>make-it-rain</code>, which has a service entry that looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Example service called make-it-rain, powering a dashboard of falling</span>
<span>// gold coins whenever anyone takes a payment via GoCardless.</span>

<p>Take a moment to read the Jsonnet- this produces a JSON structure that you can
see <a href="https://gist.github.com/lawrencejones/b209a1a5da864b987cbedb1dffef6116#file-make-it-rain-json">here</a>. It includes a definition of the service and
all its environments, with a list of deployment targets for each environment
that defines where the deployment lives.</p>

<p>There’s some configuration of team permissions and Google Cloud Platform
references- we’ll see how we can use them next.</p>



<p>Once you have a list of service entries like make-it-rain, we can use it
to tightly integrate with all the rest of our infrastructure tools.</p>

<p>Most infrastructure teams deal with many (in my mind, too many) tools.  The
GoCardless team provisions infrastructure with <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">terraform</a>, manages
virtual machines with <a href="https://www.chef.io/products/chef-infra">Chef</a>, and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> resources with
Jsonnet templating. Other teams may use far more.</p>

<p>Thankfully, our service registry is plain ol’ JSON, and easily consumed by all
of these tools. Once imported, we can begin provisioning infrastructure in
response to changes in the registry. This is a change from the registry
describing the infrastructure at a point-in-time, to becoming the definition
what really exists.</p>

<p>When you must update registry to create infrastructure, you guarantee the
registry is up-to-date, and know it can no longer become stale. This allows you
to trust the registry in use-cases that weren’t possible if it could fall
out-of-date, a benefit we’ll see when we integrate it with our
<a href="#tooling">tools</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s see how this works in practice.</p>

<h2 id="kubernetes">Kubernetes</h2>

<p>When someone creates a service like make-it-rain, we’ll import their entry into
the registry. Our CD pipelines will detect a registry change and begin
provisioning core resources required for every service.</p>

<p>First, we have a Jsonnet templated cluster service that we use to create
privileged Kubernetes cluster resources, such as namespaces. As the templating
imports the registry as just another Jsonnet file, it will detect we’re missing
a namespace (<code>make-it-rain</code>) in the <code>compute-staging-brava</code> and
<code>compute-banking</code> clusters, and automatically create them.</p>

<p>After we have a namespace, we’ll create the supporting resources.  Included in
this are resource quotas, limiting the amount of cluster resource make-it-rain
could consume- these limits can be tweaked or overriden in the cluster service
Jsonnet:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// utopia/services/cluster/instances/compute-staging.jsonnet</span>
<span>cluster</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>spaces</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>'make-it-rain'</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>quota</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>spec</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>// These React apps are getting crazy...</span>
          <span>hard</span><span>+:</span> <span>{</span> <span>cpu</span><span>:</span> <span>'32'</span><span>,</span> <span>memory</span><span>:</span> <span>'32Gi'</span> <span>},</span>
        <span>},</span>
      <span>},</span>
    <span>},</span>
  <span>},</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Permissions are one of the more complicated things about managing Kubernetes
clusters. Especially when aiming for a Devops workflow, with application
engineers empowered to care for their own Kubernetes resources, you want to
establish a consistent permission model up-front. Consistency means you can
accurately describe your security stance for audits, and helps maintain
productivity for engineers who work across multiple teams.</p>

<p>Your registry, being the authoritative definition of service RBAC, can be used
to power your Kubernetes RBAC and enforce that consistency. Looking at our
make-it-rain production environment, we can see the RBAC fields:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Service"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"spec"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"make-it-rain"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"repository"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"gocardless/make-it-rain"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"team"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"banking-integrations"</span><span>,</span><span>

      </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span>"type"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Environment"</span><span>,</span><span>
        </span><span>"spec"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
          </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"staging"</span><span>,</span><span>
          </span><span>"rbac"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
            </span><span>"admins"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
              </span><span>"banking-integrations"</span><span>
            </span><span>],</span><span>
            </span><span>"operators"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>
              </span><span>"core-banking"</span><span>
            </span><span>],</span><span>
            </span><span>"viewers"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[]</span><span>
          </span><span>}</span><span>
        </span><span>}</span><span>
      </span><span>},</span><span>
      </span><span>...</span><span>
    </span><span>]</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>We made a decision to model just three roles for a service, viewer, operator and
admin- from our experience, it seems this is flexible enough for almost all use
cases. We thought it would be great if all permissions granted to humans were
derived from these member lists, instead of scattering the membership across our
infrastructure configuration (Kubernetes, terraform, Chef).</p>

<p>Now we have our registry, we can do just that. Using Kubernetes permissions as
an example, it’s simple to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identify the list of teams who are viewers, operators, or admins for any
services that exist within each cluster namespace</li>
  <li>Use these lists to create <code>RoleBinding</code>s in the service namespace, granting
appropriate permissions to each member of the roles</li>
</ul>

<p>We implement this in a single file, <code>cluster/app/spaces-rbac.jsonnet</code>, which
allows us to map over all namespaces in a cluster and provision the
<code>RoleBinding</code> Kubernetes resources. Jsonnet is great for this type of data
manipulation, proving–yet again!–how using a static registry does not limit how
flexibly you can query the data.</p>

<h2 id="google-cloud-platform">Google Cloud Platform</h2>

<p>It’s not just Kubernetes resources in Jsonnet, though. GoCardless is a heavy
user of Google Cloud Platform, and if this permission model is sound, we should
be able to apply it to our Cloud estate too.</p>

<p>For this, we have a …</p></section></div>

			<section><p>In this article we will explore applying the security concept of least privilege to your cloud instances, within a DevOps environment, without adding bulk and delays to your pipeline.</p>
<p>DevOps is not a tool that you buy, or the act of using pipeline software to release your code, it is so much more. Let’s define DevOps, then the three ways, then letâ€™s apply least privilege.</p>
<p><em>Although there are many different definitions of exactly what DevOps is, the most popular definition is from the Phoenix project and the DevOps Handbook. We will follow this definition in this article.</em></p>
<p>DevOps is a way of developing software, as well as a culture within a software development shop, and a mixture of processes and tooling that helps you get there.</p>
<h3>In Order to do DevOps, You Must Follow the Three Ways of DevOps</h3>
<p><em>The first way of DevOps</em> is to emphasize the speed and efficiency of the entire system, instead of just your part. Sometimes this means that you have to help another team do their work, rather than your own, because that will make the entire system so much better. Sometimes this means, asking for help from other teams. Often, automation helps with this, which is why we use a DevOps pipeline software, in order to release and deploy our code quickly and efficiently. Automation generally results in fewer errors, and it almost always results in much faster results. This is the first way of DevOps.</p>
<p><em>The second way of DevOps</em> is fast feedback. This means getting feedback to the correct person or people, in a timely manner. It also means the feedback needs to be accurate, because feedback that is inaccurate is not only unhelpful, it is potentially harmful. We add security testing, and all sorts of other quality tests, to our pipeline software in order to ensure the code that we are creating is high quality, and so that we get very fast feedback. That said, a pipeline is not the only way that you can get feedback, we will talk about this when we apply least privilege.</p>
<p><em>The third way of DevOps</em> is continuous learning. This means setting time aside on a regular basis to improve your daily work. Sometimes this means training. Sometimes this means tuning your tools or doing a proof of concept of several new tools that you are considering ensuring that the one you choose is the absolute best for your specific business needs. Sometimes this means introducing artificial intelligence and machine learning into your systems or tooling, to ensure that it is continuously learning. The point being that you want to be in a constant state of striving for improvement.</p>
<p>Quite often when people think of DevOps, they assume that every single tool or test must go into the pipeline. This is not true. We need to abide by the three ways of DevOps, and that definitely means using pipeline software and putting security tests inside of it, but our work is not done with just that. We cannot possibly complete all of our security requirements within a pipeline.</p>
<h3>Least Privilege and the Three Ways</h3>
<p>Let’s look at how we can implement the concept of <em>least privilege</em> to our cloud processes within a DevOps environment, and how it relates to each of the three ways.</p>
<p>Now we could attempt to put some tests for least privilege in our DevOps pipeline, however, what would we test for? If a permission is included in the pipeline, it’s likely because the software developer assumed that they would need it. What test could we put in a pipeline that would clarify whether or not a permission was actually required? To see if it is in use, or not? This means, it is unlikely we can test for this in our pipeline.</p>
<p>Instead of putting a test in the pipeline, we could set up monitoring in our systems of new processes, to watch which permissions are actually being used and which are not. Whichever permissions are not being used, could be removed, in order to implement<em> least privilege</em>. Now, let’s look at how we can apply this to <em>the three ways</em> of DevOps.</p>
<p>The first of the three ways, to repeat, is speed and efficiency of the entire system. By not putting a tool like this in the pipeline, this would not slow the pipeline down, and that would increase the speed of the system. Instead, we could create automation outside the pipeline, to ensure that this work was done quickly and efficiently, that would obey the first rule for instance, if we had a monitoring tool that did this for us. Letâ€™s take this imaginary monitoring system with us to the next way.</p>
<p>The second way is fast, accurate and timely feedback. Letâ€™s say our automated monitoring system that is watching all of our processes to see which permissions are being used, it gives feedback quickly and to the right people [the security team], that would be a very handy tool. If it could automate removing unused permissions, tell us if someone tries to use a removed permission, and shows us reports of both, that would certainly fit well into the second way. Having it also automate sending alerts and creating tickets would be a cherry on top of all of this; feedback going directly to who needs it.</p>
<p>The third way involves continuous learning. If our automated monitoring system, itself, can learn continuously from the traffic, access, and behavior of our cloud activity and users, then that respects the third way. A system that can train itself, learn when to remove permissions, when to replace permissions, and when to block access, not only respects the third way, it makes for a fantastic least privilege security tool. With enough learning (monitoring), a tool can even start to recommend which access policies would be the best option, given specific situations and previous decisions.</p>
<p>Although many people seem to think that DevOps tools need to go in a pipeline, this article makes it clear that you can still respect the three ways of DevOps and work within DevOps processes, without having your tool in the pipeline. And gain fantastic security results to boot!</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Software development is a craft. We tend to call it “engineering”, but most of
the time, it feels more like plumbing or carpentry. Most of the time, completing
a task does not require any inventiveness. Sometimes we fool ourselves
into thinking that we are more than a craftsmen, engineers even, and in order to
verify our bias, we try to be clever where no inventiveness is required. This
only complicates things, both in the moment and the future.</p>

<p>Because software development is a craft, it is perhaps fair to deduce that
principles which apply to crafts also apply to computer programming. An efficient
workshop is, invariably, a tidy workshop, where every tool has its place.
Consistency is the key to completing tasks at a constant pace. When nothing is
amiss and there are no surprises, it is easy to make plans and execute them. To
keep a tidy workshop, you must <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-CTkbHnpNQ">always be knolling</a>.</p>

<p>An efficient team is, invariably, a team that keeps the code tidy and all
external aspects of it up to date. <em>Always be knolling</em>. This does not directly
contribute to the solution or success of the current task, but the current task
is not your entire job responsibility. In the long run, your job is to complete
tasks consistently and in accordance to specifications. If you’re held up by
ancillary tasks such as upgrading dependencies or unwinding an abstraction that
was meant to solve duplication that turned out to be incidental, then you have
failed to keep a tidy system.</p>

<p>Keeping a tidy system is not only useful to you as a programmer, it is also
useful for team leaders because it helps them to accurately report progress and
estimates to management. Another important aspect is the psychological well-being
of the team. A tidy system is a joy to work on. You do not dread a task because
you know that you are going to have to work on poorly maintained part of the
system or because you’ll have to edit code that offends your sensibilities.
Instead, what you get is the dopamine boost that comes with closing the task in
the issue tracker after you’ve completed it and verified that it works.</p>

<p>A software project is never complete. It can always be extended and changed to
take on new roles and fulfill new design criteria. This is perhaps also true
of physical items such a furniture, but software has more possibilities.
Notably, this is where software development differs from other crafts: it is
more dynamic. This is a an extremely powerful attribute of software. Just
imagine having the possibility of morphing a regular kitchen chair into a
wheelchair or a rocking-chair just by carving an incantation into its seat.</p>

<p>In order to exploit this powerful aspect of software that sets it apart from all
other things, it must be possible to actually make changes to the software. An
untidy system resists change and stands in the way of progress. By constantly
clearing away detritus, we can take advantage of software’s full potential.</p>

<p>Consistency enables change.</p>

					<p>Find <a href="https://osmlanduse.org/" target="_blank">here</a> a new update of the <strong><a href="http://osmlanduse.org/" target="_blank">OSMlanduse.org</a></strong> map. By injecting known tags provided by OpenStreetMap (OSM) into a remote sensing feature space using deep learning, tags were predicted when absent thus creating a contiguous map - initially for the member states of the EU. By design our method can be applied when- and wherever OSM and Copernicus data is available. Now we eye application for full continental coverage, other continents, and land use evolution. Improvements related to initial processing errors will be deployed soon. Insights will be provided in an upcoming publication authored by researchers Michael Schultz, Hao Li, Zhaoyan Wu, Daniel Wiell, Michael Auer and Alexander Zipf.</p>
<p>Among others, in collaboration with the Joint Research Center (JRC), Ispra and International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) the map is subjected to a online validation campaign that is launched during the <a href="https://europa.eu/regions-and-cities/" target="_blank">EU Regions week</a> the <strong>validation</strong> <strong>event</strong> will be initialized on <strong><a href="https://europa.eu/regions-and-cities/programme/sessions/1238_en">Tue 14, October 2020, 9:30</a></strong> by Michael Schultz of <a href="http://uni-heidelberg.de/gis" target="_blank">GIScience</a> Research Group Heidelberg University and Ana-Maria Raimond of IGN France.</p>
<p>Our map is the first successful large area fusion of OSM and Copernicus at 10m spatial resolution or higher, where we acknowledged varying label noise and feature space quality, scales and effective use of artificial intelligence and computing. Our method solely relies on openly available data streams and does not depend on additional expert knowledge.</p>
<p>Brief method outline:</p>
<ol type="I">
<li>OSM key value pairs (tags) were translated into Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) land cover (CLC) land use (LU) classes and used as training labels</li>
<li>Preprocessed Sentinel 2 RGB 10m data for EU was provide from Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and used as a feature space</li>
<li>1) and 2) were combined to produce a CLC classification of EU using deep learning</li>

  <p>There are two different types of technology companies - deep tech companies and product tech companies. There are significant differences between how these companies work and the types of people who work at them. Think of Airbnb. From a technology point of view, Airbnb is just a website. There’s nothing technically challenging about building a similar website - websites have been around for decades. However, Airbnb unlocked a new experience for users that did not exist before. </p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Deep tech companies are on the bleeding edge of technology. They are real innovators and rely on continual research of new technologies to stay ahead of competitors who are commoditising their previous work. Since these companies need a lot of R&amp;D they have close ties with academia. They hire a lot of PhDs and their focus is on developing new technologies to sell. The technology itself is the product. </p>
<p>Product companies use known technology in refined ways to target a new segment or improve the user experience. Everything they want to do can be built, the challenge is figuring out what is most important. The focus in these companies is coming up with novel solutions given the constraint of working with existing technologies. To differentiate they have to focus on the user experience and what the user gets from their product. Typically the employees here will be ‘hackers’ who don’t have the background to research new technologies but can come up with creative solutions.</p>
<p>Once companies reach a certain size they start including some aspects of both types, but their core product is what should be used to identify them. Take Samsung and Apple as an example. Samsung are constantly researching novel hardware - the latest thing is high refresh rate, folding screens. This helps them stand out from the competition as they are the first to develop this technology and sell it to users. Apple on the other hand are rarely the first to do anything. Their approach is to make sure the technology is mature enough that there are no compromises for their users. They let other companies like Samsung come up with a new technology and spend time thinking about the best way for users to benefit, adapting it for their needs.</p>
<p>What does this mean for founders trying to start a company? You have to think about the type of problem you want to solve - does the solution demand a new technology? Do you have someone on your team who can research and develop that new technology? On the other hand, you might find your solution can be a simple website. The differentiator is what the user can do on your website - something they can’t find anywhere else.</p>

Lambda Diagrams are a graphical notation for closed lambda terms,
in which abstractions (lambdas) are represented by horizontal lines,
variables by vertical lines emanating down from their binding lambda,
and applications by horizontal links connecting the leftmost variables.
In the alternative style, applications link the nearest deepest variables,
for a more stylistic, if less uniform, look.
<p>

The following table shows diagrams of identity, the booleans, some standard combinators,
some Church numerals, the predecessor function on Church numerals, and Omega.

<table>
<tbody><tr> <td>term</td><td>definition</td> <td>diagram</td> <td>alternative</td> </tr>

  <td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/4.alt.gif"></td> </tr>
<tr> <td>pred</td> <td> λn.λf.λx.n(λg.λh.h(g f))(λu.x)(λu.u)</td>
  <td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/pred.gif"></td>
  <td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/pred.alt.gif"></td> </tr>
<tr> <td>fac</td> <td> λn.λf.n(λf.λn.n(f(λf.λx.n f(f x))))(λx.f)(λx.x)</td>

  <td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/fib.alt.gif"></td> </tr>
<tr> <td>Ω</td> <td> (λx.x x)(λx.x x)</td>
  <td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Omega.gif"></td>
  <td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Omega.alt.gif"></td> </tr>
</tbody></table>
Curiously, the alternative Omega diagram somewhat resembles an (upside-down) Omega.
</p><p>
And here, on a larger scale, is a prime number sieve (alternative style): </p><p>
<img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/primes.alt.gif">
</p><p>
which reduces to an infinite list of booleans that starts out as
</p><p>
<img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/primebits.gif">

</p><h2>Dimensions and complexity</h2>

In terms of pixels, a diagram's width is one less than 4 times the number of variables
(vertical lines),
and its height is one more than twice the maximum number of nested abstractions and applications
(one less for alternaitve diagrams with multiple variables).
<p>
The size of the binary encoding of a term is closely related to
the graphical complexity: it is exactly twice the number of lines
plus the number of (4-way) intersections.

</p><h2>Reduction</h2>

Beta-reduction on lambda diagrams can be shown in several steps, as demonstrated in this reduction
from Y=λf.(λx.x x)(λx.f(x x)) to λf.(λx.f(x x))(λx.f(x x))

<table>
<tbody><tr><td>initial term</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>show application of abstraction</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y0.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>show bound variables and argument</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y1.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>expand function body</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y2.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>to make room for substitution</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y3.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>substitute argument for variables</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y4.gif"></td></tr>
<tr><td>final term</td><td><img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/Y5.gif"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

In the third frame, we show only the part of bound variables below abstractions, e.g. when
applying <img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/applied.gif">, the function body x(λy.x) shows as <img src="https://tromp.github.io/img/cl/bound.gif">.

<h2>Diagrams In Motion</h2>

Paul Brauner has produced some awesome <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi8_XqluS5xc7GL-bgVrxpA2Uww6nK0gV">videos</a> of beta reductions, produced with this <a href="https://github.com/polux/lambda-diagrams">software</a>.

<a href="http://dkeenan.com/">Dave Keenan</a> has a comprehensive online paper
<a href="http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/">To Dissect a Mockingbird:
A Graphical Notation for the Lambda Calculus with Animated Reduction</a>,
which partly inspired this page.
<p>
In his <a href="http://bntr.planet.ee/lambda/work/visual_lambda.pdf">Master thesis</a>, Viktor Massalõgin discusses 4 existing graphical notations before introducing his own "bubble" notation. Figure 3 on page 10 shows 4 depictions of the fixpoint combinator (which differs from Y above in one beta reduction), while the bubble form is in Figure 5 on page 13.

The diagram in the title, produced by the postscript code below, is a slightly deformed alternative Y diagram made to look like a Y.

        <p>Published on: 2020-10-04</p>
        
<p>Dual licensing with GPL is the idea that if I own a certain piece of GPL code, I can also relicense it as a proprietary library. This is how Oracle licenses Java and how QT licenses QT.</p>
<h2>I - All rights for me but not for thee</h2>
<p>But my general feeling is that there is some stigma associated with this practice, to quote <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#ReleaseUnderGPLAndNF">gnu.org</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To release a nonfree program is always ethically tainted, but legally there is no obstacle to your doing this. If you are the copyright holder for the code, you can release it under various different non-exclusive licenses at various times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "ethically tainted" doesn't resonate with me, I think this licensing model should be encouraged.</p>
<p>I will admit I am kind of biased on this because I work on a for-profit GPL-license project. But it strikes me as silly that this business model is shunned by the open-source community in favor of licensing under MIT/BSD.</p>
<p>Dual licensing is a way in which the "owner" of the code ends up in an advantageous position compared to other users.</p>
<p>That is to say, a user must abide by the strict rules of the GPL license:</p>
<ul>
<li>Release all modifications.</li>
<li>Potentially (depending on the specifics of the GPL license) have to release other projects that are used "in relation" to the library.</li>
<li>Not ship the code under a different license.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "owner" of the code abides by none of these and can thus benefit in ways that the users can't.</p>
<p>In the open-source utopia, where resources are aplenty for everyone, everything is open source and nothing is for sale, so dual-licensing doesn't fit that particular utopia. But we live in the real world, where money makes things a bit more complicated, and in the long term, dual-licensing might be better than equal-rights open licenses.</p>
<p>Well, developers have to eat.</p>
<p>Even worst, good software is made by good developers, developers which can get six-figure salaries designing skinner boxes. On the contingency that those developers aren't ideal altruists, they have to get way-above-subsistence salaries to work on useful open source projects instead of skinner boxes.</p>
<p>So if dual-licensing provides a middle ground for that which is better than the current situation where a lot of good software is proprietary, what's the harm?</p>
<p>Some would say it's a middle ground that will hamper the development of truly free software. But who release said truly free software anyway?</p>
<h2>II - Who release fully-free projects</h2>
<p>When it comes to license like MIT and BSD, that impose no restrictions upon usage, where the "owner" doesn't exist, it's interesting to look at who release projects under those licenses:</p>
<p>a) Students or hobbyists, people creating software for fun, notoriety, and experience.</p>
<p>b) Very large companies (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Uber) or government &amp; donation founded organizations (Universities, Public Research centers, software foundations such as GNU, Apache, and LSF)</p>
<p>The first group is one I don't wish to dismiss, I think a lot of important programs stem from here. But their end goal is not to work for free for their whole life. Usually, they moonlight for their open-source projects and work a paid gig to earn money. A small minority can be funded by donations, but it's a small minority.</p>
<p>The project I use for allowing comments on this website (<a href="https://github.com/umputun/remark42">remark42</a>), has 2.3k stars on GitHub and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/remark42/posts">earns 9$/month from donations</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb">project I work on</a> has 2.9k stars on Github and an operating budget of <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/16/mindsdb-raises-3-million-for-open-source-automated-machine-learning/">a few million</a> dollars.</p>
<p>You can certainly get to a point where you are funded by donations, but the reality is that it's not a good enough incentive. Doubly so since the developers working on these projects are usually the "creme de la creme", releasing and maintaining truly useful software usually requires expertise only a small fraction of engineers have.</p>
<p>The second group, the corporation and government-funded teams can only exist because of the scale.</p>
<p>Why can Facebook develop PyTorch?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because Facebook hires so many ML engineers that in the cost-benefit analysis it's cheaper to have your internal framework be popular enough such that you can get already-trained people from day 1. The &lt; 100 people working full time on PyTorch save months of training for every single one of the thousands of ML people facebook hires, since it can hire people that already know PyTorch.</li>
<li>Because Facebook doesn't dominate by having better ML models, it dominates by having thousands of times more data than anyone else. It's in facebook's interest to keep research open since it's objective is not to get ahead, but just to stay even, or at least not fall significantly behind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why can Nvidia assign engineers to dozens of open source ML and game-engine projects?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because Nvidia makes hundreds of billions each year selling GPUs. The little work they put into those libraries to make sure it works ideally with their GPUs is insignificant to the revenue they get from those markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why can Google develop TensorFlow?</p>
<ul>
<li>For about the same reasons as Facebook.</li>
<li>Because they can make a lot more money from selling/renting TensorFlow optimized hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's on the happier side of the spectrum. On the "shadier" end of the scale, one could argue projects like Flutter and Angular might be worth their investment because they make spyware-free browsers like Firefox send-class citizens in the war for the web, not to mention easier integration into internet-monopolizing schemas like AMP.</p>
<p>You've also got, I will admit, projects that seem to be open source purely for flexing. To my knowledge, Yandex might have well never released Clickhouse and the column-store database landscape would have been set back 10+ years for it. Why did they do it? Maybe just because few dozens of people working on it wanted to showcase how good they are.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, this is not a reliable model</p>
<h2>III - Profit motives</h2>
<p>So would it not be nice for open source if one can bring profit motives into the whole thing?</p>
<p>Even better, profit from the people that don't support or contribute to open source, but not from those that do.</p>
<p>It seems to me like double-licensing with GPL achieves just that. One can release a project and charge large companies for using it, at the risk of breaking the license if they don't pay. Even if a lot of them will use the software illegally, as is the case now, the threat of lawsuits will end up deterring some or most heavy-users from doing so.</p>
<p>On the other hand, people using the project in an open-source project of their own have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>The only problem that remains here is the fact that you can't chain GPL projects. That is to say, one can't use GPL code in their own double-licensed GPL code, but there are workarounds for that (e.g. isolating the GPL dependency and open-sourcing the changes to that alone). Still, this seems like the kind of problem that could be fixed by an off-shoot of the GPL meant for just this use-case.</p>
<p>This model keeps all the advantages of GPL, in that it incentives your users to open-source their product. It doesn't force them to do so, like a purely-GPL licensed software might, but it's not like GPL is working as intended, outside of a few cases where enough money was at stake to sue (e.g. TiVo), violations of the GPL go unpunished.</p>
<p>Currently, a company that wants to include GPL into their project has two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the code in such a way that GPL won't force you to open source the rest of your code.</li>
<li>Use the code and break the license.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the wording of GPL is not that clear, it could often be argued that companies go for alternative nr 2. After all, who will ever know?</p>
<p>But what if the "pay the maintainer a small sum" option was available. Wouldn't the liability afraid giants look towards this much more favorably than either of the other 2 options? Wouldn't this, in the long run, give an edge to open source projects which don't have to worry about these fees ?</p>
<hr>
<p>Thus I think I come in squarely on the side of open-source companies dual-licensing GPL on their product[s]. A model that already exists and often enough has great success (see MariaDB and Aerospike).</p>
<p>It's a nice compromise for moving towards a more open world, without having to live in Stallman's utopia. It's an amazingly pragmatic solution and anyone who reads this blog knows I'm a fan of those.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is a fact that almost every job in the world has some stereotypes. Based on the lifestyles of a few, people start attaching specific attributes to a particular occupation and those associated with that specific job. For example, there is a myth that doctors are always rich and that pursuing a medical field is one’s road to financial stability. While doctors do make good money, it is not entirely true. But because we are presumptuous people, it is easier for us to assume things.</p>
<p>Just as there are certain stereotypes for doctors, there are certain qualities that are attached to programmers too. One of the most famous attributes that are believed to be in programmers is loneliness. It is usually said that a programmer does not have a life, and that’s why they are more likely to end up alone, isolated, and cut off from the world. But is it true? Let’s dig deep into it.</p>
<h2>The Association:</h2>
<p>The primary reason for the association of loneliness with the programmers is their dense life – where from waking up early in the morning to eventually going to sleep – coding is heavily influential. Tied up with loneliness, other attributes used to define a programmer’s life are no love life, anxiety, lack of genuine friends, and lack of socializing skills.</p>
<!-- phpgang custom -->
<p>When the question in the title was thrown at programmers on Quora, most responses provided the same reason for being lonely: introvertedness. Many said to have a good love life, and they also said to have pulled off a pretty good schedule where they could give time to coding yet be left with ample time to rejoice with their respective families. Not only that, but they also wrote to have spared enough time to read and study too.</p>
<p>However, many did agree that they did not lead happening lives. They can’t afford to have spontaneous plans or leave for an unplanned road trip that will have a severe impact on their job. As a programmer with a regular 9 to 5 job, you are supposed to work 8 hours a day, five days a week, all while ensuring a good moral character along with an aptitude for striving for bigger and better in terms of career and finance.</p>
<p>So, in juggling your career and finances as a programmer, sometimes introvertedness does become a choice.</p>
<h2>Does the Claim Stand True?</h2>
<p>While many programmers deny suffering from chronic loneliness due to their dense work schedule, many passionate programmers do not have ties with anyone other than their beloved family members. Undoubtedly, the nature of a programmer’s work-life demands undivided attention, but it is not entirely the kind of work they do. The field of programming is not saturated. The growing IT and AI industries are inspiring many to pursue their careers in the established and demanding fields of programming.</p>
<p>Being a mere programmer is not all it takes to build a sustainable future; a programmer has to stand out from the crowd of hundreds of thousands. Many passionate programmers give decades of their lives to refining their skills so that they are eventually able to build their empire, make a promising future for themselves and those associated with them.</p>
<p>In between the contractions and rarefactions of life and for the pursuit of a sustainable future, many programmers give up on the relations that they could have built, trips that they could have gone to, and, more importantly, the time that they could have spared for themselves.</p>
<h2>How to Deal with Programmers?</h2>
<p>Because of their quiet, grim, and gloomy demeanour, programmers are termed as weird. Such labelling is just the result of our rushed judgment. If you have a programmer friend, know that they do not necessarily have to be good at socializing and therefore, to get them out of their zombified stature, here are a few things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not expect holistic reactions from them.</li>
<li>Talk to them about their work-life</li>
<li>Discuss their goals and achievements</li>
<li>Share your interactions with programmers, if you have had any.</li>
<li>Make sure they don’t feel left out in a party or a gathering.</li>
<li>If they don’t want to attend a gathering, respect their decision.</li>
<li>Try persuading them to push their boundaries slowly and gradually.</li>
<li>Take them a place where they are least uncomfortable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mentioned above are some of the ways you can deal with your programmer pals and buddies and help them enjoy things other than coding. Remember, a good programmer will do the coding by working hard, but a happy programmer will do the coding by heart.</p>

<p>This post was extensively <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24677407">discussed on Hacker News</a>.</p>



<p>I’ve been running for a decade a self-built NAS at home, so I thought I’d write down my experience so that others might gloat over my many failures and gasp in awe at my few triumphs.</p>

<p>The NAS is <strong>perfect</strong> because it is simple, safe, modular and extensible and it is <strong>cheap </strong>because it is built of second hand, commodity parts.</p>



<p>The NAS mostly stores files (documents and media) on a software RAID 6 and serves them over Windows shares to the local network. I’m staying away from proprietary NAS solutions because a hardware failure would make data recovery hard to impossible without the exact same hardware replacement. Every piece of hardware,  from the hard disks to the case and motherboard have been switched out for something else in this decade, sometimes more than once, so the focus on modularity paid for itself. Since long-term data integrity and robustness is a concern, the NAS should run some sort of redundant RAID level.</p>



<h2>Goals</h2>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Goal</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td><td><strong>Solution</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Function</td><td>The NAS serves as a <strong>network attached file system</strong> for home use; the NAS operates a few hours a day and is either off or in standby most of the time </td><td>Commodity hardware, open source software, modularity, keep it simple</td></tr><tr><td>Interoperability</td><td>Commonly used computer platforms should be able to access files on the NAS. Commodity hardware should be able to connect to the NAS.</td><td>Samba (aka Windows shares) on Ubuntu, USB, SATA. Connect LAN to Wifi router, does name resolution and time server.

<h2>Non-goals</h2>



<ul><li>Typical media-server tasks: streaming, encoding, transcoding etc</li><li>Bitcoin mining</li><li>Torrenting</li><li>Everything else 🙂</li></ul>



<h2>Getting the Hardware</h2>



<p>Getting the right hardware is the hard-(pun)-est part as it is the platform for modularity, price, energy consumption, size and many other goals I’m interested in. There are many second-hand, cheap proprietary NAS servers around, but I don’t like the idea of closed hardware and software systems. Eg, if a hardware RAID controller stores data in a proprietary format on the hard drives I would need the exact same replacement controller to recover that data in case of a controller failure.</p>



<p>Space is also an issue, so the server should be compact while allowing running Linux on it; that is quite hard to find as most compact NAS’ out there are proprietary systems and don’t allow installing your own OS. There are plenty of used x86 PCs and servers, but they are mostly too big or don’t have enough drive bays or SATA ports. Connecting drives over USB is also not an option because of the low speed, higher power consumption and space requirements. The first couple of my NAS revisions around 2010 used a compact barebone and later a mini tower case around which had 3 or 4 hard disk bays, but I find those box formats harder to come by these days. Lucky you if you get one at an affordable price!</p>



<p>I came across a used <a href="https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c03793258">HP proliant microserver</a> gen8 and haven’t regretted it ever since. The base model came with 2GB ECC RAM, a Celeron 2-core CPU and no hard drives for about 100€. There’s an excellent review of that server on <a href="https://louwrentius.com/zfs-performance-on-hp-proliant-microserver-gen8-g1610t.html">Louwrentius</a>. The server is extremely compact (about 26cm each dimension), reasonably low noise (although not silent) in standby, has a passively cooled CPU, two GBit ethernet ports, four 3,5″ hard drive bays and a somewhat hidden proprietary format slot for a fifth low-profile 2,5″ disk which I use for an SSD. The drive bays can directly receive SATA disks while the 5th slot requires a 4 pin FDD male-to-SATA adapter and a SATA cable to connect a 2.5″ SSD to the motherboard, which requires an FDD 4 pin (male)-to-SATA connector. As an added bonus, the server features <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Integrated_Lights-Out">ILO</a> which allows remote access to the server with a web browser – so no need for a keyboard or screen!</p>



<p>I admit that the server isn’t 100% commodity parts; eg. a motherboard or CPU failure would require ordering the exact same spare parts (which is probably going to be expensive) or building a completely new server on a different platform. However RAM, network and storage are fairly standard, I run Ubuntu on it and the benefits outlined earlier weigh enough to take that risk. About 6 years later the server still runs without any issues; barring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias">survivor bias</a>, I think that approach worked well.</p>



<p>The server I purchased had firmware from 2014 and HP thankfully started publishing updates for free recently, the last one from late 2019 which I flashed the microserver with for a slick HTML5 management UI.</p>



<p>The server underwent various upgrades over the years; from a RAID5 array of three 2TB hard disks to the current setup of 3x6TB + 1x8TB + 1x 512MB SSD and a CPU upgrade to a Xeon model and a RAM upgrade to 16GB ECC. I almost exclusively repurpose external USB hard drives (after opening , extracting the HDD and kissing the warranty goodbye) which are cheaper than internal ones… at first that is surprising considering the extra hardware (case, USB-to-SATA adapter, cables, power supply) they come with; however the warranty and technical specs are significantly inferior to those of internal drives which explains the price difference. Since the server runs a RAID 6 (the entire point of which is to survive disk failures) I think that is an ok risk to take.</p>



<p>The server is connected over an Ethernet cable to the home Wifi router; network speeds are close to 100mb/s which is ok, the USB3 ports can do around 40mb/s.</p>



<h2>Installation</h2>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Integrated_Lights-Out">ILO </a>makes setting up the server easy even without a physical keyboard and screen. I started with Ubuntu server LTS 14.04, switched over to 16.04 and am currently running 18.04. The upgrades never worked in place, in each case a fresh installation was required. </p>



<p>I recommend installing a VM (like VirtualBox) on your workstation, booting Ubuntu Server 18.04 from a live image and installing Ubuntu on a USB harddisk. I couldn’t get the Proliant microserver to boot with UEFI, so a traditional grub BIOS installation is required. </p>



<p>The four hard disks are partitioned according to the schema below: a 1MB partition at the beginning for the GRUB boot loader, a 50GB partition for Ubuntu and a 5.5TB partition for the RAID.</p>



<p>I used the Ubuntu Server 18.04 alternative installer to set up the Ubuntu partitions as a RAID 1 which mirrors that partition over all hard disks. The installer is able to install Ubuntu into that RAID 1 and GRUB is able to boot from it. In case of a hard disk failure, just removing that hard disk will allow the server to boot again.</p>



<pre><code>+-------------------+
| 1MB bios_grub     |
|                   |
+-------------------+
| 50GB Ubuntu ext4  |
| RAID 1            |
+-------------------+
| 5.5TB Data        |
| RAID 6            |
+-------------------+</code></pre>



<p>For the installer to work, there need to be at least two disks in the RAID. More disks can be <a href="https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Growing">added later</a>. Just make sure to install the GRUB bootloader on all disks with:</p>



<pre><code>grub-install /dev/sdX</code></pre>



<p>In my first experiments Ubuntu was able to boot fine, but wouldn’t activate the ethernet cards. This requires some fiddling with netplan.</p>



<p> <strong>/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml</strong> </p>


<pre title="">network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eno1:
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp6: true
      optional: true
    eno2:
      dhcp4: true
      dhcp6: true
      optional: true
</pre>


<h2>Boot RAID considerations</h2>



<p>As discussed in “installation”, Ubuntu boots from a RAID 1. md mirrors changes to all boot partitions, which is awesome. The boot RAID is mapped under /dev/md0 – I didn’t find a way to assign a name to it, but I found the device name to be stable. Unfortunately Ubuntu will constantly access the boot drive during normal operation, which in my case means that four drives are always spinning. I tried various things like remapping log directories to a ram disk and pre-loading files, but the resulting jungle of scripts is impossible to maintain. The solution turned out to be quite simple and elegant, after a hack: I installed an SSD in the 5th hard disk bay and added it to the boot RAID 1. While mirroring worked, the Proliant (gen8) BIOS won’t boot from the 5th bay if it finds hard disks somewhere else. The solution is a script which runs after boot and fails all mechanical hard disks in the RAID:</p>



<pre><code>mdadm --manage /dev/md0 --fail /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2 /dev/sdc2 /dev/sdd2</code></pre>



<p>The script is a bit more complex than that as device names are not stable and various error conditions need to be taken into account (eg. the RAID shouldn’t be touched if a harddisk is failing) – but that is a topic for a different post. MD will forget that the disks have been marked as failed after a reboot, which …</p></div></div>

    <p>RSS: </p> <p><a href="https://reyammer.io/blog/index.xml"><img src="https://reyammer.io/rss.png" width="23px"></a></p>

  <p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/reyammer/status/1311338230139232258" target="_blank">news is out</a>: I left France, I'm no longer a professor at EURECOM, I joined the Malware Research Team at CISCO Talos, and I moved to beautiful Vienna. Big change :-)</p>
<p>I have been a professor for a bit more than three years, but I have had contrasting feelings about the "prof job" for a long time (even before finishing my PhD), it took me a couple of years to realize that I would eventually have needed to move on, and it took even more (mental) effort to actually make the call and leave. Despite being <em>very</em> excited for what's next, oh boy, this was tough :-) But independently of the concrete next step, it was time to move on. Even if Talos realizes the mistake and kicks me out next week, I'm still confident that moving on was the right call.</p>
<p>Especially when it comes to take big decisions, I tend to obsess about trying to stay rational, and I spent years collecting notes on the various pros/cons. Many of these thoughts often started surfacing as "feeling something is not right", without consciously understanding what was going on. But by keep thinking and writing notes down, patterns of thoughts started to emerge and I was eventually able to pinpoint some more defined thoughts on what kept me on the current job and what pushed me to change. Once these reasons were clear, it was much easier to take the decision.</p>
<p>This is a very long blog post, and I don't expect more than a very few people to actually read it. I wrote it mostly for selfish reasons: before changing to a new life, I wanted to wrap up all these notes in something more structured. I can't be certain I took a good decision, but systematizing these thoughts allowed me to move on with enough confidence to know I'm likely making a step forward.</p>
<p>With that being said, I know that someone may be actually interested in hearing these thoughts and my experience. When I was a PhD student and I needed to take the notorious academia vs. industry decision, I would have paid big bucks to read more thoughts on the various pros/cons. One of the stupidest things you can do is to take big decisions based on what other people do and think, but reading about other people's thought process has helped me a lot. It is time I do my part.</p>
<p>The target audience for this post is, other than myself, PhD students / postdocs that are about to decide what to do next and junior profs that somehow feel that "something is wrong". I also expect some senior academics and industry people to read this post, but I guess they will find themselves skipping directly to the academic rant part and mostly agree with much I have to say :-) Anyways, I tried to stay away from the "very known things" (e.g., 👀-level BS when writing proposals, generally "more limited" immediate impact of your work, different compensation level, etc.), and I tried to focus on thoughts I have not seen much discussed around (at least not in this depth).</p>
<p>So, if you feel clueless and you want to hear more from an equivalently clueless random dude on the Internet, here we are :-) If you think this is <em>the</em> blog post that will make everything clear, I have a bad news for you: it's all about tradeoffs and in my opinion there is no clear-cut winner. And, unfortunately, the problem with tradeoffs and balancing many aspects is that figuring out which one to weigh more is yet another very personal decision in its own way. So, you will not find any answer in this post and you will eventually need to figure this thing out on your own, but I hope this will help you forming your own opinion.</p>
<p>This post is organized in three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job">Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job</a></li>
<li><a href="#part-2-the-bad-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-leave-the-job">Part 2: The Bad — What pushed me to leave the job</a></li>
<li><a href="#part-3-the-bye-bye-mdash-the-decision-to-leave">Part 3: The Bye Bye — The decision to leave</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

Please feel free to reach out, ping me on twitter, or shoot me an email: I'm of course happy to share more thoughts if you have any question. And if you disagree with something, bring it on!

<h2 id="part-1-the-good-mdash-what-pushed-me-to-keep-the-job">Part 1: The Good — What pushed me to keep the job</h2>
<p>Before I discuss why I left, I want to touch on what pushed me to keep the job. I want to make sure it's a balanced post despite the upcoming mega rant, so that my overall opinion is more closely reflected. And I really don't want to discourage anyone to take this path, I still think it is a great one.</p>
<p>Note that some of my "reasons to stay" are good, but some are bad. Also note that many of these refer to my personal situation at EURECOM, working in the field of systems security, and not all these points can be generalized to all universities. As they say, your mileage may vary.</p>
<h3 id="its-a-very-good-job">It's a very good job</h3>
<p>The first pros is... 🥁: "it's a very good job". At first, I was shocked to find out that it's an actual job. When I joined this prof thingy I thought that this would be a "job" (note the double quotes). But, while it's true that you don't have a direct boss that tells you what to do, at the end of the day you need to deliver, and you actually work very hard: If your PhD students are in trouble or you teaching sucks, you will run into problems. This doesn't necessarily mean "they kick out", but if you value being a professional (and I do), failing at your core tasks will make you feel bad, even without additional pressure from your superior, and even if you have tenure.</p>
<p>And now that we got this "it's an actual job" out of the way, I can tell you: it's a very good one. There is <em>a lot</em> of freedom in what you do and how you structure your time. Research-wise I felt very free (but you eventually work on what your students like to work on — as it should be), and the department values the right things (I've heard some BS in other schools where, in the context of systems security research, they pressure you to "publish more journal papers..." 🤦‍♂️). I really like teaching and mentoring, and there were many opportunities to do so. They let me create and teach my own class on mobile security, <a href="https://mobisec.reyammer.io/" target="_blank">MOBISEC</a>, and the teaching load is overall very low (1 or 1.5 classes per year). I love playing CTFs and I was even <em>encouraged</em> to spend time and push for NOPS, the EURECOM CTF team (after winning <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/647" target="_blank">HXP CTF 2018</a> and after being referred to as "<a href="https://youtu.be/j0taw78tCYs?t=968" target="_blank">probably a top team</a>" we are mostly enjoying our eternal and well-deserved glory).</p>
<p>The environment is extremely relaxed, informal, and friendly. You are surrounded by top-skilled colleagues and humans, from MS students to profs. I felt in a family from day 1. Last very good point: since in France positions come with tenure, there were not even problems in terms of pre-tenure stress, a real luxury. And on this aspect, EURECOM delivered: I never felt any sort of pressure (but: I did work my ass off... so if you stop doing anything, bad things may happen :-)).</p>
<p>[BTW, EURECOM is frantically trying to replace me, you should apply :-)]</p>
<h3 id="you-are-surrounded-by-students">You are surrounded by students</h3>
<p>When I took my decision to remain in academia, my top reason was for teaching and mentorship. Probably the best perk of the job is that you are surrounded by people eager to learn, from MS to PhD students to postdocs. It is extremely fulfilling and rewarding. Working with my students has been the highlight of my time at EURECOM, from traditional teaching, to suffering through the various rejections, to celebrating defeats of Reviewer #2, to cluelessly getting CTF-close in many stego CTF challenges. I feel very lucky that during these years we found enough interesting ideas that we enjoyed working on together, and that my next job will allow me to keep advising them until they graduate. As a prof, I believe the net output of my work is to see students becoming independent researchers, not the actual papers — I can't wait to see the bright careers I'm sure they will have :-)</p>
<h3 id="i-have-deep-respect-for-the-role-of-profs-in-society-and-it-felt-great-to-be-one">I have deep respect for the role of "profs" in society, and it felt great to be one</h3>
<p>I somehow have a profound admiration for the role that professors have in society and that had in my life. For their hard work, knowledge, passion, patience, and ultimately their service to the community. I'm referring to all teachers and mentors (from elementary schools to universities), who spend their life helping others, while at the same time often being asked to do many useless things and being massively underpaid. I admire and deeply respect these efforts: my most sincere thank you to all past, present, and future profs!</p>
<p>And, to be frank, it felt great to be one. I have been in love with the idea of being a prof for many years. In part, I think it is because some of the people who impacted me the most are professors, and I wanted to do my part in helping others. And after all the uncertainties that one has during a PhD, I think I was even more in love with the idea of having finally found my place in society. [Narrator: LOL, this clueless dude did not find his place. [Answer to narrator: But I've surely found it <em>now</em>!!1!]]</p>
<p>Overcoming all these positive emotions and feelings attached to this job was likely the biggest challenge I faced in coming to terms with the several problems and cons I did have during these three years. As mentioned, I have no intention to give up on this teaching/mentoring thing (taking the time for this long blog post is part of this!), but it will surely not be the same thing. I'm very grateful I had a chance to try this job out. Thanks to all who made it possible, from family to advisors, colleagues, and students ❤️. I owe you big time.</p>
<p>[Of course, being a prof does not necessarily make you a smart or great person. Some profs I know are some of the dumbest people I have ever met (by far) and they would not survive one day in the real world. And some profs I know are the most asshole, selfish, egomaniac, and delusional humans I have ever heard of (Are you pushing your students to stay in the lab …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the little things I don’t like about Twitter, or social media in general, is how it demands you to constantly create new content to keep people’s attention.</p><p>I understand the value of creating new tweets or instagram posts, sharing ephemeral updates that entertain and engage for a short while and keep your presence fresh in the minds of your audience. That’s how discovery-based social media works.</p><p>But I’ll be the first to admit that I’m a fan of things that you can do once, but reap the benefits of again and again, preferably growing over time.</p><p>And hence I prefer intent-driven search, because if I can show up for a relevant search and satisfy the searcher’s query well enough with my content, I can reap the benefits of that content today, tomorrow, and into the future.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve read in theory about SEO for long enough, without ever having practiced it strategically in the long term. One of the growth pillars for DelightChat is based on SEO, so I might as well move on from theory and get started with real world learnings.</p><p>My personal blog <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog" target="_blank">Preetamnath.com</a> is the first such long-term experiment.&nbsp;</p><p>I started publishing regularly on June 4, exact 4 months ago. Back then, my blog was to get 50 impressions/day on search results. Today, the average is at 1000/day. That’s a solid 20x jump.</p><figure id="w-node-8f3ea7c3f7d8-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f79561d425f076bba77e965_search%20traffic%20on%20preetamnath%20console.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Clicks have gone up from 3/day to 30/day, which is a 10x jump. Looks like clicks didn’t grow as well as impressions, perhaps there’s a layer of optimisation that I could look into over there.<br></p><p>I first noticed that my blog was showing up for “micro saas”, “shopify app ideas” and related long term keywords. Back then I hadn’t thought too deeply about it. But I did end up making a page called <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/habit-tracker-app" target="_blank">Habit Tracker App</a> as an experiment, which I published on August 2 (little over 2 months ago).</p><p>Since then, my habit tracker landing page has garnered 4,700+ impressions and 239 clicks directly from Google Search. This is completely on autopilot, I’ve never updated the page since I first posted.</p><figure id="w-node-d230c6cb7bbb-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f79567f6493631e80a0a6e1_habit%20tracker%20search%20organic%20traffic.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>June 4-Oct 3 data. Habit tracker was published on August 2.</em></figcaption></figure><p>But the #1 keyword for which my website draws search traffic is “micro saas”. It shouldn’t have taken me this long, but today I’m doubling down on that keyword by creating a dedicated page called Micro SaaS.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For my page, I did basic research around</p><ul role="list"><li>Which search terms related to “Micro SaaS” is my blog already ranking.</li><li>What are the suggested keywords and questions that I see when I type “Micro SaaS” on Google.</li><li>What are the related search phrase suggestions I see from Keywords Everywhere.

Over the next week or two, I’ll fill the page with more content, as well as curate links to existing resources wherever I find a relevant high-quality one.</p><figure id="w-node-a56e744a481d-2f0d8df6"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e085291ed2a2769a872e587/5f79692b952b4acb01bc7e6b_micro%20saas%20keywords%20research.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>I’ll report back on results in a month.<br></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imposter syndrome is something that I have been battling with my entire life. Often times I get the feeling that whatever success &nbsp;I have acquired over the years might have just been luck or maybe things worked out because I partnered with the right people who did all the work while I reaped the fruits. </p><p>This feeling started all the way back in school when I scored the highest marks in an exam which everybody else struggled with. </p><p>At the time I was convinced that the only reason this happened was because I was lucky enough to have studied that one question in the syllabus which nobody thought would appear in the exam but ended up appearing. </p><p>But here’s the thing, because I felt like a fraud I ended up studying harder for the next exam with the fear of being exposed as someone who just got lucky in the last one. So is this feeling really a bad thing?</p><h3>‍<br>‍<strong>Why does imposter syndrome occur?</strong><br></h3><p>From my personal experience, I can say that imposter syndrome mainly occurs in people who have self taught themselves the skill that they are currently using to make a living. </p><p>In my case it is software development. I was not particularly good at it in college even though I was studying computer science. I was just an average student if not below average.</p><p>After I left college I started working in early stage startups where there is no structure or someone to teach you stuff. The only option is to do your own research and learn things yourself. Google and Stack overflow were my only true friends.</p><p>Because I never really went through a “standard program” I always have this self doubt and I never know if the way I am doing things is the right way or not and the fact that there is no defined right way of doing things in software does not make this any easier.<br></p><h3><strong>How do you use this as a strength</strong><br></h3><p>My co-founder and I built a business that <a href="https://www.preetamnath.com/blog/grow-shopify-micro-saas-to-25k-mrr-in-14-months" target="_blank">we grew to $25k MRR</a>. Because of my imposter syndrome I have convinced myself that most of it was luck. We were in the right place at the right time. <br></p><p>The fact that we did 2 months of research on the market and product, spent a lot of time figuring out where we would get distribution from even before writing a single line of code seemed to have conveniently slipped my mind. The reason we even did all of this in the first place was our fear of not being good enough.<br></p><p>We have now started a <a href="https://www.delightchat.io/" target="_blank">new venture</a> and hired a team. Now because of the fact that we had a successful venture in the past, I am now under immense pressure to make this new one a success otherwise I might get exposed as a “fraud” or someone who “just got lucky”. <br></p><p>Because I have no other option but to make this a success I am going to work hard once again just like I did in my last venture. I would like to think that this imposter syndrome has turned into a strength. It is a feature and not a bug.<br></p><h3><strong>Closing notes</strong><br></h3><p>Some amount of self doubt is healthy and it keeps you on your toes. It also prevents you from letting your previous success go to your head and always be open for new learnings.<br></p><p>It enables you to be open to the suggestions given by your teammates which you might otherwise ignore just because they are less experienced than you if you had no self doubt at all. <br></p><p>Having said that, it is also not right to doubt yourself to an extent where it starts impacting you in a negative way. For instance, what if your teammates catch wind of your immense self doubt and they start losing faith in you? This is also not something you can afford.<br></p><p>One must have a healthy balance of self doubt and faith in yourself that you are moving in the right direction.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

October 3, 2020 | http://www.infinitepartitions.com/cgi-bin/showarticle.cgi?article=art001 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.infinitepartitions.com/cgi-bin/showarticle.cgi?article=art001">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><tbody><tr><td><div id="main">
<p>
In this article I describe the DEFLATE algorithm that GZIP implements and depends on. The DEFLATE algorithm uses a combination of LZ77, Huffman codes and run-length-encoding; this article describes each in detail by walking through an example and developing source code to implement the algorithm. My aim is to implement readable rather than efficient or extensible code. I'll focus here on unzipping, rather than zipping, but by the end of the article, the zipping process should be clear.
</p>
<p>
Material intended for human consumption tends to be highly redundant, from an information processing perspective. Because of the mysterious human mind, we need to have the same thing repeated to us in different ways in order for it to be processed correctly. Natural language, for example, is inefficient - the English language phrase "I am going to the store" could easily be abbreviated "I go store". If the subject of conversation has already been established as "me", it could be further abbreviated unambiguously as "go store". This is how children communicate until they are taught proper grammar - but as we mature, we like/want/need the redundancy.
</p>
<p>
Computers are no better when it comes to demanding redundancy. Computer programs repeat the same instructions over and over again, and program source code is verbose, even when the programmer isn't concerned about using readable variable names (you know who you are). Computer storage, on the other hand, is a scarce resource. It becomes less and less scarce every day, but every time capacity increases, we seem to find a way to run out of it. I'm sure that someday, my children will be complaining that their thumbnail computer devices can "only store four holodeck simulations!"
</p>
<p>
Computer scientists have been studying ways to use computer storage more efficiently since the 1960s. In 1977, Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv published "A Universal Algorithm for Sequential Data Compression " [1] which described what is now referred to as the "LZ77" compression algorithm. Conceptually, LZ77 is pretty straightforward - read the source document, and, for each sequence of bytes encountered, search backward through the document to see if the same sequence occurs previously. If so, rather than outputting the sequence, output a back pointer to the first occurrence of the sequence.
</p>
<p>
To get a sense of just how redundant English text is, take a look at figure 1 and figure 2. Figure 1 contains the first few verses of the Bible's book of Genesis and figure 2 shows all of the places where text from a prior point in the document is repeated. LZ77 does a very good job of exploiting that redundancy and making efficient use of available storage.
</p>

</p><p>Figure 2: LZW compression</p>

<p>
The first 17 verses, with LZ77 compression applied, is shown below. The &lt;#,#&gt; brackets indicate backpointers in the form &lt;distance, length&gt;. So, the first backpointer &lt;25,5&gt; indicates that, to uncompress the document, search backward 25 characters, and reproduce the five characters you find there. As you can see, the first sentence is mostly uncompressed, but by the middle of the text, there's almost no uncompressed text.

</p>
<p>
Example 1: LZ77 compressed representation of the first 17 verses of Genesis
</p>
<p>
This relatively short document is compressed at just over 3:1 - and the compression ratio generally improves as documents get longer.
</p>
<p>
Of course, when discussing computer formats, it's not enough to talk about concepts - a concrete representation must be agreed upon. The decoder/decompressor must have a way to distinguish which input bytes are literals, and which input bytes are backpointers. One simple, naive representation might be to introduce an "escape code" - say, 0x255, to distinguish backpointers from literals. Of course, a literal escape code would need to be similarly escaped.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, all of these escape codes end up defeating the purpose of compressing in the first place. As it turns out, there's a better way to encode these backpointers and still allow them to be correctly distinguished from literals: variable length codes. In ordinary byte-oriented data, each code is a fixed length (typically 8 bits). Variable length codes remove this restriction. Some codes can be shorter and some can be longer. Once there's no need to restrict yourself to eight-bit bytes, you can define an arbitrarily-sized "alphabet", which is exactly what GZIP does. The first 255 characters in this alphabet are the literal codes - the 8-bit bytes that were read from the input stream. The 256th character is a "stop code" that tells the decode when to stop decoding. The 257-285th codes indicate the length of the matched range (followed immediately by a distance code).
</p>
<p>
Now, if there are only 285-257=28 length codes, that doesn't give the LZ77 compressor much room to reuse previous input. Instead, the deflate format uses the 28 pointer codes as an indication to the decompressor as to how many extra bits follow which indicate the actual length of the match. This logic is complex but important for compatibility; I'll cover it in more detail below.
</p>
<p>
In a fixed-length world, this 285-symbol alphabet would require 9 bits per symbol, but would use only a little more than half of the available 512 bytes that 9 bits can encode. This alphabet can be encoded much more efficiently by assigning the symbols variable-length codes. However, the problem with variable length codes is that the decoder needs to know where one code ends and the other begins. This isn't a problem with fixed-length codes such as ASCII - the decoder reads 8 bits, decodes them, and then reads another 8 bits. To ensure that the encoder can unambiguously interpret the variable length codes, you have to be careful how you assign these codes. Imagine that you were dealing with a four-character "alphabet" with four variable-length codes:
</p>
<pre>1. A: 1
2. B: 0
3. C: 10
4. D: 11
</pre>
<p>
Example 2: Invalid variable-length code assignment
</p>
<p>
The problem with this assignment is that the codes are ambiguous. The decoder can't tell if the input sequence "10" is an A followed by a B, or a C by itself.
</p>
<p>
The solution is to assign prefix codes. With prefix codes, once you use a prefix to delineate a range of codes, it can't be used by itself as a code. So if the character "A" is assigned the 1-bit code "1", no other code can start with "1". If "B" is assigned the code "01", no other code can start with "01". A valid Huffman coding of the four-character alphabet above, then, is:
</p>
<pre>1. A: 1
2. B: 01
3. C: 001
4. D: 000
</pre>
<p>
Example 3: Valid prefix-coding variable-length code assignment
</p>
<p>
This means that there can only be one 1-bit code, one two-bit code, two three-bit codes, four four-bit codes, etc. You may deal with prefix codes on a regular basis - the country calling codes that allow you to make international phone calls are assigned using prefix code rules. Prefix codes are usually referred to as Huffman codes [2] after the inventor of a provably optimal algorithm for generating them when symbol probabilities are known. These Huffman codes are often represented as trees, where each leaf is a symbol, and each branch is a bit value.
</p>
<p>
<img src="http://www.infinitepartitions.com/huffman_tree_1.gif">
</p><p>Figure 3: a prefix code tree</p>

<p>
Once such a tree structure has been constructed, decoding is simple - start at the top of the tree and read in a bit of data. If the bit is a 0, follow the left-branch of the tree; if 1, follow the right-branch. When a leaf node is hit, stop; a symbol has been completely read. Output the symbol and return to the top of the tree.
</p>
<p>
Listing 1 illustrates a tree structure for representing Huffman codes in memory:
</p>
<pre>typedef struct huffman_node_t
{
  int code; // -1 for non-leaf nodes
  struct huffman_node_t *zero;
  struct huffman_node_t *one;
}
huffman_node;
</pre>

<p>As the reading time estimate crept over 30 minutes, without any end in sight, I was starting to feel like a bit of a blowhard.</p>



<p>The draft I’d originally intended to inaugurate this blog is still sitting there. Maybe I will condense and finish it (eventually), but I think it makes more sense to write <s>briefly</s> less long-windedly about what I mean. Instead of trying to exhaust the subject matter, I’m going to offer a perspective, and present a more intuitive argument for it.</p>



<p>So, more briefly, I’d like to ask you to think, for a moment, about what makes humans <em>ethically</em> important. There are two parts to this question, hidden just under the surface. The first asks you to consider why humans are ethical <em>agents</em>. What makes it possible for them to do, want, or experience things that could fall under the umbrella of ethics? The second (no particular order) asks you to consider why humans are ethical <em>patients</em>. How is it that what happens to them, what is wanted of them, or what is experienced about them might also be part of an ethical problem? (This agent/patient distinction I inherit from Coeckelbergh, whose book, <em>Growing Moral Relations</em>, is worth your time.)</p>



<p>I will add before you start: ethics has been defined in a few different ways, over the millennia. I consider a few definitions interesting. </p>



<p>Charles Taylor, for instance, describes ethics as pertaining not just to moral choices and obligations between people, but questions like “what is the good life?” and “what is good?”. His more expansive account, following Aristotle, moves closer to the Greek root, which refers to one’s <em>character</em>, and can be read to have a slant towards something resembling <em>virtue ethics</em>. Using Taylor, we could ask questions like “what is it good to love?” and not just “what is the right way to act?” </p>



<p>Conversely, followers of Nietzsche contrast <em>ethics</em> with <em>morality</em>, arguing that morality is about passing judgment on what people (or living beings) are and do, whereas ethics can be about <em>affirming</em> life as intrinsically self-justifying. From a (post-) Nietzschean point of view, life’s capacity to want, struggle, and change, <em>is, from the very beginning, what is good</em> (maybe not in those words). Living well means trying to overcome the need to judge, and instead to explore and express what it is to be alive, for all its intensities and tragedies. Nietzsche is often read to be asking his readers to abandon compassion, or to think only of themselves and never of the common good, but I don’t think that is exactly the case. Nietzsche is asking us to live in pursuit of what is good, but not to define it as the enemy of the bad, rather, to live <em>for its own sake, come what may</em>, and to do what is good, <em>defined in itself</em>, rather than as a reaction.</p>



<p>I don’t know Coeckelbergh’s position on ethics broadly, but he considers morality to be embedded in social relationships themselves. Rather than what is right or wrong to do to a <em>patient</em> being about its properties (whether it has consciousness, for instance) and defined in absolute terms, morality is about what relationships exist between an agent and a patient, and what kinds of relationships are good to have, knowing what the agent and patient already are to each other. Do I already mostly act like it’s a person? I should probably treat it like one. Coeckelbergh is interesting in that he tries to legitimate ideas that have, until recently, not had much hearing in the community of western philosophers, although citing him as a source for them over others might, fairly, be challenged. For instance, he would consider our dependence on our ecology grounds to entertain an obligation towards it. I haven’t finished his book yet, so I’m not aware of the extent of the advice he gives for considering problems in these relationships, but it seems fair to say that he doesn’t believe there’s a system of absolute rules out there, or that we should try to find final answers to ethical problems. Relationships are particular, and they evolve. We shouldn’t seek to use the fact that we don’t get hard answers for our convenience; instead, we should consider relationships, for their lumpiness, their particularity, their uncertainty, and live them as best we can.</p>



<p>All of these viewpoints are very different from our ordinary patterns of ethical thought. We are used to thinking that <em>individuals</em>, or sometimes <em>social groups</em> (such as nations) have <em>rights</em> that must be guaranteed to them, but everything else goes. Sometimes, referencing Isaiah Berlin, we might say we believe that this obligation is <em>negative</em> (there are some things that people are fundamentally allowed to do, and our only obligation is to stop people who try to mess with that), or it is <em>positive</em> (there are some things that people should fundamentally be allowed to do, and we need to do our best to make that possible for them). Maybe, for whatever definition of the good, we are utilitarians, who think that we should do the most good for the most people, whatever means that could entail. Perhaps we take the <em>view from afar</em>, and ask “if I had the choice of all reasonably possible societies, which would I like to be born into, knowing that I might be anyone?” Perhaps we see ethics as different versions of the trolley problem, and find reasons, based on our moral intuitions, about what choices we should make when push comes to shove. Some of us, unfashionably, believe in immortal souls and divine law, against which we must not sin, or that her majesty inherits the right to judge from God, and that the highest good is obedience to an Earthly law. A scientist, being familiar with Hume, might read his argument that we cannot derive statements about what <em>ought to be</em> from statements about what <em>is</em>, and see cause to be an anti-realist. Maybe <em>ought</em> statements only express our personal preferences, derived from what we’ve been either (or both) biologically or socially conditioned to think is pleasing. Scientists might say this implies some sort of <em>relativism</em>, or that it’s best to follow whatever is the <em>conventional</em> way to think about ethics (although, if we’re not in the business of assuming the world is already a pretty just place to be in, that last one may not be safe). </p>



<p>So, knowing what you know about what humans are made of, and how they relate to one another, to society, or to other beings, what makes them ethical agents, and what does it mean that they are? What about patients? I think it’s probably a bad idea to try to find an answer too quickly. It might be better to think through what kinds of approaches are better, and what facts could be relevant to the question. For instance, maybe the way people want things matters, as it is defined in terms of elaborations on what’s generated by the default mode network. Maybe there can’t be exactly one right answer, or maybe there must be, or maybe it’s impossible to know. How would you argue that?</p>



<h2>Why it Matters </h2>



<p>I don’t fully agree with Taylor, but, in <em>Sources of the Self</em>, he makes a good case for why we shouldn’t be self-serving, and why we already care about ethics. He says ethics are about what we <em>want to be</em>, how we identify ourselves. This is always done in terms of social groups we identify <em>with</em>. “I am a professional, so I should…” Identity gives us community, people who share something about us (a way of life, perhaps), or maybe it contrasts us against a community (we can identify ourselves as rebels). We rarely, if ever, identify with just one thing, and it’s no use to try to come up with a completely original identity, if it’s possible to do it meaningfully at all, because it doesn’t tell us much about what we’re trying to be, given we’re the only one who would know or care that we’re being it. Identity is critically important to us in interpreting our place in the world, and what we are trying to do with it. So, says he, without identity, we would struggle to come to grips with life. It is a good thing, then, that you and I already have some ideas about <em>who we are</em>, or if we’re struggling to figure that out, generally already acknowledge that it <em>is</em> an important thing to get down. Taylor says that, since it’s all about coming to grips with life, we escape Hume’s is/ought problem, because we don’t have to set up an ethics from scratch. Ethics are already there from the beginning, and have some known properties, so we can argue about them by contrasting them. “Given these two frameworks, which one of them provides the richer set of tools for figuring out how to live a good life?” To Taylor, ethics are certainly <em>real</em>, but not in the sense that they’re an object embedded in a reality perfectly detached from us, rather, they come <em>from</em> the fact that we are social creatures, and relate <em>to</em> how we are trying to live in society. They aren’t just individual, or perfectly culturally relative (as there are no perfectly incommensurable cultures, which share none of the same moral ideas and cannot communicate with each other), but they aren’t exactly objective and final either.</p>



<p>I like Taylor, for how he grounds consciousness of <em>ethics</em> in <em>social consciousness</em>, and I like how good he is at striking down the (usually unanswerable) “why should I care about ethics?” question. I share Coeckelbergh’s complaint that he considers only one kind of relation (between the individual and the community), and I would also gripe that his ethics are unusually centred on the <em>self</em>, for a subject that tends to ask us to think beyond ourselves. But then, that is why the argument against selfishness works so well. It’s difficult to get through to somebody who only thinks of themself unless that’s the place you’re starting from. </p>



<p>Taylor’s other issues, which I will not go too in-depth on here, are first, that he frames the source of ethics as appearing in the fact that one is an <em>ind…</em></p></div></section></main></div></div>

<h2>What’s wrong with Disqus</h2>
<p>Disqus loads absurd amount of tracking services, which exposes your visitors’
personal data and significantly increases loading time. See, e.g., 
<a href="http://donw.io/post/github-comments/#what-s-wrong-with-disqus">this post</a>.</p>
<h2>What’s not covered here</h2>
<p>For a static website, one usually wants a lightweight commenting server with
as little dependencies as possible. Few commenting engines listed on the page
are provided by heavy applications (e.g.,
<a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">discourse</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/debiki/talkyard">talkyard</a>), but the majority are
relatively lightweight applications designed specifically to provide 
comments for the static pages.</p>
<p>This page prioritizes information on self-hosted comments. However, there
are other open-source solutions, including implementations of third-party
services (e.g., Github issues, such as
<a href="https://github.com/imsun/gitment">[1]</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/gitalk/gitalk">[2]</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Blankj/awesome-comment">[3]</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/utterance/utterances">[4]</a>).</p>
<h2>Stars vs. time</h2>
<p>The figure below shows some of the top competitors except for Discourse (as it's not
just a light commenting server like others). The figure is useful to
indirectly estimate how active the project is.</p>

  <p>The internet is pretty cool; right now I’m watching some Harvard lectures on advanced algorithms. This one’s about sorting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>- Me</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s an algorithm?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>- Mom and Dad</p>

<p>I’m hanging out with my parents for the week. Anytime I’m home I try to spend a little time giving my parents a better sense of what I do. Neither have much background in science or engineering, but they always indulge me and ask to hear about what I’m working on.</p>

<p>Clearly explaining complicated things to people who don’t have a background is an invaluable skill. Anytime there’s a chance to practice, take advantage of it.</p>

<p>We ended up on the topic of algorithms, so I decided to play a game. I asked Dad how to describe the steps needed to sort a list of randomly generated integers from smallest to largest. That didn’t get much of a response besides “Well, study the numbers, then put them in order.”</p>

<p>I decided we needed a visual aid. We cut up and numbered some paper square and manually went through the process of creating a random array and then sorting it.</p>

<figure>
	<a href="https://i.imgur.com/f3FobQr.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f3FobQr.png"></a>
</figure>

<p>The first couple iterations of sorting the numbers didn’t make much progress towards describing any sort of algorithm. It sort of just <em>happened</em>. There were some vague mutterings about “this goes over here” and “then the 6 can move here…” and the like.</p>

<p>Eventually, I took over and said he had to tell me what to do instead. I would write down the instructions as we went along. That also didn’t go perfectly. After a couple of tries, a lot of clarifying questions, and a hint or two, however, I was able to write down the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Find min.</li>
  <li>Find max.</li>
  <li>Decide bin size.</li>
  <li>Move min to far left.</li>
  <li>Look right (within bin) for num not in bin.</li>
  <li>Move num to correct bin.</li>
  <li>Within bin, find number just smaller than num, place num in from of smaller number.</li>
  <li>If any num shouldn’t be in bin, put it in the right bin. (Repeat previous 3 steps).</li>
  <li>If all nums in bin are in valid bin, quickly sort “nearby”.</li>
  <li>If nearby is sorted, record max value.</li>
  <li>Do comparison to the right, until you find unsorted num.</li>
  <li>Check for nums in wrong bin.</li>
  <li>Either go back to putting nums in right bin, or go back to quickly sorting “nearby”.</li>
  <li>Check if array is sorted.</li>
</ol>

<p>By this point, both parents were sufficiently through with the conversation. But I had to take it one step further and turn this algorithm into working code.</p>

<p>After a few quick sessions ChuckSort was born. You can check out the source code on GitHub for more details.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Jessime/ChuckSort">https://github.com/Jessime/ChuckSort</a></p>

<p>You’ll notice that the algorithm in <code>chuck_sort.py</code> isn’t exactly the same as what’s above. It morphed a bit over the 3-4 short sessions it took me to write it up. I’m fine with that. The essence of what happened with those little paper squares is still captured in this repo. The fun bit is that the code actually works. Here’s the algorithm sorting 1 through 100:</p>

<figure>
	<a href="https://i.imgur.com/jcf92Mo.gif"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jcf92Mo.gif"></a>
</figure>

<p>This exercise reminded me of two things.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Learning to think algorithmically is difficult and not something humans do intuitively. In some sense, this is great news for beginner programmers who often feel a lot of frustration about the difficulty of programming and their lack of progress. It’s normal! Becoming a good programmer is so much more than learning the syntax of a language. It’s about expression. It’s about taking hold of thoughts in your head and clarifying those thoughts until they can ultimately be expressed in binary. When you’re programming in the context of something like bioinformatics, it’s also about capturing real-world phenomena in some accurate way.</li>
  <li>Even if <em>you’re</em> used to thinking programmatically, it’s hard to capture what someone’s doing to process some task. Even when the process is as simple as sorting 20 numbers, I was never able to fully capture what Dad was doing to sort the numbers. I’m no psychologist, but it feels like this observation has interesting implications for assuming the intent or rationale of other humans. Given the political climate (there’s been a lot of politics this week), I find it entertaining how often we say things like, “He obviously did this because he wanted to…”, or “All of those people think that…”. It’s absurd. I can’t even tell you why my own father sorted 20 numbers the way he did. How are you going to assert the intentions of some random person you’ve never met on some complex political topic? I digress…</li>
</ol>

<p>tl;dr: Formalizing the world into code is <em>tricky</em>, but fun!</p>

<p>This page gives an introduction to time-difference-of-arrrival (TDOA) based localization of transmitters and presents a simple practical system using three RTL-SDRs to localize signals in a city. I have presented the work at the Software Defined Radio Academy 2017 in Friedrichshafen, Germany. Because of the great feedback, I decided to put the related material online. The resources can be found at the end of this page.</p>
<p>For further questions please contact me at dc9st&lt;at&gt;panoradio-sdr.de. Furthermore, I would like to say thanks to my former colleague Claus and the Amateur Radio Research Group of TU Kaiserslautern for their support.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Transmitter localization is a both interesting and challenging task. Besides applying triangulation in combination with some type of direction finding receivers (using e.g. directional antennas, pseudo Doppler or the interferometer principle), the Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA) method is widely used. In TDOA three or more (non-directional) receivers at different locations capture the unknown transmitted signal. Then it evaluates the differences in arrival time of the signals to calculate the transmitter’s position (multilateration).</p>
<p>This article first provides a short introduction to localization with TDOA. Second, it presents a simple experimental localization system based on three receivers, each consisting of a RTL-SDR USB-Stick and a Raspberry PI. Although the receivers and the overall setup are very simple, localization of transmitters works remarkably well.</p>
<h2>Basics of Time-Difference-of-Arrival</h2>
<p>Assume a signal is emitted by an (unknown) transmitter and is received by several receivers at different locations. Usually the signal arrives at different times at the different receivers due to the varying distances between transmitter and receivers. This difference in arrival time is called “TDOA”. A TDOA value can be measured between a pair of receivers. It should be emphasized, that we work on the time <em>difference</em> of arrival, since any absolute arrival times in relation to transmission times are in general not available (as opposed to other localization techniques like time-of-arrival, TOA).</p>
<p>To understand the idea of TDOA localization, consider a simple example based on only two receivers and an unknown transmitter as depicted in the figure below. First, assume that the signal arrives at both receivers at the same point in time, i.e. TDOA = 0s. Then it is obvious, that the distance from the transmitter to receiver 1 is the same as to receiver 2. The transmitter must be located somewhere on a straight line in the middle between the two receivers. This is not yet a unique position, but narrows the possible positions to a line.</p>
<div id="attachment_745"><p><a href="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-745" loading="lazy" src="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle.jpg" alt="" width="671" height="387" srcset="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle.jpg 671w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle-300x173.jpg 300w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_basic_principle-500x288.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-745">TDOA system with 2 receivers in three cases: TDOA &gt; 0s, TDOA = 0s and TDOA &lt;0s. The possible TX positions form a hyperbola.</p></div>
<p>Now assume a second case, where the signal arrives earlier at receiver 1 and later at receiver 2. The TDOA value now becomes non-zero. This means, that the distance from transmitter to receiver 1 is smaller as to receiver 2 (Note, that a TDOA value can be converted to a distance by multiplication with propagation speed). In this case, the possible locations lie on a hyperbola with one of the receivers in its focal point.</p>
<p>To complete localization, more than two receivers are required – at least three for two dimensional localization in a plane. The above described method to create hyperbolas is applied pairwise to each receiver, such that for three receivers three hyperbolas can be generated (four receivers would yield ten hyperbolas). Ideally, all hyperbolas intersect at a single location on the map, that is the transmitter’s position.</p>
<div id="attachment_744"><p><a href="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-744" loading="lazy" src="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="331" srcset="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle.jpg 527w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle-300x199.jpg 300w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_3_hyperbola_principle-453x300.jpg 453w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-744">Exact TDOA localization with 3 receivers and thus 3 hyperbolas with mulitlateration</p></div>
<p>The achievable resolution and accuracy on a map does not only correspond to the resolution of the TDOA measurement. It is also largely dependent of the transmitter’s location relative to the receivers. The resolution figure below shows, that the accuracy is very good in the area roughly between the receivers and poor elsewhere. In general, TDOA systems perform well in the area that is surrounded by the receivers.</p>

Resolution is heavily dependent on the transmitter’s position relative to the receivers</p></div>
<p>Although the basic idea of TDOA localization is not too complicated, some further issues need to be addressed: First, it is required to synchronize the receivers with each other in time. Second, a means of precisely determining the time differences of arrivals must be used. Third, all receivers must be placed apart, though connected and able to exchange considerable amounts of raw sampled data. These challenges need to be solved to build a practical system and will be treated in the following.</p>
<h2>A Simple Localization System using RTL-SDRs</h2>
<p>A complete TDOA system consists of three synchronized receivers, that are connected to a central signal processing unit. In the following, a simple and cheap system for localizing signals in a city will be described.</p>
<p><strong><em>Receivers</em></strong></p>
<p>The installed receivers are minimalistic and consist each of a RTL-SDR USB-stick (~20 $) and a Raspberry PI (~40 $). The receivers use the simple whip antenna delivered with the RTL-SDR dongle. For practical reasons the antennas had to be placed indoor, which is suboptimal and leaves room for improvement. The RTL-SDR is capable of receiving 2 MHz of instantaneous bandwidth in a range from below 100 MHz to more than 1 GHz. This makes it a cheap and versatile general purpose SDR, capable of receiving various different types of signals.</p>
<p>For the experiments three receivers were deployed around in the city of Kaiserslautern, Germany. The figure below shows the receiver’s positions. For ideal placement and good accuracy the receivers should have been placed outside the city. However, in the surrounding, mostly forestal, areas no suitable internet connection could be established. Despite the suboptimal placement, good accuracy is expected in the area roughly between the receivers.</p>
<div id="attachment_751"><p><a href="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_system_city.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-751" loading="lazy" src="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_system_city.jpg" alt="" width="808" height="503" srcset="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_system_city.jpg 808w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_system_city-300x187.jpg 300w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_system_city-768x478.jpg 768w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_system_city-482x300.jpg 482w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-751">TDOA system setup in the city of Kaiserslautern, Germany</p></div>
<p>All receivers are connected to a master PC for signal processing via internet. The master triggers measurements at each receiver (simultaneously). Then the receivers send the received sampled data back to master for further signal processing and delay analysis. The amount of sampled data can quickly become very large, since the RTL-SDR outputs 8 bit IQ-data with 2 MHz. This creates a data rate of 2 x 8 bit x 2 MHz = 32 Mbit/s per receiver. With an available DSL upload of 1 Mbit/s, transferring only 1 s of sampled data already takes approximately half a minute. Reducing the sample rate of the RTL-SDR or employing compression may relax data rates.</p>
<p>It is important, that the three receivers are tuned to exactly the same frequency. For that purpose the RTL-SDR’s frequencies are calibrated with special frequency correction busts, emitted by GSM base stations. Calibration with GSM signals is easy using the <a href="https://github.com/steve-m/kalibrate-rtl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kalibrate-rtl</a> software.</p>
<p><em><strong>Synchronization</strong></em></p>
<p>As mentioned above, a prerequisite for TDOA localization is the synchronization of the receivers. One possibility is to use a GPS receiver, that disciplines the Raspberry PI’s internal clock. However, the system utilizes a different method using a transmitter with known location as a reference, that is received well by all three receivers. There is a DAB+ transmitter (217 MHz, 2 kW) in the city of Kaiserslautern, that covers a large area and is perfect for synchronization.</p>
<p>Synchronization with a reference receiver works as follows: When the master triggers a measurement, each receiver first receives some samples of the reference receiver and then seamlessly switches to the unknown transmitter’s signal of interest. For synchronization, the master aligns the three receptions from the different receivers to each other on the time axis. Alignment is done in such a way, that the delay in the reference signal portion corresponds to the known distances of the reference transmitter to the receivers. Once the complete received signal is synchronized (or aligned) the TDOA of the unknown signals is simply calculated as the delay. Precisely spoken, this technique does not synchronize the receivers themselves, but rather the received signals.</p>
<div id="attachment_742"><p><a href="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-742" loading="lazy" src="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal.png" alt="" width="550" height="232" srcset="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal.png 670w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal-300x127.png 300w, http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tdoa_with_reference_signal-500x211.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-742">RTL-SDR signal for TDOA, first recording a reference transmitter (DAB+), then switching to the unkown transmitter’s signal.</p></div>
<p>The critical point for the synchronization is the requirement to switch between the frequencies <em>seamlessly</em>, such that not a single sample gets lost (otherwise, this will impair synchronization). Modifying the C library <a href="https://github.com/steve-m/librtlsdr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">librtlsdr</a> (commonly used for controlling the RTL-SDR) to perform seamless frequency switching using the “rtl_sdr” command made it crash during execution. The solution is to use a modified branch of the librtlsdr, called “<a href="https://github.com/mutability/librtlsdr/tree/async-rearrangements">async-rearrangements</a>” as a basis. Modifying this library for seamless frequency switching worked perfectly fine and showed that the RTL-SDR can do so.</p>
<p>The modified lib <a href="https://github.com/DC9ST/librtlsdr-2freq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">librtlsdr-2freq</a> for switching between two frequencies is available as open source software.</p>
<p><strong><em>Signal Processing</em></strong></p>
<p>Measuring the delay between two inputs precisely is the most important operation for TDOA. For that purpose the correlation function is suitable. It is defined as</p>
<p><span data-display="true"> Corr(\tau) = \sum_{t=0}^{N-1}s_1(t)s_2(t+\tau)</span></p><p>(s1, s2 are the real signals received by RX1 and 2) and outputs for every hypothetical delay <span data-display="false"> \tau</span> between the two signals a value indicating how good the two signals match. The delay value of <span data-display="false"> \tau</span>, at which the correlation function has a peak is the delay between the signals (see also my <a href="http://www.panoradio-sdr.de/correlation-for-time-delay-analysis/">detailed description of correlation</a> and <a href="http://www.dspguide.com/ch7/3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steven W.

<p>I still remember the first time I got an email from somebody asking me to link to their website.</p>
<p>They addressed me by name, described one of my blog posts in detail, and asked if I could include their link. It seemed so strange. Why on earth would somebody take the time to write me a personal email, just for a silly link—from a random blog that nobody was reading!</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve learned that these emails are common. Indeed, there are entire businesses built around finding ways to send these kinds of emails effectively and at scale. I didn’t know it, but a link is a powerful thing</p>
<p>There’s a lot of reasons for this. Your website won’t appear on search engines unless somebody links to it. Multiple links can improve your search engine ranking. Links can be a steady source of new visitors and they serve as an endorsement of your site. A single link can have a huge impact.</p>
<p>A link, on the open internet, is a vote. It’s your way of saying, “<em>this is great, and more people should know about it.</em>” We talk about how much power the search engines have, but if you think about it, the search engines listen to us. They see what we link to, what we click, and how long we stay.* At the end of the day, <em>we</em> are the curators of what gets surfaced on the internet.</p>
<p>This is one reason why it’s been so disappointing to see so many people leave their independent blogs in favor of social media platforms (like Medium) for creating content. When people post on these platforms, they lose their voice because the links aren’t the same! They’re often altered with <code>rel="nofollow"</code> attributes, which prevents search engines from crawling the links or counting them toward search rankings. There are reasons for this, but the result is that the links you post lose their power.</p>
<p>I continue to occasionally get emails from marketers asking me to link to their stuff. And while it’s annoying to receive spam, it’s also a reminder of the power I wield, just by having an independent website where I can link to whatever I want.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p>
<small>* Of course there are downsides, including the legitimate privacy concerns around search engines watching us too closely. 👀</small>

<p>Responding to something I wrote long ago and can no longer find (this happens more and more), a reader asked me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does your head really tingle when you are learning something you find interesting?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It actually does. It really can get intense. Sadly, this pleasant phenomenon is getting rare as I age, although I do still get it from time to time. It's usually associated with learning that broadens in my horizons in some non-trivial way, a meaningful or especially interesting insight, that "light bulb going on" feeling. Sometimes it's just sheer density of information, if I'm actually getting it. I never get that feeling when I feel stumped or overloaded; only when I think I'm successfully taking it in.</p>
<p>I remember a really strong example of this phenomenon from university. My head got so buzzy it was like being high. It felt really, really good. Probably not a coincidence that the lady professor was super cute. It was the <i>learning</i> high, definitely, just … crush-enhanced. ☺</p>
<p>Does <em>your</em> head tingle when you learn?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, or Wasm, is an open standard that allows developers to build apps that run inside a web browser using compiled programming languages. With WebAssembly, it’s possible to write components of web apps in languages such as C/C++, Rust, C#, and Go, among others, which run within the same sandbox as JavaScript. This allows things like porting existing libraries, leveraging capabilities not available in JavaScript, and running code faster because WebAssembly is compiled into a binary format.</p><p>Recently, I’ve been experimenting with WebAssembly to be able to run some Go code in the browser. Specifically, I’ve been trying to port certain parts of <a href="https://github.com/italypaleale/prvt">prvt</a>, an open source project for storing end-to-end encrypted documents, to run within a web browser directly. The reason for the WebAssembly experiment was two-fold: first, prvt makes extensive uses of cryptography and streams, both things which are not yet great in JavaScript; second, prvt itself is written in Go, so being able to re-use code in the browser would significantly simplify development.</p><blockquote><p>For an <strong>introduction to using WebAssembly with Go</strong>, I recommend <a href="https://golangbot.com/webassembly-using-go/">this article on Golang Bot</a>.<br>Additionally, more information can be found in the Go project’s <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly">GitHub wiki</a> and in the documentation for the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/">syscall/js</a> package.<br>Note that as of writing, <strong>WebAssembly support in Go is still experimental</strong>. Because of that, the APIs might change too. This article was tested against Go 1.15.</p></blockquote><p>This article contains four different yet connected things that I’ve learnt while working on the WebAssembly port, and which I thought useful to share.</p><ol><li>Working with and creating JavaScript objects from Go code</li><li>Creating Promises in Go for passing async results</li><li>Making HTTP requests from Go code</li><li>Streaming from Go code</li></ol><h2 id="javascript-objects-in-webassembly-and-go">JavaScript objects in WebAssembly and Go</h2><p>The WebAssembly runtime for Go automatically converts the most common Go types to their JavaScript equivalent. The documentation for the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/#ValueOf">js.ValueOf</a> method contains a nice summary table of how Go and JavaScript types are matched:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="text">| Go                     | JavaScript             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| js.Value               | [its value]            |
| js.Func                | function               |
| nil                    | null                   |
| bool                   | boolean                |
| integers and floats    | number                 |
| string                 | string                 |
| []interface{}          | new array              |
| map[string]interface{} | new object             |
</code></pre></div><p>From here, you can see that the most common types, such as numbers, booleans, and strings, are converted automatically. The last row is particularly interesting as it explains how to pass “Plain Old JavaScript Objects” (POJO’s), which are the simplest kinds of objects (also called dictionaries).</p><p>For example, the following Go code defines a function called <code>MyGoFunc</code> that can be called from JavaScript code, which returns a dictionary with a string and a number (as you can see, types can be heterogeneous).</p><blockquote><p>For instructions of how to compile Go code into WebAssembly, check out the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/WebAssembly#getting-started">Getting Started section</a> of the Wiki.</p></blockquote><p>After having compiled the code into WebAssembly and having imported it in the JavaScript code, you can call <code>MyGoFunc()</code> from JavaScript to see the result. For example:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>MyGoFunc</span><span>())</span>
<span>// Prints: {hello: "world", answer: 42}
</span></code></pre></div><p>However, what the documentation is less explicit about is that we can also <strong>use any JavaScript object</strong> inside the Go code, <strong>even built-ins</strong>! And this is where things can start getting more interesting.</p><p>For example, let’s try to pass a date as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date"><code>Date</code></a> object. To do that, we first need to grab the <code>Date</code> constructor, loading its <code>js.Value</code> from the global scope of JS:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>dateConstructor</span> <span>:=</span> <span>js</span><span>.</span><span>Global</span><span>().</span><span>Get</span><span>(</span><span>"Date"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Then, we can create a new object off this constructor with the <code>dateConstructor.New</code> method, passing any argument to it as you’d pass to the <code>new Date()</code> constructor in JavaScript. The result of the invocation is a <code>js.Value</code> that can be returned to JavaScript:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>dateConstructor</span><span>.</span><span>New</span><span>(</span><span>"2020-10-01"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>So, we can modify our <code>MyGoFunc</code> to return the current date as computed in Go:</p><p>Invoking <code>MyGoFunc()</code> in the JavaScript code will now return a <code>Date</code> object:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>let</span> <span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyGoFunc</span><span>()</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>typeof</span> <span>d</span><span>)</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>d</span> <span>instanceof</span> <span>Date</span><span>)</span>
<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>())</span>

<span>/*
</span><span>Prints:

</code></pre></div><h2 id="async-js-with-promises-from-go">Async JS with Promises from Go</h2><p>In JavaScript, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise"><code>Promise</code>'s</a> are the foundation of async/await. If you need a refresher on Promises, <a href="https://javascript.info/promise-basics">this is a good article</a>.</p><p>For example, consider this code, which creates a Promise that resolves with a message (<a href="https://www.mamalisa.com/?t=es&amp;p=5534">an Italian tongue-twister</a>) after 3 seconds:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>const</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>((</span><span>resolve</span><span>,</span> <span>reject</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>setTimeout</span><span>(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>resolve</span><span>(</span><span>"sopra la panca la capra campa, sotto la panca la capra crepa"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>},</span> <span>3000</span><span>)</span>
<span>})</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In an <code>async</code> function, you can then <code>await</code> on the Promise above, so after 3 seconds you receive the message:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>// This is an async function, which can contain "await" statements inside
</span><span></span><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>MyFunc</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Create the Promise
</span><span></span>    <span>const</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>((</span><span>resolve</span><span>,</span> <span>reject</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// After a 3 second timeout, this calls "resolve" with the message we're passing
</span><span></span>        <span>setTimeout</span><span>(()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>resolve</span><span>(</span><span>"sopra la panca la capra campa, sotto la panca la capra crepa"</span><span>)</span>
        <span>},</span> <span>3000</span><span>)</span>
    <span>})</span>
    <span>// Await for the Promise - this resolves after 3 seconds
</span><span></span>    <span>const</span> <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>p</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>message</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Invoking <code>MyFunc()</code> will show <code>sopra la panca la capra campa, sotto la panca la capra crepa</code> in the console.</p><p>When working with Wasm in Go, Promises are particularly important.</p><p>In fact, as per the documentation, you cannot make blocking calls in Go inside a function that is invoked by JavaScript directly—if you do that, you’ll get an immediate deadlock and your app will crash. Instead, the documentation recommends that all blocking calls be inside a goroutine, which raises the problem of then returning the value to the JavaScript code. Quoting from the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/syscall/js/#FuncOf">docs</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Invoking the wrapped Go function from JavaScript will pause the event loop and spawn a new goroutine. Other wrapped functions which are triggered during a call from Go to JavaScript get executed on the same goroutine.<br>As a consequence, if one wrapped function blocks, JavaScript’s event loop is blocked until that function returns. Hence, calling any async JavaScript API, which requires the event loop, like fetch (http.Client), will cause an immediate deadlock. Therefore a blocking function should explicitly start a new goroutine.</p></blockquote><p>Using a Promise is perhaps the best way to solve this problem: avoiding deadlocks while allowing programming with idiomatic JavaScript.</p><p>We saw in the previous section that we can create custom JavaScript objects from Go, and this applies to Promises too! We just need to create the <code>Promise</code> object by passing a function to the constructor. Just like in the pure-JS code above, this function receives two arguments, which are functions themselves: <code>resolve</code> should be invoked with the final result when the Promise’s work is done, and <code>reject</code> can be called when there’s an error to make the Promise fail.</p><p>Here’s an updated <code>MyGoFunc</code> that resolves with a message (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/yoursay/tongue_twisters/italian/trotting_trentonians.shtml">another Italian tongue twister!</a>) after 3 seconds:</p><p>To invoke this from JavaScript:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>MyFunc</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Get the Promise from Go
</span><span></span>    <span>const</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyGoFunc</span><span>()</span>

    <span>// Await for the Promise to resolve
</span><span></span>    <span>const</span> <span>message</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>p</span>
    <span>// Show the current timestamp in seconds, then the result of the Promise

</span><span>*/</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If your Go code errors, you can throw exceptions to JavaScript by using the <code>reject</code> function instead. For example:</p><p>When you invoke this from JavaScript, you will see the returned object about half of the times, and you’ll get an exception the other half. Note that we’re invoking the <code>reject</code> function with an actual JavaScript <code>Error</code> object, as best practice in JavaScript!</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>MyFunc</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="making-http-requests-from-go-code">Making HTTP requests from Go code</h2><p>Finally, let’s look at how we can use Go and WebAssembly to make HTTP requests, a very common task. For example, you can do this inside a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers">Service Worker</a> to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FetchEvent">intercept network requests</a> and have Go process them instead (that’s what I’m doing with prvt, so the Go code can decrypt the files).</p><p>There are two important things to keep in mind:</p><ol><li>Network calls from Go are blocking, so they must be executed in a separate Goroutine. Because of that, we should return a Promise from Go to JavaScript that eventually resolves with the result of the network request.</li><li>If your goal is to intercept network requests, then your Go code should return the response wrapped in a JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response"><code>Response</code></a> object.</li></ol><p>Here’s an example:</p><p>We can then use it in our JavaScript code to invoke any REST API and get the result as if it were a <code>fetch</code> request. For example, in the code below we’re making a call to the <a href="https://taylor.rest/">taylor.rest</a> API, which returns a random quote from Taylor Swift:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>async</span> <span>function</span> <span>MyFunc</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

<p><span lang="FR">Radix Sort Revisited<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="EN-GB">Pierre <span>Terdiman</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Last revision: 04.01.2000<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="FR">In every decent
programmer’s toolbox lies a strange weapon called a Radix Sort. Where does it
come from&nbsp;? Who invented it&nbsp;? I don’t know. As far as I can remember
it was there, fast, easy, effective. <i>Really</i> effective. So unbelievably
useful I’ve never really understood why people would want to use something
else. The reasons&nbsp;? Most of the time, they tell me about floats, negative
values, and why their new quick-sort code rocks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Enough, I’m tired.
Although the standard Radix Sort doesn’t work very well with floating point
values, this is something actually very easy to fix. In this little article I
will review the standard Radix Sort algorithm, and enhance it so that&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it sorts
negative floats as well<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it has
reduced complexity for bytes and words<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><!--[if !supportLists]--><span lang="FR"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="FR">it

<p><span lang="FR">Is it worth writing
anything in 2000 about a sort routine&nbsp;? Doesn’t everyone already have
one&nbsp;? Aren’t those things already well known&nbsp;? Everyone knows how to
sort negative floats with a Radix, don’t you think&nbsp;?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Well, that’s what I
would’ve said some weeks ago. But I recently wandered on Ming C. Lin’s homepage
[2], and began to read her courses. Here’s what I found&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">«&nbsp;Counting sort
and radix sort are good for integers. For floating point numbers, try bucket
sort or other comparison-based methods&nbsp;» (21 sept. 1999) [3]<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">As you see this is
not very old…I read more of the courses, read some older papers about collision
detection, and it appeared my own way of dealing with a specific part of this
problem was (at least from a theoretical point of view) faster than the
official one. Hence, I think this article will be useful for beginners as well
as for experienced programmers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>











<p><span lang="FR">A Radix Sort is an
apparently bizarre sort routine which manages to sort values without actually
performing any comparisons on input data. That’s why this sort routine breaks
the theoretical lower bound of the O(N*logN) complexity, which only applies for
comparison-based sorts. Radix is O(k*N), with k = 4 most of the time, and
although this is not an in-place sort (i.e. it uses extra storage) it is so
much faster than any other sorting methods it has become a very popular way of sorting
data.<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="FR">The algorithm<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">What is a <i>radix</i>, anyway&nbsp;?<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Roughly we can say a radix is a position in a number. In the decimal
system, a radix is just a digit in a decimal number. For example the number
«&nbsp;42&nbsp;» has two digits, or two radices, which are 4 and 2. In
hexadecimal the radix is 8 bits wide. For example the hexadecimal number 0xAB
has two radices, A and B. The Radix Sort gets its name from those radices,
because the method first sorts the input values according to their first radix,
then according to the second one, and so on. The Radix Sort is then a multipass
sort, and the number of passes equals the number of radices in the input
values. For example you’ll need 4 passes to sort standard 32 bits integers,
since in hexadecimal the radix is a byte. By the way that’s why the Radix Sort
is often called <i>Byte Sort</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">How does it work&nbsp;? Say you want to sort some bytes, for
example&nbsp;those ones:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">54,
18, 2, 128, 3<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The idea behind the Radix Sort is to read input values and immediately
store them at the right place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Have a look at that sample code&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>unsigned char InputValues[] = { 54, 18, 2, 128, 3 };<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>int SortedBuffer[256];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>memset(SortedBuffer, -1, 256*sizeof(int));<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// Fill with –1<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for(int i=0&nbsp;;i&lt;5&nbsp;;i++){<o:p></o:p></span></pre>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>unsigned char c = InputValues[i];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>SortedBuffer[c] = c;<o:p></o:p></span></pre>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>// Now you can read SortedBuffer and get
values back in sorted order<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span lang="FR">You may think this example is stupid – it <i>is</i>&nbsp;! – but it
nicely introduces the ideas we’ll have to deal with. What do we need to change
in that code, in order for it to become useful&nbsp;? First we need to get rid
of the empty destination locations, so that the destination buffer (called
SortedBuffer in our example) has the same size as the input buffer (i.e. enough
for 5 values, no more). We also need a way to handle collisions – collisions in
the hash-table sense of the word, i.e. we must be able to deal with two equal
input values and know how to store both of them in the final buffer. Luckily
enough, both problems are solved by the same solution&nbsp;: an <i>offset table</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The offset table is a 256-entries table telling us, for each possible
input byte, where we should store the result. It is usually built in two
passes, one to compute the distribution of bytes in the input flow (i.e.
histograms, or <i>counters</i>), another one to create the offset table
according to this distribution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">This sample code&nbsp;creates the counters:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>int
Counters[256];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>memset(Counters, 0, 256*sizeof(int));<span>&nbsp; </span>//
Set all counters to 0<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for(
i =0&nbsp;; i &lt; NbItems&nbsp;; i++){<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>//
Loop over the input array<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>unsigned char c = InputValues[i];<span> </span>//
Get current byte…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Counters[c]++;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>//
…and update counter<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">We can now create the offset table&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>int OffsetTable[256];<o:p></o:p></span></pre><pre><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OffsetTable[0] = 0;<o:p></o:p></span></pre>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for(i=1;i&lt;256;i++){<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>OffsetTable[i] = OffsetTable[i-1] +
Counters[i-1];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>}<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Now, for each input byte, we can
get the right offset back thanks to this table, put the input byte at the right
place in the destination buffer, increase the offset, and repeat the sequence
for the next byte.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">For example&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>unsigned char c =
InputValues[i];<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>DestinationBuffer[OffsetTable[c]++] = c;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The destination buffer won’t have
any empty locations&nbsp;: we have enough room in it for the same number of
values as in the input buffer, no more. Thanks to the offsets we know exactly
where we must store them, and whenever an empty location would have existed in
our first example, here it doesn’t appear because no offset actually maps that
empty location.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Collisions are not a problem
either because offsets are increased each time we use one of them. If we have
two identical bytes in input, the first one will be put in
DestinationBuffer[Offset], Offset will be increased, and the next one will then
fall in DestinationBuffer[Offset+1]. Radix sort is <i>stable</i> by the way,
which means two same values in input will be in the same order in output.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">This last point is very important
to understand the next step&nbsp;: how can we extend the process in order to
sort not only bytes but also words, dwords, or event character strings&nbsp;?
This is actually very simple&nbsp;: we just have to sort again according to the
next radix. Recall a radix actually is a byte in the values to sort. The first
radix is the LSB (Least Significant Byte). The last one must be the MSB (Most
Significant Byte). Between those two, we perform all necessary passes. The
second pass doesn’t destroy what has been done in the first one because the
sorting method is stable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Example&nbsp;: say we want to sort
those hexadecimal values&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">0xBC, 0xAB, 0xBA, 0xAC, 0xBB, 0xAA<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The first pass leads to&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBC<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAC<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Note that the list is sorted
according to the last column (ie the LSB which is the first radix). The second
pass will sort this list according to the first column (ie the MSB, our second
radix) and since the sorting method is stable, the 3 numbers 0xAA, 0xAB and
0xAC which share the same MSB will be found in output in the same order as in
input. And since the input order has been determined by the first sorting pass,
eh, it’s already sorted according to the LSB, and here we are with the final
sorted list&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">0xAA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xAC<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBA<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBB<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span lang="FR">0xBC<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Radix selection is
performed by shifting and ANDing the input value according to the pass
number&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">unsigned
char Radix = (InputValues[i]&gt;&gt;(Pass&lt;&lt;3)) &amp; 0xFF;<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">…where pass begins
to 0 and gets increased for each new pass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>







<p><b><span lang="FR">Sorting floating point values<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Ok, that was the
standard Radix Sort, as most of us knew it on old 16 bits computers. What
happened then, was the following&nbsp;: one day, we all switched to 80486 (or
Pentium) and suddenly we had floats. At first sight, a Radix Sort can’t deal
with floats&nbsp;: the inner structure of a float isn’t obvious, you don’t
really see how to shift them or AND a value with them (the algorithm involves
such an operation, as seen just above), you don’t even know how to do it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The first step is to
learn how a floating-point value is actually built. This is well known
nowadays&nbsp;: the first bit is the sign bit, the next 8 bits are the biased
exponent, and the 23 last ones are the mantissa. The exponent is always
positive thanks to the bias. Chris Hecker once wrote a good introduction paper
to the numerous floating-points tricks you can afford on Intel processors [1].
Let’s quote him&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">«&nbsp;Because the
exponent are always positive (and are in more significant bits than the
mantissa), large numbers compare greater than small numbers even when the
floating-point values are compared as normal integer bits. The sign bit throws
a monkey wrench in this, but it works great for single-signed values.&nbsp;»<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">I couldn’t have said
that better. And from this point, it is easy to see why it works with positive
floats. Let’s define a function IR(x) as the integer representation of any
floating-point value x. For example the floating-point value 42.0 has a binary
representation of 0x42280000. In other words&nbsp;:<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">IR(42.0)
= 0x42280000<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">The Radix Sort works
with positive floats because for any floating-point values x and y,<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">x
&gt; y &gt;0 =&gt; IR(x) &gt; IR(y)<o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p><span lang="FR">Hence x and y will
be treated by the sorting code as IR(x) and IR(y), and the final order will be
correct. This is easy to check&nbsp;: just cast your float pointer into integer
pointer and ask your code to sort your array of positive floats&nbsp;! It
works. Well, it doesn’t work on DEC Alpha because the float format is
different, but that’s another story&nbsp;: it works provided you use IEEE
floats, which means it works on PC, on Dreamcast, and so on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

One problem though, our Bolt IR is an OCaml value, but the LLVM API we’re using is the native C++ API. We can’t import the value directly into the C++ compiler backend, so we need to serialise it first into a <strong>language-independent</strong> data representation.</p><p>Hey there! If you came across this tutorial from Google and don’t care about compilers, don’t worry! This tutorial doesn’t really involve anything compiler-specific (it’s just the illustrative example).

The <code>repeated</code> modifier corresponds to a list/vector of that field. e.g. <code>repeated PhoneNumber</code> represents a value of type <code>List&lt;PhoneNumber&gt;</code>.</p><p>For example, the following schema would define a Person in a contact book.

This allows us to add fields later without altering the existing ordering of fields (so you can continue to parse these fields without having to know about new fields).</p><p>Every time we want to add a new “type” of field, we define a schema (just like how you might define a class to add a new type of object). We can even define a schema within another schema, e.g. within the schema for a <code>Person</code>, we defined the schema for the <code>PhoneNumber</code> field.</p><p>We can also define the schema for an <strong>enum</strong> type <code>PhoneType</code>. This enum acted as a “tag” for our phone number.</p><p>Now, just as you might want a field to be one of many options (specified by the enum type), you might want the message to contain exactly one of many fields.</p><p>For example in our compiler we might want to encode an identifier as <em>one of two options</em>.

I would highly recommend that you also suppress these warnings!</p><p>An aside, <code>bisect_ppx</code> is the tool we use to calculate test coverage. It has a <code>--conditional</code> flag since we don’t want to preprocess the file with coverage info if we’re not computing the test coverage.</p><p>Telling PPX deriving protobuf that we want to serialise a type definition is easy - we just stick a <code>[@@deriving protobuf]</code> at the end of our type definition. For variant types, we have to specify a <code>[@key 1]</code>, <code>[@key 2]</code> for each of the variants.</p><p>For example, for our <code>identifier</code> type definition in our <code>.mli</code> file:</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/ir_gen/frontend_ir.mli"> <!-- -->frontend_ir.mli</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> identifier </span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Variable</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>ObjField</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string </span><span>*</span><span> int </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf</span><span>]</span></p></pre></div></div><p>We do the same thing in the <code>.ml</code> file, except we also specify the file to which we want to write the protobuf schema.</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/ir_gen/frontend_ir.ml"> <!-- -->frontend_ir.ml</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> identifier </span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Variable</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>ObjField</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> string </span><span>*</span><span> int </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf </span><span>{</span><span>protoc</span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>"../../frontend_ir.proto"</span><span>}</span><span>]</span></p></pre></div></div><p>This path is relative to the src file <code>frontend_ir.ml</code>. So since this <code>frontend_ir.ml</code> file is in the <code>src/frontend/ir_gen/</code> folder of the repo, the protobuf schema file will be written to <code>src/frontend_ir.proto</code>. If you don’t specify a file path to the <code>protoc</code> argument, then the <code>.proto</code> file will be written to the <code>_build</code> folder.</p><p>One extra tip, the ppx deriving protobuf library won’t serialise lists of lists. For example you can’t have:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> something </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Foo</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> foo list list </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf</span><span>]</span><span>)</span></p></pre></div></div><p>This is because if we have a message schema for <code>foo</code>, then to get a field of type <code>foo list</code> is straightforward - we use <code>repeated foo</code> in our field schema. But we can’t say <code>repeated repeated foo</code> to get a list of a list of type foo. So to get around this, you’d have to define another type here:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>type</span><span> list</span><span>_</span><span>of</span><span>_</span><span>foo </span><span>=</span><span> foo list </span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf</span><span>]</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>type</span><span> something </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Foo</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> list</span><span>_</span><span>of</span><span>_</span><span>foo list </span><span>[</span><span>@</span><span>key </span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>@@</span><span>deriving protobuf</span><span>]</span></p></pre></div></div><p>Finally, to serialise our Bolt IR using this schema, PPX deriving protobuf provides us with <code>&lt;type_name&gt;_to_protobuf</code> serialisation functions. We use this to get a binary protobuf message that we write to an output channel (<code>out_chan</code>) as a sequence of bytes.</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/ir_gen/ir_gen_protobuf.ml"> <!-- -->ir_gen_protobuf.ml</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>let</span><span> ir</span><span>_</span><span>gen</span><span>_</span><span>protobuf program out</span><span>_</span><span>chan </span><span>=</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> protobuf</span><span>_</span><span>message </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>Protobuf</span><span>.</span><span>Encoder</span><span>.</span><span>encode</span><span>_</span><span>exn program</span><span>_</span><span>to</span><span>_</span><span>protobuf program </span><span>in</span><span></span></p><p><span>    output</span><span>_</span><span>bytes out</span><span>_</span><span>chan protobuf</span><span>_</span><span>message</span></p></pre></div></div><p>In our overall Bolt compiler pipeline, I write the output to a <code>.ir</code> file if provided, or to <code>stdout</code>:</p><div><p><span><a href="https://github.com/mukul-rathi/bolt/blob/master/src/frontend/compile_program_ir.ml"> <!-- -->compile_program_ir.ml</a></span></p><div><pre><p><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span></span></p><p><span> </span><span>match</span><span> compile</span><span>_</span><span>out</span><span>_</span><span>file </span><span>with</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>Some</span><span> file</span><span>_</span><span>name </span><span>-&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>        </span><span>Out_channel</span><span>.</span><span>with</span><span>_</span><span>file file</span><span>_</span><span>name </span><span>~f</span><span>:</span><span>(</span><span>fun</span><span> file</span><span>_</span><span>oc </span><span>-&gt;</span><span></span></p><p><span>            ir</span><span>_</span><span>gen</span><span>_</span><span>protobuf program file</span><span>_</span><span>oc</span><span>)</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>           </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> ir</span><span>_</span><span>gen</span><span>_</span><span>protobuf program stdout </span><span>)</span></p></pre></div></div><h3 id="auto-generated-protobuf-schema"><a href="#auto-generated-protobuf-schema" aria-label="auto generated protobuf schema permalink"></a>Auto-generated Protobuf Schema</h3><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_deriving_protobuf">README</a> of the repository for the PPX Deriving Library has a thorough explanation of the mapping. We’ve already gone through an example of the autogenerated schema, so the schema shouldn’t be too unfamiliar. There was a slight modification I made though. For (<code>ObjField of string * int</code>) I said the generated output was:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>message _ObjField {</span></p><p><span>    required string objName = 1;</span></p><p><span>    required int64 fieldIndex = 2;</span></p><p><span>  }</span></p></pre></div></div><p>This is unfortunately not quite true. I put in the objName and fieldIndex for clarity, but the library doesn’t know what the semantic meaning of <code>string * int</code> is, so instead it looks like:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>message _ObjField {</span></p><p><span>    required string _0 = 1;</span></p><p><span>    required int64 _1 = 2;</span></p><p><span>  }</span></p></pre></div></div><p>That’s the downside of the autogenerated schema. You get the generic field names <code>_0</code>, <code>_1</code>, <code>_2</code> and so on instead of <code>objName</code> and <code>fieldIndex</code>. And for <code>type block_expr = expr list</code>, you get the field name <code>_</code>:</p><div><div><pre><p><span>message block_expr {</span></p><p><span>  repeated expr _ = 1;</span></p><p><span>}</span></p></pre></div></div><h2 id="decoding-protobuf-in-c"><a href="#decoding-protobuf-in-c" aria-label="decoding protobuf in c permalink"></a>Decoding Protobuf in C++</h2><p>Alright, so far we’ve looked at Protobuf schema definitions and how PPX Deriving Protobuf encodes messages and generates the schema.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=box-piper-app">Scraper API</a> provides a proxy service designed for web scraping. With over 20 million residential IPs across 12 countries, as well as software that can handle JavaScript rendering and solving CAPTCHAs, you can quickly complete large scraping jobs without ever having to worry about being blocked by any servers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=box-piper-app" target="_blank">
<img src="https://www.boxpiper.com/779cab4c054e767248e43be74fabf94c/scraperapi-1.gif">
</a></p><p>Implementation is extremely simple, and they offer unlimited bandwidth. Proxies are automatically rotated, but users can choose to maintain sessions if required. All you need to do is call the API with the URL that you want to scrape, and it will return the raw HTML. With Scraper API, you just focus on parsing the data, and they’ll handle the rest.</p>
<p>As per data, they have handled 5 billion API requests per month for over 1,500 businesses and developers around the world</p>
<figure>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
            Having built many web scrapers, we repeatedly went through the tiresome process of finding proxies, setting up headless browsers, and handling CAPTCHAs. That's why we decided to start Scraper API, it handles all of this for you so you can scrape any page with a simple API call!
        </p>
        
	</blockquote>
</figure>
<p>One of the most frustrating parts of automated web scraping is constantly dealing with IP blocks and CAPTCHAs. ScrapperAPI handles it beautifully.
You can customize request headers, request type, IP geo-location and more. They automatically prune slow proxies from our pools periodically, and guarantee unlimited bandwidth with speeds up to 100Mb/s, perfect for writing speedy web crawlers.</p>
<p>Features loaded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 20 million residential IPs in the pool</li>
<li>Simple dashboard to manage usage and billing</li>
<li>Geo-targeting: target 12+ countries around the world</li>
<li>Free plan with 1000 requests &amp; all features</li>
<li>Seven-day, no questions asked refund policy</li>
<li>24/7 support and great customer service</li>
<li>Rotating and sticky IP sessions</li>
<li>Easy setup</li>
<li>Able to render JavaScript pages</li>
<li>Custom browser headers</li>
<li>Premium proxy pools</li>
<li>Auto-extraction of data from popular sites</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>When you sign up for Scraper API you are given an access key. All you need to do is call the API with your key and the URL that you want to scrape, and you will receive the raw HTML of the page as a result. It’s as simple as:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>curl "http: ; //api.scraperapi.com?api_key=XYZ&amp;url=http://httpbin.org/ip"</code></pre></div>
<p>On the back end, when Scraper API receives your request, their service accesses the URL via one of their proxy servers, gets the data, and then sends it back to you.</p>
<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<p>Scraper API exposes a single API endpoint, simply send a GET request to <a href="http://api.scraperapi.com/">http://api.scraperapi.com</a> with two query string parameters, api_key which contains your API key, and url which contains the url you would like to scrape.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code>
<span>var</span> scraperapiClient <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>"scraperapi-sdk"</span><span>)</span><span>(</span><span>"XYZ"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3>Geographic Location</h3>
<p>To ensure your requests come from the United States, please use the country<em>code= flag (e.g. country</em>code=us)</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>    curl "http://api.scraperapi.com/?api_key=XYZ&amp;url=http://httpbin.org/ip&amp;country_code=us"</code></pre></div>
<h3>POST/PUT Requests</h3>
<p>Some advanced users will want to issue POST/PUT Requests in order to scrape forms and API endpoints directly.</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code># Replace POST with PUT to send a PUT request instead
curl -d 'foo=bar' \
-X POST \
"http://api.scraperapi.com/?api_key=XYZ&amp;url=http://httpbin.org/anything"

# For form data
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-F 'foo=bar' \
-X POST \
"http://api.scraperapi.com/?api_key=XYZ&amp;url=http://httpbin.org/anything"</code></pre></div>

<h4>Account Information</h4>
<p>When you log into your Scraper API account, you will be presented with a dashboard that will show you how many requests you have used, how many requests you have left for the month, and the number of failed requests (which do not count towards your request limit).</p>
<p>If you would like to monitor your account usage and limits programmatically (how many concurrent requests you’re using, how many requests you’ve made, etc.) you may use the /account endpoint, which returns JSON.</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>curl "http://api.scraperapi.com/account?api_key=XYZ"</code></pre></div>
<h4>Result</h4>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"concurrentRequests"</span><span>:</span> <span>553</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"requestCount"</span><span>:</span> <span>6655888</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2>Ending Note</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=box-piper-app" target="_blank">Scraper API</a> is the best proxy API service for web scraping in the market today.
Easy to integrate, able to accommodate for all levels/sizes of scraping projects. If you have any serious scraping projects, then Scraper API is definitely worth looking into. Even if you’re a casual user, you may benefit from using the free plan.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>According to social psychology, clumsy mistakes like these can give individuals an advantage more often than you might think. It’s called the Pratfall Effect and remains a highly intriguing theory in the field of social science.</p>
<p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>
            In social psychology, the pratfall effect is the tendency for interpersonal appeal to increase or decrease after an individual makes a mistake, depending on the individual's perceived ability to perform well in a general sense. An individual perceived to be highly competent would be considered more likable after committing a blunder, while a perceived average individual would be considered less likable.
        </p>
        
	</blockquote>
</figure>
<p>When a person makes a mistake or acts in a clumsy way that might even make people laugh, they are found to be more likeable, including in comparison with people who are more intelligent and clever.</p>
<p>When you make a mistake, you appear more human, more like others and so more likeable. People who are perfect can seem threatening, but people who are imperfect are safe and hence easier to truly like.</p>

<p>We can observe the truth of the Pratfall Effect with the famous film actress Jennifer Lawrence. Widely touted for her talent and beauty, she is also known for her gaffes, such as falling down at red carpet events and speaking brashly in interviews. Yet Lawrence is commonly considered a “down-to-earth” celebrity and regularly celebrated for her likeability.</p>

<h2>Revelation</h2>
<p>The Pratfall Effect experiment revealed three major social truths:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s OK to be fallible.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a person is generally considered smart and capable, committing a small mistake will generally make them more socially attractive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If individuals are considered average or mediocre, they are more likely to be negatively impacted by their mistake.</li>
<li>
<p>The ultimate effects of pratfalls are contextual.</p>
<ul>
<li>Subsequent studies have discovered that pratfalls are perceived differently based on other factors, including gender.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ending Note</h2>
<p>If you want to be liked, make mistakes sometimes (or just admit to error), though do be careful to make it in an area which is unimportant and which will not make people think you are incapable in areas where they need your ability.</p>

<p>I was talking to my friend Josh a couple weeks ago about the speed at which teams move and how best managers can create a sense of urgency. We pretty quickly agreed that there are two types of urgency for a team: push-based and pull-based.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Is your urgency push-based or pull-based?</p><p>It's a thought-provoking management question.</p><p>Ex: Arbitrary deadline=push, Excitement=pull</p><p>Does this division make sense? What other kinds of urgency are there?</p></div>— Joshua Levy (@ojoshe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ojoshe/status/1309279621448310786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>I felt like this is an important delineation, and wanted to summarize our conversation a little, just by giving some examples.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Team:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based: </strong>You hire people who will what is asked of them, and nothing more.</li><li><strong>Pull-based: </strong>You hire people who are conscientious and self-motivated, and if they aren’t being pushed, they will push themselves and everyone around them.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Goals:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based: </strong>The team has “soul-less” goals like “get X done by Y” or “increase metric Y by Z”.</li><li><strong>Pull-based: </strong>The team clearly understands the value of what they are building and are excited about making it real.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Road-blocks:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based:</strong> Team members constantly lose momentum because they run into obstacles that are beyond their control.</li><li><strong>Pull-based: </strong>The “path is paved”, so-to-speak. Team members might face obstacles, but they are either empowered to clear those obstacles or have access to executives that can clear the obstacles for them.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Deadlines:</strong><ul><li><strong>Push-based:</strong> Arbitrary deadlines like “our exec wants this done by Friday”.</li><li><strong>Pull-based:</strong> Self-imposed deadlines like “this should take 2 weeks, and we will hold ourselves accountable to that”.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>We actually discussed deadlines a little bit, and as Josh always does he broke out a few dimensions:</p>



<ul><li>Deadlines can be artificial or real. An artificial deadline is one in which there will be no repercussions if the deadline is missed, and a real one has repercussions.</li><li>Deadlines can be superimposed or self-imposed. A team can decide a deadline for itself, or someone (typically more senior) can decide a deadline for them.</li><li>Deadlines can be evident or arbitrary. An evident deadline might be “if we don’t build our product by November, we’ll miss out on the holiday season orders.”</li></ul>



<p>So a deadline that is real, superimposed, and arbitrary, could be something like “If you don’t accomplish this by end-of-month, you will be fired.”</p>



<p>Someone once told me that managers push and leaders pull. Plenty of people, companies, and teams have gotten results with very “push-based” urgencies, but if you ask someone which type of urgency they prefer on their team, they’ll likely say “pull-based”. Which is an interesting point to ponder.</p>

For security reasons, we create a new user that will be used to administrate the server. It is good practice to only work with the least amount of privileges you need and use <code>sudo</code> when you need more permissions. </p><p>We will disable the possibility to log in as the <code>root</code> user using a password, but we will allow it to log in using public-key authentication.</p><hr><p>To add a new user you can use the <code>adduser</code> command.</p><p>You will be asked a few questions including what password you want to use. Make sure the password is secure and in the best case random generated and stored in a password manager like <a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1Password</a> or <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lastpass</a>.</p><div><pre><code><p><span>Adding user `phiilu' ...</span></p><p><span>Adding new group `phiilu' (1000) ...</span></p><p><span>Adding new user `phiilu' (1000) with group `phiilu' ...</span></p><p><span>Creating home directory `/home/phiilu' ...</span></p><p><span>Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...</span></p><p><span>New password:</span></p><p><span>Retype new password:</span></p><p><span>passwd: password updated successfully</span></p><p><span>Changing the user information for phiilu</span></p><p><span>Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default</span></p><p><span>    Full Name []: Florian</span></p><p><span>    Room Number []:</span></p><p><span>    Work Phone []:</span></p><p><span>    Home Phone []:</span></p><p><span>    Other []:</span></p><p><span>Is the information correct?

If you are the <code>root</code> user you can just type</p><p>and you will be logged in as the user without prompted a password. You can also use log in with the <code>login</code> command.</p><hr><p>Next, we want to give the user permission to administrate the server. Right now we have a new user, but the user does not have any permission to make any changes as a superuser. </p><p>You can confirm this when trying to update the packages:</p><div><pre><code><p><span>[sudo] password for phiilu:</span></p><p><span>phiilu is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.</span></p></code></pre></div><p>As you can see, we need to add the new user to the sudoers file to be able to execute commands as the superuser.</p><p>We need to exit our current session with <code>exit</code>. You should now be logged in as the <code>root</code> user.</p><p>If you are <code>root</code>, you can type <code>visudo</code> to check the current sudoers file.</p><div><pre><code><p><span>#</span></p><p><span># This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.</span></p><p><span>#</span></p><p><span># Please consider adding local content in /etc/sudoers.d/ instead of</span></p><p><span># directly modifying this file.</span></p><p><span>#</span></p><p><span># See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.</span></p><p><span>#</span></p><p><span>Defaults        env_reset</span></p><p><span>Defaults        mail_badpass</span></p><p><span>Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"</span></p><p><span># Host alias specification</span></p><p><span># User alias specification</span></p><p><span># Cmnd alias specification</span></p><p><span># User privilege specification</span></p><p><span>root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL</span></p><p><span># Members of the admin group may gain root privileges</span></p><p><span>%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL</span></p><p><span># Allow members of group sudo to execute any command</span></p><p><span>%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL</span></p><p><span># See sudoers(5) for more information on "#include" directives:</span></p><p><span>#includedir /etc/sudoers.d</span></p></code></pre></div><p>You can see that if a user is in the <code>sudo</code> group, he should be able to execute commands as <code>root</code>.

<p>Omnipedia went live on September 28th 2049, with Hsiung and Xu taking part in a press conference to celebrate its public launch. They described Omnipedia's mission statement as "offering an easily accessible primary source of balanced, responsible, and accurate information about anything and everything." Although it was initially hinted that some of Wikipedia's content would be carried over to Omnipedia for its initial launch, Hsiung stated that this turned out to be infeasible due to the copyright issues that had led to Wikipedia ceasing operations on April 13th 2048. As a result, Omnipedia will feature fully original content.<sup id="backreference-2"><a href="#reference-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

                    <p><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaa238">A study which has just been published in the leading neurology journal Brain</a>,  indicates that Parkinson's disease is not one but two diseases, starting either in the brain or in the intestines.</p>

<p>These two groups of patients displayed strikingly different profiles on multimodal imaging battery.</p>

<p>These profiles support the existence of a brain-first and body-first subtype of Parkinson’s disease, and furthermore, that premotor rapid eye movement sleep (REM) sleep behaviour disorder is a highly predictive marker of the body-first subtype.
<img src="https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800/2019/wheredoespar.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Neuropathological autopsy studies of patients with Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or incidental Lewy body disease have shown discrepant results.</p>

<p>Heiko Braak’s staging system was derived from a cohort of patients, who were selected based on the presence of Lewy pathology in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and all these patients conformed to a brainstem predominant type.</p>

<p>Other studies reported that some post-mortem cases do not harbour Lewy pathology in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and a minority of patients do not follow the Braak staging scheme.</p>

<p>A pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease is the presence of intraneuronal a-synuclein inclusions termed Lewy pathology. However, it remains unknown from where the initial a-synuclein aggregates originate.</p>

<p>It has been hypothesized that a-synuclein inclusions initially form in nerve terminals of the enteric nervous system, and then subsequently spread via autonomic connections to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and intermediolateral cell columns of the sympathetic system (Braak et al., 2003).</p>

<p>In addition, Lewy pathology has been detected in gastrointestinal nerve fibres years prior to Parkinson’s disease diagnosis.
There is also epidemiological evidence that complete but not partial vagotomy may protect against later Parkinson’s disease.</p>

<p>Autopsy studies have shown that a minority of cases with Lewy pathology do not have pathological inclusions in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and that a fraction of cases display a limbic-predominant distribution of a-synuclein inclusions with less pathology in the brainstem.</p>

<p>The scientists hypothesized that the appearance of isolated REM sleep behaviour disorder well before parkinsonism is a strong marker of the body-first subtype. The presence of REM sleep behaviour disorder in the premotor phase is a marker of the body-first type, probably a reflection of ascending a-synuclein pathology reaching the pons before the substantia nigra. 
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Substantia_nigra.gif" alt="enter image description here">
<em>The substantia nigra in the brain.
Source Wikipedia</em></p>

<p>To test this hypothesis, they recruited de novo patients with Parkinson’s disease and performed video-polysomnography to divide patients into de novo Parkinson’s disease without REM sleep behaviour disorder and de novo Parkinson’s disease with pre-motor REM sleep behaviour disorder. The study was conducted between August 2018 and January 2020.</p>

<p>The scientists have shown that prodromal and de novo patients with Parkinson’s disease can be categorized by means of multimodal imaging into distinct clusters, which are compatible with a brain-first and body-first Parkinson’s disease subtype.</p>

<p>Their conclusion is that the Parkinson’s disease comprises two subtypes: 
(i) a body-first (bottom-up) subtype, where the pathology originates in the enteric or peripheral autonomic nervous system, and then ascends via the vagus nerve and sympathetic connectome to the CNS;</p>

<p>(ii) a brain-first (top-down) subtype, in which the a-synuclein pathology initially arises in the brain itself or sometimes enters via the ol- factory bulb, and subsequently descends to the peripheral autonomic nervous system.</p>

<p><strong>Body-first (bottom-up) subtype:</strong>
The initial a-synuclein pathology appears in the enteric or peripheral autonomic nervous system. It then propagates via the sympathetic connectome to the heart, and via the vagus nerve to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus.
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Pons.gif" alt="enter image description here">
<em>The pons area in the brain.
Source Wikipedia</em></p>

<p>Ascending pathology affects pontine structures giving rise to REM sleep behaviour disorder before the substantia nigra shows substantial involvement.
When parkinsonism appears, signifying a loss of 450% of nigrostriatal dopamine terminals, all lower Braak stage structures show marked damage on relevant imaging markers.</p>

<p><strong>Brain-first (top-down) subtype:</strong>
 In the brain-first type, the initial a-synuclein pathology appears in the CNS.
The most likely site of origin seems to be the amygdala or connected structures, or the pathology may in some cases enter via the olfactory bulb.
Rarely, the pathology arises in the upper brainstem (substantia nigra or locus coeruleus).
The pathology spreads from the site of origin to the brainstem and cortex.
When parkinsonism appears, the brainstem shows a rostro-caudal gradient of pathology with marked involvement of the substantia nigra, moderate involvement of the neighbouring pons, but little involvement of the medulla and autonomic nervous system.</p>

        <p>Git is a free and open source distributed Version Control System (VCS). Git can
be hard, especially for people discovering it for the first time, but there are
a lot of things that make this an exceptional VCS worth learning. This post is
not meant to be a git tutorial, but rather a compilation of things and tips I
find interesting. I also wanted to give a perspective of git independent of
services like GitHub. Hopefully you can find something useful and “<em>git better
at it</em>” 🙃.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to learn how to use git, take a look at the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/">Pro Git
book</a>, it’s free and it is a great resource!</p>

<h2 id="git-is-not-github-">Git is not GitHub 😮</h2>

<p>Services like <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> made git particularly popular, but
the convenience of something like Github has its downsides for new users: it
causes confusion about the differences between <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> or
<a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, and the actual version control system, <em>git</em>.
While the former are great to host git repositories and make them publicly
available (among other things), git is a piece of software designed to allow for
distributed version control and collaboration. This means that you can use it
offline, without GitHub, you can collaborate with people via chat, email, and
anything that allows you to send text to someone else. Yes, GitHub makes it
convenient to host your project and make it discoverable; it provides an
incentive for collaboration, but, at the end of the day, GitHub is not git, just
as Gmail is not e-mail.</p>

<h2 id="git-is-distributed-">Git is distributed 🖧</h2>

<p>For those used to GitHub, collaborating with git over e-mail might seem
anachronistic, but, consider the scale of projects and what git was designed to
do. Being able to send contributions as plain text allied with the threaded
nature of e-mail, means that you can have multiple discussions around certain
aspects of a contribution, which is a big plus. Linux kernel development, for
example, doesn’t happen on GitHub or GitLab. From the linux kernel GitHub Pull
requests (GitHub’s system for submitting contributions):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks for your contribution to the Linux kernel!</p>

  <p>Linux kernel development happens on mailing lists, rather than on GitHub -
this GitHub repository is a read-only mirror that isn’t used for accepting
contributions. So that your change can become part of Linux, please email it
to us as a patch.</p>

  <p>Sending patches isn’t quite as simple as sending a pull request, but
fortunately it is a well documented process.</p>

  <p>Here’s what to do:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Format your contribution according to kernel requirements</li>
    <li>Decide who to send your contribution to</li>
    <li>Set up your system to send your contribution as an email</li>
    <li>Send your contribution and wait for feedback</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The development happens on various mailing lists for multiple subsystems. It’s
distributed development to an unprecedented scale. This scale has a price,
discipline in your contributions, something that GitHub doesn’t really help
reinforce –which seems to be the whole
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/pull/17#issuecomment-5654674">issue</a> that the
creator of git Linus Torvalds has with it.</p>

<h3 id="git-daemon-">Git daemon 🌐</h3>

<p>Focusing the development on a centralised service like GitHub can feel like
you’re using an improved version of Subversion client/server approach, but
remember, git is truly a decentralized system and we can do better. Suppose you
don’t want to use GitHub, but want to make your repository available for other
people to clone, pull from, etc. Git supports Peer-to-Peer setup out of the box
with <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Git-Daemon"><code>git
daemon</code></a>.
Collaboration then happens on each peer local copy of the source tree and some
form of communication channel (e.g. e-mail, chat, etc).</p>

<p>From your git folder you can execute the following command</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git daemon <span>--export-all</span> <span>--base-path</span><span>=</span><span>.</span> <span>--reuseaddr</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>--enable=upload-pack</code>: (enabled by default) allows for <code>git fetch</code>, <code>git pull</code>, and <code>git clone</code>.</li>
  <li><code>--export-all</code>: means that you don’t have to create a file named git-daemon-export-ok in each exported repository.</li>
  <li><code>--base-path</code>: allows people to clone projects without specifying the entire
path. Example: if you start the daemon with <code>--base-path=/srv/git</code> and try to
pull from <code>git://example.com/hello.git</code>, git daemon will interpret the path as
<code>/srv/git/hello.git</code>.</li>
  <li><code>--reuseaddr</code>: allows the server to restart without waiting for old connections to time out.</li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations, your machine is now running a git server and anyone can do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone git://192.168.1.42/  <span>#Your IP</span>
<span># or</span>
git remote add Foo git://192.168.1.42/
git fetch Foo
git checkout develop
git push Foo develop
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="git-patches-">Git patches 📝</h3>

<p>As we have discussed, git is a decentralized system, you can send contributions
to anyone without the need of a centralized git repository. This is not only the
default way of collaborating with git, it is particularly useful when a server
is down, or if you don’t have permissions to write to a remote repository
—but would still like to propose changes.</p>

<p>You can create a patch from your current changes without committing the code on
your source tree:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># changes in the working tree not yet staged for commit</span>
git diff <span>&gt;</span> big-improvements.patch
<span># or changes between the index and your last commit;</span>
<span># what you would be committing if you run "git commit"</span>
<span># without "-a" option.</span>
git diff <span>--cached</span> <span>&gt;</span> big-improvements.patch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As an example suppose the change is the addition of a README file, the diff
would look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>diff --git a/README b/README
</span><span>new file mode 100644
</span><span>index 0000000..e69de29
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>More often, what we would like to do is to propose a change we have made in your
local source tree. To do this, we can use the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch"><code>git
format-patch</code></a> command:</p>



<p>if we have commits ahead of the master branch, a diff file will be generated. We can also reference other commits in the same branch.
Suppose we made changes in the current branch and want to reference the changes in relation to the last commit. We can do:</p>



<p>the patch file will contain something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>From daf1010eb425a67ca6b0ba60f7cbec15bcff31f1 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001

<span>+This is a README file, that is all.

<p>to apply the patch we do:</p>

Git comes with its own [pull request
module](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull).

This feature has nothing to do with [GitHubs pull
request](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/creating-an-issue-or-pull-request).
It's mean to facilitate the creation of summary messages to be sent through
e-mail for example. If you want to use GitHubs pull request feature without the

to your public repository for others to see. If this is a remote repository you might do it like this:

```bash
git push https://bestgitserver.com/project master
```

Then we run the following command:

```bash
git request-pull v1.0 https://bestgitserver.com/project master
```

This will produce a request message with information about:

 1. where to pull from (your downstream repository address)
 2. the upstream repository
 3. a summary of the changes between v1.0 release and your master.

You can then send this request by e-mail for instance, making the pull request
completely distributed and independent from GitHub proprietary system.

<h2 id="git-tips-">Git tips 🔥</h2>

<p>We are all bound to get stuck sometimes when things go wrong. A good starting
point is this <a href="https://ohshitgit.com/">compilation</a>. These are solutions to
problems I often have to solve.</p>

<h3 id="premature-commit-">Premature commit 🔧</h3>

<p>You pulled the trigger too fast on that commit and wish you could include
additional changes? Make your changes, call <code>git commit --amend</code> and done. (Also
useful to change the commit message.)</p>

<h3 id="go-back-">Go back ⌛</h3>

<p>We messed up, go back to a previous commit.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># go back n commits n=1 in this case,</span>
<span># --soft: optionally don't discard changes</span>
<span># and put them on the staging area instead</span>
git reset HEAD~1 <span>--soft</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="put-changes-on-hold-">Put changes on hold 🚧</h3>

<p>So you want to get back to the state before you started making changes, but
don’t want to throw these changes away:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># stash the changes</span>
git stash
<span># get the changes back when needed</span>
git stash pop
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="where-it-went-wrong-">Where it went wrong 🔍</h3>

<p>You have a problem and don’t know which commit introduced it, enter <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect"><code>git bisect</code></a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git bisect start          <span># start a bisect section</span>
git bisect bad            <span># Current version is bad</span>
git bisect good v2.2.1    <span># v2.2.1 is known to be good</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>bisect will now choose commits in the middle of the history and you can mark
them as good or bad with the same commands. When no more revisions are available
you’ll have a description of the commit that caused the problem. You can then reset
the bisect state with <code>git bisect reset</code>.</p>

<h3 id="rebasing-commits-">Rebasing commits 💥</h3>

<p>Sometimes we make two commits when in reality, we could have included all the
changes in a single commit, and our history would be clearer. This is what is
known as <em>squashing</em>. We can use <code>git rebase</code> to meld commits with previous
commits. It can also be used instead of merging branches. Git’s rebase command
temporarily rewinds the commits on your current branch, pulls in the commits
from the other reference and reapplies the re-winded commits back on top.</p>

<p>Most people will advise you to always squash the commits and rebase them onto
the parent branch (like master or develop) before you submit a pull request or
send out a patch. Whether rebasing is preferred to merging really depends on the
context.</p>

<p>If you want to read more about <code>rebase</code> vs <code>merge</code>, check out <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/mastering-git-why-rebase-is-amazing-a954485b128a">this
post</a></p>

<p>Whatever you do <strong>DO NOT</strong> rebase commits in a upstream repository people can
pull from. It will mess everyone’s history and lead to conflicts that all
downstream peers will need to fix.
Also, it’s <strong>never</strong> a good idea to <strong>rebase somebody else’s work</strong>, see <a href="https://yarchive.net/comp/linux/git_rebase.html">this
discussion</a>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># rebase last 2 commits</span>
git rebase <span>-i</span> HEAD~2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The interactive system will open an editor where you can choose each commit in a
list that are about to be changed. In this case, it will list 2 lines with the
last 2 commits. This list reflects exactly how your branch will look like after
the rebase:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pick c8175df added line
pick dc58443 added final line

<span># Rebase 65e38e0..dc58443 onto 65e38e0 (2 commands)</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Commands:</span>
<span># p, pick &lt;commit&gt; = use commit</span>
<span># r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message</span>
<span># r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message</span>
<span># s, squash &lt;commit&gt; = meld into previous commit</span>
<span># f, fixup &lt;commit&gt; = like "squash", but discard log message</span>
<span># ...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can pick, reorder or squash any commits you want to make for a more readable
history.</p>

<p>As we discussed, you can also rebase the current branch onto another</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git checkout feature
git rebase <span>-i</span> master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For more information about rebase see the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase">documentation</a></p>

<h3 id="good-commit-messages-">Good commit messages 🧐</h3>

<p>Commit messages should be consistent across a project in terms of <strong>style</strong>,
<strong>content</strong>, and <strong>metadata</strong>. But some good rules are as follows:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In 1984 the co-inventor of Unix, Ken Thompson, delivered a seminal speech in which he highlighted that <em>you can’t trust code that you did not totally create yourself</em> <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. For a while, this lesson was largely ignored as open-source package registries like RubyGems, PyPI and npm grew rapidly. However, as we’re seeing <a href="https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/mining-for-malicious-ruby-gems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a> <a href="https://blog.npmjs.org/post/185397814280/plot-to-steal-cryptocurrency-foiled-by-the-npm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and</a> <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/a-post-mortem-of-the-malicious-event-stream-backdoor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more</a> supply-chain attacks through software dependencies, the risks of using unvetted dependencies are becoming clearer.</p>

<p>The risks are particularly great for JavaScript applications. Veracode found that the average JavaScript project relies on 377 dependencies – compared with just 16 for Python projects, or 43 in the Java ecosystem<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. Whenever a developer pulls in a new dependency, they are implicitly trusting the maintainers of that dependency. Often, this trust is awarded on the basis of popularity – we assume that a popular library will be more carefully vetted, or that since many others trust the maintainers, we can too. Other times, this trust relationship and the risks involved are not considered at all.</p>

<p><a href="https://sambleckley.com/writing/npm.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some have argued</a> that the ill health of the npm registry is a social, rather than a technical problem, and suggest a human-compiled set of packages in order to separate the wheat of maintained, healthy packages from the chaff of abandoned toy projects with no documentation. <a href="https://medium.com/@dpc_96143/cargo-crev-and-rust-2019-fearless-code-reuse-b75d58398cb8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another suggestion from the Rust world</a> involves creating a manual web of trust from maintainers cryptographically signing each other’s projects. Either way, there are challenges: webs of trust have rarely taken off (outside of Debian), and compiling a vetted set of packages from scratch is a massive undertaking. I propose something in the middle: bootstrapping a web of trust using existing npm dependency relationships, and building from that foundation.</p>

<h2 id="existing-trust-relationships-in-npm">Existing trust relationships in npm</h2>

<p>Creating a web of trust from existing npm dependencies is, admittedly, somewhat problematic. As stated earlier, choosing to use a particular dependency is not always a well-considered decision based on researching its code and maintainers, and the trust relationship is merely implied. Similarly, there is no cryptographic verification of this weak trust, nor does npm currently have the infrastructure for such tools<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. What I am suggesting is an imperfect starting point to demonstrate the need for, and potential of, stronger trust measures in open source.</p>

<p>To construct this initial web, we can model npm’s maintainerships as a graph. If we let each node be a maintainer, then the edges between them are the trust relationship arising from using a dependency. In other words, if Alice maintains a package A, and A depends on package B maintained by Bob, then there is a directed edge from Alice to Bob. We can even weigh these edges by the number of Alice’s packages in which she implies trust of Bob.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-the-graph">Exploring the graph</h2>

<p>This simple model exhibits a power-law-like pattern in terms of trust: the vast majority of users are trusted by few or no others, and a very small number of users are highly trusted. This type of pattern is common in social networks: you see a similar thing emerge when plotting follower counts on Twitter. Such power laws often lead to a rich-get-richer feedback process in which the inequality (in terms of trust, in this case) gets more pronounced over time<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/efe1a929e64ebeeb021e79f341b35faa4baf1397/c0643/static/img/maintainer-wot-in-degrees.png" alt="Scatter plot of in-degree vs. number of users. Shows a roughly power-law relationship."></p>

<p>Who are these highly-trusted users? They’re who you’d expect: bots for large projects (e.g. <code>types</code>), corporate accounts (e.g. <code>fb</code>), and the maintainers of extremely popular open-source libraries (e.g. <code>sindresorhus</code>, who maintains e.g. <code>string-length</code>).</p>

<p>Perhaps more interestingly, this web of trust exhibits some useful structures. A number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strongly connected components</a> emerge – groups of users that, roughly speaking, all trust each other according to the web of trust principles (i.e. if I trust Alice, and Alice trusts Bob, then I trust Bob, too). All of these connected components are small, with the exception of a single one that’s home to over 11,000 users<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>. This core component – we’ll call it the <strong>strong set</strong> – could provide a starting point for a measure of trust in the npm ecosystem.</p>



<p>We can quantify trust in a slightly more nuanced way than simply looking at the in-degree of each npm user. The PageRank algorithm provides such a measure that takes into account the trustworthiness of the people who trust me. For example, I may only be trusted by one user, but if that user is <code>isaacs</code> (the creator of npm) then that trust relationship counts for a lot! After running PageRank, the 10 “most-trusted” users are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>types</code></li>
  <li><code>sindresorhus</code></li>
  <li><code>angular</code></li>
  <li><code>m1tk4</code></li>
  <li><code>tjholowaychuk</code></li>
  <li><code>google-wombot</code></li>
  <li><code>fb</code></li>
  <li><code>isaacs</code></li>
  <li><code>gaearon</code></li>
  <li><code>yyx990803</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Many of these are unsurprising. However, <code>m1tk4</code> stands out: they only maintain two rarely-downloaded libraries. Because one of these libraries is used by the BBC, <code>m1tk4</code> is implicitly trusted by a large number of relatively trustworthy BBC employees who maintain other, more popular projects. This demonstrates how PageRank diffuses trust across the social network of npm maintainers. In fact, <code>m1tk4</code> is not a member of the strong set mentioned earlier – but many of the users who trust them <em>are</em>. <code>m1tk4</code> just doesn’t trust those users back!</p>

<p>While PageRank gives a fun measure of trust, it’s a very rough model for the reasons mentioned earlier: it’s based on a pretty weak indication of real trust. However, it might be useful in detecting suspicious behaviours in npm, which is something we – or registry maintainers – need to do proactively if we want to stop supply-chain attacks. For example, it might be a red flag if a highly-trusted user suddenly starts using a library by someone with a PageRank-based-trust of close to 0. And regardless, the strong set comes merely from observing which dependencies people choose to use without applying any complex calculations.</p>

<p>How might we want to use the strong set to create a stricter trust (or reputation) system? I think that formalizing such a system is unlikely if it requires large-scale buy-in from npm users. Instead, we might create a simple wrapper for npm that checks if you’re about to install something from a developer outside of the strong set, similar to Liran Tal’s excellent <a href="https://github.com/lirantal/npq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">npq</a>. Or perhaps security researchers could use the npm web of trust as an additional data point when deciding whether a suspicious package warrants further investigation. Either way, the state of trust within the npm ecosystem is not great. This model gives us a starting point.</p>

<p><em>Do you think I’ve got it all wrong? Or do you have further suggestions on how we can improve the state of trust in open source? <a href="https://www.btao.org/contact">Get in touch</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>A final note: this analysis is based on data from June 2020, which I collected for my Master’s thesis. I believe you’d reach similar numbers if you ran the analysis on data from today.</em></p>

		<h2 id="003">0:03</h2>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. </p><p>Today I’m going to have a conversation with Brian Nigito, essentially, about the technological underpinnings of the financial markets, and some of the ways in which those underpinnings differ from what you might expect if you’re used to things like the open Internet and the way in which cloud infrastructures work. We’re going to talk about a lot of things, but there’s going to be a lot of focus on networking, and some of the technologies at that level, including things like IP multicast. </p><p>Brian Nigito is a great person to have this conversation with because he has a deep and long history with the financial markets. He’s worked in the markets for 20 years, some of the time he spent working at the exchange-level where he did a lot of the foundational work that led to the modern exchange architectures that we know today. He’s also worked on the side of various different trading firms. For the last eight years, Brian’s been working here at Jane Street and his work here has covered a lot of different areas, but today, he spends a lot of time thinking about high performance, low latency, and especially network level stuff. </p><p>So let’s dive in. I think one thing that I’m very sensitive to is a lot of the people who are listening, don’t know a ton about the financial markets and how they work. And so just to get started, Brian can give a fairly basic explanation of what an exchange is.</p></div>

<h2 id="122">1:22</h2>

<p>I think when you hear about an exchange, you can think of lots of different kinds of marketplaces. But when we talk about an exchange, we’re talking about a formal securities exchange. And these are the exchanges that the SEC regulates, and they meet all of the rules necessary to allow people to trade in securities. So when we use that loosely, yeah, it’s pretty different than your average flea market. Supposed to be anyway.</p>

<h2 id="146">1:46</h2>

<p>That’s obviously a function which, once upon a time was done with physical people in the same location, right? Those got moved into more formal, more organized exchanges with more electronic support. Then eventually there’s this kind of transformation that’s happened essentially over the last 20 years, where the human element has changed enormous amount. Now, humans are obviously deeply involved in what’s going on, but the humans are almost all outside of the exchange and the exchange itself has become essentially a kind of purely electronic medium.</p>

<h2 id="217">2:17</h2>

<p>Yeah, it’s a really interesting story because you have examples of communication technologies and electronic trading, going back to the late ’60s, but probably more mid-‘70s (I’m being a little loose with dates) but it was kind of always present. But the rule set was not designed to force people to operate at the kinds of timescales that electronic systems would cause you to operate at. It was rather forgiving. So you know, if somebody on the floor didn’t want to deal with then electronic exchange, the electronic exchange had to wait. Over the past 10 to 15 years, that’s kind of flipped and so generally, we favor, always accessible electronic quotations.</p>

<h2 id="305">3:05</h2>

<p>To step back a little bit. The exchanges are the places for people to meet and trade, as you said, to advertise their prices. And for people to transact with each other. Other than people who are buying and selling, what are the other people who interact at the exchange level, what are the other kind of entities that get hooked in there.</p>

<h2 id="319">3:19</h2>

<p>So you have, obviously the entities who either in their own capacity or on behalf of other people are transacting securities, but then you have financial institutions that are clearing and guaranteeing those trades, providing some of the capital or leverage to the participants who are trading, they obviously want to know what’s going on there. You have other exchanges, because the rule set requires the exchanges to respect each other’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_quote">quotations</a> – in this odd way, there’s a web where the the exchanges are customers of each other. And you may also have various kinds of market data providers. So those quotes that reflect the activity on the exchange are eventually making their way all the way down to what you might see scrolling on the bottom of the television or your brokerage screen or financial news website, etc. I guess they even make it all the way down to the printed page when the Wall Street Journal prints transaction prices.</p>

<h2 id="410">4:10</h2>

<p>So what does this look like at a more systems level? What are the messages the different participants are sending back and forth?</p>

<h2 id="416">4:16</h2>

<div><p>The most primitive sorts of things are you have orders or instructions, there are other platforms where we have quotes and we may use that loosely, but we’ll just say orders. An order would just say that I would like to buy or sell, let’s say, a specific stock, and I’d like to do so at no worse than this price, and for no more than this quantity, and that may mean I could get filled at a slightly better price than that. I could get filled for less [quantity] than that. I could get filled not at all. </p><p>That order could basically check the book immediately and then come right back to me if there’s nothing to be done. Or it can rest there for some nonzero amount of time where it could advertise and other people may see it and choose to interact with it. And then obviously, I can withdraw that interest or cancel it. So when we talked about orders or cancels, those go hand in hand. </p><p>Finally, there’s execution messages where if you and I intersect on our interest I want to buy you want to sell or vice versa, then the exchange is going to generate an execution to you. And to me, saying that that happened and the terms of that trade.</p></div>

<h2 id="522">5:22</h2>

<div><p>One of the key properties here is that you have a fairly simple core set of messages, this basic data structure at the heart of it called “the book,” which is the set of orders that have not been satisfied. And then people can send messages to add orders and remove orders. And then if two orders <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cross.asp">cross</a>, if there are two orders that are compatible, where a trade can go up, then an execution occurs and the information flows out. </p><p>There’s a fairly simple core machine at the heart of it but then lots of different players who want different subsets of information for different purposes. There are people who are themselves trading, who want to see of course, their own activity and all the detail about that. And they also want to see what we call “market data,” that kind of public anonymized version of the trading activity so you can see what are the prices there are out there that are advertised for you to go and transact against. </p><p>In the end, you need to build a machine that’s capable of running this core engine, doing it at sufficient speed, doing it reliably enough… Maybe a thing that’s not apparent if you haven’t thought about it is: there’s like a disturbing dizzying amount of money at stake. And oh my God, you do not want to lose track of the transactions, right? If you say like, “Oh, you guys did this trade,” and then you forget about it and don’t report it, or you report to one side and not the other, terrible things happen. So reliability is a key thing.</p></div>

<h2 id="635">6:35</h2>

<p>Yeah and I think to go back, there’s lots of different consumers, lots of different participants. And I think the key word there is there’s lots of <em>competing</em> participants. So one thing you didn’t mention in there is disseminating all that information fairly. So trying to get it to everybody at the same time is a real challenge and one that participants are studying very, very carefully and looking for any advantage they can technologically within the rule set, etc. So that extra layer of competition sort of makes the problem a little more complicated, and a little more challenging.</p>

<h2 id="710">7:10</h2>

<p>This fairness issue is one that you’ve seen from the inside working on early exchange infrastructure at Island and Instinet, which eventually became the technology that NASDAQ is built on. Early on, you guys built an infrastructure that I think didn’t have all the fairness guarantees that modern exchanges happen today. Can you say more about how that actually plays out in practice?</p>

<h2 id="729">7:29</h2>

<div><p>When working on the Island system, it was very close, originally, to sort of “fair” in that you had the same physical machines, you had an underlying delivery mechanism, which we’ll talk about, that was very fair at getting it to those individual machines. And then you were sending copies of orders or instructions after going through one application to everyone. So you were all passing through about the exact same amount of work and the about the exact same number of devices. But it was actually very inefficient, we were using thousands of machines that were mostly idle. </p><p>So once we started trying to handle multiple clients on a single machine, it exposed some obvious and silly problems. The naive implementation where people would connect, we would collect all of those connections. And then when we had a message, we would send them on the connections serially, often in the order in which people connected. Well, that immediately led to thousands of messages per second before the exchange open where somebody tried to be the very first connection in that line. </p><p>Then you start sort of round-robining, so you know, you start from one and then the next time around, you start from two etc, etc, to try to randomize this. And then you had people who were connecting to as many different ports as they could and taking the fastest of each one. And so these incentives are very, very strong, and we’d like to use machines to their fullest, but to literally provide each participant their own unique machine for each connection starts to get ridiculous as well.</p></div>

<h2 id="904">9:04</h2>

<p>Where did that lead you? How did you end up resolving that problem?</p>

<h2 id="907">9:07</h2>

<p>A lot of these were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a> protocols. In those days, we actually had a decent number …</p></div></div>

<p>This article introduces a generic and light-weight debugging aid / event
tracing mechanism that is both feasible for targets without proper debugger
connection, as well as visual, providing visibility into high-level and
low-level events.</p>
<p>“What would an ocean be without a monster lurking in the dark? It would be like
sleep without dreams.”
― Werner Herzog</p>
<p>“The harder you work… and visualize something, the luckier you get.”
― Seal</p>

<p>For the past few weeks, I’ve been busy banging my head against the wall with a
system that contains a complex SoC and the vendor SDK is also a .. mess (to put
it politely). In the specific subsystem that I’ve been working with, the SDK
code structure is such that it’s pretty impossible to know who does what, in
what order and when.</p>
<p>In a normal world, one could use a debugger and various hardware assisted code
tracing tools, but the debugger connection
to this system is somewhat unstable to begin with and CoreSight TRACE is not available.
Utilizing SRAM-buffered message streams (e.g. Segger RTT) is also too unstable
(since it relies on the debugger connection).</p>
<p>In similar situations I’ve gotten away by using multiple GPIOs and toggling them
from strategic places and then used a logic analyzer to see what’s what. The
technique has many good qualities and is quite general, but requires pins to
be available to be toggled by software. This sadly is not the case on the
system in question.</p>
<p>There is an UART that is used for text-based debugging messages, but using
<code>printf()</code> from within highly asynchronous code (and ISRs) is akin to digging out
dragons out of one’s nose. On the other hand, the UART is the only thing not
dedicated to core system functionality, so I ended up using it.</p>
<p>In the end, I instrumented the code with a lot of UART writes (single bytes from
different parts), indicating entry and return from functions (including ISRs) in
a race-free manner. While I’ve used this
technique with great success in the past, this time the complexity of the system
was such that manually “decoding” the events from the logic analyzer’s protocol
decoder was pretty slow and tedious and involved a lot of head scratching and
crying. I wanted a way to visualize the data so that I could have both the
long-term view as well as the short-term one.</p>
<p>As a side note, I actually managed to solve my acute problem without these tools
before I wrote them, but these are the tools that would’ve aided my adventures
quite a bit, and I plan to use them in the future.</p>


<p>Armed with my <a href="https://www.saleae.com/">trusty logic analyzer</a>, I thought that
since it already has a rather nice UART decoding support, I’ll just export the
stuff from it into a simple to parse file, and then do a small program to draw
pretty things from that.</p>
<p><img src="https://lowerstrata.net/img/serial-tracing/saleae-serial-800.png" alt="Saleae Logic UART decoder"></p>
<p>Except that the export options for Saleae Logic do not support exporting the
protocol analyzer results (<strong><em>It actually does, please read on</em></strong>). I still love
the analyzer and the software, but I’d have to leave it behind. At least I could
export the actual digital trace data out from the program.</p>
<p>I’ve been waiting for a good problem to try <a href="https://sigrok.org/">sigrok</a> with.
I’ve been reading about it for a while, but didn’t have a problem to solve yet.
sigrok has a capable UART decoder, and supports command line exporting and
whatnot. Should’ve been trivial to achieve what I wanted. So, downloaded the latest release of <code>sigrok-cli</code> and PulseView and victory! Except that I failed completely to
load either of the exported formats (CSV and VCD) into PulseView. After figuring out where the code lives,
seems that the CSV decoder is incapable of handing data that is change-based.
Sequential CSV format would’ve worked, but I like working at high capture rates,
so the file sizes would’ve been prohibitive. The VCD import didn’t work either,
with very wrong imported results. So, damn you sigrok, I wanted to like you! (I
might come back to it eventually)</p>
<p>So, I was left without any sane manner of getting actual decoded data unless I
used the graphical Logic program manually. In the past, I’ve implemented
various tools that did quite complex analyses based on the change based CSV
that Saleae Logic exports, so I knew that writing a custom UART decoder was
doable. This was how <code>decode-serial</code> was born. It reads the
change based CSV in, recognizes UART frames and emits another CSV with the
timestamped recognized frames (aka “bytes” or “octets” if using 8-data bits per
frame).</p>
<p>From this (<code>decode-serial-csv/testdata/input/2017-09-23-serial-3000000-at-500Msps.csv.gz</code>):</p>
<pre><code>Time[s], DTRACE/SPI_MOSI, RX, UARTX
0.000000000000000, 0, 0, 1
0.362525714000000, 0, 0, 0
0.362526030000000, 0, 0, 1
0.362526330000000, 0, 0, 0
0.362526684000000, 0, 0, 1
0.362527020000000, 0, 0, 0
...
</code></pre>
<p>To this:</p>
<pre><code>timestamp(s),byte,isFrameValid,subascii
0.362525714000000,69,1,E
0.370543750000000,87,1,W
0.370661094000000,119,1,w
0.370664710000000,101,1,e
0.370762978000000,66,1,B
...
</code></pre>
<p>Like this (you can use the tool without the pipeline as well, but I tend to keep
CSV files in compressed format):</p>
<pre><code>zcat testdata/input/2017-09-23-serial-3000000-at-500Msps.csv.gz | \
./decode-serial.py UARTX 3000000 | \
gzip -9 &gt; testdata/output/2017-09-23-serial-3000000-transitions.csv.gz
</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-didn-t-actually-fail">What didn’t actually fail</h2>
<p>While writing this article I decided to do some “Deep Machine Learning Analysis”
and google whether it was at least somehow possible to export the protocol
analyzer data from Logic, and for sure, it is. It’s actually quite easy. The
feature just wasn’t located in a place where I looked for it. Ugh.
Co-incidentally, now that I’ve tried the export, the output format is compatible
with <code>generate-call-sequence</code> (covered below) once the display radix is first
set to <code>Dec</code>. So, ROTFL. On the other hand, it’s been a while that I had a
chance to write python properly and I have some future plans for the decoder,
so it wasn’t a completely useless exercise.</p>
<p><img src="https://lowerstrata.net/img/serial-tracing/science-dog-800.jpg" alt="Leading Advanced Deep Machine Learning Expert"></p>

<p>Once we have the individual frames recognized, the next issue is using them to
reconstruct “what happened”. Due to the nature of the tracing mechanism, it’s
best to use a single frame output to indicate when a specific function is
entered or left (separate codes and emitting are necessary for both). Sticking
to such an arrangement allows for a fairly light-weight operation, and if the
hardware peripheral has any kind of built-in queue available, pushing data out
can be made to happen without blocking the operation of the rest of code.
Although in my case the underlying output mechanism was strongly synchronized,
so I might’ve as well emitted more than a single byte at a time.</p>
<p>So, the code would have instrumentation akin to this:</p>
<pre><code>function execute {
  emitTraceByte('E');
  ...
  write(..);
  ...
  emitTraceByte('e');
}

function write(..) {
  emitTraceByte('W');
  ...
  // we've reached an important point within write, mark it (see below). Unlike
  // the other instrumentation here, this code does not have an "ending" pair
  emitTraceByte('D');
  ...
  emitTraceByte('w');
}

ISR complete {
  emitTraceByte('B');
  ...
  execute();
  ...
  emitTraceByte('b');
}
</code></pre>
<p>Given a list of single byte codes and timestamps when they were emitted, we can
then reconstruct a call-graph of a sorts (or rather, a call sequence). Assuming
we instrument the code always in pairs (enter and leave), this will be
sufficient to reconstruct a call “stack”. If the output mechanism works safely
from within ISRs, additional context information can be implicitly formed.</p>
<p>Next, we tell the <code>generate-call-sequence</code> tool how to translate the codes into
events (by placing these rules into a specification file):</p>
<pre><code>execute: E, e
write: W, w
complete: B, b, ISR1
callback: F, f
powerdown: C, c
sync: D
</code></pre>
<p>Above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each line starts with a label (e.g. <code>execute</code>). This label will be emitted
into the visualization and should describe the function entered (e.g. the
function name might be a good choice here)</li>
<li>Each label is followed by 1 to 3 additional parameters.</li>
<li>The 2 parameter form describes that we have something with a start and an end.
Start and end codes can be given in ASCII if in <code>[a-zA-Z]</code> or hex
(<code>0x</code>-prefix) or unsigned decimal numbers. Internally the sequence generator uses
python <code>int</code>s, so the available code space is fairly large.</li>
<li>The 1 parameter form describes that we have an event “mark”. These are meant
to mark some important “thing” which does not represent a function call per
se. Marks will have a distinct visual representation in the event viewer.</li>
<li>The 3 parameter form is similar to the 2 parameter form, but also includes the
name of the context that will be “entered” when the start code is encountered.
It is currently assumed that the context will be left simultaneously to leaving
the function that created the context, so expressing that separately is not
required (nor supported).</li>
<li>The convention of using capital letters as start codes and lowercase letters
as end codes makes it slightly easier to read the instrumented code, but
this is not a technical requirement. Any codes are allowed as long as
they’re unique in the specification and the parser does not reject them.</li>
<li>Acceptable characters for both labels and contexts are from the set
<code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</code>.</li>
<li>File format is ASCII, with support for comments (<code>#</code> starts a comment). For
file suffix, I’ve used <code>.gcs</code>, but you can use whatever you like.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t particularly like writing desktop GUI programs. I’ve yet to see a
toolkit / GUI-library that would fit my square hole I guess. So in general,
whenever user representation on desktop is required, I try to stick with either
CLI or HTML. However, some time back I ran across
<a href="https://github.com/nico/ninjatracing">ninjatracing</a>, which is a tool that
reads build logs generated by the quite awesome <a href="https://ninja-build.org/">ninja build tool</a> and emits “events” in JSON format. These events are in a
format that the Chrome’s built-in Trace Event profiling tool (aka <code>about:tracing</code>)
will read and lay out graphically. While the event viewer is geared towards Chrome
developers (and perhaps developers of highly-interactive …</p></section></article></div></div></div></div>

  <p>08 Sep 2020</p>

  <p>There’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rrAbLNePxU">a scene in Moneyball</a> in which Brad Pitt’s character, the
manager of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics">Oakland A’s</a>, is watching a recording of one of his
players trying so hard to run fast that he stumbles and falls. Lying on the
ground he’s angry at himself, because he doesn’t realize that right before he
started his run he hit a home run and scored the game-winning points. Watching
the scene, Pitt leans back, smiles a Brad Pitt smile and says: “how can you not
be romantic about baseball?”</p>

<p>There are moments in which I ask myself the same thing about programming.</p>

<p>We’re programming computers. We spend large parts of our days writing down
instructions for machines. Other parts of the day are spent making sure that we
chose the right instructions. Then we talk about those instructions: why and how
we picked the ones we picked, which ones we will consider in the future, what
those should do and why and how long it will probably take to write those down.</p>

<p>It can sound very serious and dry; a bureaucracy of computer instructions. And
yet.</p>

<p>And yet we, the ostensible bureaucrats, talk about magic as something that
exists —&nbsp;the good <em>and</em> the bad kind. There are <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/547625">wizards</a>. Instructions
are <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html">“like a sorcerer’s spells”</a>.</p>

<p>We don’t call them instructions, though, not when talking about what we produce
each day anyway. It’s code we write. Emotions are involved. Code, we say, can
be: neat, nice, clean, crafted, baroque, minimal, solid, defensive, hacky, <em>a
hack</em>, art, a piece of shit, the stupidest thing I’ve ever read, beautiful, like
a poem.</p>

<p>Some lines of code are a riddle to anyone but their author and the name code
serves as a warning. Other times, strangely, it’s a badge of honor.</p>

<p>Fantastic amounts of code have been written, from beginning to end, by a single
person, typing away night after night after night, for years, until one day the
code is fed to a machine and, <em>abracadabra</em>, a brightly coloured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#Development">amusement
park</a> appears on screen. Other code has been written, re-written, torn
apart and stitched back together across time zones, country borders and decades,
not by a single person, but by hundreds or even thousands of different people.</p>

<p>This world of programming is held together by code. Millions and millions of
lines of code. Nobody knows how much there is. Some of it is more than 30 years
old, some less than a week, and chances are you used parts of both yesterday.
There are lines of code floating around on our computers that haven’t been
executed by a machine in years and probably won’t be for another lifetime.
Others are the golden threads of this world, holding it together at the seams
without no more than a dozen people knowing about it. Remove one of these and it
all comes crashing down.</p>

<p>If you haven’t been here long enough and try to guess how much there is and how
many generations are layered on top of each other — you won’t even come close.
But stay around. After a while, more and more, you’ll find yourself in moments
of awe, stunned by the size and fragility of it all; the mountains of work and
talent and creativity and foresight and intelligence and luck that went into it.
And you’ll reach for the word “magic” because you won’t know how else to
describe it and then you lean back and smile, wondering how someone could not.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Software as a Service (SaaS) has become the dominant model for delivering business software. With SaaS, applications are hosted by a vendor and made accessible to end customers over the Internet on a subscription basis. The popularity of SaaS is making a substantial impact on the daily activities of IT workers. When software is hosted on internally managed PCs or servers, the IT department is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure that supports these systems. IT professionals need to procure, configure, test, and physically set up the hardware. Additionally, it is necessary to provide on-going support for the infrastructure in areas like security management, capacity planning, service continuity, and incident response. After shifting to the SaaS model, many of these activities are outsourced to the provider. <a href="https://www.bettercloud.com/wp-content/reports/451-research-bettercloud.pdf">IT workers spend far less time on tasks like managing data storage, upgrades, maintenance, and purchasing</a>.</p><h2 id="it-admins">IT Admins</h2><p>This threatens certain conventional roles in the IT Department. An engineer whose primary skillset is the physical installation of hardware cannot offer much value when the infrastructure has been outsourced to SaaS. However, the SaaS shift often frees up these IT professionals to focus on tasks that create more value for the business. IT workers become less technically focused and more connected to the business. The transition to cloud applications provides many benefits to IT admins including spending less time on daily maintenance, the increased ability to work remotely, increased participation in business strategy, improved relationships with business colleagues, and reduced boredom and frustration at work [38]. Therefore, although certain conventional IT roles are being eliminated, SaaS often enables these workers to move into more rewarding careers. System administrators that previously specialized in configuring on-site hardware are now responsible for designing and supporting cloud-based infrastructure. Database administrators that were previously focused on keeping a business’s databases healthy and running, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/changing-role-of-the-dba-4369434.pdf">are often being transitioned into data architects who understand how to cultivate and leverage data to achieve business objectives</a>.</p><h2 id="software-engineers">Software Engineers</h2><p>Software engineers are highly affected as well. As the SaaS market matures, every conceivable niche of the business problem is now addressed by one or more SaaS products. This is reducing the number of new custom software projects enterprises need to initiate. However, many organizations still invest in developing software that supports the broader business strategy. For example, an internally developed customer-facing web portal may provide competitive differentiation in the market. Even though the back-office processes may be running on a standard SaaS product, there are often bolt-on custom software applications that could be developed to improve the customer experience or help the operation run more efficiently.</p><p>As organizations become more focused on leveraging data to create business value, software engineering roles are often shifting to a data engineering focus. When an organization’s portfolio of SaaS products exposes data through open APIs, many opportunities arise for engineering teams to use data. Often data from multiple applications can be combined and correlated to provide valuable business insights. For example, customer communications from the CRM could be run through a sentiment analysis tool to analyze the current level of customer satisfaction, and then overlaid with the customer’s payment patterns in the accounts receivable system. The finance team could be alerted to an increased likelihood of past due payment or bad debt. When SaaS is the predominant software model, engineers will spend more time on data and process automation projects as opposed to building new business applications from scratch.</p><p>These trends will require software engineers to develop different skill sets. Although it is popular for those in software engineering careers to view programming as a craft or a calling, the real need for these workers in a corporate setting is to create automation that increases revenue or decreases costs. Organizations hire software engineers to create a competitive advantage in the market, satisfy customer requirements, and optimize processes to reduce labor costs. Software engineers that are well aligned with business strategy are better positioned for career success than those overly focused on the technical minutiae of their chosen programming language. Software engineering jobs now typically require writing skills, problem-solving skills, research skills, and competencies in teamwork and collaboration.</p><h2 id="what-s-your-saas-career-strategy">What’s Your SaaS Career Strategy?</h2><p>Whether you work in IT or not, the proliferation of SaaS will impact your career significantly. Your ability to adapt and learn will help you turn cloud technology into a competitive advantage in the job market. In future posts I will be offering some ideas on how you can leverage these trends to supercharge your career and thrive in the cloud economy.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I remember the first time I wrote a checkout system that took money from customers. It was for a paid real-time analytics product that I’d built – a few years before Google made it free with Analytics. I was using the Authorize.net API and was terrified. “What if I screw up the arithmetic and charge a customer too much? What if we get hacked?” but most importantly I struggled with the belief that anyone would actually pay us for software that I had built. It seemed unfathomable.</p>
<p>Like most things, as you mature as a software developer or product creator, you have a much better sense of how little you still know, which manifests as humility, making it hard to charge for your products.</p>
<p>You’ve written your own software or created your own product, and you know all about the various bugs, problems, inefficiencies, glitches and the various warts your baby has. So it is hard to look at it from a customer perspective and see the value, because you see all the things that need fixing or could be improved. You feel like your customer will see those things too and won’t pay until you fix every single one of them, at which point more perceived problems will have emerged, creating a never ending cycle.</p>
<p>You need to overcome these psychological barriers and realize that, as long as your software solves a real customer problem, and as long as solving that problem is worth more to your customer than the money you charge, you will make sales. Customers will buy. And those customers won’t return furious at you for not fixing every single bug, but will actually be happy that your product worked well enough. As Jim Collins once said, “Don’t let Great be the enemy of Good.”</p>

<p>It’s important that you overcome the psychological barrier to charging for your product or service early on. There are two core reasons for this:</p>
<p>Firstly, it ensures that you are building a business that can generate cash flow. If you make something free and have tremendous growth, it is as meaningless as standing on a street corner handing out $20 dollar bills. You are not validating your business model.</p>
<p>Secondly, everyone loves free stuff, and that love of free will poison your product decisions. You are getting feedback from people who incur no cost to use your product and thus the bar for product success is artificially low. You need feedback from people who incur a cost, so that they can inform your product decisions from a base of having incurred real cost. If your product decisions do not deliver enough value to justify what the product costs, you need to reevaluate and do better.</p>

<p>Pricing is weird. The more you charge, the more perceived value your product has, even before a customer learns about the product and tries it. Slap on an eye-wateringly high price and you will make a handful of sales, even on a brand new product targeting a new market. I’ve seen it happen. Your price won’t be optimal, but the psychology behind perceived value based on price is real and a useful input in your decision making.</p>
<p>The less you charge, the more you will find your customer service load per customer increases. Customers that pay less are more demanding. I’ve seen this pattern remain constant. It doesn’t apply to slight drops in pricing, but to products where prices are extremely low – in the $1 to $7 a month range. We’ve sold SaaS products at various prices with monthly or yearly subscription over the past 15 years and have found this to remain true.</p>
<p>There is a market for every price point. As our business budget has increased into the millions, I’ve discovered that it makes perfect sense for us to pay 6 figures and higher for certain things when the price is far lower than either: the cost of the problem, the revenue that we’ll earn by using the product, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>As a one or two person team, you’ll be sitting in a room, living off your savings and you’re going to have a very hard time believing that an enterprise customer will happily pay thousands or tens of thousands of dollars for your product per year. That is going to make it hard for you to make rational pricing decisions and very difficult for you to talk to customers and rationalize the cost of your product. This is an early stage problem that goes away quickly after your first few sales.</p>
<p>Start out low, but not too low, and increase your pricing. If you’re charging for a subscription product, it is easy to let your existing customers know that you’re increasing the price. Cut them a break e.g. give them their existing pricing for another year, or just grandfather them in at the old pricing on their existing licenses, which is what we did.</p>
<p>Starting higher and lowering prices later on is not a great look unless you provide a very clear and positive rationale. It risks your early adopters feeling like suckers and questioning their buying decision. It creates negative perceived value, as the product may not appear to be “worth” what it was when the price was higher.</p>
<p>At Wordfence, we started out at $17.95 per year, then raised the price to $35 per year, then to $49 per year, then to $99 per year. That shift happened between 2012 when we launched and around 2017. Those price increases seemed insanely high to me. I was sure our customers would revolt, that we’d receive social media pushback and outright incredulity from existing customers. None of those came to pass. In fact these increases created a positive outcome for our existing customers because we were able to grow the product and team, providing significantly more value.</p>

<p>Our hacked site cleaning business is interesting because we use a demand based pricing model. When our team gets busy, the price for site cleaning rises to help throttle demand. When they don’t have enough to do, the price automatically drops.</p>
<p>We recently conducted a financial study where we ‘bucketed’ buyers who paid $100 to $200 in one bucket, $200 to $300 in another bucket, all the way up to $2000. We plotted a bar chart showing how many buyers we had for a given pricing bucket for a given time period and separated the time periods into months with high demand and months with low demand.</p>
<p>In other words, we were able to examine our customer resistance to price increases as the pricing changed. Our average price is around $220 for a hacked site clean. When you examine this data, there appears to be no resistance to price increases, but then you have to consider that the price is increasing due to increased demand. So you’re really looking at how customers behaving in the face of increased price, but also increased demand. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Price elasticity of demand</a> says that as demand increases people will pay more. Ideally you’d want to see buyers still buying as you increase price and demand stays static.</p>

<p>I would be remiss without mentioning price discrimination. There is a rather unfortunate reality that some customers just want to spend money, some customers think through every purchase in a logical and systematic way, and others just want whatever the cheapest option is. I describe this reality as unfortunate because, if you create three versions of the same product and simply have a perceived differentiation between each product, but with a low, medium and high priced version, you will make more money.</p>
<p>You’ll make more money because customers that simply “want the best” will buy the higher priced version, some customers will just default to the middle tier, and others will make a rational choice to buy the lowest priced option or will default to that. If you had a single middle tier price, you’d exclude the “I want the best” customers and you may not make a sale to the deal shoppers.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, it is unethical to exploit price discrimination without actually having differentiated products that provide more or less value, and where that value has some relationship to the costs to produce or maintain those products. So be a good person, make good choices, but know that price discrimination is a very real phenomenon and potentially a low friction way to increase cash flow.</p>

<p>We’ve chatted about overcoming your psychological resistance to charging for your creations, that you should charge early to validate and help shape your product and business, the perceived value of higher prices and the customer service load associated with lower prices.</p>
<p>We also covered how it will be challenging for you, living on Ramen and tepid tap water, to charge a lot for a product that you created, and that you need to separate your circumstances from the reality of the market available for your product and what they’ll pay.</p>
<p>We talked about how it is easier to increase prices than decrease them, and I used Wordfence as an example of how radically pricing can change over the years, provided you continue to increase the value that your customers receive. Finally we discussed how taking a data driven approach can help, but may not provide all the answers, and about price discrimination and how it can increase pricing efficiency.</p>

Standard approaches involve Zoom, which is not only proprietary, but also quite a bit of a privacy nightmare. The last straw was the random placement of my speaker bauble head.</p><figure><img src="https://rgoswami.me/ox-hugo/2020-10-03_16-51-07_screenshot.png" alt="Figure 1: Zoom webcam placement"><figcaption><p>Figure 1: Zoom webcam placement</p></figcaption></figure><p>At this point, given that I was to set up a pre-recorded video for <a href="https://rgoswami.me/posts/pycon-in-2020-meta/">PyCon India 2020</a>, I decided to look into alternatives.</p><h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2><p>The search for alternative screen recording systems isn’t really a very new one. For group work (like <a href="https://wc3m.github.io/">W3cm</a>&nbsp;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>), I tend to prefer Skype, since it handles speaker galleries very well. Unfortunately, Skype has no capacity for recording single person calls, at least as yet. This is not the place for an extended debate on the pros and cons of Skype, or Google Meet (only records corporate accounts), or the rest. Instead, lets sum up all these issue with the simple understanding that, if <strong>one person</strong> wants to record a webcam connected to their local computer, along with the screen, it is insane to imagine that the only way to get this is by:</p><ul><li>Making an account somewhere (Zoom, Meet, Skype, anything)</li><li>Giving a cloud service permission to record our screens</li></ul><p>At the same time, a lot of standard tools for screen recording do not play nice with webcam recorders (like <a href="https://www.maartenbaert.be/simplescreenrecorder/">Simple Screen Recorder</a> and <a href="https://help.gnome.org/users/cheese/stable/">Cheese</a>).</p><h2 id="open-broadcaster-software">Open Broadcaster Software</h2><p>The <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=obs+studio&amp;ia=web">OBS studio project</a> is a godsend. It allows for simultaneously managing multiple streams, of both audio and video. Furthermore, since these are implemented as overlays, it is possible to fine-tune the positioning of each of these, which is something Zoom and friends lack.</p><figure><img src="https://rgoswami.me/ox-hugo/2020-10-03_16-53-51_screenshot.png" alt="Figure 2: Into the matrix"><figcaption><p>Figure 2: Into the matrix</p></figcaption></figure><p>The ability to resize the webcam is best shown in the figure below.</p><figure><img src="https://rgoswami.me/ox-hugo/2020-10-03_16-58-26_screenshot.png" alt="Figure 3: Almost Zoom, only better"><figcaption><p>Figure 3: Almost Zoom, only better</p></figcaption></figure><p>OBS also generates beautifully small videos and supports live-streaming.</p><h3 id="common-caveats">Common Caveats</h3><ul><li>The standard setting is set to work with hardware acceleration, which may not be present for many users<ul><li>Use the settings to change this back to the software setting</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>I cannot imagine going back to Zoom to record anything local.

One of the most important use cases in our ecosystem is addressing the <a href="https://cryptobriefing.com/guide-vulnerabilities-decentralized-finance/">many critical challenges</a> of decentralized finance (such as front running and lack of privacy). We are building applications to solve these problems and introduce more usable and sustainable DeFi products. Everything – transactions, lending, exchanges, wrapped assets, and stable coins – substantially benefits from privacy.</p><figure><a href="https://blog.scrt.network/programmable-privacy/"><div><p>Programmable Privacy</p><p>How giving full control of data privacy (and transparency) to end users and developers, instead of data monopolies, unlocks the true value of the decentralized web.</p><p><img src="https://blog.scrt.network/favicon.png"><span>Secret Network - Official Blog</span></p></div><p><img src="https://blog.scrt.network/content/images/2020/07/Programmable-Privacy.png"></p></a></figure><p>Below is a summary of just some of what our community hopes to implement next, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020!

With secret staking derivatives, users can pool SCRT in a secret contract that chooses how to stake pooled SCRT across validators in the network while issuing a synthetic staking derivative Secret Token (e.g., dxSCRT). In this sense, SCRT serves as collateral; dxSCRT is a liquid token, so it can be used or traded immediately. And because dxSCRT is a standard Secret Token, this particular staking derivative can be used privately.</p><p><em>What types of Secret DeFi applications will benefit from the liquidity unlocked by staking derivatives?

It can be slower since you have to search the text, and doesn’t work in all circumstances. But when it works, it does save quite a few clicks, especially because you can select the button with ⌃ (Ctrl) + index, similar to Vimium’s indexing of links.

I would list Karabiner as my first tool, but the process to set up and break in is a tad more involved. Karabiner works by mapping mouse actions (mouse up, down, left, right, click, etc) onto the keyboard. In my personal setup that lets me use either hand/side of the keyboard, I’ve mapped <em>⌃ (Ctrl) + wasd OR ijkl</em> to my mouse movements. I’ve also mapped actions such as scroll, click, and right click, and have a precise and fast mouse navigation setting.</p><p>There are some details to getting it set up, and tweaking it to your preferences, which will be explained in detail in a follow up blog post very shortly.</p><h2 id="b-mouse-keys-nativehttpssupportapplecomguidemac-helpcontrol-the-pointer-using-mouse-keys-mh27469mac-macoshttpssupportapplecomguidemac-helpcontrol-the-pointer-using-mouse-keys-mh27469mac"><a name="mk"></a><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/control-the-pointer-using-mouse-keys-mh27469/mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">b.

<strong>Update 10/1/20: I previously had not covered the premium version, and now have, updating Alfred’s position on my list from 5 to 4.</strong></p><p>Some swear by Alfred’s as a force multiplier, and there is a rich community of support. I didn’t understand it until I tried it myself. I’ve since retired Spotlight for Alfred. The free version offers a taste of it’s power, with lots of tedious actions exposed as keywords. But the real power comes from the custom workflows you can build or get from open-source: any action you could want to automate now at your fingertips you can use in Alfred. For example, by making bash to keywords in alfred, a basic task like toggling bluetooth or connecting to a device is now an option in alfred, thanks to someone who built this

Some of these tools work well in isolation, and others work better together in combination with each other and with native app shortcuts or OS shortcuts. For example, in Chrome, I limit my tabs to 9 with a chrome extension so I can navigate with command + tab number 1-9 (native chrome shortcut), use Vimium for clicking and indexing links, Karabiner for scrolling, and Alfred to quickly google or wikipedia in a new tab.</p><p>For that reason, I’d highly recommend spending even ten minutes getting intimate with all the shortcuts of your OS and the applications you use frequently. For me, knowing OneNote and Sublime Text shortcuts is essential.</p><p>In my opinion, shortcutting is much better than moving a cursor, even if controlled by a keyboard.</p><a name="mac"><h2 id="6-general-mac-shortcuts">6.

Let’s hold out for our godfather Elon Musk to make Neuralink a reality. The next step is when the computer I/O is no longer limited by dexterous digits.</p><p>I hope you find this post useful.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

      <div>
        <p>This is a list of tools I use to increase my privacy on the Internet. I'm not a security expert. My goal is to have a good enough protection. Feel free to suggest any additions and improvements.</p>
<h2 id="firefox">Firefox</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343120-ed616080-e00d-11ea-9451-f2c69ada5246.jpg" alt="firefox"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/exp/firefox/">Firefox</a> probably doesn't need an introduction. It is an open-source project. It's run by Mozilla - a non-profit organization. Anyone can go to the <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/">Firefox repository</a> to take a look at the code and see how it works.</p>
<p>Firefox doesn't gather your personal data to serve you ads as Chrome. While Google seems careful and to an extend trustworthy with handling people's personal data, you don't seem to have much control how your profile is built and used.</p>
<p>The browser is constantly being improved. It seems slightly heavier than Chrome or Safari on my computer, but that's a minor issue compared to all the advantages. I use the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Developer Edition</a>.</p>
<h2 id="little-snitch">Little Snitch</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343121-edf9f700-e00d-11ea-91d7-a2a876111ca1.jpg" alt="Little Snitch"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/">Little Snitch</a> is a MacOS application that  monitors connections and lets you control inbound and outbound traffic from your computer. It visualizes these connections and shows where applications connect. This way you have information about both familiar and unfamiliar network actions that applications are trying to perform.</p>
<h2 id="pihole-adguard">PiHole &amp; AdGuard</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343124-ef2b2400-e00d-11ea-8f26-f4dcbdf189d6.jpg" alt="Pi Hole">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343113-e9cdd980-e00d-11ea-8d17-642c01565237.jpg" alt="AdGuard"></p>
<p><a href="https://pi-hole.net/">PiHole</a> &amp; <a href="https://adguard.com/">AdGuard</a> are ad blockers. PiHole is open-source while AdGuard is a paid offering. I use one at home and the other one at the office. AdGuard is slightly easier to setup and use. Both work network-wide, but AdGuard also provides standalone applications and browser plugins to protect from ads when being outside of private networks.</p>
<h2 id="nibspace">Nibspace</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343122-ee928d80-e00d-11ea-950f-3514adfca5fa.jpg" alt="Nibspace"></p>
<p><a href="https://nibspace.com/">Nibspace</a> is an alternative to Google Analytics. It provides basic information about the visitors of my websites. It doesn't use cookies and it has a small footprint (~ 1kb) while being affordable ($1/mo per domain). It's not open-source. There are few other, notable competitors such as <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a>, <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/">Simple Analytics</a> and <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bitwarden">Bitwarden</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343117-ec303380-e00d-11ea-828d-c0bf960154a2.png" alt="Bitwarden"></p>
<p><a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> is an open-source password manager. I used to use 1Password, but I wanted something more affordable yet with similar features and Bitwarden fits the bill perfectly.</p>
<h2 id="nordvpn">NordVPN</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343123-ef2b2400-e00d-11ea-8026-de472ec96bc6.jpg" alt="Nord VPN"></p>
<p><a href="https://nordvpn.com/">NordVPN</a> is a personal virtual private network service provider. Their marketing seems aggressive, so I was a bit skeptical at the beginning, but then I decided to give it a try. Overall, NordVPN is one of the most polished and reliable VPNs I've used so far.</p>
<p>I also like that they show some innovation efforts, namely their NordLynx technology that is built around WireGuard - this relatively new VPN tunneling protocol</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21312609">NordVPN was hacked</a>, but they handled the whole situation pretty well in my view.</p>
<h2 id="fastmail">Fastmail</h2>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/200613/90343118-ecc8ca00-e00d-11ea-938b-7e9f884e8a6d.jpg" alt="Fastmail"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> is a paid e-mail service that focuses on privacy and doesn't display ads. It is a simple service to manage e-mails, calendars and contacts. It costs $5/mo. It is also fast. This is partly related to their work on a more reliable, faster IMAP alternative, called <a href="https://jmap.io/">JMAP</a> - so it goes beyond just a snappy UI.</p>

                    <p><em>This article is the third in a three part series that explores gold and Bitcoin in detail as products, including who the customers are for gold and Bitcoin, what jobs gold and Bitcoin do for them, and a perspective on the future markets for gold and Bitcoin.</em></p><h3 id="what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin"><strong>What everybody ought to know about gold and Bitcoin</strong></h3><ul><li><a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-1-of-3-gold-as-a-product/">Part 1: Gold as a product</a></li><li><a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-2-of-3-bitcoin-as-a-product/">Part 2: Bitcoin as a product</a></li><li>Part 3: The future for gold and Bitcoin <em>(this post)</em></li></ul><hr><p>On July 1, 1979, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman">SONY released the Walkman</a>. Initial sales were disappointing, and the industry laughed at it because the sound quality was so poor compared to high-end speaker systems. But Walkman went on to be one of Sony's most successful brands of all time, selling almost 400 million portable music players. Walkman was never intended for the small number of people buying high-end speakers. Walkman enabled a much larger number of people to listen to music in places they never could have previously. In other words, Walkman's competition was never high-end speakers, it was non-consumption.</p><p>On January 9, 2007, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone">Steve Jobs announced the iPhone</a>. There was no app store at the time, and people forget how many <a href="https://bgr.com/2016/07/01/iphone-reviews-original-negative-ballmer-dvorak/">negative reviews it received</a>. Because it was such a poor actual phone, many early adopters actually carried an iPhone in addition to their regular cell phone. Steve Ballmer said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U">"There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share</a>." So how did iPhone become Apple's most successful product ever, selling 2.2 billion units as of November 1, 2018, and extracting much of the profit from the wireless value chain that previously went to carriers? When iPhone launched, there were no smartphones that had web browsing and media consumption that people could actually use. The real competition for iPhone was non-consumption.</p><p>Uber was founded in 2009. When they were first raising money, many investors passed because they didn't think that the taxi market was big enough. But that was the wrong way to think about it. Uber's primary competition was not taxis, but non-consumption. And Uber ended up massively expanding the total market for rides.</p><p>What does all this have to do with gold and Bitcoin?</p><p>Similar to the products above, there have been no shortage of Bitcoin detractors since its launch on January 3, 2009. Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It does not have alternative uses like jewelry or industrial applications. And gold has had thousands of years to entrench its position in the world. How could Bitcoin ever replace gold?</p><p>But what if this Bitcoin versus gold debate is a false dichotomy? </p><p>What if the "Bitcoin is digital gold" narrative is incomplete or misleading? What if thinking about Bitcoin in the context of gold is like thinking about Uber in the context of taxis?</p><p>Bitcoin enables a larger group of people than ever before to protect their savings and purchasing power. It does not do everything gold does. It doesn't need to.</p><p>Bitcoin's main competition is not gold. It is non-consumption. </p><p>Walkman, iPhone and Uber all seemed like toys when they were first launched. And though they may have been "inferior" products, that didn't matter because they were being sold to different customers. Over time, each product got better and better, and people began to trade down because the product was good enough and saved them money. In time, the new "inferior" products actually became better than the incumbents. And the incumbents shrank or disappeared.</p><p>But does this apply to Bitcoin? Is Bitcoin getting better? Isn't it the same now as when it launched in 2009?</p><p>Looking at the Bitcoin software project on Github we can see that it receives thousands of additions and deletions each week, and has received a steadily increasing number of contributions to master from 2010 to 2020.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-1.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-1.png 1000w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/image-1.png 1600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/09/image-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Steady increase in Bitcoin commits to master (2010-2020)</figcaption></figure><p>Why is Bitcoin constantly being worked on and improved, even though it has no parent organization like Sony, Apple or Uber to push it forward?</p><p>Bitcoin works because it is a special kind of product. It's a multi-sided network.</p><p>Interaction between participants in the network creates incentives that drive the project forward. These network effects are why we see contributions to the Bitcoin project on Github growing at an increasing rate. </p><p>Let's map out the network flywheel¹ for Bitcoin and drop in the jobs to be done we identified in <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-2-of-3-bitcoin-as-a-product/">Part 2</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Bitcoin-Network-Flywheel-Map-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Bitcoin-Network-Flywheel-Map-2.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Bitcoin-Network-Flywheel-Map-2.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Bitcoin Multi-Sided Network Flywheel</figcaption></figure><p>The multi-sided network for Bitcoin begins with Satoshi Nakamoto's vision for sound digital money and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_bitcoin">early contributors</a> to the open source project and network. Once the network began to grow, specialized investors emerged to provide the financial capital necessary to develop the network. These investors typically hail from Silicon Valley or Wall Street, often co-invest on deals, and typically focus exclusively on cryptocurrency. Bitcoin mining operations developed, and these companies started building their own custom ASICs for mining, earning billions of dollars per year. Third party developers emerged to provide user-facing on-ramps and off-ramps to the Bitcoin network, as well as a wide range of infrastructure, analysis, trading and custodian services. Each layer of improvement to the network brought more users. Including more users, which itself brought more users.</p><p>The Bitcoin network exhibits increasing returns, which means that the more people who participate in the network, the more valuable the network is to every participant. This generates a natural monopoly and starts an exponential growth curve. </p><p>Gold is also a multi-sided network, but has weaker network effects.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Gold-Network-Flywheel-Map-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Gold-Network-Flywheel-Map-1.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/Gold-Network-Flywheel-Map-1.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Gold Multi-Sided Network Flywheel</figcaption></figure><p>The multi-sided network of gold begins with the metal itself and the memes behind why gold has been obsessed over for thousands of years. We discussed this in detail in <a href="https://andyjagoe.com/what-everybody-ought-to-know-about-gold-and-bitcoin-part-1-of-3-gold-as-a-product/">Part 1</a> of the series.</p><p>From here we move to investors, who have been putting financial capital to work developing new technologies and applications for gold for millennia. Today, the gold value chain is very mature, and even the promise of AI in the exploration process seems likely only to yield incremental results. </p><p>Incentivized by the value of gold, miners perform the costly and time consuming process of locating gold deposits and producing doré, a metallic alloy containing between 60-90% gold. The steps in this process are <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/exploration">exploration</a> (1-10 years), <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/development">development</a> (1-5 years), <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/operation">operation</a> (10-30 years), <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/decommissioning">decommissioning</a> (1-5 years) and <a href="https://www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/how-gold-is-mined/mine-reclamation">reclamation</a>. </p><p>The doré that gold miners produce is then the basis for a complex ecosystem of third parties that add value and create useful applications from gold. Refiners like Valcambi, PAMP, and Heraeus convert doré into semi-fabricated metals and alloys for use in the industrial and jewelry sectors and investment grade bullion and coins. Gold bullion is then accredited by the LBMA for <a href="http://www.lbma.org.uk/good-delivery-explained">good delivery</a> and then stored in vaults like the New York Federal Reserve and the Bank of England before being traded over the counter in London and Zurich or on exchanges like the London Mercantile Exchange. Gold futures are most often traded on COMEX in New York, and companies like State Street Global Advisors and Blackrock have built financial products like gold ETFs that have claims on gold bullion.</p><p>The products produced by this third party ecosystem are bought by consumers as jewelry, investors as bars/coins or financial products with claims to bars/coins, central banks and industrial users. For consumers, investors and central banks, gold is valuable because other people find it valuable. And the more people who find it valuable and will accept it in exchange for goods and services, the more valuable it is to all. This is the primary network effect in the gold network.</p><p>Bitcoin has a similar network effect. It too is valuable because other people find it to be valuable. And the more people who find it valuable and will accept it in exchange for goods and services, the more valuable it is to all. </p><p>But Bitcoin's network effect is different, because gold is physical and Bitcoin is digital. The software eats the world hypothesis says that any product or service in any field that can become software, will become software. We see these dynamics play out in industry after industry, and the field of hard money and wealth preservation is no exception. </p><p>Why is digital different? Digital products can take advantage of zero marginal costs and universality of compute, attributes that a non-digital substitute cannot compete with. Bitcoin is ten times better than gold on a few very important factors that dramatically improve its usability and accessibility compared gold for the average person. Bitcoin can be instantly transmitted anywhere in the world, it is easily and instantly divisible in a way that gold is not, it is trivial to carry (no matter the quantity), and it is hard to seize. </p><p>These benefits effectively expand the market for Bitcoin to a much larger number of network participants compared to gold. And Metcalfe's law projects that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its number of nodes.</p><p>And unlike gold, this is not where Bitcoin's network effects end. Because Bitcoin is software, it is steadily getting better, whereas gold remains unchanged. We have already shown above the increasing rate at which contributions are being made by Bitcoin network participants to Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin has the advantage of Moore's law with respect to compute and storage cost, and because trust is built into the network itself, third party developers typically open source all their code so there is a same-side network effect among third party developers who borrow each other's code and best practices. This adds an incredible accelerant to the Bitcoin network and stands in contrast to gold's well developed but opaque and closed third party ecosystem.</p><p>That said, Bitcoin still has a long way to go relative to other …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

  <div><p>Right so yes I've spent over 25 years writing software for people in a professional capacity. As time has gone by, and I've learnt more about the process, I've slowly realised that actually writing code is actually quite a small part of the process. When I was a junior developer I probably spent 90% of my working day sat in front of an editor writing code. And I thought that was the job. Turns out it really isn't!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I think people both inside and outside of the industry fixate on coding for a number of reasons, and it's quite interesting to ruminate on those, but building software is so much more than writing code. Talking to users, agreeing on features, designing the interface, setting up the infrastructure, testing the platform for bugs, testing it for performance, providing support for it. These are all messy, imprecise things that have very human factors.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>If you are a software engineer you can often seek solace in the code itself. Code is truth. You can't really argue with it. You can't argue with your compiler. It's really easy to fall into the trap of avoiding all work other than coding for these very reasons. But I would suggest that this makes you a really bad engineer! Engineering means getting your hands dirty, either literally in the case of Brunel, or from a human interaction point of view where software is concerned.</p></div>

  <div><p>So you are sort of saying that an engineer solves problems, and problems are experienced (mostly) by people, so to solve problems effectively you a) have to deal with people and b) have to really know how to solve the problem (e.g. dealing with infrastructure, performance, etc.) instead of only the parts you are comfortable with. Is that correct?</p></div><div><p>How much of this comes down to the attitude of the engineer? And how much of this comes down to actively studying?Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>In my experience, almost 100% of that learning comes from hard won experience.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>When I studied at university, I was really surprised to discover that the "Computing" courses that I was interested in were labelled as "Software Engineering". I thought it was odd at the time; I never really had thought it about it before, and I was even a bit worried that I might have been signing up for the wrong course!Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I don't think many universities at the time offered "Computer Science" as an undergrad course; it's a very different discipline.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>It took me a LONG time to get my head around the fact that one of the words in the job was "engineering". And really the only way I realised that was after years of working building software. At some point the penny dropped that I was an engineer, and that writing code was only 1 aspect of that job.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

  <div><p>There are a number of things that people starting off in a career of Software Engineering should try and keep in mind.</p></div><div><div><ol>
<li>Never stop learning. Software development is still a very immature discipline. I like to think about it like building jet aeroplanes. After the jet engine was invented, flying on a jet passenger plane was pretty dangerous! Google "the de Havilland Comet". There was so much new engineering that needed to be learnt to get to the point where now it is pretty much the safest mode of transport in the world. The software industry is still building de Havilland Comets to a certain degree. So much is being learnt in terms of best practices, what works and what doesn't. If you don't constantly learn new things, you will be left behind.</li>
<li>You know less than you think. You can wield great power writing software and it can go to your head! Good engineers are humble and never think they either know it all or know better than others.</li>
<li>Stretch yourself. If you know an OOP language, learn a functional one like Elixir or Haskell. If you have spent a lot of time with a very high level language like Python, try Rust. Think of it like a gym. The machine you cant stand the site of is probably the one doing you the most good.</li>
<li>It is an art as well as a science. There is room for beauty and elegance in software.</li>

  <div><p>I sort of feel swamped by things that I don't know, almost to the point of paralysis.</p></div><div><p>I'm new to Ruby on Rails and know that there is a huge ocean of knowledge that I could keep swimming in, but then again I'm competent enough to build this reasonably functioning Taaalk website. I look at React, which might help me get a job, and unlike with Rails, I know none of that currently. And then there are tangential things, for example improving my git skills.</p></div><div><p>It feels confusing, especially without a job where problems to solve aren't put in your plate. And it feels confusing because I can doÂ&nbsp;<em>enough to create</em>. I could probably build most things in my mind with Rails and a standard html.erb + scss front end... but while I would learn something, I wouldn't be learning in leaps and bounds in the same way I was when I was learning Ruby/Rails for the first time. I guess what I'm saying is that, in some ways, my ability to create is separated from my need to make drastic educational strides - so it is confusing to know what to focus on.</p></div><div><p>If you were in my shoes what would you be optimising for?

  <div><p>A good rule of thumb for things like personal projects. If you want to learn something new, build the project with new tools, languages and frameworks. If you want to actually build a project, use what you know. So it depends what the point of the project is. I guess if you want to do both you have to just accept that it will take longer using whatever new shiny stuff youâ€™re using.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>Tech and software engineering has always been obsessed with the new thing. People just canâ€™t help themselves! Itâ€™s fine if youâ€™re just working by yourself and playing around with a new language or framework, but if you are making those decisions on behalf of an employer with a large team, you can easily burn millions of pounds by making the wrong choice. The hard part of all this is making consistently right choices given varying contexts and requirements.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>This goes back to what I was saying about engineering. It is not just coding. Itâ€™s the ability to understand a new technology, digest what is good and bad about it, consider it subjectively and then make a decision based on all that information. Good engineers will be good at that, and will be opinionanted about it as well. Being careful and conservative when they need to be, and working on the cutting edge when it makes sense.Â&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>I would recommend not trying to do 4 new things at once. So if you want to learn Flutter or React Native, donâ€™t then something totally foreign for the backend API. Just take it one step at a time. That way you will strike a balance between the fear and excitement of learning something new, and without the admitted drudgery of knocking out features that have no interesting aspects.Â&nbsp;</p></div>

October 3, 2020 | https://jix.one/the-assembly-language-of-satisfiability/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jix.one/the-assembly-language-of-satisfiability/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently there has been a some discussion about how much practical use is seen by certain methods coming out of academia, especially those methods for which a wide practical applicability is often claimed.
Among these are techniques are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem">SAT</a> solvers, which I quite like and with which <a href="https://jix.one/project/varisat">I am also somewhat familiar</a>.
This lead to questions about how to make SAT solvers easier to use.
In this post I will give my personal perspective on that question.</p>
<p>The discussion started with <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyjkun/status/1303057920419004416">Jeremy Kun’s post on Twitter</a>, where he asked for concrete examples where SAT solvers are used in practice.
He wrote about the responses in <a href="https://buttondown.email/j2kun/archive/whats-in-production/">his newsletter</a> and while he concedes that SAT solvers are more widely used than he initially thought, for some of the examples people responded with, he remains skeptical towards whether they really are as widely used as claimed.</p>
<p>While I don’t want to go into how widely used SAT solvers are on an absolute scale, I personally think that SAT solvers, or rather methods based on SAT solvers, have the potential to be used much more widely than they currently are.
This raises the question: what is stopping the industry from making more use of SAT solvers wherever applicable?</p>
<h2 id="are-we-bad-at-sat-solvers">Are We Bad at SAT Solvers?</h2>
<p>In his latest <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/">newsletter</a> titled “We’re Bad at SAT Solvers”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, Hillel Wayne argues that this is a problem of usability.
SAT solvers require the input problem to be a propositional logic formula in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form">conjunctive normal form (CNF)</a>.
Apart from a few rare exception, this is not a natural way to express most problems which we want to solve using a SAT solver.
Even worse, as Hillel notes, translating problems into equivalent CNF formulas is not a straightforward process.
For a single given problem, there are often many different ways to do this.
Selecting a good approach often requires a lot of experience, some knowledge of SAT solver internals and running careful experiments.
Additionally, experience in encoding one problem domain into CNF might not translate to the problems of a different domain.</p>
<p>Even for seemingly simple constraints which are part of many problems, like counting the number of set Boolean variables, there is a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=cardinality+constraints+CNF">vast amount of literature, including recent publications,</a> detailing different trade-offs that can be made.
These trade-offs are also not just an academic concern, but can make the difference between solving a problems in seconds or giving up after running the solver for days.
Many practical problems will contain different kinds of constraints and expecting users to be familiar with the corresponding literature for each of them is certainly a barrier for wide scale adoption.</p>
<h2 id="making-sat-solvers-easier-to-use">Making SAT Solvers Easier to Use</h2>
<p>In his newsletter Hillel then wonders what it would take to make them more useful to the industry.
He does mention that the related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisfiability_modulo_theories">SMT solvers</a> seem to be doing much better in this regard, and consequently have a lot more users than SAT solvers.
SMT solvers are similar to SAT solvers, but allow much more freedom in the way the input problem can be expressed.
You are not limited to Boolean variables, but also have integers, fixed-width integers, arrays and other datatypes (depending on which SMT solver you use), you have many common operations on those types and you don’t have to get your problem into a specific normal form.
All that often comes with an API that allows you to manipulate the input formula as an abstract syntax tree, which you can inspect at any time.</p>
<p>I think the observation that SMT solvers are much easier to use than SAT solvers is an important observation.
At the same time, I think it also answers his question on how an easier to use SAT solver would look like: you would get an SMT solver.</p>
<p>So why are SAT solver authors not trying to lift some of the input restrictions like requiring CNF?
Or if SMT solvers work just as well as SAT solvers, why are people still working on those hard to use SAT solvers?</p>
<p>To answer these questions we need to have a very high-level look at how SMT solvers work.
This will also allow us to understand why people working on SAT solvers tend to implicitly count all applications of SMT solvers when talking about applications of SAT.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-smt-solvers-work">How do SMT Solvers Work?</h2>
<p>For SMT solvers there are two general approaches which dominate the landscape: bit-blasting and CDCL(T). Often solvers combine these or add additional techniques on top of this, but those two techniques form the backbone of any SMT solver I’m aware of.</p>
<h3 id="bit-blasting">Bit-Blasting</h3>
<p>Bit-blasting describes the process of taking the input formula and directly encoding it into an equivalent Boolean formula in CNF, which can then be solved by a SAT solver.
This process is limited to formulas where every data type has a finite set of values, as otherwise there is no direct way to encode each variable using a finite set of Boolean variables.
Luckily, a lot of software makes use of fixed-width integers, so bit-blasting is often very effective for problems that come from all kinds of software analysis.</p>
<p>I’m aware of two SMT solvers that use bit-blasting as their main strategy, <a href="https://github.com/Boolector/boolector">Boolector</a> and <a href="https://stp.github.io/">STP</a>, both having won several awards at solver competitions.
Both of them also use stand-alone SAT solvers to solve the encoded CNF formula. Boolector offers the choice between <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/cadical/">CaDiCaL</a>, <a href="https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat">CryptoMiniSat</a>, <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/">Lingeling</a>, <a href="https://github.com/niklasso/minisat">Minisat</a> and <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/">Picosat</a>, of which CryptoMiniSat and Minisat are also offered by STP.</p>
<p>For bit-blasting this makes clear that we need a SAT solver as backend and that any improvement to SAT solving also translates into a corresponding improvement to SMT solvers based on this approach. They can be accurately described as additional tooling around a SAT solver, that makes it easier to use and easier to apply to a wider area of problems. This way only the authors of the SMT solver need to be aware of all the techniques for encoding problems into CNF, lifting that burden from the users.</p>
<h3 id="cdclt">CDCL(T)</h3>
<p>The other approach, CDCL(T), is slightly more complicated, but also more flexible, as it can handle input problems with variables that have an infinite domain.
In common with bit-blasting though, is that it is again based around a SAT solver.
The CDCL stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-driven_clause_learning">conflict driven clause learning</a>, which is the algorithm employed by most modern SAT solvers<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and the T stands for the extension with certain so-called theories. A theory here is just a collection of supported non-Boolean datatypes and operations which are also allowed in the input formula.</p>
<p>To work around this in CDCL(T) we construct a Boolean formula which is a sound over-approximation of the input formula.
I’m going to gloss over a lot of details, but essentially we can do this by replacing any subterm of the formula that we cannot encode by an unconstrained variable.
This formula can then be solved by a SAT solver.
If the solver declares the formula unsatisfiable, we know that our input problem is also unsatisfiable because our approximation can only make it easier to satisfy.
If the SAT solver produces a Boolean solution to our approximated problem, we then need to check whether we can extend it to a solution to the input problem.
This is done using so-called theory solvers, which handle the non-Boolean datatypes and operations.
If they are able to extend the solution to satisfy the input problem, we are done, otherwise the theory solvers produce some data which allows us to refine our Boolean over-approximation in such a way that it better approximates the input formula.
Then the process is repeated until either the SAT solver decides the problem to be unsatisfiable or until the theory solvers produce a solution.</p>
<p>As far as I’m aware<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, most CDCL(T) solvers come with their own SAT solver, which is tightly integrated to make the interaction between theory solvers and the SAT solver as efficient as possible.
Still those integrated SAT solvers use the same techniques, the same data structures and the same algorithms as stand-alone SAT solvers.
Any improvement made to stand-alone SAT solvers will find its way into integrated SAT solvers and vice versa.</p>
<p>There are too many solvers based on this approach to list them all here, but examples are <a href="https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3">Z3</a>, which seems to be the most popular, or <a href="https://cvc4.github.io/">CVC4</a> which has won many awards at solver competitions.</p>
<h2 id="cnf-as-assembly-language">CNF as Assembly Language</h2>
<p>This high-level description might leave you with the impression that SMT solvers are mostly thin wrappers around a SAT solver.
This would be far from the truth.
In my description I simply focused on the part where SAT solvers are used.
Overall I think a SAT solver is a significant part of a state-of-the-art SMT solver, but the majority of necessary complexity lies elsewhere, especially for CDCL(T) based solvers.</p>
<p>I think a good analogy of the relationship between the interface offered by SAT solvers and SMT solvers is that of assembly language and high level languages.
Here Boolean CNF formulas correspond to a universal assembly language that is supported by different SAT solver implementations, much like you can get CPUs that run the same instruction set from different vendors.
Keeping this layer as simple and minimal as possible, even if that complicates manual use, helps a lot with making different implementations compatible.
This in turn leads to increased competition between solvers, which I think played an important part in the improvements we’ve seen over the years.</p>
<p>SMT solvers then allow you to effectively use a SAT solver without having to be an expert in CNF encoding.
They give you a much easier to use input language and at the same time free you from making a lot of low-level decisions that would require expert knowledge about SAT solvers.
This is very much like compilers allow you to use high level languages while freeing you from having to worry about details like e.g. instruction scheduling or register allocation.
Also these days no one would call a modern compiler a thin wrapper that produces assembly code (I hope!).</p>
<p>The analogy even extends a bit further: Sometimes for specific problems that could be solved with an SMT solver, an …</p></div></div>

I was getting stripe notion on every 10 minutes. Someone bought Business Plan Lifetime subscription for $249. I was getting so excited &amp; feeling a high responsibility for the users.</p><p>And finally, the experiment was really successful &amp; I made $20,228 in less than 48 hours. I become the first solo millionaire in my country within 2 days.</p><p>It’s not about I never made that much money in my life, I sold the first product I build in Jan’2019 for $23k.

		<span></span>
		<span><p>The Sound Blaster 1.0 was not the first PC sound card, but it was the first to support digital sound, two different types of sound synthesis, MIDI, and a joystick all in one card. Let’s lift the hood and examine how the card does its magic.<br>
You can follow along by <a href="https://github.com/schlae/snark-barker/blob/master/SnarkBarker.pdf">looking at the schematic here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Playback</strong><br>
There are three methods a Sound Blaster card uses to play back digital audio.</p>
<p><strong>Direct DAC</strong><br>
The first is called Direct DAC and it means that the PC software has to feed the sound card each sample at just the right time. It works a lot like the parallel-port DACs that people used to build in the 80s and 90s, or like the Disney Sound Source. When you send a data byte to the sound card, it immediately changes the analog signal going into the speaker amplifier.</p>
<p>Software using this method typically sets up a periodic timer interrupt. In the interrupt handler, the new sample is calculated and then fed to the sound card for playback.</p>
<p>Although it’s a simple method, it produces extra noisy playback to due the timing jitter of the interrupt handler. Because PC interrupts are non-deterministic, the samples don’t occur at precisely the sampling rate. This timing difference means that the waveform being reproduced doesn’t match the source material, and the difference in voltage sounds like noise or hiss.</p>
<p><strong>DMA DAC</strong><br>
The other method uses the DMA (Direct Memory Access) controller on the PC motherboard to automatically send samples to the sound card. It does require a little bit more work to set up the operation.</p>
<ol>
<li>The software configures the PC’s DMA controller (historically an Intel 8237) with the source address and length. The DMA controller is set to perform a single transfer per DMA request (DREQ).</li>
<li>The Sound Blaster is configured for a particular sampling rate. It programs an internal timer to generate a DREQ signal at the sampling rate.</li>
<li>The software sends the playback command to the Sound Blaster.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next operations happen in a loop until all the samples have been played back. Notice that the software is not involved at all—just the DMA controller, the Sound Blaster, and main memory.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Sound Blaster asserts DREQ.</li>
<li>The DMA controller responds by asserting DACK (DMA Acknowledge) at the same time it places the memory address and memory chip select onto the bus. The data byte gets transferred directly from main memory into the Sound Blaster input register!</li>
<li>The Sound Blaster takes this data and sends it to the audio DAC.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, the Sound Blaster ends playback then triggers an interrupt to let the software know that it is done with playback.</p>
<p><strong>Auto-Initialize DMA DAC</strong><br>
The final method, introduced with the Sound Blaster 2.0, is very similar to the previous method, except the ending. The Sound Blaster triggers an interrupt as before, but then it reloads the sample counter to the original value and continues requesting samples from the DMA controller!</p>
<p>The usual way software uses this feature is to create a seamless digital audio stream using a double buffer. The DMA controller gets a buffer that is twice as big as the number of samples that the Sound Blaster is programmed to play back. Because of that, the interrupt gets triggered halfway through buffer playback. In the interrupt handler, the software then loads a new set of samples into the buffer half that has already been played. When playback hits the end of the DMA buffer, the interrupt triggers again, only this time the software refills the last half of the DMA buffer. The DMA controller then wraps around to the beginning of the buffer and playback continues unbroken.</p>
<p>One of the side effects of this approach is that if the software crashes, the DMA controller and sound card continue to play back the sample buffer in a loop. You may have heard this when playing old DOS games back in the day.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Recording</strong><br>
This works in very much the same way as playback including the Direct mode, DMA mode, and Auto-Init DMA modes, except data gets transferred in the opposite direction, from the sound card into main memory.</p>
<p>One interesting wrinkle is that the Sound Blaster doesn’t actually have a proper ADC (analog-to-digital converter)! Instead it uses a clever circuit and an algorithm to accomplish the same thing:</p>
<ol>
<li>An input filter processes the incoming sound to smooth out any high frequency transients. This is common practice, even with an ADC, to help prevent sampling-induced aliasing, but it it’s helpful for making the trick work.</li>
<li>A comparator looks at the difference between the audio DAC and the incoming signal. The output of the comparator is only one bit; it can only tell if the incoming signal is greater than or less than the setting of the audio DAC.</li>
<li>The DSP starts the audio DAC at the halfway point, then looks at the comparator output. The comparator output gets recorded as the most significant bit of the audio sample.</li>
<li>Depending on the bit, the DSP sets the audio DAC up or down half again—either 25% or 75%.</li>
<li>The DSP repeats steps 3 and 4, going halfway again and again until it’s obtained the 8 bits of a complete sample.</li>
</ol>
<p>This technique is known as successive approximation, and it’s a technique used in many ADC chips. The code looks something like this:<br>
<code><br>
mov	p1,#80h		; Start DAC at the halfway point, 1000 0000<br>
mov	c,t1			; 1 Put comparator output into carry bit<br>
mov	p1.7,c			; 2 If greater, then leave MSB as is. If less, clear MSB<br>
setb	p1.6			; 1 Set DAC to upper or lower halfway point<br>
mov	c,t1			; 1 Check comparator output again<br>
mov	p1.6,c			; 2 Rinse and repeat<br>
setb	p1.5<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.5,c<br>

mov	p1.1,c<br>
setb	p1.0<br>
mov	c,t1<br>
mov	p1.0,c<br>
mov	a,p1			; We are done, copy DAC code into accumulator.</code></p>
<p><strong>The Hardware, Section By Section</strong></p>
<p><strong>Address Decoder</strong><br>
The address decoder takes the I/O port address off the ISA bus and looks for accesses at 210h, 220h, 230h, 240h, 250h, or 260h depending on the jumper setting. It also looks for 388h and 389h so that it can make the Yamaha OPL2 chip appear there for Adlib compatibility. It also decodes 0x200-207h as the joystick port (each address is actually the same).</p>

<p>A jumper, JP1, can be pulled to shut off the PC joystick port. The MIDI function still works, however. Many combo-IO boards came with a built-in joystick port so the one on the Sound Blaster may not always be needed.</p>
<p><strong>Reset Circuit</strong><br>
It’s important to make sure the card powers up in a good state without generating spurious noises, so the SB uses the ISA RESET signal to clear the OPL2, the CMS chips, the joystick one-shot, and basically all of the other internal state latches.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/reset.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/reset.png" alt="" width="496" height="159"></a></p>
<p>There is also an IO port that, if you write a 1 to it, resets the DSP and its associated bus interface. (You also have to write a 0 to it afterwards to allow the DSP to start operating.) Later versions of the DSP require this to exit high speed auto-init DMA mode, since in this mode, the DSP devotes 100% CPU to servicing DMA requests.</p>
<p><strong>DSP</strong><br>
The core of the digital sound capabilities of the Sound Blaster is the Digital Sound Processor, or DSP for short. It’s not actually a Digital Signal Processor in the traditional sense—it’s just an 8051 microcontroller with custom firmware.</p>
<p>The DSP also handles MIDI transmit and receive using the 8051’s built-in UART.</p>
<p><strong>DSP Bus Interface</strong><br>
The bus interface allows the host PC to talk to the DSP. It uses two unidirectional 8-bit registers as a “mailbox,” temporary holding areas for a single data byte. One is for PC-to-DSP communications, and the other is for DSP-to-PC communications. There are also two data flip flops that are used to signal when data is available in one of the registers.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mailbox.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mailbox.png" alt="" width="349" height="362"></a></p>
<p>When the PC sends data to the DSP (I/O port 2XCh), the data gets stored in an 8-bit register and the flip-flop is automatically set high (DAV_DSP).</p>
<p>When the DSP reads the register, the flip-flop gets cleared automatically.</p>
<p>When the DSP sends data to the PC, the data goes into the other 8-bit register and the other flip-flop automatically gets set (DAV_PC). The PC can check this bit by reading from I/O port 2XEh. When it reads from I/O port 2XAh, it receives the byte of data and the flip-flop automatically gets cleared. The DSP can see that the PC has read the byte by checking the DAV_PC input. The DSP often checks this pin to make sure the PC has read a data byte before writing a new data byte to the register, otherwise the byte in the register will be lost before the PC has a chance to read it.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/data-flags.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/data-flags.png" alt="" width="441" height="355"></a></p>
<p><strong>Interrupts</strong><br>
When the DSP is done with a particular (often lengthy) task, it can signal the host PC by asserting the interrupt line. It does this by pulsing IREQUEST which triggers a flip-flop that asserts the IRQ line on the PC bus. On the host PC, the interrupt handler is supposed to clear the interrupt by reading from I/O port 2XEh. This simply clears the flip-flop which then deasserts the IRQ line.</p>
<p><a href="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/interrupt-flag.png"><img src="http://tubetime.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/interrupt-flag.png" alt="" width="426" height="281"></a></p>
<p><strong>DMA</strong><br>
When the DSP needs a new sample from the PC (or needs to transfer a new sample to the PC during record mode), it pulses the DREQUEST line. Note that the DSP also needs to enable DMA by asserting its DMA_EN# line. When DREQUEST pulses, it causes the DMA request flip-flop to output a 1 on the DRQ1 line. The PC’s DMA controller responds by asserting DACK1#, which clears the flip-flop. DACK1# also bypasses the address decode logic of the Sound Blaster and forces it to either accept data from or place data on the ISA bus lines. This data transfer happens between the ISA bus and the mailbox registers.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Audio Output</strong><br>
An 8-bit DAC connected to the 8051 generates an analog current corresponding with the digital code on its inputs. A current-to-voltage converter (U5C) changes the current into a voltage that is used by the rest of the circuit. This voltage goes through an antialiasing filter which removes distinctive- and ugly-sounding artifacts from the audio signal. U5A implements this filter using a Sallen-Key design. The filter cutoff frequency is about 4KHz, …</p></span></p></div></div>

                <div>
                    <p>With today's zero or negative real interest rates, deciding what to do with your cash and short term savings has never been harder.</p><p>Savings accounts at major banks have paid close to 0% for nearly a decade, but now even online banks, credit unions and cash accounts from fintech startups pay 0.6% at best. CDs, "high yield" checking, and money market accounts are no better and come with even more restrictions. Treasuries? 1 month and 1 year T-Bills <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=billrates">also pay near zero</a>. Bond funds? Expense ratios, changing prices, default risk and minimums make these too complicated for the typical saver. What about peer-to-peer lending sites like Lending Club? These generate what seem like good returns, but it's hard to overstate the risk. You're making loans to people or businesses that didn't qualify for a loan from a traditional lender.</p><p>After exhausting all these options, you might just give up and decide to play the lottery with your savings. Since 1956, the UK government has offered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premium_Bond">Premium Bonds</a>, where interest for bond holders is determined by lottery. This gamified experience is one of the top savings vehicles in the UK, where about <a href="https://nsandi-corporate.com/media-resources/premium-bonds-factsheet">one third of citizens hold bonds valued in total at over $100 billion</a>. A startup named <a href="https://www.withyotta.com/">Yotta</a> just graduated from <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?batch=S20">Y Combinator's Summer 2020</a> batch to launch a similar business in the US, and <a href="https://www.pooltogether.com/">PoolTogether</a> raised a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pooltogether/company_financials">seed round</a> led by <a href="https://www.ideocolab.com/ventures/">IDEO Colab Ventures</a> early this year for a blockchain-based version. Of course, these models are based on lotteries. They're gambling. Most people receive nothing, and any expected value calculation would tell you this game is not worth playing.</p><p>Are savings options so bad that people would rather gamble for the remote chance of winning some interest than even be bothered with a traditional savings vehicle?</p><p>Why have rates been so low for so long? Is there any end in sight?</p><h2 id="age-of-abundance">Age of Abundance</h2><p>Technology and digitization are driving incredible improvements in global quality of life, moving the world from an era of scarcity into an era of abundance. </p><p>Thirty years ago, finding an answer meant going to the library to read some books or asking people you knew. As of 2016, Google had indexed <a href="https://searchengineland.com/googles-search-indexes-hits-130-trillion-pages-documents-263378">130 trillion web pages</a>, providing instant answers to anything for everybody. Information is no longer scarce, and what's now scarce is matching the best answer to a question. Alex Danco calls this <a href="https://alexdanco.com/2019/09/07/positional-scarcity/">positional scarcity</a>.</p><p>Similar technology-driven processes of commoditizing supply and aggregating demand are playing out in industry after industry, giving rise to natural super-monopolies. Amazon has done this first in books, then in all retail. Netflix has done this in entertainment, Airbnb in accommodation, iTunes and Spotify in music, Facebook in your personal life, and Linkedin in your business life. The list goes on and on, and this software eats world process is still in the early innings.</p><p>The dark side to all this abundance is that technology is generating a Moore's law fueled deflationary cycle. Technology gives you more for less. This, by definition, is deflation. The faster technology spreads throughout the economy, the more deflationary pressure there is. In 2009, Microsoft was the only technology company in the top ten S&amp;P 500 companies by market cap. In 2019, the top five companies in the S&amp;P 500 by market cap were all technology companies. Humans, by nature, find it extremely difficult to see and understand exponential growth even when it is happening right in front of them.</p><p>If you want to test if you have a good feel for exponential growth, <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBooth">Jeff Booth</a> in his book the <a href="https://amzn.to/3460StR">Price of Tomorrow</a>, asks a simple question. He says "Imagine if I fold a piece of paper on itself fifty times. (I can only fold it seven times before it resists too much, but let’s assume for the moment that I can keep folding it up to fifty times.) How thick would the piece of paper be on fold fifty?"</p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I've never met anyone with a gut feel for exponential growth. You always have to calculate it. But everyone in the startup world at least knows never to turn their back on it.</p>— Paul Graham (@paulg) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1235250332936081408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 4, 2020</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Most people give an answer of a few inches, and on rare occasions Jeff says he hears "to the ceiling" unless someone has heard the question before. The correct answer is that on fold fifty the paper would reach all the way to the sun (93 million miles).</p><p>But getting more for less seems great, right? What's the problem?</p><p>Consumer spending accounts for 70% of the US economy, and therefore growing the economy is heavily dependent on increasing consumer spending. But a steadily increasing deflationary force pushes consumers to spend less. And to get consumers to spend more, central banks lower interest rates to make borrowing cheap. This is why global debt has doubled over the last ten years.</p><p>In past situations, lower interest rates led to increased consumer spending which led to inflation, steadily decreasing consumer debt burdens. This is why the Fed has an inflation target of 2%. The US economy is built on credit and assumes a steady low level of inflation to work properly. But with strong <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/fiscal-and-monetary-policy/">deflationary pressure</a>, inflation has proven elusive. </p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-4.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-4.png 829w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>What happens in an economy experiencing deflation? The cost of debt in real terms increases and there is downward pressure on wages. This means your mortgage or rent payment gets steadily more expensive in real terms at the same time that layoffs and unemployment increase because employees also get steadily more expensive (and don't respond well wages cut). The higher the debt level, the worse this situation is. And global debt levels have never been higher.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-6.png" alt=""></figure><p>Left unchecked, this results in large-scale social unrest, populism, or worse. This explains why interest rates have been steadily decreasing for years and why the Fed has signaled <a href="https://twitter.com/BloombergTV/status/1306332101680287744">they will keep interest rates at zero until at least 2023</a>. And because zero interest rates are no longer sufficient to encourage enough new borrowing and spending, it's why Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in March that there is <a href="https://twitter.com/todayshow/status/1243133507859292160?lang=en">no limit to the amount of money the Fed is willing to put into the economy to keep it afloat</a>. The Fed continues to massively expand the supply of US dollars.</p><figure><img src="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-5.png 600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-5.png 1000w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/image-5.png 1600w, https://andyjagoe.com/content/images/2020/09/image-5.png 2332w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Understanding the fight between the exponential force of technology driven deflation and the inflationary forces of low interest rates and massive expansion of the money supply is important to understanding what is likely to happen to the future for interest rates and the yield on savings vehicles. With every doubling in the exponential spread of technology, deflation is harder and harder for governments and central banks to counter-act. This is a massive problem, but we'll leave that for another day. For our purposes related to savings, what's clear is that zero yield is probably here to stay.</p><p>Is there nothing we can do to save savings? It seems unreasonable to receive no compensation for letting someone borrow your savings. And even worse to have to pay for the privilege.</p><p>Savings accounts seem rather boring, like a long forgotten banking backwater. But what if we were to reimagine the savings account for the software century? Could we redesign them from first principles for the age of abundance? Could we unbundle them from the bank, strip out their costs, give them full transparency, and generally make them 10x better?</p><p>Let's try.</p><h2 id="can-software-save-savings">Can software save savings?</h2><p>Before we start, let's make sure we understand the problem we're solving. What are savings accounts specifically for? And what jobs must a savings account do?</p><p>Savings accounts are designed to be used for expenses expected over the next year or so. These expenses might include emergency funds, property taxes, estimated income taxes, home maintenance expenses, home improvement expenses, car maintenance expenses, weddings, travel, and maybe clothing or gift expenses, among others. &nbsp;Savings accounts are not designed for monthly or bi-monthly expenses (that's what checking accounts are for) or for expenses expected to be more than 3-5 years away (that's what investment accounts are for).</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>With that in mind, let's break down the jobs to be done for a full service savings account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep your money safe
<ul>
<li>From theft</li>
<li>From being accidentally lost</li>
<li>From bank run or default (e.g. FDIC insurance)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow you to deposit money
<ul>
<li>Electronically (intra-bank, ACH, wire, check)</li>
<li>Cash (ATM, branch)</li>
<li>Foreign currency (branch)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow you to withdraw money
<ul>
<li>Electronically (intra-bank, ACH, wire)</li>
<li>Foreign currency (mail, branch)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provide overdraft protection for checking accounts</li>
<li>Provide a ledger of all your transactions as a reference</li>
<li>Provide separate logical account buckets to save for different expenses</li>
<li>Provide compensation for the use of your money</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>As you look at these jobs to be done, can you identify a customer-first focus in how banks have prioritized them or what they have optimized for other than enriching themselves? I can't. Banks might pat themselves on the back for adding mobile account access or mobile check deposit, but the truth is that savings products have scarcely changed in decades, have evolved by incrementalism, and have never had a bottoms-up re-assessment. It reminds me of the wireless industry before the iPhone.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>If we took a customer-first focus to re-imagining the savings vehicle, what jobs would we optimize for? Here's a list and how we might prioritize them.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reasonable yield.</strong> Savers want to be compensated for lending their money. They're upset when they learn that <a href="https://a16z.com/2019/11/22/the-case-for-forfeiting-margins/">financial institutions make money on their savings while they receive nothing</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Reasonable preservation of principal.</strong> Most savers need their money over the next year.</li>
<li><strong>Safety from theft, loss or default.</strong> Savers need to have confidence that their savings won't be stolen, lost or defaulted on by an insolvent institution.</li>
<li><strong>Electronic withdrawals.</strong> Let's assume customers have a checking account elsewhere so we can focus solely on ACH and internal transfers.</li>
<li><strong>Electronic deposits.</strong> …</li></ol></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>The French language</strong> offers two ways of speaking about freedom: <em>libre arbitre</em> means â€˜free will;â€™ <em>volontÃ©</em> means â€˜the willâ€™ or, better, â€˜volitionâ€™. Each carries with it distinct conceptual baggage. On the one hand, we exercise free will when making a choice. For volition, on the other hand, our freedom amounts to an exertion of effort. One is intellectual; the other laborious. Although you could get away with using either in everyday conversation, the choice of one term rather than the other is consequential. Indeed, the history of this semantic rift spills beyond the French language. It reveals a fissure at the core of what it means to author oneâ€™s own life story.</p>
<p>Two hundred years ago, disputes over the nature of freedom were all-consuming in France. Thatâ€™s not only because political upheavals rocked the 19th century. In the wake of the 1789 French Revolution, men and women experienced radical democracies, military dictatorships, resurgent monarchies and constitutional republics â€“ a living exercise in political science during which questions of <em>libertÃ©</em> (another term for â€˜freedomâ€™) preoccupied national debates.</p>
<p>A scientific revolution also ignited beyond the Palace of Versailles, setting the fates of free will and volition on a collision course. The rise of psychology and neurology threw into disarray the terms with which people made sense of their selfhood. By the beginning of the 20th century, the young sciences showed how freedom involves our entire bodies; indeed, it penetrates far deeper into our being than mere choice.</p>
<p>The philosopher and psychologist Maine de Biran (1766-1824) led the vanguard. During a long political career, from the court of Louis XVI to the lower house of parliament â€“ an institution created after the brothers of the executed king took over the throne in 1815 â€“ Biran used his influence to gather the foremost French scientists. They studied the mind as part of the body. At a time when the nervous systemâ€™s workings were only beginning to be understood, the gatherings were, for some, an occasion to dispel freedom as an illusion. Emblematic was the physiologist Pierre-Jean-George Cabanis (1757-1808) who claimed that â€˜The brain secretes thought like the liver secretes bile.â€™ Material enquiry, and not the abstract notion of free will, was to explain our agency.</p>
<p>Biran saw the fledgling brain sciences otherwise. In his work <em>The Influence of Habit on the Faculty of Thinking</em> (1802), Biran showed how our freedom hinges on volition, which canâ€™t be easily confined to the space between our ears. Materialist scientists tilted at windmills, so Biran charged. The idea of free will is a fiction because our freedom needs friction.</p>
<p>Biranâ€™s insight was that our nervous system is not a cause of volition but its constraint. In putting our body to use, we exert effort and encounter resistance. The play between the two â€“ their modulation over time â€“ gives rise to habits. According to Biran, habit follows a double law: â€˜the less we feel, the more we perceiveâ€™. Before I studied the French language, the silent consonants and serous liaisons struck my ears like an indistinguishable mÃ©lange. By focusing on individual words, contorting my tongue and taking risks to speak, I eventually came to inhabit the language. Thanks to my sustained volition, a cacophony of foreign sounds eventually gave way to meaningful speech. For Biran, the paradigmatic habit is self-education.</p>
<p>His book overthrew the longstanding view that habit is blind repetition. RenÃ© Descartes and Immanuel Kant had condemned habits as mechanical routines. They cloud clear judgment. For Biran, however, the discrete decisions of our free will matter less than the direction of our volition over time. And as habits take over, new resistance mounts. My patterns of thought and verbal crutches take the place of intentional speech. When I find myself lost in conversation at a cocktail party, <em>voilÃ&nbsp;</em> rolls off my tongue instinctively whenever I feel itâ€™s time to wrap up. Habits open an opportunity to renew our efforts and overcome the resistance that takes over within us.</p>
<p><strong>In the 19th century</strong>, psychology and politics revolved in the same orbit. Uprisings sought to replace old monarchical habits with new democratic ones. Biran, however, was no democrat. He applauded NapolÃ©onâ€™s brief return from exile in 1815. The French deserved an emperor who would strengthen peopleâ€™s volition, which had been weakened by the unruly sentiments of popular sovereignty. Biranâ€™s vision of selfhood was as consistent as his politics was lamentable, tethered as it was to an enduring aristocratic disposition.</p>
<p>Bergson adapted Biranâ€™s insight for a modern world ruled by numbers: choices touch only the shallows of our selfhood</p>
<p>In the eyes of European liberals, the new social orderâ€™s success hinged on a different form of freedom â€“ free will. Universal male suffrage and market economies, both established with yet another French revolution in 1848, introduced novel decision-making capacities. The prolific polymath Charles Renouvier (1815-1903) argued that citizensâ€™ <em>libre arbitre</em> usurped the reign of God and monarch. We occupy the role of judge (following the Latin, <em>arbitrium</em>) who renders a decision, as it were, in the court of the mind. To act with a free will, we â€˜place the government of our innermost spirit in the hands of a single ideaâ€™. Renouvier spent the decade of 1854-64 writing his <em>Essays of General Critique</em>, a project to translate the individual will into the driving force of national regeneration. Government would thereby find its legitimacy in the voluntary consent of citizens.</p>
<p>National regeneration was the chief <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/w/wsfh/0642292.0042.015/--brain-in-the-third-republic-science-pedagogy-and-national?rgn=main;view=fulltext" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">goal</a> of the Third Republic, which reinvigorated disputes between free will and volition. It was the longest democratic regime in the countryâ€™s history, lasting from 1870 to the Nazi occupation in 1940. Following its inception, investment in science was a national priority. Fidelity to the <em>patrie</em> was to be not only free but also rational.</p>
<p>When the first experimental psychology laboratories broke ground in the 1880s, their focus was psychometrics. Reaction time experiments allowed researchers to track the time of thinking, feeling and willing. They ranged between .1 and .3 seconds (the time from the reception of stimuli in the brain to the movement of a limb). The mathematical revolution in the study of mind also set in motion projects to scale intellectual aptitude â€“ Alfred Binet (1857-1911) released the first IQ measure in 1905 â€“ and to rationalise colonial conquests of â€˜uncivilisedâ€™ people in West Africa and Indochina. A trenchant materialism characterised the <em>fin de siÃ¨cle</em>, a period during which faith in numbers drove projects to hierarchise human freedom.</p>
<p>Critics returned to Biranâ€™s ideas. For Alfred FouillÃ©e (1838-1912), quantitative psychology demonstrated that thoughts constitute powerful motor actions â€“ what he called <em>idea-forces.</em> Their duration fluctuates with the obstacles we confront. In documenting the time taken to make decisions, experimental research didnâ€™t make freedom predictable so much as it laid to rest the idea of unencumbered free will. Such was the case in liberal politics as well: our choices (left or right, buy or sell) reflect the surface of our freedom. Deeper, FouillÃ©e believed, was a fleshly understanding of volition entangled with the bodyâ€™s sensory-motor coordination.</p>
<p>The philosopher Henri Bergson (1859-1941) went a step further. In an <em>oeuvre</em> that was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Literature, Bergson showed how we experience the world as a <em>lived duration</em>. As he saw it, psychometrics recorded the trace left by our volition, much like a marathonâ€™s final standings indicate when runners pass the finish line. Within the flow of time, however, our freedom fluctuates between exertions of energy and effortless passivity. When I reflect inward on the life I live, I notice discrete decisions: the choice of college majors, career paths and romantic partners. When I probe deeper, the volition shaping my self comes into view â€“ that is, the kind of person I continuously strive to become â€“ and with it the constraints that have lent traction to my creativity. Bergson adapted Biranâ€™s insight for a modern world ruled by numbers: choices touch only the shallows of our selfhood.</p>
<p>Today, choice-making is central to economic forecasting, political analysis and psychological testing. Market data and survey metrics aggregate our collective decisions. Although our world is distant from that of France a century ago, the countryâ€™s thinkers offer an enduring reminder that our aspirations for freedom do not amount to one thing. Do we seek more choices? Or do we strive to resist the sediments of time â€“ that is, to make our selfhood anew?</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>Reviewing papers is a central source of diversion, confusion, joy, and
other feelings for many academics. Much has already been written about
how to structure a review, how to phrase criticism kindly, etc. But in
this brief post I want to point out that the <em>mindset</em> behind a review
is absolutely crucial for writing a useful and constructive review. My
core philosophy can be summarised as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When reviewing a paper, you are primarily a <em>midwife</em> for the paper,
not a <em>gatekeeper</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me expand on this: it seems that many people consider their review
duties to be akin to that of the Night’s Watch. But this is altogether
the wrong approach for me. As reviewers, we are <em>not</em> the last line of
defence that protects our community from ‘improper’ research—may
it sound ever so romantic. I fully understand where this feeling comes
from: certainly, there <em>are</em> researchers that act in bad faith and try
to publish something they <em>know</em> is wrong. However, my issue with this
perspective is that it aligns itself along a low-prevalence event. The
common researcher does not have malicious intentions. If they <em>had</em> it
would be almost impossible to have any sort of scientific progress! So
rather than seeing ourselves as ‘protectors of the realm’, each one of
us should see themselves as the <em>midwife</em> of a paper: our <strong>ultimate</strong>
goal—not necessarily our <em>immediate</em> one—should be to help
the research get published eventually. Of course, the paper may not be
up to the standards of a certain conference. That’s fair. That happens
to all of us. But we should make sure that we are willing to cooperate
with the authors<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> to ensure that the research sees the light of day
at some point in time.</p>
<p>If we write reviews with <em>this</em> mindset, our statements will be imbued
with the proper spirit, making it possible to criticise constructively
in all situations.</p>
<p>To some extent, this mindset can also be used in other contexts. Code,
for example, should also be reviewed with a midwife mindset—even
though there may be more reasons to reject pull requests.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> However,
even in these contexts, try to be a supporter, instead of a preventer.</p>
<p>In short: <em>do not be a gatekeeper, be a midwife.</em></p>
<section role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>Of course, cooperation goes both ways, and we cannot protect ourselves against ‘bad faith’ authors. I would argue that these cases are rare. If they are <em>not</em> rare, it might be a sign of a dysfunctional community or system, but handling these cases is beyond the scope of this post. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>For example, <em>feature creep</em> is an issue of code bases that does not necessarily have an equivalent in the scientific community. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<!--
SYNOPSIS:		Background Information on Downloading and Installing Software from Sourcecode on Open-source Operating Systems
PREREQUISITES:		None
-->



<p>This document is intended for users of open-source operating systems who wish to install software direct from the original authors, rather than relying solely on the software (and versions) provided by their operating system. It is written for those who are not familiar with the concept of downloading software in source-code form, providing background information about relevant commands and the process in general.</p>



<ul>
  <li>Development and distribution: independent software developers, multi-os support, releases (archives), version-control</li>
  <li>Distributions: binary packages and package-managers</li>
  <li>Downloading: http, ftp, wget, checksums and signatures</li>
  <li>Archive files: tar, zip, gzip</li>
  <li>Common files: README and INSTALL; required dependencies</li>
  <li>Patching with sed/awk/patch</li>
  <li>Building and Installing: configure, make, cmake, perl and python</li>
  <li>Building and Installing Documentation</li>
  <li>Compiler settings and stripping; handing errors</li>
  <li>Post-installation</li>
</ul>



<p>A typical operating system consists of hundreds of different applications. In a proprietary operating system, the producer/seller of that operating system typically owns and manages the development of all that software. However open-source systems are usually created by obtaining and integrating applications invented and maintained by many independent groups - or even single independent developers. In addition, an open-source software project is often used in a variety of different operating systems - eg Linux-based, BSD-based, Hurd, and sometimes even integrated into proprietary operating systems such as Solaris, Mac, even Windows (if the licence allows).</p>

<p>The original software developers are sometimes referred to by distribution maintainers and end-users as the <em>upstream source</em> or simply <em>upstream</em>. Similarly, the developers often refer to the distributions that use their code, or the end-users as <em>downstream</em>.</p>

<p>Most open-source projects store their source code in a version-control system which is accessible over the internet (read-only for anonymous users). For such projects it is possible to download the very latest “in-progress” files, or to download the set of files “tagged” with some release-id (version number). However it is often not very efficient to do this; projects usually make regular <em>releases</em> by creating an <em>archive file</em> containing all the relevant files and make it available for download. For projects that do not have a public version-control system, such periodically released <em>archive files</em> are the only way to obtain the sourcecode directly.</p>



<p>There are many <em>operating system distributions</em> which do the work of finding, downloading and tweaking all the most-commonly used software packages. Several also compile it, and make the binary-form results available. There are many benefits, including quicker installation, one location to <em>find</em> relevant software, and particularly a supply of relevant <em>security patches</em>: the distribution maintainers watch for security updates and make it easy for end users to notice and install them.</p>

<p>However such distributions often don’t include the very latest version of software; if you need a newer version than the one provided by your distribution then it may be necessary to build it yourself.  Software is also often very customisable at install-time, particularly with the ability to omit features that are not needed. Because a distribution needs to keep a wide range of users happy, they tend to include <em>every</em> feature in the compiled applications they distribute; you as the end-user may be able to tune an application better by compiling it yourself.</p>

<p>Distributions generally include a <em>package manager</em> that keeps a database of which software is installed. It isn’t a good idea to go changing the software on a machine “behind the back” of the package manager; all sorts of odd behaviour could occur later. If your distribution has a package manager, then please read this document for background information - but then consult the documentation for your distribution to find out how to install software without confusing your package manager. Usually this involves writing a <em>package specification</em> that describes the software and then using the local package manager to compile and install the software. This applies to all distributions with package-managers, regardless of whether applications are distributed in binary (pre-compiled) or source-code form.</p>



<p>The usual way to download an archive file is by using a web-browser and clicking on a “download” button, clicking a link, or right-clicking a link and selecting “save as”. This downloads the file using the “http” protocol. Some sites instead make files available via the older “ftp” protocol. Many web-browsers support this too, ie clicking a link can also work here. Alternately, there are ftp client applications.</p>

<p>The “wget” or “curl” command-line application can also be used under unix-like operating systems to fetch a file via http or ftp when the correct URL is known.</p>

<p>Sites which publish software that is very frequently downloaded often have “mirror” sites set up, ie helpful people keep <em>copies</em> of the files in various places around the world. The original site usually has a list of the available <em>mirrors</em>, and you should choose one that is near to you. This helps reduce the cost of network bandwidth on the original publisher, and usually also lets you download faster.</p>

<p>Both the “http” and “ftp” network protocols can be intercepted by criminals or other undesirable parties who can then modify data as it downloads. Data can also potentially be corrupted by accident while underway (though this is not common). And when using a mirror-site, it is possible that someone has modified the files there (ie that the files on the mirror are not the same as those from the original publisher).  It is therefore a good idea to <em>verify</em> that what you downloaded is what the original publisher intended.</p>

<p>Many sites provide an <em>md5sum</em> file for each archive file, which holds a <em>checksum</em> of the contents of the file; sometimes a single <em>md5sums</em> file holds checksums for a number of other files. You should always obtain an md5sums file from the <em>original site</em>, never a mirror. And you should download it via the secure <em>https</em> protocol if possible. The unix <code>md5sum</code> commandline tool can then be used to compute the checksum of the big archive file, and compare it to the expected values to ensure the contents are as expected.</p>

<p>To compute the sum of a single file:</p>

<pre><code>   md5sum file-to-check
</code></pre>

<p>and “by hand” verify the output of this application against the expected value. If the value is in a webpage, you can open the “find” dialog on that page and copy-and-paste the value output by the md5sum program. The “find” will match only if the values are the same.</p>

<p>If the software provider provides an md5sums file which has a list of (filename, checksum) pairs, then you can run:</p>

<pre><code>   md5sum -c md5sums-file
</code></pre>

<p>which will look in your local system for every file listed in the md5sums-file, compute its checksum, and report an error if it is not the expected value.</p>

<p>Some software providers <em>sign</em> archive files instead of (or as well as) providing an md5 checksum. In this case you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>download the provider’s <em>public key</em> from their website (using https where possible)</li>
  <li>download the “signature file” for the archive-file; this will be a small file which has the same base name as the downloaded file, with suffix “.sig” or “.asc”</li>
  <li>perform the following steps</li>
</ul>

<pre><code># needed only once for each key, ie each "publisher"
gpg --import {public-key}

gpg --verify {signature-file-name}
</code></pre>

<p>The verify step decrypts the signature-file, revealing a checksum; it then runs a checksum algorithm over the real file and checks that they are the same. Obviously, the “gpg” application needs to be installed locally.</p>



<p>An <em>archive</em> is a single file that contains within it a number of other files. There are several different tools for creating such files but in all cases the process is effectively to append all the individual files together, and then add an “index” which contains the offset, length, name and other properties of the original files so that they can be extracted again.</p>

<p>Note: the word “archive” in English can imply something “old”, no longer used, or a “backup” copy. While archive files can be used to store backups or rarely used data, they are also convenient for passing data around a network.</p>

<p>The  “tar” application packs multiple files into a single “tar-format” archive file, which is the most commonly-used format in open-source. Tar originally meant “tape archive”, but the format works well on disks too. Tar archives remember not only the original names of files, but also their original Unix “owner id” and file-permissions. The ownerid is seldom useful (unless the tar archive was created on the same machine it is being unpacked on), but the file-permissions are. By convention, tar-format files are usually given names ending in “.tar”. Tar-format files containing sourcecode are sometimes referred to as “tarballs”.</p>

<p>The tar application doesn’t compress the file contents. However source-code files do compress very well and network bandwidth is always too slow and too expensive, so tar files are usually <em>compressed</em> after creation, using a generic compression application. The most commonly used compression type is “gzip”, and the resulting file is usually given the suffix “.tar.gz” or “.tgz”. Compression with bzip2 is also common, and such files are usually given the suffix “.tar.bz2”. Occasionally “xz” compression will be used; files are usually given the suffix “.tar.xz”.</p>

<p>The original version of the tar application was created a long time ago, and it has been reimplemented a number of times. Sadly this means that the commandline options available vary considerably depending on which version of the application you are using. The functionality also varies depending on version; in particular some versions can auto-detect when compression has been used, and decompress automatically …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="blog-page"><div><div><div><article><div><div><h2>Vets Who Code: What, Where, And How to Help</h2></div><p>When I started this journey&nbsp;<span>SIX</span>&nbsp;years ago, I just wanted to create an affordable solution for veterans to transition into the workforce as fast as they can without the hurdles of civilian life of trying to find a code school that accepts the GI Bill. I didn’t want my fellow troops in transition to fall through the cracks, like I did.</p><p>That’s why I went into the nonprofit sector in the first place. I wanted to help my brothers and sisters. What I found was a system designed, not to help them, but, to get as much money out of donors, sponsors and government agencies as possible by telling the story of how the nation fails our servicemen and women; all the while creating extremely high requirements, yet, having extremely low benchmarks for success. Did you know that unless you are actually sleeping on the streets in some states you aren’t considered homeless? Meaning, if you are living out of your car, living out of a hotel room, or couch-surfing, you don’t qualify for certain support services.</p><p>I should know — I’ve had the great displeasure of doing all three. Despite the adversity, perseverance enabled me to climb out of the darkness, with a deep desire to keep other veterans from falling into the abyss. Thinking back, that was the hardest six months of my life! It was development and design that helped me get through those tough times, not the current nonprofit sector filled with relics that have cozy relationships all the while doing the minimum.</p><p>I spent every waking moment learning skills that other people were either too stubborn or just too fearful to learn, and it added value to me — value the civilian sector could understand. Then, when a fallen soldier’s family needed help, my newly minted value empowered me to answer the call to bury a brother. Afterwards, I was like “what do I do next?” — leading to the stupid idea of turning something old (a freaking castle!) into something new, repurposing it to retrain veterans in real and digital skillsets. Unfortunately that didn’t work. But, out of it came true inspiration, something revamped, brilliant, and functional — something I hope would even make David Heinemeier Hansson (my hero) proud.</p><p><span>What is Vets Who Code?</span></p><p>Vets Who Code is a veteran founded, lead and operated 501(c)(3) distributed charitable non-profit, dedicated to filling the wide chasm between technical expertise needed and available with transitioning veterans and active duty military spouses through software development training and education. We utilize our distributed model for the capability to train veterans anywhere, but we are so much more. We are a team of people with hybrid tech skills and a lean mentality, focused on helping veterans not only learn how to program, but get jobs in the field and to do it without the unnecessary bloat that other nonprofits take on. From UX and DevOPs engineers to little old me, who got thrown into this because I simply wanted to help my fellow veterans, which is the most important part of this nonprofit. Currently 80% of the team is veterans, and we provide what you need to surpass our successes and learn from our mistakes. ’Cause if we are to celebrate this thing called life, we need to be there together.</p><p><span>Why Code?</span></p><p>Great question. Right now our country has a problem: we have programming jobs, but not enough programmers. Not only that, we don’t have enough GOOD programmers. On top of that, while it’s definitely better, veterans are still the highest unemployed demographic in America. So we had this crazy idea. What if we created a vetted curriculum designed around modern technologies? Not just any veterans, those who this skill could really impact. Not only that, let’s work tirelessly to mentor them in professional standards of code, business, and design. Can you imagine how much better you get at design thinking when the guy speaking has been thinking about it every day for the last 15 years? We then thought, what if we added tools to continue learning after you’ve dealt with us for 15 weeks? Our partners like Frontend Masters and Google Cloud give us amazing tools to gift the veterans so that they can learn and prep for up to a year. Not only that — we make introductions, and train them in the interview process to help them get jobs in the industry. You know what? It works. Our troops have been getting highly paid positions, and we couldn’t be happier. Here we empower amazing people to have the lifestyle they have earned, and we do it all online; a feat that wasn’t even possible 10 years ago.</p><p><span>How Can You Help?</span></p><p>That’s actually a question we get quite often. Our veterans spend 15 weeks with our team focusing on the language JavaScript and and all it encompasses, and understanding software architecture and computer science fundamentals. We focus on having workflows, interview questions, computer science, and UX research.</p><p>The most important thing you can do to support our mission is&nbsp;<a href="https://donorbox.org/vetswhocode-donation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>donate</span></a>. As a 501(c)(3) we are tax-deductible, and as a distributed non-profit, we don't have any wasteful operating cost. All proceeds go directly to resources and cool things for the troops.</p><p>If you’re a software engineer with at least two years experience working with ES6 and Javascript, sign up as a mentor. If you are a designer who can code, we are always looking for someone to help us with our user experience. If you are in HR, drop us a line in our contact form, so that we can get our troops into your pipeline for javascript jobs.</p></div></article></div></div></div></section></div>]]>

Run <code>clippy</code> regularly. It’s distributed with the compiler via <code>rustup</code> now, so you have no excuse not to.</p>
<h2 id="build-cache-sccache">Build cache – <code>sccache</code></h2>
<p>Or, “how to make a full rebuild 70% faster”. <code>sccache</code> is a build artifact cache similar to <code>icecream</code> or <code>ccache</code>, except it’s actually trivial to just use. <code>cargo install sccache</code>, add a single line in a home dir config file, and you’re ready to go. Pretty much handles most crate and compiler versioning issues for you, so it Just Works if you update crates or install a new version of <code>rustc</code> or something. I think I’ve had to force-clear the cache due to some build weirdness a grand total of once. Looks like it has enough features to use in a professional context as well, at least on a small-to-medium scale.</p>
<h2 id="dependency-viewer-cargo-tree">Dependency viewer – <code>cargo-tree</code></h2>
<p>The best way to view what dependencies you are using, and what dependencies they are using, and so on. Best way to start cracking down on flabby dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-criterion">Benchmarking – <code>criterion</code></h2>
<p>Basically the best benchmark system out there. Incredibly simple to use, informative, and statistically sound. Doesn’t really do profiling, but it’s a good start for understanding your program’s performance, and better for proving that your implementation of X is faster than someone else’s.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<p>Stuff that is less general purpose but occasionally very useful for the meta-programming process of choosing libraries, evaluating them, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo-geiger</code> – Measures how much unsafe code is in a codebase, and its dependencies</li>
<li><code>cargo-crev</code> – A <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/ActuallyUsingCrev">very neat tool</a> for authoring and verifying distributed code reviews.</li>
<li>Various tools maintained by <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem">Embark Studios</a>, useful for production/company purposes like checking licenses, pinning specific versions of crates, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cool stuff Real Computer Scientists write about.</p>
<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>
<p>No specific crates here. There’s no single crate that provides All The Hash Algorithms, just lots of little ones that generally provide a single algorithm each. Just type the name of the algorithm you want into <code>crates.io</code> and you’ll get at least a couple options, choose the one with 8 million downloads or whatever. <code>sha2</code>, <code>md5</code>, <code>crc</code>, etc. Lots of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
<p>Same as the hashing category. Type <code>zip</code> or <code>bzip2</code> or whatever into crates.io and you’ll get what you need. <code>flate2</code> might be the one crate that’s not quite trivial to find. Again, many of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
<p>I have little actual experience or authority on this topic, so I’m going to punt on this one.</p>
<h2 id="pseudorandom-number-generator">Pseudorandom number generator</h2>
<p>Use <code>oorandom</code>. (Disclaimer, I wrote <code>oorandom</code>, but people besides me seem to like it.) More usually you’ll see the <code>rand</code> crate in use. If you’re doing Real Science and need to generate <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.random.html">fancy probabilities</a>, then <code>rand</code> is the right tool, but most people aren’t doing that. Otherwise <code>rand</code> is complicated and has lots of features, while <code>oorandom</code> is very simple and has about two features, and I expect 80% of code to use at least one of them. <code>rand</code> has had several major breaking changes in its history that the rest of the ecosystem still hasn’t caught up with, while I intend <code>oorandom</code>’s API to change maybe twice in my lifetime. (Its version number, while obeying semver, is mostly a joke.)</p>
<p>There’s other lightweight PRNG crates that are just fine; see <code>oorandom</code>’s readme for a list of some others and choose one you like. Whatever you choose, use the <code>getrandom</code> crate to produce Real Random Seeds for it.</p>

<p>“I just need to solve this ooooooone common problem, but it needs to be solved WELL…”</p>
<h2 id="logging-log">Logging – <code>log</code></h2>
<p>Need to output log messages in your code? Why, use the <code>log</code> crate. Where do the log messages go? <code>log</code> provides only an interface, and that interface compiles to nothing if it isn’t used. You can write your own system for it to actually output the logs to, which is pretty easy, or use one of the small plethora of crates for it. My preferred one is <code>pretty_env_logger</code>, but <code>fern</code>, <code>slog</code> and others are all good too.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-data-crunching-rayon">Parallel data crunching – <code>rayon</code></h2>
<p>Ever have some computation where you have a big list of STUFF and want to process it in parallel, farming out jobs to as many threads as you have CPU’s? That’s what <code>rayon</code> does, and it does it really, really well. You still <a href="https://aspenuwu.me/posts/rust-optimization.html">have to know what you’re doing</a>, but changing a single <code>.iter()</code> into <code>.par_iter()</code> and watching your CPU-bound data-crunching run 8x faster is pretty magical. Now your CPU can help keep you warm this winter!</p>
<p>Please never use it in a library. It’s rude to spawn threads in library code, unless that’s specifically what the library is for.</p>
<h2 id="regexes-regex">Regexes – <code>regex</code></h2>
<p>To quote the inestimable <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/">jwz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://xkcd.com/208/">somebody’s gotta save the day</a>. So, use the <code>regex</code> crate. Also use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep">anything else</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/xsv">written by BurntSushi</a>. BurntSushi is a paragon of Rust program design, and also just a great <del>human being</del> charred cuisine in general.</p>
<h2 id="threadsafe-globals-lazy_static">Threadsafe globals – <code>lazy_static</code></h2>
<p>“I know globals are evil,” you say, “but I just need one. I’ll only use it for good, I promise.” <code>lazy_static</code> has your back.</p>
<p>May eventually be superseded by <code>once_cell</code>, which looks like its <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2788">headed for inclusion into <code>std</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="serializationdeserialization-serde">Serialization/deserialization – <code>serde</code></h2>
<p>Ever have a struct and just wanted to turn it into JSON, CBOR, XML, or some other engine of woe and devastation designed to be written to an I/O stream? Or had a blob of random JSON and wanted to just stuff it into a struct matching it? Sure you have. <code>serde</code> lets you do this with a single <code>#[derive]</code>. <code>serde</code> is without a doubt one of Rust’s killer libraries. It is better than any other serialization system I have ever used.</p>
<p>What data formats does it support? Anything; the actual reading and writing is done via plugin library. There’s a <a href="https://serde.rs/#data-formats">wide selection of them</a>, of varying quality, and writing your own is a little tedious but not terribly difficult.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>
<p>This spot deliberately left blank.</p>
<p>Rust’s <code>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</code> type is one of the best setups for lightweight, transparent error handling I’ve seen, but it doesn’t do everything. How do you easily write your own error type without a bunch of boilerplate? What if you have multiple different error types from different libraries you want to coalesce together? How do you collect a backtrace of every function an <code>Err</code> is returned through, so you can find the root cause of where it came from? Can we do all this without allocating anything unnecessarily? And so on.</p>
<p>There have been various crates to try to solve these problems. First in 2015 there was <code>error_chain</code>, which was complicated and not very convenient. Then in 2017 there was <code>failure</code>, which was simpler but not very flexible, and which took an irritatingly long time to compile. Then in 2019 there was <code>anyhow</code>, which was about the time I stopped paying attention. Now apparently the new kid on the block is <code>eyre</code>, and I’m sure that in another year or two there will be something else.</p>
<p>So, I just write the boilerplate and make my errors descriptive enough I don’t need a backtrace. When I want to get fancy I implement the built-in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html"><code>Error</code></a> trait, which used to be kinda useless but is now more helpful. And in another five years it’ll still work just fine.</p>
<h2 id="byte-mucking-bytemuck">Byte mucking – <code>bytemuck</code></h2>
<p>For the rare occasions you need to turn a structure into arbitrary <code>&amp;[u8]</code> or back. Doing this using unsafe pointers is quite easy, and also makes it very easy to screw up horribly with Undefined Behavior galore. (Did you know that changing the value of padding bytes in a struct in UB? You do now.) <code>bytemuck</code> lets you muck around with bytes a little more responsibly.</p>
<h2 id="human-dates-and-times-chrono">Human dates and times – <code>chrono</code></h2>
<p>Rust’s <code>std::time</code> doesn’t really handle calendar or wall-clock times, just arbitrary, monotonic <code>Instant</code>’s and measurable <code>Duration</code>’s between them. Nice, pure, computationally-robust time measurement. For all the nasty human calendar and timezone stuff, you use <code>chrono</code>. (And maybe <code>humantime</code>, but I personally reach for <code>chrono</code> first, just out of habit.)</p>
<h2 id="bit-flags-bitflags">Bit flags – <code>bitflags</code></h2>
<p>Defining type-safe bit-masks in a reasonably convenient way. Not always worth the trouble, but sometimes pretty convenient.</p>

<p>“I have to create or read a…”</p>
<h2 id="pngjpeggifetc-image">PNG/JPEG/GIF/etc – <code>image</code></h2>
<p>General-purpose loading and saving and images, which can handle a lot of formats. Can do some amount of image manipulation as well, such as cropping, smoothing, etc. but that will hopefully be pulled out into its own library at some point soon.</p>
<h2 id="small-data-things-uuid-base64-csv-semver">Small data THINGS – <code>uuid</code>, <code>base64</code>, <code>csv</code>, <code>semver</code>…</h2>
<p>Exactly what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>Not aware of any great encoders, but there’s plenty of <em>decoders</em> for common audio formats. <code>lewton</code> for Ogg Vorbis, <code>hound</code> for .wav, <code>minimp3</code> for MP3, <code>claxon</code> for FLAC. Video, I haven’t used enough to have an opinion on.</p>
<h2 id="config-files-toml">Config files – <code>toml</code></h2>
<p>For all your config file format needs. Works with <code>serde</code>, naturally.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-pulldown-cmark">Markdown – <code>pulldown-cmark</code></h2>
<p>There’s several good Markdown readers and writers, <code>pulldown-cmark</code> is my favorite. It supports CommonMark, it’s simple to use, and it’s pure Rust.</p>
<h2 id="templating-askama">Templating – <code>askama</code></h2>
<p>There’s several quite good text templating engines, but <code>askama</code> IMO rises above them all by compiling your templates into Rust code and type-checking your templates at compile time. Sometimes this isn’t what you want, but it is a great feature surprisingly often. This also makes it super fast, for when you really need to …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><span>I</span>n the mid-2020â€™s, NASA will launch a helicopter-like lander the size of a small car toward Titan, Saturnâ€™s largest moon. Nearly a decade later, after crossing about a billion miles of empty darkness, this spacecraft, dubbed Dragonfly, will gently settle onto Titanâ€™s sand dunes.&nbsp;There&nbsp;the sun will merely appear as a very bright star in the heavens and the Earth will barely be visible, like a floating mote of dust. The frigid temperatures will be colder than anywhere on Earth. But scientists believe this enigmatic world might harbor alien life.<br></p>

<p>Of all the planets, moons and asteroids in our solar system, Titan is a rarity. Along with Enceladus, another of Saturnâ€™s moons, and Europa, which orbits Jupiter, it is an ocean world, possessing flowing water and other liquids, organic materials, and an energy source that could provide just the right conditions for microbes to arise. Mars might be synonymous with pop-culture conceptions of aliens, but the Red Planet likely lacks those features and has been bone-dry and mostly atmosphere-less for some three billion years. These ocean worlds could be inhabited right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The discovery of any kind of alien microbes on any of these worlds would be transformative, changing our prevailing views of life, its origins, and ultimately, ourselves. But if searches for life continue to turn up nothing, it may turn out that Earthlings have to explore much, much further to find fellow organisms in our galaxy.</p>
<p>â€œThese three moons in particular can help us test the hypothesis of whether life can naturally evolve in a place if you have all the ingredients it needs to survive,â€� says Morgan Cable, an astrochemist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and part of a cadre of astronomers who want to send robotic explorers to these moons. â€œOr is life super unique and weâ€™re horribly alone?â€�</p>
<p>Along with Dragonfly, NASA is also building the Europa Clipper, a lander slated to sail toward Jupiter's moon in the near future. And though a return to Enceladus is not high on the agencyâ€™s priorities, a collaboration with the Breakthrough Starshot Foundation could eventually get a mission off the ground. Titan will come first, though, making it the first ocean world—other than Earth, of course—to be explored.</p>
<blockquote>Titan will be the first ocean world<strong>—</strong>other than Earth<strong>—</strong>to be explored.</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes visible to the naked eye with its faint yellowish hue, Saturn has fascinated Persian, Hindu, Chinese, Greek and other stargazers for millennia. But it was Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens who discovered Titan orbiting the sixth planet in 1655 using a telescope he built himself. Soon afterward, he discerned Saturnâ€™s rings and also spotted a clutch of its smaller moons, of which there are now known to be more than fifty. Huygens referred to the largest moon as Luna Saturni, and English astronomer John Herschel later gave it and other known moons names from Greek mythology. Those monikers stuck.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, data collected by the first Voyager probe during its brief, 37,000 mile-per-hour flyby revealed how surprisingly thick and opaque Titanâ€™s atmosphere is. Later came NASAâ€™s Cassini spacecraft, laden with sensitive instrumentation, which surveyed the ocean worlds and other moons until spectacularly ending its mission in 2017 by diving into Saturnâ€™s gaseous body. Before Cassini burned up, the data it sent back to Earth finally penetrated Titanâ€™s haze to map out its undulating plains, dunes, lakes, and craters.</p>
<p>Larger than our moon and even Mercury, which is roughly two-fifths the size of Earth, Titan hosts plenty of intriguingly unique environments. Nascent lifeforms might benefit from its bubbling ice volcanoes, with the heat and pressure from below thrusting up liquified, briny ice like flowing, molten rock on Earth. And Titan is occasionally bombarded by asteroids whose impacts could melt the ice frozen on its surface. But after a time the water they produce—and anything possibly living there—would inevitably freeze again.</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_32ad92099390210393fe7b2b51e82e8a.jpg" alt="Titan surface - artist rendering"><figcaption><span>Artistâ€™s visualization of hydrocarbon pools on Titan's rocky surface. </span><br><span>Steven Hobbs</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Titanâ€™s dense, calm, orange-tinted atmosphere stands out, too, as an uncommon feature of worlds in our solar system. â€œThe reason weâ€™re interested in life on Titan is because of its atmosphere,â€� says Catherine Neish, a planetary scientist at the University of Western Ontario. Nitrogen and other molecules undergo reactions with ultraviolet light from the sun and cosmic rays, which turns them into more complex molecules. â€œAt the end of the day,â€� says Neish, â€œyou have these hugely complicated organic molecules that slowly trickle down to the surface, meaning that the Titan surface is covered in them.â€�<br></p>
<p>The chemical conditions on the surface could pose an obstacle to possible fledgling microbes—provided theyâ€™re like anything scientists know on Earth. But scientists have also speculated about life as we <em>donâ€™t</em> know it. Clouds of methane and ethane drift over Titan; they rain onto its surface, forming rivers and streams that ooze into polar seas comparable in size to the Great Lakes on Earth. Itâ€™s the only world in the solar system other than Earth known to have vast quantities of liquid on its surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liquids are a superb medium for bringing molecules together, forming new ones, and sweeping away waste. Eventually, somewhere, molecules can become more complex and make new copies of themselves, crossing the blurry boundary that some scientists and philosophers would call â€œlife.â€� The methane lakes of Titan would offer very different building blocks than do Earthâ€™s pools; microbes would have to eat acetylene and breathe hydrogen rather than oxygen, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These alien life forms would also need to cope with temperatures down to âˆ’180 degrees Celsius—roughly twice as cold as the coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth—and with methane being a poor medium for carbon-based organic molecules to dissolve in. That would limit the chemical possibilities, making it harder to break most chemical bonds, and crucially, it would result in slower chemical reactions. If microbes defied the odds and arose on the surface, then, their life cycle and ecological interactions would move very slowly compared to the processes thought to be involved in the beginnings of life on Earth.</p>
<p>Scientists are keeping an open mind about lifeâ€™s myriad forms, including a chemistry alien to us, so they equip their probes with a variety of instruments and make their explorations as thorough as possible. But it's hard to look for something you've never seen before. â€œIt may be that life in a lake like that is very, very different and potentially unrecognizable compared to life as we know,â€� says Cable. â€œWe donâ€™t want to miss it by accident because weâ€™re biased by Earth life.â€�</p>
<figure><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nautilus-vertical/oceans_13df004fcabca482b041f97e46687a81.jpg" alt="High-Temperature-Beebe-Vents-Black-Smokers"><figcaption><span>A hydrothermal vent in the Cayman Trough, three miles below sea level, may be similar to vents on Enceladus. </span><br><span>Chris German/WHOI/NSF</span></figcaption></figure>

<p><span>M</span>ethane lakes are not the only potential cradle for Titanian life. Titan, as well as Europa and Enceladus, have relatively warm oceans underground. Titanâ€™s salty waters are hidden beneath an icy crust 100 kilometers thick, blocking already-feeble light from the distant sun, so photosynthesis would be impossible. But it is possible that on some of the ocean worlds, alien microbes could instead glean energy from hydrothermal—hot water—vents found near volcanoes rising from the bottom of these vast oceans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Earth, the movement of tectonic plates cracks the planetâ€™s rocky crust and creates such fissures. On the ocean worlds, the necessary force is provided by the constant gravitational pull of close orbits around the colossi of Saturn and Jupiter. Water percolating into cracking rock can then release energy.</p>
<p>â€œThe great thing about hydrothermal vents is that they provide a lot of energy sources for microbial life that doesnâ€™t include sunlight,â€� says Julie Huber, a marine chemist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Organisms living at hydrothermal vents on Earthâ€™s seafloors, she explains, â€œcan use chemical energy, so that means things like sulphur, iron, hydrogen and methane and they create a base of the food chain.â€�</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, oceanographers towing cameras on miles-long cables through the GalÃ¡pagos Rift in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, near the islands of the same name, collected the first clear evidence of hydrothermal vents. Theyâ€™ve subsequently been found scattered in seafloor volcanic areas near the edges of tectonic plates throughout the worldâ€™s ocean, spewing superheated, mineral-rich fluids that generate chemical reactions as they burble into the cold seawater.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might seem challenging for anything to subsist in these harsh, bleak places. In fact, such environments typically offer wide ranges of temperature, pressure, acidity and energy, meaning that a diversity of microbial life is actually possible. Itâ€™s been theorized that life on Earth actually originated around hydrothermal vents rather than in primordial soup at the planet's surface, and some hardy organisms thrive there: mainly specially adapted bacteria and single-celled creatures known as archaea. Even in the ostensibly deadest spot on Earth, the nutrient-starved South Pacific Gyre east of Australia, scientists recently found microbes that apparently survived for millions of years in a form of stasis while embedded in the seafloor.</p>
<p>Vent fields off Costa Rica and in the Caribbeanâ€™s deep Cayman Trough are thought to be similar an undersea spot on Enceladus, and the connection between hydrothermal vents on Earth and potentially similar spots on ocean worlds has spurred collaborations between astrobiologists and oceanographers like Huber. The nascent deep-sea mining industry is interested, too, though for different reasons: the mineral-rich sulfide deposits include some valuable metals in dwindling supply on land, like manganese, copper, nickel and …</p></article></div>

                    <p><em>The last piece of hair fell on the floor.</em></p><p><em>My head was shining like a moon.</em></p><p><em>“Tomorrow, I’ll be in China.”</em></p><hr><p><strong><strong>In the first week of June, I was stuck.</strong></strong></p><p>We desperately needed to come up with a startup idea. Our company was in free fall, and I had to do something about it.</p><p>But I couldn’t.</p><p>I spent weeks trying to figure it all out in my head. Every day, we would sit for hours in the office. Trying to understand what we really want to work on. Brainstorming ideas. Nothing worked.</p><p>I had the idea to take some time off for a while. But I never really explored it. I’ve always believed the only way to solve a problem is to start working on it. A mere thought of lying on a beach all day long and doing nothing caused physical pain in my head.</p><p>After a few weeks of struggle, I accepted that we’re not moving anywhere.</p><p><strong><strong>I needed a change.</strong></strong></p><p>I used to do martial arts as a kid. I remember when I first read about Shaolin. I was amazed. It seemed like something sacred, unreal to me. Very distant, but also very close in some way.</p><p>I remember begging parents to allow me to go there and train with monks.</p><p><em>“You’re out of your damn mind!”</em></p><p>I’m not blaming them; I’d probably tell my kids the same.</p><p>But now I had no excuse.</p><p>I decided to fly to China and study Kung Fu at The Shaolin Temple.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q3pS6-bIyhrxVRndWfaux_yN_-PJBPebn2jwQJHImjIMygREWwyR3Wc8w0kILJgijhjt0r-d4BIdoeT3qsZO7VEfvQpbh5pVHakdASf1Q03R6s4clJWAUA0EjgxqNDkCdRKFH1ek" alt=""></figure><p>The Shaolin Monastery is like Mecca for Buddhists.</p><p>It’s a mysterious place where monks live, train, and meditate.</p><p><em>Some of them never leave the temple.</em></p><p>And while you can visit the temple as a tourist, there’s no way for a stranger to get into the private part of the monastery, where real monks train. There’s no website where you can apply. No email address.</p><p>But I had a plan.</p><p>I decided to find a martial arts school in Dengfeng, which is a small town 12 km from the temple. My idea was to get to Dengfeng, and then try to meet some younger monks from the temple and beg them to death to let me in.</p><p>After a few days of research, I found a school that seemed reasonable and applied.</p><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YDuca6U-Xj9WUbeyshjgYpN2oWYZXvEXofbvILQW7t-j-FljoSA9TjA_S3LTvOHsMWiiltMTuraj13qtDORfzWvbY_nxeqM6fI6xt_5bRC4wVUUuIYjFu-gBo6lLeZZFXbXzfbRz" alt=""><figcaption>Shifu and students. And his kid.</figcaption></figure><p><em>“Unfortunately, we’ll not be able to enroll you. We’re shutting down.”</em></p><p>That’s what I heard from the school 24 hours before the flight.</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>Finding this school was tough. There are hundreds of fake “Shaolin Kung Fu” schools in Dengfeng. They’re making money off the Shaolin brand, but there’s no real, authentic, hard training involved.</p><p>Getting another good one to accept me over night seemed impossible. But I kept looking.</p><p>I was looking for something original and challenging. And all Kung Fu schools I’d seen before were like holiday camps.</p><p>A few hours later, serendipity kicked into play.</p><p>I found a YouTube video from a former Xing Long student. I loved it. I went on their website and smiled.</p><p>The website said:</p><p><strong><strong>“Our school is not a holiday retreat.”</strong></strong></p><p>On a warm night of June 14th, I landed in Beijing.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ku0IQGnR2GgIWEcrPMlgo-wFYzrsanZT3agAhjOq95QJNZmS9Axi2I1MxXmN6KBHi_bmHD50q7RsO96dWnjovN83jDGHhEIxKdsCf1X3sgntgTe16-EmsHXw3DmGMWNzPWdNWwrn" alt=""><figcaption>4:30 a.m. Meeting the dawn at a Beijing Railway Station.</figcaption></figure><p>When I arrived in Beijing, I still hadn’t heard from Xing Long.</p><p>But I had no choice. I was in China, and coming back was not an option. So I bought a train ticket and embarked on 600 km journey to northern China.</p><p>After six hours of slumber in the high-speed train, I was in Siping.</p><p>At the exit of the train station, three students of Xing Long waited for me with a welcoming sign, “Vasili Shynkarenka.” They drove me to school.</p><p>That’s when I met the Master for the first time.</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TDkN2V3FfpErJtZ5GeLWTX__0T2KMX_dKy1xq40UENQN6OiQUEgQ3JW4jE-mfU5ECQwI4TDTflt5wuf2lz6IlbswXzhZ2bdmKpH09BsWQYqPA8nGsR9vPe6v70TcWczFbhI4DO-M" alt=""></figure><p>Shifu is 5”2, fast as a jaguar, has a bone-crushing handshake and dark brown eyes that look right into your soul.</p><p>He once tore off someone’s shoulder with bare hands.</p><p>At 12, he already trained in Shaolin.</p><p>Shifu turned pro after seven years. He started competing professionally, won the famous “Kungfu King” tournament, and achieved the rank of a 7th-degree master at 19.</p><p>And then he broke his back. It was a full-contact sparring match, and he cracked his fourth vertebrae.</p><p>Doctors said he wouldn’t be able to walk ever again. Shifu made a full recovery in six months.</p><p>He couldn’t return to professional fighting, but life without Kung Fu was not an option to him.</p><p>He began teaching.</p><p>His vision was simple:</p><p><strong><strong>“To spread classic Shaolin skills throughout the world.”</strong></strong></p><p>To achieve that goal, Shifu had to learn English. He worked hard for 18 years, and he speaks almost fluently now.</p><figure><img src="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/2020/09/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image.png 600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image.png 1000w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/image.png 1600w, https://vasilishynkarenka.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/09/image.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Me and Shifu Wang.</figcaption></figure><p>Shifu believes that Shaolin Kung Fu is not just a martial art from Jackie Chan movies.</p><p>In its origin, Kung Fu refers to any discipline achieved through hard work. Anything that requires patience, energy, and time to complete. And once you learn it in martial arts, you can transfer this knowledge to other domains.</p><p>He is also a great thinker. I saw him reading Meditations from Marcus Aurelius once. That’s the kind of teacher I needed.</p><p>The Shaolin Temple has become fancy.</p><p>More tourists. More noise.<em> Less signal.</em></p><p>Three years after opening his first school near the temple, Shifu moved to the northern province of Jilin.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/58E2EatlNlHjmGt-l9A8bY4nSm_Q7xixee-35sXFc3LmT6oeERgxi9cerT_jz152153YHAHvHryr1r6j2JVma4dZ-ZiMqHFTrPpqk-AInBJONHGqlm_xQQR2U41raPCAjhp1mDMf" alt=""><figcaption>Hills near the school in winter.</figcaption></figure><p>Xing Long school is located on a small farm in the countryside.</p><p>There's one large training hall, full of equipment and dried sweat.</p><p>Second training hall in the back.

Having a small group helps Shifu to dedicate enough time to each student, but also make sure there’s a lot of practice for everyone.</p><p>People all over the globe came to China to study Kung Fu. Explorers; seeking for something deeper than living in the Matrix.</p><p>Some of them, like Matt, had been at the school for six years already.</p><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_MkifjL76syDHa6wuUXWJXHu2EkaEh9vXg6a-aAPWoZvveQmQemDcwyjDH6cnBEZWXcMsN1LcyGL-u3tML98ZCwW4H145ubkG7JQaPeMYuuIgiu0r2s_MOrePSaBbHYo9FvWzVp1" alt=""></figure><p>I was surprised by how diverse, open, and curious students were.</p><p>We had a scientist who worked on quantum computing, a famous reporter from Hollywood, and a primary school teacher.</p><p>We spent hours at the dinner table talking about everything from farming to teaching to space.</p><p><strong><strong>It felt like a brotherhood.</strong></strong></p><h2 id="training">Training</h2><p><em>It was the final lap of 45 degrees uphill mountain running.</em></p><p><em>My legs were destroyed. I barely strolled. The sole purpose of my existence came down to two words:</em></p><p><strong><strong><em>“Don’t. Stop.”</em></strong></strong></p><p><em>I questioned myself a thousand times.</em></p><p><em>“Why are you doing this to yourself? What’s the purpose? Why don’t you just walk the rest of the run?”</em></p><p><em>And then it hit me:</em></p><p><em>“Because that’s who I am.”</em></p><p><em>I kept running.</em></p><hr><p><strong><strong>Every day we had six to eight hours of Shaolin training.</strong></strong></p><p>We woke up at 5:30. At 5:50, we lined up.</p><p><em>“Go, running!”</em></p><p>We ran for about three miles uphill and then stretched for twenty minutes.</p><p>After the warmup was done, we had Tai Chi.</p><p>Tai Chi is like action movies in slow motion.

        <p><em><strong>These tests and experiments were performed by Ian Jackson VK3BUF in the QRM Guru test lab.</strong></em></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div>
<p>Much has been said about the importance of applying ferrite clamps, rings and beads to radios and other domestic products to fight QRM.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Articles on the correct placement of ferrite noise suppressors are common, but little has been written about the different options and where to buy them. &nbsp;In Australia, there are only a limited number of suppliers that carry stock.&nbsp; Ferrite size, shape and cost varies significantly.&nbsp; The information provided can be minimal or non-existent.&nbsp; Part numbers for ferrites listed in international catalogues are not generally available in Australia and buying these can entail long lead times and high freight costs.</p>
<p>Often we don’t really know what we’re getting and how effective they will work for us when they finally arrive.&nbsp; From this perspective, buying and using ferrite filters seems to have more in common with black magic than the application of radio science.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I know if the ferrites I purchased are good, bad or totally ineffective?</li>
<li>Do I get what I pay for? &nbsp;Are expensive ferrites much better than cheap ones?</li>
<li>How can I tell if one ferrite is enough?&nbsp; Are 2 or 3 together really worthwhile?</li>
<li>What are the advantages of clamps over beads and rings?</li>
<li>Are big and heavy ferrites better than lightweight and small ones?</li>
<li>How far up the radio spectrum are these things going to work for me?</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="218" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3.jpg 832w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3-300x270.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3-768x690.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3-60x54.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-3-150x135.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px">Ferrites are a type of ceramic made from iron and other oxides and come moulded into different shapes.&nbsp; The material combination &nbsp;is called a ‘mix’.</p>
<p>The characteristics of these mixes determine where and how they should be used.&nbsp;&nbsp; When a wire passes through or near ferrite materials, it effectively adds resistance to that wire at radio frequencies, but this resistance effect varies with the frequency applied to the wire.</p>
<p>Every ferrite has its own characteristic impedance curve allowing it to absorb unwanted RF currents before reaching your receiver or appliance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can’t tell what that working curve is going to be just by looking at it.</p>
<p>For this experiment, we purchased sample ferrites from the Australian retailers Jaycar and Altronics.&nbsp; We compared these with samples of similar size from the QRM Guru ferrite kits, then further compared all of these with some cheap ‘no-name’ ferrites purchased from eBay.</p>

<p>Testing methodology is important.&nbsp; We used a spectrum analyser with a tracking generator.&nbsp; The spectrum analyser shows gain or loss of radio frequencies between any two points on the radio spectrum.&nbsp; Our unit has capability to scan the radio spectrum from 10KHz to 1.5 GHz, but in this trial, we profiled these ferrite devices between 100KHz and 450MHz.</p>
<p>The tracking generator creates a small signal that regularly sweeps between two frequencies we are monitoring at a very controlled level.&nbsp; We are then able to couple from the tracking generator to the spectrum analyser via a small brass rod, which will become our test wire.&nbsp; First we&nbsp; ‘<strong>normalise’</strong> to compensate for any stray capacitance and inductance around our test area.&nbsp; A flat yellow line represents zero dB.&nbsp; This line becomes our reference point before filtering is added.&nbsp; When any unknown ferrite is added to the test conductor, we measure a clear plot showing the unique characteristics of that item.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5.jpg" alt="" width="985" height="509" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5.jpg 985w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5-300x155.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5-768x397.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5-60x31.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-5-150x78.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 985px) 100vw, 985px"></p>
<p>With this arrangement we examined a graphic plot of each sample, then recorded five unique values which identify its effectiveness.&nbsp; We looked at :</p>
<ul>
<li>(<strong>A</strong>) The <strong>lowest</strong> frequency where the item drops below the -3dB (half-signal) point.</li>
<li>(<strong>B</strong>) The <strong>highest</strong> frequency where the curve crosses the -3dB point</li>
<li>(<strong>C</strong>) The frequency (<strong>MHz</strong>) where the greatest attenuation takes place</li>
<li>(<strong>D</strong>) The maximum degree of <strong>attenuation</strong> (peak –dB) that takes place.</li>
<li>(<strong>E</strong>)&nbsp; The <strong>weight</strong> of each ferrite item.&nbsp; (in grams)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Not all characteristics are being tested here</strong></p>
<p>It should be noted that this article is focused on using ferrites for noise reduction only.&nbsp; In this role the energy being absorbed is not great.&nbsp; Where ferrites are used in high-current environments, such as in a transmitter balun, there will be an RF power threshold where they can no longer effectively absorb energy and their characteristics will begin to distort.</p>
<p>The overheating and saturation effects of high current applications are not a part of this study.</p>
<h2><strong>Study Results</strong></h2>
<p>The table below contains the raw results of our assessment, grouped in order of supplier, then size. &nbsp;The figures can be difficult to digest in this form, but we can take away some very important findings from this test data.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="459" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8.jpg 900w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8-300x153.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8-768x392.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8-60x31.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-8-150x77.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"></p>
<h2><strong>Branding vs Price</strong></h2>
<p>The first significant observation is that they all worked.&nbsp; Regardless of the source, none of the samples tested were fake or defective.&nbsp; They were all capable of suppressing radio frequencies to a greater or lesser degree. &nbsp;This is reassuring, as you can never prove authenticity just by looking at a ferrite.</p>
<p>From these samples, we can surmise that regardless of their source, all of these clamp-on ferrites will provide at least some degree of effectiveness in the shack.</p>
<h2><strong>Ferrite Mixture Type</strong></h2>
<p>The next observation (with the exception of the Altronics Iron Core ring) is that all of these materials are composed from a similar mix of ferrite material.&nbsp; The absorption curves were all a reasonable match to <strong>Mix 43</strong>.&nbsp; This indicates that their application is appropriate for HF and low VHF frequencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The Altronics ring L4534A was purchased with the rest of the ferrites, but it does not qualify as a ferrite device.&nbsp; It is a powdered iron object with different characteristics.&nbsp; We left it in the test for contrast and will provide separate comment on these devices.)</p>
<h2><strong>Size vs weight correlation of ferrite clamps</strong></h2>
<p>Clamp-on ferrite devices come in a variety of different physical sizes and shapes.&nbsp; It is reasonable to think that bigger ferrites work better than smaller ones, but is this actually the case?&nbsp; We sorted our samples by weight and plotted this chart to see how closely the degree of absorption of RF energy followed the physical weight of each sample.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9.jpg" alt="" width="874" height="242" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9.jpg 874w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9-300x83.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9-768x213.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9-60x17.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-9-150x42.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="267" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10.jpg 481w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10-300x246.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10-60x49.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-10-150x123.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px">The answer appears to be”partially yes”.&nbsp; Generally, heavier ferrites will out-perform lighter versions, but there were a couple of exceptions that did very well.</p>
<p>The <strong>Altronics</strong> solid ring <strong>L4534A (A3) </strong>outperformed clamps of similar weight, as did the <strong>Jaycar</strong> <strong>LF1294 (J2)</strong>.&nbsp; Both are circled in red in the chart above.</p>
<p>There is a correlation between ferrite effectiveness and wall thickness.&nbsp; Both circled examples had a relatively small internal wire opening, which made for a thicker clamp wall.&nbsp; This equates to a higher density of ferrite material around the single conductor, giving superior performance.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11.jpg" alt="" width="321" height="203" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11.jpg 425w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11-300x190.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11-60x38.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-11-150x95.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 321px) 100vw, 321px">Conversely, sample <strong>E1</strong> from eBay was a physically large clamp, but it catered for a thick 12mm cable.&nbsp; This thinner wall thickness reduced effectiveness, as seen by the data point circled in yellow on the chart above.</p>
<p>This effect is not as bad as it first seems, so don’t necessarily shop only for thick-walled clamps.&nbsp; Examine some of the following sections in this article which explore the most effective ways to use ferrite clamps.</p>
<p>The final comment on the size of clamps was the observation that the very small clamp-on ferrites don’t have sufficient mass for good performance.&nbsp; The smallest of the eBay clamps (<strong>E5</strong>) didn’t even reach -3dB.&nbsp; Unless a friend gives you a lot of them for nothing, there is a lot to be said for aiming straight for medium and large clamps, or the results could be disappointing.</p>
<h2><strong>Are solid ferrite rings better than split rings?</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="209" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12.jpg 552w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12-300x188.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12-60x38.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-12-150x94.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px">This turned out to be an easy question to answer.&nbsp; Two rings of similar weight, hole-size and ferrite mix were compared.&nbsp; One was solid and the other was split.</p>
<p>The results were almost identical when tested.&nbsp; This tells us that shopping for solid cores have no real advantage over split cores.&nbsp; However, the split ferrites can be applied to cables without having to remove connector plugs and this makes them a more practical purchase.</p>
<h2><strong>What’s the best way to use ferrites?</strong></h2>
<p>An important question to answer is “<em>what is the optimum configuration for the application of ferrite clamps</em>“.&nbsp; It’s easy to imagine that two clamps are better than one, but how much better?</p>
<p>For this exercise we focused our attention on the QRM Guru clamps (<strong>Q2</strong>) designed for 8mm wire.</p>
<p>Compare the following screen captures and images of one and two clamps:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13.jpg" alt="" width="1173" height="435" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13.jpg 1173w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-300x111.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-1024x380.jpg 1024w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-768x285.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-60x22.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-13-150x56.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1173px) 100vw, 1173px"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14.jpg" alt="" width="1164" height="429" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14.jpg 1164w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-300x111.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-768x283.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-60x22.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-14-150x55.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1164px) 100vw, 1164px"></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, doubling up on the clamps gives an additional 3dB of RF absorption.&nbsp; At <strong>55 MHz</strong> the peak absorption jumped from <strong>-4.40 dB</strong> to <strong>-7.54 dB</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This tells us that if one clamp on its own does not quite do the job, then add another for improved performance.&nbsp; Be aware that to achieve a further 3dB, you must double again from two to four units.</p>
<p>Next, we explore the effectiveness of looping a wire through a clamp more than once.&nbsp; This can only work where there is sufficient slack in the cable, and where the hole in the core is large enough to accept additional turns.</p>
<p>Here is what happens:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15.jpg" alt="" width="1151" height="458" srcset="https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15.jpg 1151w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-300x119.jpg 300w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-1024x407.jpg 1024w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-768x306.jpg 768w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-60x24.jpg 60w, https://qrm.guru/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Image-15-150x60.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1151px) 100vw, 1151px"></p>
<p>This is a very interesting result showing that the single extra turn through the core increases absorption from -4.4dB to a huge -12.41 dB.&nbsp;&nbsp; This 8 dB increase makes a single clamp provide the same effectiveness of around six such clamps on the same wire.</p>

<h2><strong>Why adding turns makes ferrites much more effective</strong></h2>
<p>This effect is not really a mystery when we break down what’s happening.&nbsp; When we add ferrite to a wire, we are effectively adding series resistance to that wire, but this resistance effect varies with frequency.&nbsp; At steady DC, the ferrites have no effect, but as an AC signal is applied a resistance is developed within the wire surrounded by the ferrite material.&nbsp; The higher the frequency, the greater the increased resistance.&nbsp; This resistance is also affected by the type of ferrite material, its volume, and its distance from the wire concerned.</p>

<p><em>Guest blog post by <a href="https://lanebc.com/about/">Jay Michlin</a>, circa 1987 (used with permission). A recounting of a presentation by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson">Bill Atkinson</a> at the <a href="https://www.pa-smug.org/">Stanford Macintosh User Group (SMUG)</a> </em></p>



<p>HyperCard. Bill Atkinson. The auditorium was packed and everyone stayed until the end.<br>What more need be said?</p>



<p>I considered stopping this month’s report right here, because the first paragraph already<br>tells volumes. But I never learned to quit while ahead, so here’s more. Specifically, I’m going to try to explain what HyperCard is, both as Bill described it and as I see it. As you’ll see, my perspective is somewhat different.</p>



<p>Bill said that HyperCard tries to make more of the power of a personal computer available to nonprogrammers. There’s plenty of goodness in using a computer for word processing, spreadsheets and other applications. But to unlock the real power, you have to program, and that’s very hard. HyperCard delivers a lot of the power of programming, but with minimal burden.</p>



<p>Or, you can look at the matter another way. Before HyperCard, the Mac had documents and applications. Documents contain information, but by themselves offer no opportunity for interaction with you. Applications offer interaction, but do not contain information. HyperCard stacks are in between, with a combination of both information and interaction inherent in them.</p>



<p>Or, you can think of HyperCard as a software erector set. It comes with a kit of tools, a set of instructions and lots of parts. Like an erector set, it has one more thing — examples. When you first get the set, you build copies of the ex amples. Then you change a few small details. Eventually you become comfortable with the tools and the parts and start using it fluidly to express your own, original ideas. In the same way, HyperCard comes with dozens of sample stacks. They’re not an afterthought. They’re an integral part of the product, intended to help you use it immediately and learn it quickly.</p>



<p>Here’s what I think. HyperCard is the latest in a long list of “languages” that seek to make<br>computers easy to program. The need is not new, the idea is not new and the solution is not new. What’s special about HyperCard is that it’s brilliantly executed. Biil obviously spent a lot of time thinking and learning about his task before, during and after sitting down to code.</p>



<p>Let me explain. For the early computers there were no such things as “canned” applications like word processors and spreadsheets. Everyone was a programmer. There was no choice. Then, in the 1960’s, timesharing was invented. The primary external feature that made timesharing different was that it supported users interacting with the computer at terminals.</p>



<p>But the users still had to program if they were to get the machine to do anything, As terminal access to timesharing became more widespread, especially on college campuses, everyone understood that programming was a barrier. So they invented BASIC.</p>



<p>Perhaps you thought that BASIC always was as it is today on personal computers. It wasn’t. It was expressly designed to help college students get over the programming barrier on early timesharing systems. It did that in a number of ways:</p>



<ul><li>It was interpretive. Users could type a command and get instant results printed on the terminal. It’s an elementary fact of life that we learn better if we have quick, useful feedback. </li><li>It made simple things simple. To print something on the terminal, you said, “PRINT.” There was no need to tell the computer how to find the terminal or what the printing format was to be. </li><li>It was small in that it had very few statements and options defined. Of course, that was partly because the computers and translators of the time would have struggled to give quick response on a complicated language. But even when more features were added, they remained in the background, invisible to novice users who don’t need them. </li><li>It came with clear, obvious examples, either as part of a college course or in a manual. You learned to write BASIC by trying the examples. BASIC worked. It helped a generation of college students learn to use computers. Later, it was the primary offering on commercial timesharing systems from Tymshare and General Electric. And most recently, it helped launch the personal computer revolution. It wasn’t so long ago that to use a personal computer at all, you had to program.</li></ul>



<p>Personal computers and their application software have grown sophisticated so fast that we easily forget that computers and programming go together. It’s tempting to say that to- day, in the modern era, programming is no longer needed. We all just go to Computer Ware and buy whatever package we need to make our machines do anything.</p>



<p>For many, perhaps that is true. But Bill Atkinson, and Apple are saying that you still need the opportunity to program to tap the underlying power of your computer. HyperCard will be the BASIC of the modern era, with possibly as profound an effect on the future as BASIC has had up to now.</p>



<p>Those are my words, not Bill’s. But I wouldn’t be surprised if he agreed.</p>



<p> * * * *</p>



<p>In case you missed the meeting, here are some details. Bill wasn’t there alone. Dan Winkler, who created HyperTalk, HyperCard’s internal scripting language, was also present. So was Danny Goodman, who wrote the book. Also Kristee Kreitman, who did the artwork (of which there is lots), Robin Shank, who helped do the testing, and Mike Holm, the Product Manager.</p>



<p>As an aside, this is an interesting illustration of the difference between a modern business enterprise and one from the last generation. A modern corporation values the natural benefits to all concerned when employees from all parts of the organization go out and meet customers. A more traditional corporation sends out only carefully prepared marketing teams.</p>



<p>Anyway, Bill demonstrated HyperCard and talked about the philosophy behind it. Then Dan told us about HyperTalk. He showed it to be a powerful, yet well-behaved language. Despite the fact that it underlies much of what goes on in HyperCerd, HyperTalk remains invisible be- hind the scenes if you don’t need or want to know about it.</p>



<p>Then Danny told us about two stacks he designed and is now selling commercially. The first, Business Class, presents a map of the world. Click anywhere and you can learn about language, currency, time zones, air travel and other important conditions. The second, Focal Point, is a very generalized and very interactive desk calendar and diary. Both are implemented as HyperCard stacks.</p>



<p>Incidentally, when you buy a HyperCard stack, you can copy and modify it the same way you can manipulate the example stacks that come with HyperCard itself. Apple’s whole approach is to make HyperCard a common tool, and stacks a common medium that people exchange and build on.</p>



<p>Finally, here are a few miscellancous points our guests made in response to questions.</p>



<p>HyperCard is roughly 360K of code, nearly ten times the sum of Bill’s original MacPaint and QuickDraw combined. HyperCard requires at least 1 MB or memory and the 128K ROMs. The team tried for 512K, but couldn’t make it.</p>



<p>The program contains some pioneering work Bill has done to compress bit maps. The com- pression feature brings two advantages. First, it minimizes disk space to store stacks. And second, it speeds response because the program has fewer bytes to move to and from disk. The feature typically achieves 10-to-1 compressions, with up to 30-to-1 not unusual.</p>



<p>Bill claims to be about two-thirds done with HyperCard. The product is now at a point “where you can build stacks and count on them still working five years from now…” The next features to be added are international features beginning in a month or two (Kanji will take longer) and CD-ROM support a bit later. Color is on the to-do list, but not at high priority.</p>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Design is easily one of the most misunderstood lines of work there is. If you’ve ever heard people comment on a piece of art saying <em>“I could do that”</em>, or bicker about a designer’s work being “overpriced”, you probably know what I mean.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Just a few months ago, The Sunday Times even published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/8-in-10-singaporeans-willing-to-pay-more-for-essential-services">poll</a>&nbsp;stating that 71% of Singaporean locals think Artist is the most 'non-essential' job during a pandemic. This sprouted heated responses all over the world about the importance of the arts, which includes design work.</p>
<p>To those who have never set foot in the field, design looks like it’s easy and requires no smarts. It is in everything we see — our digital devices, our homes, the chair that you’re sitting on, and even the webpage you’re reading from right now — yet, it is so taken for granted. Why?</p>
<p>We gave our designers a penny for their thoughts, and learned a few things.</p>
<h3><strong>“I could do that.”</strong></h3>
<p>People often assume…</p>
<p>“It's easy.” — <strong>Leni</strong></p>
<p>“That design is easy and fast, and that everyone is capable of designing since there are many free softwares out there on the internet. The reason why everyone wants quick work from us is because they tend to underestimate the time and effort we invest in each design.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating a design is rarely the problem. Creating a great design that is set apart from others is challenging and takes time.” — <strong>Kelsey</strong></p>
<p>“That designing is easy, and that what we do can't bring value.” — <strong>Jye Miin</strong></p>
<h3><strong>“So, you like drawing?”</strong></h3>
<p>People think…</p>
<p>“That design is solely ‘art’. Though there is art in design, design is often also about problem solving. It’s often rooted in basic principles of decision making.” — <strong>Mei Kwan</strong></p>
<p><span>"That designers just do arts or&nbsp;create beautiful things. We actually often use design concepts to solve problems. That includes little things like the style and position of a button, colors, margins, etc. </span></p>
<p><span>These all serve to solve problems that users face, or rather help users achieve their goals when they interact with the apps/systems that we build. Design makes everyone's lives easier." — <strong>Adri</strong></span></p>
<h3><span>"You must be talented!"</span></h3>
<p><span>And people misunderstand that...</span></p>
<p><span>"Design is all about the talent. It’s a common misconception that design comes naturally to us.</span></p>
<p><span>Design requires more than an eye for aesthetics — it's often about user experience, purpose, creating solutions, and empathy. While we constantly learn, practice, and adapt in developing an eye for good design, we should also build on these fundamental principles. Talent, skill, and experience all play a part in making a great designer."&nbsp;— <strong>Han</strong></span></p>
<p>In what other ways do people misunderstand design work?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>On Monday, a group of researchers sponsored by Breakthrough Listen, the world’s largest SETI program, </span><a href="http://seti.berkeley.edu/lunarseti/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">submitted a paper</a><span> to National Academy of Sciences’ Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey that makes the case for establishing a SETI radio observatory on the farside of the moon. The decadal survey establishes scientific priorities for the next ten years and the new paper addresses one of the biggest problems facing the search for extraterrestrial intelligence today: The overwhelming amount of radio interference.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Our planet has become so “loud” in the part of the radio spectrum observed by SETI that it threatens to drown out any signal sent from an intelligent civilization. Not only would a lunar radio telescope not have to deal with terrestrial radio interference, it could also significantly increase our chances of hearing from ET by opening up parts of the radio spectrum that are blocked by Earth's atmosphere. While the idea of using the moon for radio astronomy is decades old, the researchers make the case that technological advancements have finally made a lunar SETI observatory truly feasible.</span></p></div><div><div><p><span>
says Eric Michaud, an intern at the SETI Berkeley Research Center and the first author of the paper. “Maybe not today, but I think it’s going to get more and more feasible as time goes on.”&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Radio interference has been a problem for SETI from the very beginning. In the spring of 1960, the planetary scientist Frank Drake trained the massive radio telescope at Green Bank Observatory in West Virginia on Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, two stars a mere 12 light years from Earth. That summer, Drake spent his days studying the signals picked up by Green Bank’s giant mechanical ear in the hopes of receiving a message broadcast by an alien civilization orbiting those stars. Known as Project Ozma, Drake’s experiment marked the beginning of SETI, the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Shortly after Drake started his observations, he was surprised to find what appeared to be a signal of intelligent origin. After days of watching a needle drift lazily over a spool of paper recording the random undulations of cosmic static, Drake and his colleagues were jolted awake when the machine started recording the frantic pulses of a strong radio signal picked up by the telescope. The timing and magnitude of the pulses clearly marked them as artificial; there was nothing in the natural world that could produce such a frenetic radio profile. It would have been an astounding stroke of luck to pick up an alien message after only a few hours of observation, but it was hard to argue with the data.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>“None of us had ever seen anything like it,” Drake recalled in </span><em>Is Anyone Out There?</em><span>, his autobiographical book about the early days of SETI. “We looked at each other wide-eyed. Could discovery be this easy?”</span></p></div><div><div><p><span>

It was a letdown, but the false detection turned out to be a portent for the future of SETI. In the 60 years since Drake’s pioneering experiment, researchers have conducted dozens of SETI searches across thousands of stars and turned up empty-handed. At the same time, the sources of radio interference on Earth—military radars, TV towers, cell phones, and satellites—have exponentially increased, which greatly increases the chances that an extraterrestrial signal will be lost among the noise.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Earth was never a particularly great place to do any kind of radio astronomy due to our thick atmosphere blocking a large portion of the radio spectrum. The proliferation of radio communication technologies has only made things harder. The moon, by comparison, has no atmosphere and its nights last for weeks on end, which limits radio noise from the sun. And as&nbsp;NASA discovered through a spate of lunar orbiter missions in the late 1960s, the moon also acts as a natural shield that blocks radio signals emanating from Earth. As the planetary astronomer Phillipe Zarka has put it, “the farside of the moon during the lunar night is the most radio-quiet place in our local universe.” It’s exactly the sort of peace and quiet you want if you’re searching for faint radio signals from solar systems that might be hundreds of light years away.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>The new Breakthrough Listen paper proposed two main approaches to a lunar SETI observatory: an orbiter and a telescope on the surface. The basic idea behind a SETI lunar orbiter would be to scan for signals as it passed over the lunar farside and relay data back to Earth as it passed over the near side. One of the main advantages of an orbiter is cost. The proliferation of small satellites that are capable of accurate tracking combined with low-cost small launch providers like Rocket Lab means that a SETI orbiter could conceivably be sent to the moon </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-launch-cubesat-to-moon-from-virginia/#:~:text=The%20firm%2Dfixed%2Dprice%20launch,Tyvak%20Nano%2DSatellite%20Systems%20Inc." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for less than $20 million</a><span>. This would be a valuable pathfinder mission that could pave the way for a more ambitious observatory on the surface, but without the risk and cost.&nbsp; As the </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/the-supercluster-podcast-water-bears-might-now-occupy-the-moon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ill-fated Israeli Beresheet lander mission</a><span> reminded us, landing on the moon is extremely challenging even when the mission is backed by $100 million.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>But a SETI lunar orbiter would also come with a lot of compromises. It would only be able to conduct observations during the brief stretches when it was on the lunar farside, which would make a sustained observation campaign more challenging. The upshot is that an orbiter would have access to the full sky, whereas a telescope on the surface would be constrained by the moon’s rotation. The biggest downside of an orbiter is that it might lose a lot of the shielding benefits of the moon and be more vulnerable to radio interference from Earth since it would be orbiting high above the lunar surface.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>“The first SETI observations that are done from the lunar farside will be done from orbit, there’s no question about that,” says Andrew Siemion, the director of the Berkeley SETI Research Center and the second author on the paper. “I think eventually we absolutely want to do something on the surface because we want to build a very large aperture telescope, but even when we’re at that point I don’t think that would negate the utility of doing things from orbit as well.”&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>So what would a SETI observatory on the moon look like? One idea is to use the naturally parabolic lunar crater as a radio dish, much like the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico and </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/chinas-massive-telescope-is-the-next-great-seti-hope" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the FAST telescope in China</a><span>, which are built into natural depressions in the land. This idea was </span><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/RS012i005p00845" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first considered</a><span> back in the late 1970s by a group of scientists at the radio physics lab at the Stanford Research Institute. Their idea was to recreate Arecibo on the moon by suspending an antenna from the lip of a crater and using the basin as a reflector. The reduced gravity on the moon would allow for a radio telescope far larger than any on Earth, which could significantly enhance the sensitivity of SETI searches. Ultimately the researchers concluded that a lunar radio observatory was too expensive compared to SETI telescopes that could be built on Earth.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>But 40 years later, Michaud says that building a radio dish in a lunar crater may finally be cheap enough to pull off. One of the main drivers of this cost reduction is the advent of commercial launch providers like SpaceX and Rocket Lab, which have </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/cheaper-rockets-growing-the-human-family-in-space" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dramatically lowered the cost of space access</a><span>. Another driver is NASA’s push to establish a permanent human presence on the moon, which has subsidized the development of a fleet of commercial lunar exploration vehicles. “There’s so much interest in going back to the moon,” says Michaud, who cited Blue Origin’s lunar lander and Rocket Lab’s Photon Lunar satellite as examples of technologies enabled by </span><a href="https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/nasas-first-puerto-rican-born-director-aims-for-a-moonshot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NASA’s Artemis program</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>A crux of the original vision for lunar SETI observatories was that it would require a human settlement on the moon to build and operate the radio dish. But robotic systems have improved enough that it may be possible to take humans out of the equation. This was clearly demonstrated in 2019 when China’s Chang’e 4 rover landed autonomously on the farside of the moon. These advancements in autonomous navigation have laid the foundation for a lunar radio observatory that is built entirely by robots.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>It sounds like science fiction, but earlier this year NASA’s Advanced Innovative Concepts program </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2020_Phase_I_Phase_II/lunar_crater_radio_telescope/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">awarded one of it’s prestigious grants to Saptarshi Bandyopadhyay, a researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to figure out a way to make it happen</a><span>. His idea is to use rovers to deploy wire mesh in a crater on the lunar farside and suspend a receiver over the dish. NIAC is all about funding high risk, high reward missions, and there’s no guarantee that Bandyopadhyay’s proposal will ever come to fruition. Still, addressing the technical problems associated with building a radio receiver on the farside of the moon is an important first step.</span></p></div><div><p><span>And Bandyopadhyay isn’t the only NASA-backed researcher contemplating a lunar radio observatory. Jack Burns, a radio astronomer at the University of Colorado, has also received a grant to study a mission concept for a radio telescope array called </span><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/project/lunar-farside/dr-jack-burns" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FARSIDE</a><span>. Instead of using a crater as a dish, FARSIDE would deploy several smaller antennas across the lunar surface that would collectively form a large radio telescope. Both NASA studies are focused on radio astronomy rather than SETI, but Siemion sees the two disciplines as natural allies in the quest to establish an observatory on the lunar farside. SETI has piggybacked on other radio astronomy projects in the past—SERENDIP, for instance, opportunistically searched for ET signals during radio observation campaigns at a variety of telescopes—and it seems plausible that a similar arrangement could be made with an observatory on the moon.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>Siemion acknowledged that there were certain technical challenges that would arise in a collaboration on a lunar radio observatory. The biggest issue, he says, is that a lot of radio astronomy is done at frequencies that don’t really require an observatory on the moon. “Radio …</span></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>If you have been working as a network administrator for quite some time, you probably already know about <strong>switches</strong>.</p>



<p>Switches are essential blocks of any network environment. </p>



<p>When they associated with computers, they are responsible for <strong>receiving</strong> and <strong>transmitting</strong> traffic over a network.</p>



<p>However, do you really know <strong>how computers communicate?</strong></p>



<p>What tools do they use when you are dealing with a private local network?</p>



<p>Is it different when you are communicating over a larger network, or Internet?</p>



<p>In this tutorial, you are going to discover everything that there is to know about <strong>computer communication</strong>. </p>



<p>By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to clearly identify <strong>how computers are communicating</strong> and which tools they are using in order to achieve it.</p>



<h2>Switches and OSI Model</h2>



<p>Before jumping into the explanation, there is an important concept that you need to grasp : <strong>the OSI model</strong>.</p>



<p>The OSI model is made of seven layers :</p>



<ul><li><strong>Physical layer</strong> : essentially your cables and every physical part that links a computer to another</li><li><strong>Data-link layer</strong> : that defines the protocol used in order for devices to communicate over a local network (Ethernet most of the time)</li><li><strong>Network layer</strong> : defines the way computers are meant to communicate over a larger network or between a group of networks.</li><li><strong>Transport layer</strong> : that describes how data will be transmitted from one point to another (is it TCP or is it UDP?)</li><li><strong>Session layer</strong> : which states if we are talking about a full-duplex, half-duplex or simplex communications</li><li><strong>Presentation + application layer</strong> : your users are quite familiar with this layer because it represents the application they are using to communicate (Firefox or Chrome for example).</li></ul>



<p>In this list, we are going to focus on the second point because it is the one that relates to MAC addresses.</p>



<p>In most cases, communication is done via <strong>Ethernet.</strong></p>



<p>Ethernet, in simple words, is a protocol that defines a way for devices to communicate with each other.</p>



<p>It defines the way frames are formatted, how large they should be, where data should be stored and so on, the destination as well as the source of the message.</p>



<p>The destination and source are represented by the destination MAC address and the source MAC address of both devices.</p>



<p><em>But, what is a MAC address?</em></p>



<h3>MAC Address Definition</h3>



<p><strong>A MAC Address is an unique identifier given to your network adapter when it was built by a given NIC vendor.</strong></p>



<p>MAC addresses are represented by 12 hexadecimal characters, six groups of two, separated by colons or dashes (<a href="https://ouilookup.com/mac/98-E7-43">98-E7-43</a>-78-65-74 or <a href="https://ouilookup.com/mac/9C-7B-EF">9C-7B-EF</a>-45-F5-45 for example).</p>



<p>If your device is communicating over Internet, you can be pretty sure that it has a network interface card equipped with a MAC address (computers, gaming consoles, mobile phones..)</p>



<p>However, a MAC address on its own is not enough for your computer to send a message over a network.</p>



<p><em>Remember the OSI model we saw in the previous chapter?</em></p>



<p>When sending a message over the network, your message will be <strong>encapsulated</strong> with information from the presentation layer to the data-link layer.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers-1024x282.png" alt="osi model and layers explained" width="1024" height="282" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers-1024x282.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers-300x82.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers-768x211.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/osi-model-layers.png 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>In other words, it will be assigned TCP (or UDP) headers, IP headers as well as Ethernet headers before going onto the wire.</p>



<p>If you just plugged your computer to the network, there is a chance that your computer does not know anything about other computers on the network.</p>



<p>It is important to say that if your computer already communicated over the network, it has a cache that it is going to use to format packets correctly.</p>



<p>Instead of having to connect every single computer to each other on a network, we use a device that binds the computers together : <strong>the switch.</strong></p>



<p>For now, let’s assume that we don’t have any router, as we simply want to send messages over a simple local subnet.</p>



<p>Use the following schema as a starting point : you have three computers on the network linked via a simple switch.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/simple-network-example.png" alt="simple network example" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/simple-network-example.png 828w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/simple-network-example-300x174.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/simple-network-example-768x445.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px"></figure></div>



<p>Computer A wants to send a message to computer B, h<strong>ow can it achieve that?</strong></p>



<h3>Understanding ARP on a local subnet</h3>



<p>In order to understand how computer A can send a message to computer B, you need to understand the <strong>ARP protocol</strong>.</p>



<p>ARP is a protocol used by computers in order <strong>to discover MAC addresses associated with IP addresses over a network.</strong></p>



<p>In short, when computer A decides to send a message to computer B, it does it using the IP address of computer B (192.178.1.3/24 in our case).</p>



<p>But if you remember the OSI model we saw just before, you realized that the message needs to have Ethernet headers.</p>



<p>That is to say that the message needs to have a source MAC address and a destination MAC address.</p>



<p>However, computer A has no idea of the MAC address of computer B.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b-1024x333.png" alt="" width="1024" height="333" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b-1024x333.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b-300x98.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b-768x250.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/message-for-computer-b.png 1269w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>In order to learn about it, it is going to use the <strong>ARP protocol</strong>.</p>



<p>Computer A will send an ARP discover frame to the switch stating that it needs to learn about the MAC address of computer B.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema-1024x346.png" alt="ARP discover example" width="1024" height="346" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema-1024x346.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema-300x101.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema-768x260.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/arp-discover-schema.png 1419w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>From there, your switch will broadcast the frame to all computers connected to the switch. As a consequence, every computer on the local network will receive the ARP discover frame.</p>



<figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch-1024x346.png" alt="" width="1024" height="346" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch-1024x346.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch-300x101.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch-768x260.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/broadcast-arp-discover-switch.png 1419w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>When receiving the message, if the IP address matches, the corresponding computer will send a message back stating that it is matching.</p>



<p>If it doesn’t match, the NIC of the corresponding computer will drop the message.</p>



<p>From there, the switch also learns about the MAC address and forwards the message back to the initiating computer.</p>



<p>Awesome, your computer now knows that the computer 192.178.1.3/24 has the <a href="https://ouilookup.com/mac/00-60-70">00-60-70</a>-14-45-10.</p>



<figure><img src="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network-1024x350.png" alt="" width="1024" height="350" srcset="https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network-1024x350.png 1024w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network-300x103.png 300w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network-768x263.png 768w, https://ouilookup.com/images/wordpress/2020/04/complete-ethernet-message-network.png 1290w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Now, your computer is able to properly format the message, the missing Ethernet header can now be completed!</p>



<p>As a consequence, the message is sent over the network and both computers can now happily communicate without any trouble.</p>



<p><strong>Quite nice!</strong></p>



<p>Now, you may be wondering : if I want to communicate with another computer located in another network, very far away from me, do I need to know about every single MAC address on Earth?</p>



<h2>Network communication over Internet</h2>



<p>In the previous chapter, we saw that communication can easily be achieved on a local subnet using the <strong>ARP protocol</strong>.</p>



<p>However, in most cases, you want to be able to communicate over Internet.</p>



<p>To answer the previous question, you don’t have to have every single MAC address stored on your computer, ARP is a protocol for local Ethernet resolution.</p>



<p>To complexify things a little bit, let’s add a router to our previous network and state that computer A now wants to communicate with computer D.</p>



<p>To understand communication over Internet, you need to understand the decision made by your computer to send a computer over the network.</p>



<p>When sending a message, your computer goes into the following decision making process :</p>



<ul><li><strong>Is the destination IP located on the subnet I am currently linked to? </strong></li></ul>



<p>If this is the case, we use the algorithm seen in the previous chapter (using ARP).</p>



<p>If this is not the case, the message is simply <strong>forwarded to your local router</strong> in order to be routed over Internet.</p>



<p>Note that your computer needs to know about the <strong>MAC address of your router</strong> in any case, using the ARP protocol described in the previous section.</p>



<p>The key here is to understand that <strong>the destination IP will be the one of the computer D but the MAC address is the one of the local gateway.</strong></p>



<p>In our example, the destination IP is not on the same subnet, so the message will be forwarded to the default gateway (aka our local router).</p>



<p>From there, the message is routed through hundreds of different routers to your destination and the response (if any) is sent back to you by the destination computer.</p>



<p>Awesome, you now know how message are sent over a network and how they can reach a local or a distant destination!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In this tutorial, you learnt <strong>how computers can easily communicate over a network.</strong></p>



<p>If you are dealing with a local subnet, you now know that the ARP protocol is used and that your message is broadcasted to everyone in order to learn the destination MAC address.</p>



<p>If you want to send your message over Internet, you often send your message to your local gateway (using the destination IP but the MAC of your router!).</p>



<p>From there, <strong>complex routing algorithms</strong> are used in order to reach the destination computer.</p>

		<p><em>Reverse engineering the North Korean version of a popular Sim City-like game using Ghidra and ndSpy to understand video game monetization strategies in the DPRK and the marketization of the country’s economy. </em></p><p><em>Key takeaways:</em></p><p><em>
<li>Android devices and applications are increasingly common in North Korea. Physical “app stores” can be found on every street corner in Pyongyang.</li>
<li>The game considered in this post is based on a Chinese version of a popular Android game developed in the Netherlands</li>
<li>The game’s monetization strategy was adapted to the country’s infrastructure (low internet/intranet availability, physical app stores)</li>
<li>The North Korean version eschews the original freemium + online microtransaction model for a one-time licence purchase + offline microtransaction model</li>
<li>File integrity checks added by North Korean developers shows that piracy is a concern and suggests the existence a warez/cracking scene in the DPRK</li>
<li>The cryptographic algorithms used for the licence are MD5, SHA1, RSA and AES. The library used by the game included the domestically developed private key algorithms Pilsung and Jipsam, but they were not used as part of the licencing system</li></em></p><p><a href="#intro">0.

<h4 id="intro">0. Introduction </h4><p>During a recent trip to North Korea, I noticed the recent and ubiquitous presence of <em>Information Technology Exchange Rooms</em> (정보기술교류실), physical stores where one can purchase a variety of electronic devices – from laptops and tablets to USB sticks and chargers – as well as software and video games for PC, mobile and tablets (for an in-depth look at what goes on inside those stores as well as what the app selection looks like, <a href="https://www.nknews.org/2019/02/what-to-buy-inside-a-north-korean-app-store/">this article</a> by Alek Sigley provides a an excellent description. There are also a few <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ujblnigJmM">videos</a> on YouTube). After looking through the catalogue of available games at different stores, I eventually decided to try and buy a Sim City-like game called <em>City Management</em> (도시경경).</p>
<figure id="attachment_426"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chongbo.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/chongbo.png" alt="" width="845" height="760"></a><figcaption>Billboards for various app stores in Pyongyang</figcaption></figure><p>The game only cost 5000 wons (less than 1 USD) which I paid to have the app installed on the phone I had, a Samsung Galaxy A5 running Android 8. The vendor connected the phone to his PC, transferred the APK and tried to install it, but to no avail. After multiple attempts, he eventually informed me that North Korean apps most likely could not run on phones from other countries. </p>
<figure id="attachment_428"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/marrichakyongchu.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/marrichakyongchu.png" alt="" width="551" height="827"></a><figcaption>Advertisement for a car racing game inside a North Korean app store</figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, I was later able to purchase one of the different tablets sold in North Korea. I got the <em>Morning</em> (아침) brand, which is geared towards students and quite affordable. The tablet ran Android 4 (Kit Kat) on an ARM cpu and came loaded with a few educational apps: language learning courses, dictionaries and several e-book libraries containing the complete works of Kim Il Sung, school textbooks and a collection of literary works. No games, but that could now be fixed quite easily.</p>
<figure id="attachment_431"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/achimtablet.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/achimtablet.png" alt="" width="800" height="490"></a><figcaption>A North Korean Ach’im (Morning) tablet</figcaption></figure><p>I retrieved the <em>City Management</em> APK from my phone and installed it on the tablet, where it ran perfectly. Unfortunately, after the game’s initial splash screen, I landed on this:</p>
<figure id="attachment_434"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/buyserial.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/buyserial.png" alt="" width="1024" height="600"></a><figcaption>Licence key needed</figcaption></figure><p>The screen tells us that there is no “key file” (열쇠화일) and that we should purchase one at a store. There is a “request number” (요청번호) likely used to generate the licence key and make sure it can’t be shared with other devices. Unfortunately, since the APK never installed, the vendor did not put a licence file on my phone when I bought the app. My stay in North Korea was coming to an end too and I did not have time to go back to an app store to buy a new key. So I figured I would take a look inside the app and see if I could get it running nonetheless. </p>
<hr id="licence">
<h4>1. Licensing system </h4><p>To start looking into the APK’s code, I’ll use the standard suite of tools to decompress, decompile and rebuild android apps: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dex2jar/">dex2jar</a>, <a href="http://java-decompiler.github.io/">jd-gui</a>, <a href="https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/">apktool</a> and <a href="https://github.com/appium/sign">apksign</a>. I’ll also use <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android Studio</a> to run and debug the app. The fact that I couldn’t run the app on my phone may have just come from an Android version compatibility issue: I had no problem running it on an emulated Android 4.4 device with Android Studio. The decompilation of the <code>classes.dex</code> file gives us some interesting information right away:</p>
<figure id="attachment_438"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dex2jar1.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/dex2jar1.png" alt="" width="211" height="326"></a><figcaption>Packages and classes from the decompiled <code>classes.dex</code> file</figcaption></figure><p>The name of the <code>com.bz.cityisland2</code> package actually refers to the original game that <em>City Management</em> is based on: <a href="https://www.sparklingsociety.net/sparkling-games/city-building-games/city-island-2/">City Island 2</a> by the Dutch game studio Sparkling Society. The name of the package <code>com.smartions.appprotected</code> refers to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/smartions-ag#section-overview">Smartions</a>, a company that offers solutions to “monetize your mobile game or app in China” and are apparently also City Island’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkling_Society">distributor in China</a>. There are no mentions of those companies in the game itself however. The game’s loading splash screen only tells us that the game was made by the Ryusong (meteor) Technology Exchange Center (류성기술교류소) and that it is protected by the law for the protection of software (<a href="https://www.kisdi.re.kr/kisdi/common/premium?file=1%7C10360">콤퓨터쏘프트웨어보호법</a>). The law has been in place since 2003 to regulate the sales and distribution of software in the country and guarantees software developers the private ownership of their creation.</p>
<figure id="attachment_502"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kyongyong-1.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kyongyong-1.png" alt="" width="1000" height="640"></a><figcaption>Loading screen for the game</figcaption></figure><p>It’s hard to tell whether the North Korean version is based on the source code of the original game or if it’s entirely reverse engineered. In any case, the North Korean version does not use Smartions’s monetization system nor Sparkling Society’s but relies on a different system, which is the main difference from the original game. Save for the translation and some minor renames, the game is otherwise similar to the original (from a cursory examination) in its design, gameplay, features… to the original. </p>
<figure id="attachment_442"><a href="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/UnityStructure.png"><img src="http://digitalnk.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/UnityStructure.png" alt="" width="339" height="221"></a><figcaption>Structure a Unity APK. From Shim et al., <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2018/6280768/"><em>Static and Dynamic Analysis of Android Malware and Goodware Written with Unity Framework</em></a> (2018).<br></figcaption></figure><p>There’s not much more we can glean from the Java code for now since, as the classes in <code>unity3dplayer</code> and <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file make clear, it is used to run code that was written with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)">Unity</a>, a popular cross-plaform video game framework which uses C# as its main programming language. The Unity code is stored in various library with the developer’s C# code being compiled to <code>Assembly-CSharp.dll</code>. C# compiled code is easily decompilable using tools such as <a href="https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy">dnSpy</a>. Once the dll is decompiled, we can look for the message we got earlier “열쇠화일이 존재하지 않습니다” (“The key file does not exist”) to find the bits of code we are interested in. The string search takes us to the <code>CIGLoadingScreen</code> class where we find the string among other variables:</p>
<pre title="">
	// Token: 0x0400056A RID: 1386
	private string userKey;

	// Token: 0x0400056B RID: 1387
	private string tapjoyCurrencyIdentifier;

	// Token: 0x0400056C RID: 1388
	private bool bannerVisible;

	// Token: 0x0400056D RID: 1389
	private int _loadingScreenShownCount;

	// Token: 0x0400056E RID: 1390
	private Dictionary&lt;int, bool&gt; m_gameObjectStatus = new Dictionary&lt;int, bool&gt;();

	// Token: 0x0400056F RID: 1391
	private bool m_isVerify;

	// Token: 0x04000570 RID: 1392

	private string reqNumLabel = "요청번호 : ";

	// Token: 0x04000573 RID: 1395
	private string reqNum;

	// Token: 0x04000574 RID: 1396
	private string finishLabel = "끝내기";
</pre><p>Looking for the name of the string variable <code>reqMsg</code> takes us here:</p>
<pre title="">	// Token: 0x06000928 RID: 2344 RVA: 0x00026E60 File Offset: 0x00025060
	private void OnGUI()
	{
		if (!this.m_isVerify &amp;&amp; this.loadingDone)
		{
			GUI.skin.font = this.kfont;
			GUI.DrawTexture(new Rect(0f, 0f, (float)Screen.width, (float)Screen.height), this.blackBg, ScaleMode.StretchToFill);
			GUI.Label(this.GetTextLabelRect(this.reqMsg, 0.5f, 0.3f), this.reqMsg);
			GUI.Label(this.GetTextLabelRect(this.reqNumLabel, 0.3f, 0.5f), this.reqNumLabel);
			GUI.Label(this.GetTextLabelRect(this.reqNum, 0.6f, 0.5f), this.reqNum);
			RectOffset padding = GUI.skin.button.padding;
			GUI.skin.button.padding = new RectOffset(20, 20, 10, 10);
			if (GUI.Button(this.GetButtonRect(this.finishLabel, 0.5f, 0.8f), this.finishLabel))
			{
				Application.Quit();
			}
		}
	}
</pre><p>This is the code used to display the splashscreen we encountered earlier. If the boolean property <code>this.m_isVerify</code>, presumably the result of a call to a function checking the existence and validity of a licence key, is <code>False</code> then, the screen is displayed with the message we saw earlier and the “request number”. The verification function and the generation of the request number are handled in another class <code>GameCus</code>:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting" id="applying-make-invalid-states-unrepresentable">
  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p><time itemprop="datePublished">02 October 2020</time></p>

<p>Here are some real life cases of applying one of my
<a href="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/articles/my-principles-for-building-software/">favourite principles</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll try to update this as I come across good examples.</p>

<h2 id="case-1-contiguous-time-periods">Case 1: Contiguous Time Periods</h2>

<p>A straightforward way to represent a period of time is by its start
and end dates (<code>(Date, Date)</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c1.png"></p>

<p>If we need to represent a timeline split in to contiguous periods, it
may be tempting to represent this as a sequence of periods (e.g. <code>List
(Date, Date)</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c2.png"></p>

<p>However, with this representation there can be both gaps in the
timeline and overlapping periods:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c3.png"></p>

<h3 id="improved-representation">Improved Representation</h3>

<p>We can improve this representation so that the contiguous and
non-overlapping constraints always hold, and we can do this in a way
that may remind you of database normalisation - by removing
redundancy.</p>

<p>In a well formed contiguous timeline, the joint start/end
of the adjacent periods are redundant. Contiguous, non-overlapping
splits can simply be represented by a set of dates (<code>Set Date</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/c4.png"></p>

<p>You can begin to see how this representation simplifies the system
when you consider how to make a further split in the timeline. In the
list representation, splitting a period requires carefully modifying
the data-structure and ensuring constraints aren’t violated. In the
‘set of dates’ representation you simply add a date to the set.</p>

<p>It is sometimes still useful to represent the periods as a sequence of
start and end dates. It is trivial to project the set of dates in to
this form. As long as the canonical representation is the set, the
constraints will still hold.</p>

<h2 id="case-2-default-contracts">Case 2: Default Contracts</h2>

<p>In this system, a customer pays us a recurring rent based upon a contract.
Contracts last for a fixed amount of time, and when they expire we fall back to
a ‘default contract’. The customer can have many fixed contracts, and can
sign new contracts at any time.</p>

<p>This was represented as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A ‘customers’ table storing
    <ul>
      <li>The customer start date.</li>
      <li>An optional end date, should the customer leave.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A ‘contracts’ table storing
    <ul>
      <li>The contract start date.</li>
      <li>An optional end date, for default contracts that don’t end.</li>
      <li>If it was a ‘fixed’ or ‘default’ contract.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f1.png"></p>
<p>Customer and contract timelines</p>

<p>This representation allows for some undesirable states that are trivial to prevent:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The customer may have gaps in their contracts.</li>
  <li>A fixed contract may not have an end date.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f2.png"></p>
<p>Contract gaps</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the API for these contracts allowed you to
modify each individual contract, fixed or default, without guarding against
these states. This shows how a poor choice of
representation propagates itself through the design of a system.</p>

<p>This poor choice was not just a theoretical problem -
gaps in contracts were found on more than one occasion, requiring
hours of engineering effort to hunt down and fix.</p>

<h3 id="improved-representation-1">Improved Representation</h3>

<p>This is easily improved by removing the ‘default’ contracts from the
contract table. If the customer doesn’t have a fixed contract, it is
assumed they are on a default contract:</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinmahoney.co.uk/img/articles/misu/f3.png"></p>
<p>Inferred default contracts</p>

<p>Now there can no longer be any gaps, and 
the end date of a contract no longer needs to be optional as it only represents fixed contracts.</p>

<p>It’s worth reiterating that this representation can be projected in to the previous
representation using a database view if that form is more convenient. What is
important is that the underlying representation enforces these constraints, it
is not important how you view the data.</p>

<p>As with the first case, a better representation makes the manipulation
of the data structure simpler. In this case, adding a new fixed contract is
greatly simplified. There is no need to create or modify default contracts, or ensure
that the contracts are contiguous.</p>

<h3 id="the-influence-of-object-oriented-thinking">The Influence of Object-Oriented Thinking</h3>

<p>If this improvement seems obvious to you, you may wonder how the
original design happened in the first place.</p>

<p>I think this happens because of atomistic, object-oriented thinking.</p>

<p>In this mindset, the fixed contracts are <em>objects</em>, the default contracts are
<em>objects</em>, and each of these concepts must be reified as a row in a table and
never inferred.
There is a distrust of using any features the database
offers beyond storing or retrieving <em>objects</em>.</p>

<p>This approach is antithetical to quality relational design and
the principle of making invalid states unrepresentable.</p>

<p>It may feel “simpler” on some level, as you don’t really need
to think about your design.
However, as we see here, this lack of forethought inevitably
leads to complexity.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://blog.steve.fi/writing_an_assembler_.html">Writing an assembler.</a></h2>
  <p>3 October 2020 13:00</p>
  <div><p>Recently I've been writing a couple of simple compilers, which take input in a particular format and generate assembly language output.  This output can then be piped through <code>gcc</code> to generate a native executable.</p>

<p>Public examples include this trivial <a href="https://github.com/skx/math-compiler" rel="nofollow">math compiler</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/skx/bfcc" rel="nofollow">brainfuck compiler</a>.</p>

<p>Of course there's always the nagging thought that relying upon <code>gcc</code> (or <code>nasm</code>) is a bit of a cheat.  So I wondered how hard is it to write an assembler?  Something that would take assembly-language program and generate a native (ELF) binary?</p>

<p>And the answer is "It isn't hard, it is just tedious".</p>

<p>I found <a href="https://github.com/vishen/go-x64-executable/" rel="nofollow">some code</a> to generate an ELF binary, and after that assembling simple instructions was pretty simple.  I remember from my assembly-language days that the encoding of instructions can be pretty much handled by tables, but I've not yet gone into that.</p>

<p>(Specifically there are instructions like "<code>add rax, rcx</code>", and the encoding specifies the source/destination registers - with different forms for various sized immediates.)</p>

<p>Anyway I hacked up a simple assembler, it can compile <code>a.out</code> from this input:</p>

<pre><code>.hello   DB "Hello, world\n"
.goodbye DB "Goodbye, world\n"

        mov rdx, 13        ;; write this many characters
        mov rcx, hello     ;; starting at the string
        mov rbx, 1         ;; output is STDOUT
        mov rax, 4         ;; sys_write
        int 0x80           ;; syscall

        mov rdx, 15        ;; write this many characters
        mov rcx, goodbye   ;; starting at the string
        mov rax, 4         ;; sys_write
        mov rbx, 1         ;; output is STDOUT
        int 0x80           ;; syscall


        xor rbx, rbx       ;; exit-code is 0
        xor rax, rax       ;; syscall will be 1 - so set to xero, then increase
        inc rax            ;;
        int 0x80           ;; syscall
</code></pre>

<p>The obvious omission is support for "JMP", "JMP_NZ", etc.  That's painful because jumps are encoded with relative offsets.  For the moment if you want to jump:</p>

<pre><code>        push foo     ; "jmp foo" - indirectly.
        ret

:bar
        nop          ; Nothing happens
        mov rbx,33   ; first syscall argument: exit code
        mov rax,1    ; system call number (sys_exit)
        int 0x80     ; call kernel

:foo
        push bar     ; "jmp bar" - indirectly.
        ret
</code></pre>

<p>I'll update to add some more instructions, and see if I can use it to handle the output I generate from a couple of other tools.  If so that's a win, if not then it was a fun learning experience:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/skx/assembler/" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/skx/assembler/</a></li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>Sofware dysfunction is more often motivated by anxiety, fear, worry and embarassment than it is by a lack of technical skill. Engineers avoid work that needs doing because they’re afraid of becoming entangled with a nightmarish task, or because they’re afraid of looking stupid, or harming their career by spending time on grungy work. The task itself is rarely that difficult; it just seems so, which is enough of a barrier to discourage anyone from picking it up. One of the highest-leverage things you can do as an engineer is to recognize this emotional reaction in yourself and work to counter it. If you’re working on a single task, doing this can make your implementation significantly cleaner. If you’re a senior engineer with responsibility for a whole system, this can help you address high-impact architectural or operational issues.</p>
<p>You can see this in the common advice to sleep on a problem and come back to it in the morning. A bug that seems impossible when you’re tired and frustrated is far more approachable when you’re well-rested and caffeinated. Tedious investigative tasks (like scanning the logs for a bug or tracing all the possible code paths in a function) are still tedious in the morning, but infinitely more doable. You can knock it out in half an hour while drinking your morning coffee, rather than spending hours the night before avoiding the tedious work and hoping for a flash of inspiration.</p>
<p>Necessary work avoided becomes a haunted forest in the codebase. One engineer’s avoidant emotions turn into dangerous team habits as engineers teach each other to avoid touching certain files, or to pass odd-looking production bugs to the operations team. “This network behaviour is dark magic, let them handle it!” What began as a single engineer’s worry is now a team’s dysfunction, and can eventually metastasize into actively blocking engineers from working on the original technical problems: if you’re avoiding working on a worrying problem, it can feel threatening when someone else comes along and tries to solve it. What if they succeed, or worse still succeed easily? That would reveal that you weren’t good enough to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Just because you’re touching a scary part of the system doesn’t mean you’re facing scary work calmly and rationally. Engineers often approach thorny work like they’re going through a haunted house: either trudging through with eyes half-closed, or rushing through at full speed trying to get out as quickly as possible. Both tactics aim to take in as little of the frightening environment as possible, and neither tactic is a good way of solving real problems in technical systems. If you’ve ever just tweaked setings or frantically moved code around until it worked, you’ve done this.</p>
<p>From the inside, this doesn’t feel like emotionally-driven avoidance. It feels like working on legacy code, sharing friendly complaints about it with other engineers on your team. This is in part because a fear of hard technical problems can be a rational fear. Untangling messy parts of the codebase, identifying and removing dead code, cleaning up build, deploy and monitoring systems - these tasks often feel overwhelming because they can overwhelm you, sucking up days for no real gain. It can harm your career to spend time on this work in an org that mainly values shipping features. (I haven’t seen the other common worry - looking stupid - really be an issue in practice myself.) The trouble comes when you don’t recognise that part of your response is emotional, and therefore overrate the actual difficulty or risk.</p>
<p>How can you distinguish a rational response to a too-difficult task from a learned emotional reaction to a task that is merely worrying? This is a hard problem. I think it is the hardest problem that almost all engineers will regularly face. One approach is to avoid trying to tell the difference at all, and allot a certain amount of time to looking at randomly-chosen neglected parts of the system. Things that reduce stress in general are also good ways to reduce stress and worry about work. Good sleep, eating well, exercise, therapy, and working in an emotionally safe team all have a significant positive effect on the quality of engineering work. Once you start doing this, the difference is usually obvious in hindsight: if the task that worried you for six months took an hour or two of work when you finally mustered up the effort to look at it, you know your worry was unfounded. Dealing with worry is a virtuous cycle. Each difficult task you do makes you less scared of the next one.</p>
<p>Tackling a series of worrying tasks is one of the quickest ways I know to have massive impact in your engineering org. This is because once you understand a thorny piece of code, or a neglected system, you will usually see how to make obvious improvements. In any other part of the system these improvements would have been made already, but since you are the first person to really wrap your head around it in a long time, you get to make them here! Occasionally, you will see the opportunity to completely remove the worrying part of the system, which for me is one of the most satisfying things you can do as a software engineer. Removing things that cause your team stress has compounding benefits to your team, to the systems you work on, and to your engineering org in general.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

<![CDATA[An Honest Review of Gatsby]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We decided to adopt Gatsby for <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/">Sentry’s customer-facing documentation</a> - well, I should say that <em>I</em> decided. We were already using it successfully for a variety of static marketing content, and I knew it had a lot of hype, so after a brief proof-of-concept it seemed like a safe choice.</p>
<p>To help contextualize everything I’m about to say, it’s important to understand the scope of our usage. Sentry’s documentation is not as straightforward as you might think - in fact, there are over 3,000 pages as of writing. We have a large amount of templated content designed to render language-specific examples, as well as a variety of different types of documentation (user guides, help desk-y articles, code-rich technical docs). Originally we had extended Jekyll to support a lot of this, but Ruby isn’t widely used at Sentry (approximately 0% of the engineering team knows Ruby), and it had become a big mess of spaghetti code with slow build times.</p>
<p>I also want to note that while this blog post is primarily focusing on the flaws of Gatsby as a framework, I’m not here to tell you that it’s not good for your use case. That said, I was not able to discover many of these short comings easily when evaluating Gatsby, and many things you read on the internet don’t stem out of real-world usage. My hope here is that Gatsby continues to improve over time, and that, as a user, you can be more informed about if it’s the right choice for you.</p>
<h2>Adopting Gatsby</h2>
<p>So, enter Gatsby. It seemed fast, was built on React (we’re experts on that here, with our gigabyte-sized Sentry frontend app), and had a huge adoption (assumed future existence and stability). While we didn’t have the desire to use MDX, it also seemed like a positive outcome given we could more easily deal with some of the rich aspects of our docs site, without having to resort to 2010-era JavaScript. We assumed a bunch of the other features of Gatsby had value-add, but we didn’t have an immediate need. These were things like dynamic source data - thus the need for a GraphQL engine at all - as well as the large plug-in ecosystem.</p>
<p>We started by iteratively converting sections of the Jekyll site into Gatsby - running them side by side for a time. At one point we eventually bulk converted pages, and ripped off the band aid. At this point though it was becoming clear build times were a problem. You’d spend at least 5 minutes on image optimization alone, with no way to even disable that. Slowly but surely we were depleting the ozone later on re-optimizing images which had already been pre-optimized. Oh yeah, and we were crippling our iteration speed as well, since the build cache would invalidate under a variety of situations in early development.</p>
<p>Making this worse was how we deployed Gatsby. We started off leveraging what we had already done: deploying Jekyll with Docker onto our own infrastructure - effectively just proxied via a CDN. We continued that for a period of time, but deploy times were far too long - upwards of 30-40 minutes for everything to build. Eventually we moved over to <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> which dropped it down closer to 10 minutes, but ultimately it can’t fix what it doesn’t control.</p>
<p>The build and deploy times were the first of many woes, and they represent what would become a continued frustration: a problem without a clear solution.</p>
<h2>Enter MDX</h2>
<p>Rewind time a little bit - this actually wasn’t our first project converting documentation to Gatsby. The proof-of-concept I mentioned earlier was actually our <a href="https://develop.sentry.dev/">developer documentation</a>, which I had migrated out of Notion to make public. While doing that we had gotten our hands dirty with some initial MDX usability and extensions - like our code samples which support toggling between different languages. This was one of the many things we needed to solve for, but MDX made it look like it’d be seemingly easy. No more jQuery DOM manipulation, just clean, encapsulated React components. Or so we thought.</p>
<p>Almost immediately we hit rough spots with MDX. We were coming from Jekyll - which was Liquid-rendered (a template engine) markdown - to MDX - a strange offspring of Markdown and JSX, attempting all of the benefits of both, but missing by a fairly large margin. Let’s illustrate the crux of the issue with what has got to be one of the most common needs in a documentation system: an alert (or callout) component:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>info<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>You should know something important about this!<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>At face value this looks great. <code>Alert</code> is just a React component, and JSX is close enough to HTML that non-technical folks are able to pick it up fairly easily. Now the problem comes into play when you actually want to do something in the real world. Here’s an example from our API docs:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>warning<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Note<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span><span>**</span><span>PUT/DELETE</span><span>**</span></span> methods only apply to updating/deleting issues.
Events in sentry are immutable and can only be deleted by deleting the whole issue.
<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>How would you expect this to render? Both as an engineer and a non-engineer, I would expect - given this is markdown - that the “PUT/DELETE” text would be bold. It’s not. Because the MDX interpreter decides that once you enter a component block, it’s no longer markdown. So instead, we’re forced with this monstrosity <em>everywhere</em> in our documentation:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>Alert</span> <span>level</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>warning<span>"</span></span> <span>title</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Note<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>markdown</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>**</span><span>PUT/DELETE</span><span>**</span></span> methods only apply to updating/deleting issues.
Events in sentry are immutable and can only be deleted by deleting the whole issue.

<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>markdown</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>Alert</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>There’s two things you should note here: 1) we have to use this <code>&lt;markdown&gt;</code> tag, 2) we have to put empty new-lines to ensure paragraph tags render.</p>
<p>“But David”, you might say, “why don’t you just tell the <code>Alert</code> component to render the text as markdown?“. If only you could, or at least, if only I could have possibly found a way to achieve that as a user with minimal Gatsby or MDX internals knowledge.</p>
<p>To Gatsby, or at least to the MDX team’s credit, they recognize some of these problems and <a href="https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/1041">there is work underway</a> on a 2.0 of the MDX dialect. While I’m confident they will improve things, I’m not confident MDX can ultimately succeed. It’s likely going to tradeoff one problem for another due to what it’s trying to achieve in the first place. It may get to a good place, but frankly, we need to step back and look at what we’re trying to solve, instead of creating a solution to a problem we don’t have. I don’t need JSX syntax in my markdown, I need a way to include JSX components. That might sound similar, but its quite a different thing.</p>
<p>As an example, there’s no reason I couldn’t simply use markdown syntax, and provide a way to achieve something akin to:</p>
<div data-language="markdown"><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>a-valid-html-tag-because-markdown-allows-that</span> <span>a-valid-property</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>a-value<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This wouldn’t force us to work around quirks in a new language (or interpreter even), and could be solved in a much more sustainable way. There are other alternatives as well. A generic way to render extensions in markdown could simply call into a React component, and avoid even trying to hijack HTML in the first place. While I don’t know what this might look like in Markdown, in <a href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html">Sphinx’s use of reStructuredText</a> this was solved early on with Directives:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>.. my-directive:: some data
   :property-name: property-value</code></pre></div>
<p>I will hold out for MDX 2.0 and hope that finds a nice minimal-compromise place, but if not, we’ll be looking for a way to extend native markdown.</p>
<h2>A Broken DOM</h2>
<p>While we were able to work around the kinks of MDX, there’s been some things not yet solved. One of those is the layer which Gatsby uses to apply diffs to the DOM. I’m going to caveat this section with <em>I don’t know what the technical implementation is</em>, but I can make some assumptions given what I know of the domain. The system itself is intended to apply deltas to the DOM. This is naively also how React works, and I imagine under the hood it’s relying on React at least for part of it. We’ve had issues with this identified in two places already:</p>
<ul>
<li>progressive image loading</li>
<li>dynamic JSX components</li>
</ul>
<p>While they might not be linked to the same issue, they smell like they are, so we’re going to roll with it. The problem exhibits itself when you have a bunch of DOM that to a naive robot might look the same:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>&lt;div&gt;foo&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;bar&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;baz&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;foobizbar&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>In React it uses the graph to identify which node is which - effectively creating a unique entity ID based on its location. In cases where that’s difficult, React will warn you to explicitly bind a <code>key</code> attribute on each element to ensure it can more accurately deal with updates. While I would assume Gatsby is at least partially using React’s DOM engine, what we see in production effectively takes the above example, and replaces some of the content with other subsets of content - meaning it’s unable to accurately identify which nodes need updated.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this where a progressive image is replaced with an entirely different image that’s present near it on the page. We’ve also seen this happen for a dynamically loaded section of content (our language-selector include tags). While we’ve yet to identify a fix for the image tags, our other issue was resolved by literally changing a <code>div</code> tag to a different tag, one which is less commonly used (in our case, <code>section</code>).</p>
<p>All of the cases happen after Gatsby’s initial static render and exist only when applying some form of delta.</p>
<h2>Let’s Talk GraphQL</h2>
<p>It’s a static website generator. It literally does not need GraphQL all over the place. While there are few instances in the real world where that is valuable, it shouldn’t require a GraphQL API to read objects that are already in memory.</p>
<p>I don’t want to spend the energy to hammer this in, but take a look at Jared Palmer’s <a href="https://jaredpalmer.com/gatsby-vs-nextjs">Gatsby vs. Next.js</a> as it echoes my thoughts.</p>
<p>So, let’s actually not talk about GraphQL, but all its done is create complexity for us.</p>
<h2>Minor Gripes</h2>
<p>There’s a number of other things we’ve found fairly frustrating at this point, but this post is already getting long, so I’m choosing to summarize them.</p></section></div>

    <section>
      <p>When the engineering managers I coach struggle to find ambitious goals, I sometimes leverage their ambitions to help them identify areas where they can improve. But, to my surprise, not so many EMs have ambitions beyond their current role.</p><p>When I had a “real job”, I was always driven by the next thing. I didn’t care about the title, but I always wanted more impact and responsibilities (in six years and two companies, I had seven different positions 😅). While I don’t recommend being as “opportunistic” as I was (but hey, I ended up being an entrepreneur), I do believe that thinking about the next position gives you <strong>perspective and makes you more in control of your career</strong>. But the difference between thinking about your next promotion and getting it is enormous. </p><p>Many engineers believe that if you do great work at your job, people will recognise that work and automatically give you an adequate promotion or raise. It is unfortunately far from reality, as <strong>those who get promoted, are not the best employees, but the more visible</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image.png 600w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image.png 900w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Dilbert.com</figcaption></figure><h3 id="visibility-matters"><strong>Visibility matters</strong></h3><p>Think about your CTO’s typical day (or the VP Engineering, the one who will eventually decide on your promotion). They might have eight to ten meetings to attend, tens of emails (or Slack messages) to answer and they always have to switch their mind to a different project or a new problem that needs to be solved. So, unless you’re involved in the problem du jour, the number of seconds the CTO is thinking about you in a day is about zero. Pretty normal right? The CTO is a busy gal and can’t think about every single team member. But if you’re serious about this promotion, <strong>she should hear about you often</strong>. </p><p>In an <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/katie-sylor-miller">interview with StaffEng</a>, Katie Sylor-Miller, a Frontend Architect at Etsy, says that “<em>a big part of being promoted [...] is making sure that your work is visible, that people know your name and you have a good reputation.</em>” I’m sure you’re thinking right now about OKRs, performance reviews, one-on-one(s) with your boss and all the other mechanisms in place at your company to make your work visible. Unfortunately, as rightly pointed out by <a href="https://defmacro.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">Slava Akhmechet</a>, a product manager at Stripe, they’re too often <strong>“social fiction”</strong>:</p><blockquote><em>Following the overt mechanisms of advancement is neither sufficient nor necessary. It may even be actively harmful - almost everyone who does great work and takes performance reviews seriously toils in relative obscurity. Look at the people who occupy positions of considerable authority in your organisation. Did any of them get there by following some middle manager's feedback?</em></blockquote><p>Instead of social fiction, I think the word “game” is more appropriate for the advancement system in most companies (and any human interactions by the way). Since I’m pretty sure you’ve spent countless hours like me playing video games (or still do 🎮), how do you win at video games? <strong>You game the system</strong>.</p><h3 id="understand-the-promotion-process-at-your-company"><strong>Understand the promotion process at your company</strong></h3><p>If you’re currently an engineering manager, any promotion from now on will make you part of your company’s leadership team. And, as pointed out by <a href="https://lethain.com/being-visible/">Will Larson</a>, “<em>existing members of that team want to be comfortable that they’re expanding their ranks with folks they believe in, and they can’t believe in you if they don’t know you.</em>”</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/image-1.png 600w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/10/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/10/image-1.png 1240w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>FangXianUo/iStock</figcaption></figure><p>As an engineering manager, you’re not contributing anymore to the codebase. You’re<strong> contributing to the company’s success</strong>. Managing your team is the means to get there, not the goal. More specifically, an engineering manager contributes to the company’s success by:</p><p><strong>1/ Attracting and retaining the very best engineers</strong>: like <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/07/25/hitting-the-high-notes/">Joel Spolsky</a>, I firmly believe that an organisation “<em>where the best software developers in the world would want to work [leads] to profits as naturally as chocolate leads to chubbiness.</em>” So even if there is a process in place to attract engineers, everyone in the company will thank you if you managed to score a high-profile recruit (while saving thousands in headhunter’s fees). Some tips for doing so:</p><ul><li><strong>Be recognised externally as an expert</strong> and someone great engineers would want to work with (blogging, speaking…)</li><li><strong>Continuously look for talent</strong>, especially visible ones (the ones who blog, speak, live code, contribute to open source…) and invite them for informal interviews</li><li><strong>Mentor external engineers</strong> pro-bono, even if they don’t end working for you, they sometimes have friends who might</li></ul><p><strong>2/ Shipping revenue-generating projects</strong>: for any company out there, technology is just the means to make more money. So which projects in your company right now have the highest revenue-generating potential? There are usually three or four such projects per year, so you need to make sure your team is involved in these projects, even if it means <strong>being proactive about it and not waiting for your manager to assign it to you</strong>. When I was an employee, I used to regularly crash meetings (or discussions at the coffee counter) and see if I could be useful to a project.</p><p><strong>3/ Proactively solving problems:</strong> I’m sure you’re the kind of person who always presents problems with a solution. What’s even better is for you to <strong>start solving the problem before your boss is even aware of it</strong>. CTOs have to make countless decisions every day, and they need to know they can count on leaders in their team to be proactive and make the right decisions for them. Obviously, this action shouldn't say hidden and you would have sent a message to the leadership with information about the problem, what your team is doing to solve it and a deadline.</p><h3 id="building-your-promotion-playbook">Building your promotion playbook</h3><p>When I was advising startups on fundraising, most of the work we were doing was building up a great story that would unroll during the roadshow (3 to 6 months). Getting promoted is not the same as fundraising, but the mechanism is similar:</p><p><strong>1/ Make your intentions known</strong>: promotion is a two-way street, and your management should be aware of your objectives, as well as you should be aware of what they’re expecting from someone who does your targeted job. Ideally, they should state clearly what you should be demonstrating to get the job so that you can show you’ve done it when the time is right.</p><p><strong>2/ Keep a log of your achievements and impact:</strong> start a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/">brag document</a> or a <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/promo-packets">promotion packet</a> that will be the base for any communication about your team’s accomplishments (especially the ones on high-impact projects).</p><p><strong>3/ Make it impossible for them to say no</strong>: when it’s promotion or review time, build a short presentation that shows factually how you achieved what the management expected of you and your team’s successes.</p><p>Keep in mind that <strong>the higher you go on the management ladder, the fewer positions are available</strong>. Sometimes you might want to make a lateral move at a smaller company to build up more responsibilities (like becoming CTO or VPE at a startup) before going back to a more mature company.</p><p>Last but not least, it’s essential to understand that while thinking about your next promotion should not be your main focus, <strong>it is part of your job</strong>. There are still way too many opportunistic leaders in technology organisations and not enough people like you. So please do me a favour, keep doing a great job AND get that promotion instead of all the opportunistic contenders 😉</p><hr><h3 id="news"><strong>News</strong></h3><p><em>This section is only available to email subscribers. <a href="https://www.tlt21.com/signup/">Sign up</a>, it's free!</em></p><hr><h3 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h3><ul><li>Thinking about getting promoted gives you perspective and makes you more in control of your career</li><li>Those who get promoted are not the best employees, but the more visible</li><li>To be more visible: attract high-level engineers, ship revenue-generating projects, proactively solve problems</li><li>Getting promoted is a 6-month process that resembles a fundraising roadshow</li></ul><h3 id="reading-list"><strong>Reading List</strong></h3><p>[RESOURCE] <a href="https://progression.monzo.com/techops"><strong>Progression at Monzo</strong></a> - Monzo</p><p>[ESSAY] <strong><a href="https://defmacro.substack.com/p/how-to-get-promoted">How to get promoted</a> </strong>- Slava Akhmechet</p><p>[ESSAY] <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-promotions/"><strong>Software Developer Promotions: Advice to Get to That Next Level</strong></a> - Gergely Orosz</p><p>[ESSAY] <a href="https://lethain.com/being-visible/"><strong>Being visible</strong></a> - Will Larson</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wikipage">

<p>People were arguing about Rust’s std lib recently, so I went through the <code>Cargo.toml</code> of all the Rust projects I’ve written since 2015 and picked out the choice tools that get used over and over again. Up to date as of October 2020.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/RustCrates" title="Go to wiki page">RustCrates</a>, though that’s old. There’s also <a href="https://christine.website/blog/rust-crates-go-stdlib-2020-09-27">this</a>, which is narrower but deeper, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust">awesome-rust</a>, which is shallower and broader, and the various <a href="https://www.arewewebyet.org/">more</a> <a href="https://arewegameyet.rs/">specific</a> <a href="https://areweasyncyet.rs/">websites</a> <a href="https://www.areweguiyet.com/">for various</a> <a href="https://areweideyet.com/">topics</a>.</p>

<p>I need to set up a new Rust dev environment, what do I install?</p>
<h2 id="linting-clippy">Linting – <code>clippy</code></h2>
<p>The one, the only, the great Rust style and correctness linter. Want to learn how to write “idiomatic” Rust, or just learn more about handy little corners of the language and library? Run <code>clippy</code> regularly. It’s distributed with the compiler via <code>rustup</code> now, so you have no excuse not to.</p>
<h2 id="build-cache-sccache">Build cache – <code>sccache</code></h2>
<p>Or, “how to make a full rebuild 70% faster”. <code>sccache</code> is a build artifact cache similar to <code>icecream</code> or <code>ccache</code>, except it’s actually trivial to just use. <code>cargo install sccache</code>, add a single line in a home dir config file, and you’re ready to go. Pretty much handles most crate and compiler versioning issues for you, so it Just Works if you update crates or install a new version of <code>rustc</code> or something. I think I’ve had to force-clear the cache due to some build weirdness a grand total of once. Looks like it has enough features to use in a professional context as well, at least on a small-to-medium scale.</p>
<h2 id="dependency-viewer-cargo-tree">Dependency viewer – <code>cargo-tree</code></h2>
<p>The best way to view what dependencies you are using, and what dependencies they are using, and so on. Best way to start cracking down on flabby dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarking-criterion">Benchmarking – <code>criterion</code></h2>
<p>Basically the best benchmark system out there. Incredibly simple to use, informative, and statistically sound. Doesn’t really do profiling, but it’s a good start for understanding your program’s performance, and better for proving that your implementation of X is faster than someone else’s.</p>
<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<p>Stuff that is less general purpose but occasionally very useful for the meta-programming process of choosing libraries, evaluating them, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo-geiger</code> – Measures how much unsafe code is in a codebase, and its dependencies</li>
<li><code>cargo-crev</code> – A <a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/ActuallyUsingCrev">very neat tool</a> for authoring and verifying distributed code reviews.</li>
<li>Various tools maintained by <a href="https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem">Embark Studios</a>, useful for production/company purposes like checking licenses, pinning specific versions of crates, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cool stuff Real Computer Scientists write about.</p>
<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>
<p>No specific crates here. There’s no single crate that provides All The Hash Algorithms, just lots of little ones that generally provide a single algorithm each. Just type the name of the algorithm you want into <code>crates.io</code> and you’ll get at least a couple options, choose the one with 8 million downloads or whatever. <code>sha2</code>, <code>md5</code>, <code>crc</code>, etc. Lots of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
<p>Same as the hashing category. Type <code>zip</code> or <code>bzip2</code> or whatever into crates.io and you’ll get what you need. <code>flate2</code> might be the one crate that’s not quite trivial to find. Again, many of them are written by the Rust core team.</p>
<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>
<p>I have little actual experience or authority on this topic, so I’m going to punt on this one.</p>
<h2 id="pseudorandom-number-generator">Pseudorandom number generator</h2>
<p>Use <code>oorandom</code>. (Disclaimer, I wrote <code>oorandom</code>, but people besides me seem to like it.) More usually you’ll see the <code>rand</code> crate in use. If you’re doing Real Science and need to generate <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.random.html">fancy probabilities</a>, then <code>rand</code> is the right tool, but most people aren’t doing that. Otherwise <code>rand</code> is complicated and has lots of features, while <code>oorandom</code> is very simple and has about two features, and I expect 80% of code to use at least one of them. <code>rand</code> has had several major breaking changes in its history that the rest of the ecosystem still hasn’t caught up with, while I intend <code>oorandom</code>’s API to change maybe twice in my lifetime. (Its version number, while obeying semver, is mostly a joke.)</p>
<p>There’s other lightweight PRNG crates that are just fine; see <code>oorandom</code>’s readme for a list of some others and choose one you like. Whatever you choose, use the <code>getrandom</code> crate to produce Real Random Seeds for it.</p>

<p>“I just need to solve this ooooooone common problem, but it needs to be solved WELL…”</p>
<h2 id="logging-log">Logging – <code>log</code></h2>
<p>Need to output log messages in your code? Why, use the <code>log</code> crate. Where do the log messages go? <code>log</code> provides only an interface, and that interface compiles to nothing if it isn’t used. You can write your own system for it to actually output the logs to, which is pretty easy, or use one of the small plethora of crates for it. My preferred one is <code>pretty_env_logger</code>, but <code>fern</code>, <code>slog</code> and others are all good too.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-data-crunching-rayon">Parallel data crunching – <code>rayon</code></h2>
<p>Ever have some computation where you have a big list of STUFF and want to process it in parallel, farming out jobs to as many threads as you have CPU’s? That’s what <code>rayon</code> does, and it does it really, really well. You still <a href="https://aspenuwu.me/posts/rust-optimization.html">have to know what you’re doing</a>, but changing a single <code>.iter()</code> into <code>.par_iter()</code> and watching your CPU-bound data-crunching run 8x faster is pretty magical. Now your CPU can help keep you warm this winter!</p>
<p>Please never use it in a library. It’s rude to spawn threads in library code, unless that’s specifically what the library is for.</p>
<h2 id="regexes-regex">Regexes – <code>regex</code></h2>
<p>To quote the inestimable <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/">jwz</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://xkcd.com/208/">somebody’s gotta save the day</a>. So, use the <code>regex</code> crate. Also use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep">anything else</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/xsv">written by BurntSushi</a>. BurntSushi is a paragon of Rust program design, and also just a great <del>human being</del> charred cuisine in general.</p>
<h2 id="threadsafe-globals-lazy_static">Threadsafe globals – <code>lazy_static</code></h2>
<p>“I know globals are evil,” you say, “but I just need one. I’ll only use it for good, I promise.” <code>lazy_static</code> has your back.</p>
<p>May eventually be superseded by <code>once_cell</code>, which looks like its <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2788">headed for inclusion into <code>std</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="serializationdeserialization-serde">Serialization/deserialization – <code>serde</code></h2>
<p>Ever have a struct and just wanted to turn it into JSON, CBOR, XML, or some other engine of woe and devastation designed to be written to an I/O stream? Or had a blob of random JSON and wanted to just stuff it into a struct matching it? Sure you have. <code>serde</code> lets you do this with a single <code>#[derive]</code>. <code>serde</code> is without a doubt one of Rust’s killer libraries. It is better than any other serialization system I have ever used.</p>
<p>What data formats does it support? Anything; the actual reading and writing is done via plugin library. There’s a <a href="https://serde.rs/#data-formats">wide selection of them</a>, of varying quality, and writing your own is a little tedious but not terribly difficult.</p>
<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>
<p>This spot deliberately left blank.</p>
<p>Rust’s <code>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</code> type is one of the best setups for lightweight, transparent error handling I’ve seen, but it doesn’t do everything. How do you easily write your own error type without a bunch of boilerplate? What if you have multiple different error types from different libraries you want to coalesce together? How do you collect a backtrace of every function an <code>Err</code> is returned through, so you can find the root cause of where it came from? Can we do all this without allocating anything unnecessarily? And so on.</p>
<p>There have been various crates to try to solve these problems. First in 2015 there was <code>error_chain</code>, which was complicated and not very convenient. Then in 2017 there was <code>failure</code>, which was simpler but not very flexible, and which took an irritatingly long time to compile. Then in 2019 there was <code>anyhow</code>, which was about the time I stopped paying attention. Now apparently the new kid on the block is <code>eyre</code>, and I’m sure that in another year or two there will be something else.</p>
<p>So, I just write the boilerplate and make my errors descriptive enough I don’t need a backtrace. When I want to get fancy I implement the built-in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html"><code>Error</code></a> trait, which used to be kinda useless but is now more helpful. And in another five years it’ll still work just fine.</p>
<h2 id="byte-mucking-bytemuck">Byte mucking – <code>bytemuck</code></h2>
<p>For the rare occasions you need to turn a structure into arbitrary <code>&amp;[u8]</code> or back. Doing this using unsafe pointers is quite easy, and also makes it very easy to screw up horribly with Undefined Behavior galore. (Did you know that changing the value of padding bytes in a struct in UB? You do now.) <code>bytemuck</code> lets you muck around with bytes a little more responsibly.</p>
<h2 id="human-dates-and-times-chrono">Human dates and times – <code>chrono</code></h2>
<p>Rust’s <code>std::time</code> doesn’t really handle calendar or wall-clock times, just arbitrary, monotonic <code>Instant</code>’s and measurable <code>Duration</code>’s between them. Nice, pure, computationally-robust time measurement. For all the nasty human calendar and timezone stuff, you use <code>chrono</code>. (And maybe <code>humantime</code>, but I personally reach for <code>chrono</code> first, just out of habit.)</p>
<h2 id="bit-flags-bitflags">Bit flags – <code>bitflags</code></h2>
<p>Defining type-safe bit-masks in a reasonably convenient way. Not always worth the trouble, but sometimes pretty convenient.</p>

<p>“I have to create or read a…”</p>
<h2 id="pngjpeggifetc-image">PNG/JPEG/GIF/etc – <code>image</code></h2>
<p>General-purpose loading and saving and images, which can handle a lot of formats. Can do some amount of image manipulation as well, such as cropping, smoothing, etc. but that will hopefully be pulled out into its own library at some point soon.</p>
<h2 id="small-data-things-uuid-base64-csv-semver">Small data THINGS – <code>uuid</code>, <code>base64</code>, <code>csv</code>, <code>semver</code>…</h2>
<p>Exactly what it says on the tin.</p>

<p>Not aware of any great encoders, but there’s plenty of <em>decoders</em> for common audio formats. <code>lewton</code> for Ogg Vorbis, <code>hound</code> for .wav, <code>minimp3</code> for MP3, <code>claxon</code> for FLAC. Video, I haven’t used enough to have an opinion on.</p>
<h2 id="config-files-toml">Config files – <code>toml</code></h2>
<p>For all your config file format needs. Works with <code>serde</code>, naturally.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-pulldown-cmark">Markdown – <code>pulldown-cmark</code></h2>
<p>There’s several good Markdown readers and writers, <code>pulldown-cmark</code> is my favorite. It supports CommonMark, it’s simple to use, and it’s pure Rust.</p>
<h2 id="templating-askama">Templating – <code>askama</code></h2>
<p>There’s several quite good text templating engines, but <code>askama</code> IMO rises above them all by compiling your templates into Rust code and type-checking your templates at compile time. Sometimes this isn’t what you want, but it is a great feature surprisingly often. This also makes it super fast, for when you really need to …</p></div></div>

        <article>
    

    <p>I’ve always been fascinated by CPython and C language companionship.
On the one hand, we’ve got a comprehensive and straightforward tool, and on the other — 
performant and low-level one. I’d even say that this synergy is one of the main 
pillars that have led to Python’s widespread success nowadays.</p>

<p>However, as an infrequent user of C, I never fully realized how this combination works.
The more I used it, the more questions popped out:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How CPython calls binary executables and what is an ABI?</li>
  <li>Why ctypes and other FFI tools are slower than using C extensions?</li>
  <li>Why it’s not possible to call C++ library?</li>
</ul>

<p>I had no other choice but to take it all apart and look inside.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of the examples in this article are written in C.
That said, even despite I thoroughly explain all the topics,
<strong>I presume a reader is somewhat familiar with C/C++</strong> and compiled languages.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Let’s start with an exploration of binary executables.</p>

<p>CPUs speak in so-called <strong>machine code</strong> — low-level instructions
that operate directly over CPU memory, registers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit">Arithmetic logic unit</a>, etc.
A naive assumption would be that executables are just a list of such instructions for CPU to run.
Well, that’s not the case.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://azhpushkin.me/assets/images/python_c_abi/compiled_and_cpu.jpg" alt="Not happening.">
    
    <figcaption>Not happening.</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Compilers generate executable files according to standardized binary file formats.
Such files contain machine code, structured in a certain way,
and wrapped with a plethora of additional metadata.</p>

<p>Operating systems rely heavily on this metadata to determine how binary files should be used.
Because of that, each operating system features some exact format to work with.
Among the most popular ones are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ELF</strong> (Executable and Linkable Format), used by most of Linux distros</li>
  <li><strong>PE</strong> (Portable Executable), used by Windows</li>
  <li><strong>Mach-O</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_(kernel)">Mach</a> object), used by Apple products</li>
</ul>

<p>As a Linux user, I’m using ELF throughout the article.
However, general ideas hold for other systems as well. 
I can also recommend looking at
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/631631/">“How programs get run: ELF binaries”</a>
if you want to learn more about execution flow.</p>

<p>Worth mentioning, even though each OS works with a specific file format,
it does not mean that running others is impossible.
It’s just a matter of parsing and executing machine code correctly.
<a href="https://www.winehq.org/">The Wine project</a> is a perfect example:
it’s a platform that runs PE files (Windows default format) on systems
without native PE support.</p>

<hr color="#dddddd">

<p>We are going to peek into ELF for a moment.
Meet our test subject:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// basics/dullmath.c</span>
<span>int</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>&lt;=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>n</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>return</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>-</span><span>2</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>float</span> <span>get_pi</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span><span>return</span> <span>3</span><span>.</span><span>14</span><span>;}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To use this code from other programs, we need to compile it to the so-called
shared library.</p>

<p><strong>Shared library</strong> (or <strong>shared object</strong>) is an executable binary file intended to
be used by other programs. We compile it once and simply <em>link</em> other programs against it.
Hence the name <em>shared</em> — everyone is using the same binary file.
Besides, there is no need for the <code>main</code> function
as the library is not designed to run standalone.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span># Note the naming convention: `lib&lt;name&gt;.so`</span>
<span>$ </span>gcc <span>-shared</span> <span>-fPIC</span> dullmath.c <span>-o</span> libdullmath.so
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The resulting <code>libdullmath.so</code> is an ELF file.
Note <code>-fPIC</code> compiler argument: it makes machine code
<a href="https://azhpushkin.me/posts/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code">position-independent</a>. This ensures that
the library operates correctly regardless of the memory position, where it is loaded.
You can refer to <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/08/25/load-time-relocation-of-shared-libraries/">“Load-time relocation of shared libraries”</a>
and <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/11/03/position-independent-code-pic-in-shared-libraries/">“Position Independent Code (PIC) in shared libraries”</a> articles for a thorough examination.</p>

<p>Each ELF file contains a list of <strong>symbolic references</strong> (or just <strong>symbols</strong>).
Symbols are used to identify individual machine code sections by names.
We can look at those with a <code>readelf</code> tool to verify that our functions are available:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ readelf -D --symbols libdullmath.so | grep FUNC | grep GLOBAL
  5   1: 0000000000001109    74 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  11 fibonacci
  6   1: 0000000000001153    14 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  11 get_pi
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We also need to make our library visible to our programs. An easiest way to do so
is to copy it to <code>/usr/lib/</code> - default system-wide directory for libraries.</p>

<p>If you’d rather not mess with sudo or system-wide directories, you may as well use 
<code>LIBRARY_PATH</code> and <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> environment variables.
Both add a given path to the list of lookup directories.
<code>LIBRARY_PATH</code> is used by gcc during the compilation, and
<code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> is used by OS at runtime (gcc doesn’t bind location of shared object,
so there is a separate lookup at runtime).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span># Copy to system default location</span>
<span>$ </span><span>sudo cp </span>libdullmath.so /usr/lib/  
<span>$ </span>
<span>$ </span><span># Or use environment variables</span>
<span>$ </span><span>export </span><span>LIBRARY_PATH</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>pwd</span><span>)</span>    <span># add to compilation scope</span>
<span>$ </span><span>export </span><span>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>pwd</span><span>)</span> <span># add to runtime scope</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All the ways of calling C from Python are based on compiling a shared library
and loading it from Python.
So if you don’t feel very familiar with shared libraries, I highly recommend
tinkering around with them for a little. <a href="https://amir.rachum.com/blog/2016/09/17/shared-libraries/">“Shared Libraries: Understanding Dynamic Loading”</a> is a great starting point.</p>



<p>With the shared object compiled, we are ready to call it.</p>

<p>I consider <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html">ctypes</a> to be the easiest way to execute some C code, because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it’s included in the standard library,</li>
  <li>writing a wrapper uses plain Python.</li>
</ul>

<p>Latter makes ctypes an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface"><strong>Foreign Function Interface (FFI)</strong></a> for Python.
This is a general name for a mechanism by which you can write code in one programming language
to run another. One that you write is called the <strong>host</strong> language, one that
you execute — the <strong>guest</strong>. In our case, the host is Python, the guest is C.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> import ctypes
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span># note: ctypes require a path to file, not library name</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib <span>=</span> ctypes.CDLL<span>(</span>f<span>'/usr/lib/libdullmath.so'</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> 
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.get_pi
&lt;_FuncPtr object at 0x7f3671537b80&gt;
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.fibonacci
&lt;_FuncPtr object at 0x7f3671537700&gt;
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.other_function   <span># wrong names are not found</span>
Traceback <span>(</span>most recent call last<span>)</span>:
  File <span>"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line 1, <span>in</span> &lt;module&gt;
  File <span>"/usr/lib/python3.8/ctypes/__init__.py"</span>, line 386, <span>in </span>__getattr__
    func <span>=</span> self.__getitem__<span>(</span>name<span>)</span>
  File <span>"/usr/lib/python3.8/ctypes/__init__.py"</span>, line 391, <span>in </span>__getitem__
    func <span>=</span> self._FuncPtr<span>((</span>name_or_ordinal, self<span>))</span>
AttributeError: /home/.../libdullmath.so: undefined symbol: other_function</code></pre></figure>

<p>All as expected: ctypes uses symbols to find functions, and invalid symbols
usage raises an undefined symbol exception.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>[</span>lib.fibonacci<span>(</span>i<span>)</span> <span>for </span>i <span>in </span>range<span>(</span>7<span>)]</span>
<span>[</span>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.get_pi<span>()</span>
0
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Yikes! What happened to <code>get_pi()</code>?</p>

<p>Well, to call the function correctly, we need to know the type signature of that function.
ELF does not carry types information, so we need to provide them manually.</p>

<p>ctypes allows this by declaring <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#specifying-the-required-argument-types-function-prototypes">function argument types</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#return-types">return types</a>. Default return type is considered <code>c_int</code>, so that did work out-of-the-box for <code>fibonacci</code> and did not for <code>get_pi</code>.</p>

<p>Easy fix.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.get_pi.restype <span>=</span> ctypes.c_float
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.get_pi<span>()</span>
3.140000104904175
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The exciting part starts once you try to compile this code as a C++ library.
This is an <em>easy way to break this demo down</em>.
As I pointed out at the start of an article, ctypes doesn’t support C++ libraries.
Even though this simple piece of code is perfectly valid as both C and C++.</p>

<p>Check this out:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>g++ <span>-shared</span> dullmath.c <span>-o</span> libdullmath.so  <span># just swap gcc to g++</span>
<span>$ </span>python
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> import ctypes
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib <span>=</span> ctypes.CDLL<span>(</span>f<span>'./libdullmath.so'</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> lib.fibonacci
Traceback <span>(</span>most recent call last<span>)</span>:
  File <span>"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line 1, <span>in</span> &lt;module&gt;
  File <span>"/usr/lib/python3.8/ctypes/__init__.py"</span>, line 386, <span>in </span>__getattr__
    func <span>=</span> self.__getitem__<span>(</span>name<span>)</span>
  File <span>"/usr/lib/python3.8/ctypes/__init__.py"</span>, line 391, <span>in </span>__getitem__
    func <span>=</span> self._FuncPtr<span>((</span>name_or_ordinal, self<span>))</span>
AttributeError: /home/.../libdullmath.so: undefined symbol: fibonacci
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To discover why it is so, we need to take a closer look at
machine code, packed inside the generated binary.</p>



<p>As we have found out in the previous chapter, we need to know type signatures
to use a shared library properly. In fact, we need to know much more —
we need to understand an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface"><strong>Application Binary Interface (ABI)</strong></a> of compiled machine code.</p>

<p>An ABI is similar to an API, but on a much lower level. 
ABI could be described as a set of rules that define how 
certain compiled machine code works. One of the most important and 
illustrative parts of ABI is a calling convention.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention"><strong>Calling concention</strong></a> defines low-level rules of a function call.
For instance, it defines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>where arguments and return values are stored,</li>
  <li>what is the ordering of arguments,</li>
  <li>who is responsible for cleaning up after function return,</li>
  <li>and many, many more.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#List_of_x86_calling_conventions">this Wiki comparison</a> to see that there are
plenty of different conventions, each with its own nuances and pitfalls. 
And this is just a tiny part of the binary interface.</p>

<p>I believe a good analogy to understand ABI is to imagine a <strong>jigsaw puzzle</strong>.
Each function is a piece. Each piece has a different form, just like
functions have different type signatures. The whole program is a finished puzzle.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://azhpushkin.me/assets/images/python_c_abi/abi_intro.jpg" alt="">
    
</figure>

<p>Compilers are the ones who take care of ABI.
They generate machine code accordingly to specific rules and ensure
it is coherent. Thus, all function calls, memory layout rules, and other details
in generated executable work in the same way.</p>

<p>Check out this example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>// example.c</span>
<span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</span> 
<span>int</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>);</span>

<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>printf</span><span>(</span><span>"10th fibonacci number is %d</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>,</span> <span>fibonacci</span><span>(</span><span>10</span><span>));</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>gcc <span>-c</span> example.c <span>-o</span> example.o
<span>$ </span>gcc example.o <span>-ldullmath</span> <span>-o</span> example
<span>$ </span>./example
10th fibonacci number is 55
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>During the library compilation, GCC created machine code for fibonacci 
according to certain conventions. Then, it produced matching callee machine code
for <code>example.o</code>. As we used one and the same compiler, the same ABI was applied,
and the binaries matched.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://azhpushkin.me/assets/images/python_c_abi/callee_and_caller.jpg" alt="">
    
</figure>

<p>But what if we use different compilers?</p>

<hr color="#dddddd">

<p>The bad news is that <strong>there is no standardized ABI neither for C++ nor for C</strong>. Different compilers, or even <em>different versions of the same compiler</em>, can …</p></article></div></div></div>

The Question

<p>
A recent homework problem had us derive the parallel plate
capacitor<sup><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> equation for electrostatics. This gives the
capacitance of a parallel plate structure in terms of the plate area,
distance between the plates and relative permittivity. The equation

After solving this problem for the analytical solution, I was curious
to see how closely the result matched a 3D field solver. Using the
Capacitance Extraction mode in Cadence 3D Workbench, I designed a
parametric model of the parallel plate capacitor with variable edge
length, distance and dielectric constant (See image above for the
model). Dk<sup><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> was varied but the complex component (dissipation factor)
was set to zero to ignore any dielectric losses. The edges were swept
at lengths of 0.1 inch, 1 inch and 10 inch. The distance was swept
with values of 1mil, 10mil and 100mil. Finally, the dielectric
constant was swept with values of 1, 10 and 100. This resulted in 27
unique cases, and the analytical result was compared to the extracted
result in each case.

Results Analysis
</h2>
<p>
There are two interesting takeaways from the results. First, we see
much higher error when the area is not significantly larger than the
dielectric height. This is expected because the field solver will
correctly solve the fringe fields along the edges of the structure,
while the equation is only valid when $A &gt;&gt; d$. These fringe fields
result in a computed capacitance which is always higher than the
equation-based formula. The reason we see more accuracy with smaller
dielectric thickness is that the fringe fields do not extend very far
laterally from the structure in that case.  
</p>
<p>
The second major takeaway is that we see much better agreement between
simulation and equation when the dielectric constant is higher. The
better agreement here is likely due to the fact that the absolute
value of the capacitance is much higher, therefore an error of a few
$pF$ is still a smaller percentage variation.

Update (Oct. 4, 2020)
</h2>
<p>
I had a quick chance to investigate the electric field intensity
vectors while varying the dielectric constant. Below are cutaway plots
showing the electric field intensity within both the dielectric
material and surrounding air. Note that the scale is kept the same on
both plots for easier comparison.
</p>
<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/cap_field_dk1.png">

<figure><a href="https://shielddigitaldesign.com/images/post/2020/cap_field_dk100.png">

            <p><em>Figure 3. Fringe electric field, $Dk = 100$.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
One interesting feature seen from this comparison is that the field
intensity within the dielectric material is much stronger for lower
Dk. This makes perfect sense; in reference <sup><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>, we see that the
electric field magnitude can be represented using Gauss's Law<sup><a id="footnote-reference-3" href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup> as:
</p>
<p>
$
E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}
$
</p>
<p>
Thus, reducing Dk will increase the electric field intensity. The
direction of the field can be seen as normal to the conductors, even
wrapping around the conductor edges. Since the effective Dk at the
edge is lower in Figure 2, the field intensity is higher out to a
further distance. What are the practical implications of this
characteristic? We know that in nearly all cases, lower Dk is
better since we can use wider traces for a given dielectric thickness
(resulting in lower skin effect losses).<sup><a id="footnote-reference-4" href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup> It also helps with
crosstalk since there will be lower capacitive coupling. Lastly, since
the flight time of a signal is inversely proportional to the square
root of Dk, a lower Dk will result in a longer flight time (in
$\frac{ps}{inch}$). This means that if you have to match two traces to
within a certain flight time, the physical trace length mismatch is
more forgiving with lower Dk material.
</p>
<p>
When would we want a higher Dk material? I can think of one very
important situation: power and ground planes. We can improve the
design of the power distribution network (PDN) with higher Dk
material, as well as using the thinnest dielectric possible between
these planes. In addition to increasing the capacitance of the PDN,
this arrangement will also reduce the inductance which will help with
ground bounce and extend the effective frequency range of the PDN. 
</p>
<p>
So, what can be done to reduce fringing fields along the edges of
PCBs? The 20H rule was once touted as a method of reducing these
fields. I believe one of the origins of the 20H rule may be this<sup><a id="footnote-reference-5" href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup>
set of guidelines (see the 7th bullet point). While this study did not
look into the effects of the 20H rule, many authors consider the 20H
rule to be a bit of a myth which has been confirmed by research.<sup><a id="footnote-reference-6" href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup>
Whether or not the power planes are recessed, I have always considered
an edge fence of ground vias to be an effective way to suppress fringe
fields around a board. Sounds like a great topic for follow-up
investigation!

<p><em>Hacker spirit.</em> Nowadays, the word “hacker” conjures up visions of
Russian trolls, Julian Assange, and Angelina Jolie’s 90s pixie cut.
But a nobler usage predates this.
Hacker culture, in the original sense, grew out of places like MIT
in the 60s, with its tradition of highbrow silliness and elaborate technical pranks.
Although associated with programming, hacker spirit can be viewed as
a broader ethos about play, understanding and creativity.
In the words of open-source gnuru Richard Stallman,</p>

<p><span>
What [hackers] had in common was a love of excellence and
programming. They wanted to make the programs that they used be as
good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They
wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone
believed possible and show ‘Look how wonderful this is. I bet you
didn’t believe this could be done.’
</span></p>

<p>Using techniques in a clever or unexpected way is a <em>hack</em>, with <em>hack
value</em> quantifying the degree of ingenuity. (“Hack” is actually a
back-formation of “hack value”.)
Hackers do not look for the most powerful, or obvious, or easy tool
for the job.
They delight in the unexpected, in using humble means to achieve
extraordinary ends.
In a way, they realise David Deutsch’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity">definition</a>
of knowledge as
<em>information with causal power</em>.
Knowing a technique well enough to hack it means you can act on the world in new ways.</p>

<p>I think physics needs more hacker spirit: more people willing to fool
around and explore what our marvellous toolset can do, to creatively
defy expectations and push the Deutschian envelope.
Physics is not withouts its hackers but unlike computer
science, the hackers are colourful exceptions, tending towards
goofy irreverence and self-mythology
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_feynman">Richard Feynman</a>
springs to mind).
I think hacking should go mainstream.</p>

<p><em>Napkin hacks.</em> My goal in this post is to outline a few simple hacks
for the back of a napkin.
I think of these as algorithms for a napkin computer, and with some
practice, they really
can be implemented using high school algebra on a small piece of
paper, without calculus or calculators (though the latter save
time).
While there is whimsy and irreverence aplenty, our focus will be
<em>real physics</em>.
Our goal will be a beautiful proof of the existence of atoms, due to
none other than Albert Einstein, the greatest physics hacker of all.
Another running theme is rain, a tribute to my rainy city of residence,
Vancouver.</p>

<p>Hackery is not just about excellence and creativity for their own
sake, but has clear pedagogical implications.
Most people have to wait until grad school to compute viscous drag, estimate
urban power usage, or determine the size of the E. coli genome.
But imagine a world where high school students are so empowered that,
given a few hints, a pencil, and a napkin, they could discover it all
themselves.
This world is very close to ours: all we need is a little more hacker
spirit in the enjoyment and instruction of physics.</p>

<p><em>Notes.</em> This post really consists of three distinct tutorials.
The <a href="#sec-2">dimensional analysis tutorial</a> and <a href="#sec-3">section on Fermi estimates</a> can be
read independently. The <a href="#sec-4">last tutorial</a> on random
walks assumes you have read the dimensional analysis section.
The exercises are just as important as the text, but only the results
of <a href="#sec-2-3">Exercise 3</a>
and <a href="#sec-4-2">Exercise 14</a> are used subsequently.
Solutions, and various other technicalities, are collected
<a href="https://hapax.github.io/assets/napkin-hacks-appendix">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2-dimensional-analysis-">2. Dimensional analysis <a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a></h2>

<p>We will start with one of the most powerful but underappreciated tools in
physics: <em>dimensional analysis</em>.
Physics is ultimately about experimental measurements.
Take some object, maybe an old pumpkin, and poke or prod it with a
measuring device.
The device returns a number, but that’s now what interests us;
instead, we want to know the <em>physical property</em> probed by that
device.
This is what we mean by <em>dimension</em>.
For instance, if we compare the width of the pumpkin to a ruler, the
dimension is the length, if we put it on some scales it’s the mass,
and if we time how long it takes to rot, the dimension is time.</p>

<p>We denote the dimension of length by $L$, time by $T$ and mass by
$M$.
We use brackets $[\cdot]$ to refer to the dimension of a measurement.
It’s easy when the measurement is given in some units, since we can
throw away the numbers and just ask: what aspect does the unit measure?
For instance,</p><p>

\[[20 \text{ cm}] = [\text{cm}]  = L, \quad [5 \text{ lb}]
=[\text{lb}] = M, \quad \quad [2 \text{ days}] =[\text{days}] = T.\]

</p><p>Centimetres measure length,
hours measure time, and pounds measure mass.
More complicated dimensions follow from the basic ones according to
simple rules which are easier to show than tell.
Area, for example, has dimensions $L^2$:</p><p>

\[[1 \text{ cm}^2] = [\text{cm}^2] = [\text{cm}]^2.\]

</p><p>An alternative to units is using general formulas, e.g. for the area of a rectangle:</p><p>

\[[\text{area}] = [\text{width}\times \text{height}] = [\text{width}]
\times [\text{height}] = L^2.\]

</p><p>Dimensions can be divided as well as multiplied:</p><p>

\[[\text{velocity}] = \left[\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}\right] =
\frac{[\text{distance}]}{[\text{time}]} = \frac{L}{T}.\]

</p><p>Be careful: only measurements with the same dimensions can
be added and subtracted.
For instance, it makes no sense to ask what “$1$ cm + $4$ hours” is,
though it <em>is</em> sensible to compute “$1$ cm + $4$ feet”.</p>

<p>Physical laws tell us how measurements depend
on each other.
For example, Newton’s second law $F = ma$ tells us how measurements of
force, mass and acceleration are related.
If the two sides of $F = ma$ are equal, the dimensions must agree,
with</p><p>

\[[F] = [m a] = [m]\times \left[\frac{v}{t}\right] = \frac{ML}{T^2}.\]

</p><p>The point of dimensional analysis is that you can sometimes <em>reverse</em>
this process, and determine the physical laws from dimensions!
Let’s see how.</p>

<h3 id="21-pendulous-pumpkins-">2.1. Pendulous pumpkins <a id="sec-2-1" name="sec-2-1"></a></h3>

<p>Suppose we attach an old pumpkin to a length of string and give it a
kick.
Gravity will pull on the pumpkin, causing it to oscillate back and
forth with some period of oscillation $t$.
If we know how the period of oscillation depends on other properties
of the system, we can utilise this knowledge to make a pumpkin clock!
Let’s start by listing some relevant quantities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the mass of the pumpkin $m$, with dimension $[m] = M$;</li>
  <li>the length of the string $\ell$, dimension $[\ell] = L$;</li>
  <li>gravitational acceleration $g = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$, dimension $[g] =
LT^{-2}$ (from the units);</li>
  <li>the initial displacement of the pumpkin $x$, dimension $[x] = L$.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
    <div><p><img src="https://hapax.github.io/images/posts/hacker3.png" width="30%"></p><figcaption><i>Physical features of the pendulous pumpkin.</i></figcaption>
	</div>
	</figure>

<p>Not all of these quantities will turn out to be relevant.
Galileo discovered that as long as the initial kick is
small, it has no affect on the period: pendulums are “isochronic”.
Grab a pumpkin, stopwatch and string, and check for yourself!
Galileo realised he could exploit this property to make a reliable
timepiece, and invented the pendulum clock.
(There is actually a deep physical reason pendulums are isochronic for
small kicks, but we will have to leave that for another time!)</p>

<p>In terms of relevant features, this leaves the pumpkin mass $m$, string length $\ell$, and gravity $g$.
You can also eliminate the pumpkin mass empirically, but as we’ll see,
we can leave it in and let dimensional analysis <em>tell us</em> it’s irrelevant.
At this point, I’m going to do something a bit sneaky.
Instead of period $t$, we will deal with the <em>angular velocity</em></p><p>

\[\omega = \frac{2\pi}{t}.\]

</p><p>(We will explain another way to get factors of $2\pi$ in Exercise 4.)
Dimensional analysis is nothing fancier than guessing that $\omega$ is related to $m$,
$\ell$ and $g$ by a relation of the form</p><p>

\[\omega = m^a \ell^b g^c,\]

</p><p>for some numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$.
Our goal is to figure out what these numbers are.
We can find the powers by matching dimensions on each side:</p><p>

\[\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{T} = [\omega] = [m^a \ell^c g^c] = \frac{M^aL^{b+c}}{T^{2c}}.
\end{align*}\]

</p><p>Requiring the leftmost and rightmost expressions to be equal, we can immediately read off the powers:</p><p>

\[a = 0, \quad 2c = 1, \quad b + c = 0 \quad \Longrightarrow \quad a =
0, \quad c = -b = \frac{1}{2}.\]

</p><p>As promised, dimensional analysis kindly informs us that the mass
is irrelevant!
My earlier piece of sneakiness (replacing period with angular
velocity) actually gives the exact answer for small kicks:</p><p>

\[\omega = m^a \ell^b g^c =  \sqrt{\frac{g}{\ell}}.\]

</p><p>We didn’t need to solve a differential equation, analyse forces, or even deal with numbers.
Dimensional analysis let us skip straight to the answer!</p>

<p>Suppose we want to make a pumpkin clock with the conventional
grandfather-clock period of $t = 2 \text{
s}$, so that each half swing takes
one second.
Then we should suspend the old pumpkin from a string of length</p><p>

\[\ell = \frac{g}{\omega^2} = \frac{g t^2}{(2\pi)^2} = \frac{9.8 \text{
m}}{\pi^2} \approx 1
\text{ m}.\]

</p><p>Incidentally, this explains why grandfather clocks are so large.
They will house a large (typically non-curcurbitar) pendulum with
$\ell \approx 1$ m.</p>

<p>In order to make the clock, we need a ruler to measure out the length
of string.
But for maximal whimsy, we can switch things up, and turn a stopwatch,
pumpkin and spool into a ruler!
Measure with the string and snip off the corresponding length, attach
the pumpkin and gently wobble.

<p>This document is a set of guidelines for using C++ well.
The aim of this document is to help people to use modern C++ effectively.
By “modern C++” we mean effective use of the ISO C++ standard (currently C++17, but almost all of our recommendations also apply to C++14 and C++11).
In other words, what would you like your code to look like in 5 years’ time, given that you can start now? In 10 years’ time?</p>

<p>The guidelines are focused on relatively high-level issues, such as interfaces, resource management, memory management, and concurrency.
Such rules affect application architecture and library design.
Following the rules will lead to code that is statically type safe, has no resource leaks, and catches many more programming logic errors than is common in code today.
And it will run fast – you can afford to do things right.</p>

<p>We are less concerned with low-level issues, such as naming conventions and indentation style.
However, no topic that can help a programmer is out of bounds.</p>

<p>Our initial set of rules emphasizes safety (of various forms) and simplicity.
They may very well be too strict.
We expect to have to introduce more exceptions to better accommodate real-world needs.
We also need more rules.</p>

<p>You will find some of the rules contrary to your expectations or even contrary to your experience.
If we haven’t suggested you change your coding style in any way, we have failed!
Please try to verify or disprove rules!
In particular, we’d really like to have some of our rules backed up with measurements or better examples.</p>

<p>You will find some of the rules obvious or even trivial.
Please remember that one purpose of a guideline is to help someone who is less experienced or coming from a different background or language to get up to speed.</p>

<p>Many of the rules are designed to be supported by an analysis tool.
Violations of rules will be flagged with references (or links) to the relevant rule.
We do not expect you to memorize all the rules before trying to write code.
One way of thinking about these guidelines is as a specification for tools that happens to be readable by humans.</p>

<p>The rules are meant for gradual introduction into a code base.
We plan to build tools for that and hope others will too.</p>

<p>Comments and suggestions for improvements are most welcome.
We plan to modify and extend this document as our understanding improves and the language and the set of available libraries improve.</p>



<p>This is a set of core guidelines for modern C++ (currently C++17) taking likely future enhancements and ISO Technical Specifications (TSs) into account.
The aim is to help C++ programmers to write simpler, more efficient, more maintainable code.</p>

<p>All C++ programmers. This includes <a href="#S-cpl">programmers who might consider C</a>.</p>

<h2 id="inaims-aims"><a name="SS-aims"></a>In.aims: Aims</h2>

<p>The purpose of this document is to help developers to adopt modern C++ (currently C++17) and to achieve a more uniform style across code bases.</p>

<p>We do not suffer the delusion that every one of these rules can be effectively applied to every code base. Upgrading old systems is hard. However, we do believe that a program that uses a rule is less error-prone and more maintainable than one that does not. Often, rules also lead to faster/easier initial development.
As far as we can tell, these rules lead to code that performs as well or better than older, more conventional techniques; they are meant to follow the zero-overhead principle (“what you don’t use, you don’t pay for” or “when you use an abstraction mechanism appropriately, you get at least as good performance as if you had handcoded using lower-level language constructs”).
Consider these rules ideals for new code, opportunities to exploit when working on older code, and try to approximate these ideals as closely as feasible.
Remember:</p>

<h3 id="in0-dont-panic"><a name="R0"></a>In.0: Don’t panic!</h3>

<p>Take the time to understand the implications of a guideline rule on your program.</p>

<p>These guidelines are designed according to the “subset of superset” principle (<a href="#Stroustrup05">Stroustrup05</a>).
They do not simply define a subset of C++ to be used (for reliability, safety, performance, or whatever).
Instead, they strongly recommend the use of a few simple “extensions” (<a href="#S-gsl">library components</a>)
that make the use of the most error-prone features of C++ redundant, so that they can be banned (in our set of rules).</p>

<p>The rules emphasize static type safety and resource safety.
For that reason, they emphasize possibilities for range checking, for avoiding dereferencing <code>nullptr</code>, for avoiding dangling pointers, and the systematic use of exceptions (via RAII).
Partly to achieve that and partly to minimize obscure code as a source of errors, the rules also emphasize simplicity and the hiding of necessary complexity behind well-specified interfaces.</p>

<p>Many of the rules are prescriptive.
We are uncomfortable with rules that simply state “don’t do that!” without offering an alternative.
One consequence of that is that some rules can be supported only by heuristics, rather than precise and mechanically verifiable checks.
Other rules articulate general principles. For these more general rules, more detailed and specific rules provide partial checking.</p>

<p>These guidelines address the core of C++ and its use.
We expect that most large organizations, specific application areas, and even large projects will need further rules, possibly further restrictions, and further library support.
For example, hard-real-time programmers typically can’t use free store (dynamic memory) freely and will be restricted in their choice of libraries.
We encourage the development of such more specific rules as addenda to these core guidelines.
Build your ideal small foundation library and use that, rather than lowering your level of programming to glorified assembly code.</p>

<p>The rules are designed to allow <a href="#S-modernizing">gradual adoption</a>.</p>

<p>Some rules aim to increase various forms of safety while others aim to reduce the likelihood of accidents, many do both.
The guidelines aimed at preventing accidents often ban perfectly legal C++.
However, when there are two ways of expressing an idea and one has shown itself a common source …</p></div></div>
