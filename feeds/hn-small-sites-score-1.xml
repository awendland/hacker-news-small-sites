		<article>
				               
			<p>We are at a critical moment, when digital technologies of automation, often referred to with buzzy vocabulary like “algorithms” and “AI,” are poised to transform work in a “Fourth Industrial Revolution.” Headlines scream about the imminent replacement of workers, often in language reminiscent of anti-immigrant rhetoric: robots are threatening to “take” or “steal” jobs. You can even go to the website willrobotstakemyjob.com and input specific occupations to get statistics on the likelihood of such theft. Writers have only a 3.8 percent chance—“totally safe”—while machinists face an alarming 65 percent. “Robots are watching,” the site cautions. These numbers are drawn from a widely cited 2013 report by economist Carl Benedikt Frey and computer scientist Michael A. Osborne that concluded 47 percent of total US employment would be automated by 2034.</p>
<p>Many writers on the radical left have accepted this framing of automation, while detourning its implications, making “full automation” central to the transcendence of capitalist exploitation. In <em>Inventing the Future</em>, Alex Williams and Nick Srnicek argue, “Without full automation, postcapitalist futures must necessarily choose between abundance at the expense of freedom (echoing the work-centricity of Soviet Russia) or freedom at the expense of abundance, represented by primitivist dystopias.” Aaron Bastani’s <em>Fully Automated Luxury Communism</em> pushes this idea to its limits, promising a future of boundless leisure for all, supplemented by a profusion of goods and services delivered sans human exploitation: “We will see more of the world than ever before, eat varieties of food we never have heard of, and lead lives equivalent—if we so wish—to those of today’s billionaires.”</p>
<p>Such a framing is both simple and attractive, especially to those of us trapped in dead-end jobs and eking out precarious existences; if robots, rather than we and our fellow workers, performed these tasks, and the productivity of technology were widely and equally dispersed, maybe we could spend our days doing more fulfilling activities than punching a clock. Like those cheesy banner ads that were all over the web in the late 2000s, you could have an egalitarian society with “one weird trick.” The bourgeoisie would hate this!</p>
<p>But Full Automators, whether dystopian or utopian, have a misguided approach to the question. According to historian Aaron Benanav, the specter of a postwork future has been conjured by anemic growth rates, not new technologies. Without radical change, our fate is further stagnation and crisis, not the world of the Jetsons. But new technologies certainly exist, and they are certainly doing, well, <em>something</em> to the work. But what?</p>
<p>Let’s start with a more basic question. What is automation? Machines have replicated and augmented human work processes for centuries, and that is often the colloquial use of “automation” in our current moment. But “automation” was not used to describe this process until 1947, when Delmar Harder, vice president of manufacturing at Ford Motor Company, created its Automation Department. The department’s engineers redesigned automobile production so that materials were automatically conveyed from one process to another, obviating the need for laborers to load and unload machines. Further, the process was itself increasingly machine-controlled, through a system of timers, switches, and relays—what technology historian David Hounsell calls the “electromechanical brain.”</p>
<p>Most of the technologies involved in automation had been developed and implemented in other industries years before their incorporation into Ford’s production process. What made automation new was its centrality to Ford’s manufacturing strategy, coming at a time of historic unrest among autoworkers, and in particular, on the heels of a costly twenty-four-day strike at Ford’s massive River Rouge plant in May of 1949. Not only would the new technologies dramatically reduce an unruly labor force, but they allowed Ford to decentralize its production away from the roiling unrest of Detroit as the company opened new automated factories, with new less militant employees, in Cleveland and Buffalo. Workers immediately perceived the threat, and automation was, from its inception, a deeply politicized issue. The history of automation reveals it as a political tool to subvert worker power, not simply an economic one to increase productivity.</p>
<p>Digging into the technical side of automation unearths more problems with the Full Automation Fallacy. David Autor, an economist, offers a useful corrective in his 2015 article “Why Are There Still So Many Jobs?,” its plaintive title a response to John Maynard Keynes’s Depression-era predictions of an automated future with a 15-hour work week. As Autor explains, rather than simply replace human jobs with machinic processes, automation affects labor in complex ways:</p>
<p>Changes in technology do alter the types of jobs available and what those jobs pay. In the last few decades, one noticeable change has been “polarization” of the labor market, in which wage gains went disproportionately to those at the top and at the bottom of the income and skill distribution, not to those in the middle.</p>
<p>Automation thus recomposes the workforce, isolating and rearranging tasks, altering job descriptions, and hollowing out middle-tier occupations.</p>
<p>Why does automation polarize instead of outright replace jobs? For one, many jobs require labor that is challenging to automate. Computers have to follow instructions laid out by programmers, so in order to substitute a computer for a worker, the worker’s tasks must be understood and articulated. However, much of the labor process is encompassed in tacit knowledge that workers are unable to articulate: “There are tasks for which neither computer programmers nor anyone else can enunciate the explicit ‘rules’ or procedures.” Even when tasks are known, automating them is easier said than done. On one end, computers cannot replicate the high levels of abstract thought required for managerial positions. On the other, jobs that require both manual work and flexibility, such as service sector jobs in food preparation and maintenance, are both difficult and cost-prohibitive to automate.</p>
<p>Take an example. In March 2018, Flippy, a burger-flipping robot, was rolled out at the Pasadena location of fast-food chain CaliBurger, to great fanfare and numerous headlines. The implication was clear: Would this humble machine spell the end of the fast-food job, the metonym for low-skilled entry-level occupations?</p>
<p>Not exactly. In an event that provoked far less press coverage, Flippy was retired after one day of work. CaliBurger’s owners took the honorable path of blaming Flippy’s failure on their human employees: workers, they explained, were simply too slow with tasks such as dressing the burgers, causing Flippy’s meaty achievements to pile up. However, a few discerning journalists had previously noted Flippy’s numerous errors in the relatively simple task that gave the robot its name. Flippy just wasn’t very good at its job. And so, yet another fully automated dream came crashing into messy reality.</p>
<p>According to Autor, the introduction of new kinds of information and control technology, such as what is currently hyped as “artificial intelligence,” supplements managerial work, and so increases the power and wages of bosses. On the other end, manual laborers (such as Flippy’s coworkers) see tasks eaten away and their movements reorganized and tightly controlled to make room for more rigid machines. Wages and working conditions deteriorate. But even then, automation stops short of “full”: such systems, as we will see, rely upon a stratum of human labor that is all but ineradicable. This is as true of Flippy as it is of the most powerful AI.</p>
<p>What do tend to be substitutable are not the lowest rungs, but those jobs requiring repetitive physical labor, as well as middle management jobs in operations. For example, Amazon’s warehouses use a software-directed system that coordinates human laborers, who select individual goods, with robots, who move large shelves. Algorithms replace middle-income jobs in managing the floor, leading to a polarized workforce of increasingly wealthy and powerful executives and programmers and increasingly degraded laborers who are substitutable not by machines, but by other humans; in other words, they are eminently replaceable.</p>
<p>But some have their targets set on precisely those positions in “knowledge work” that once promised a future safe from the robots. Technologists such as Kai-Fu Lee, former president of Google China, vow that white-collar jobs will go first. According to Lee, “The white collar jobs are easier to take because they’re purely a quantitative analytical process. Reporters, traders, telemarketing, telesales, customer service, analysts, they can all be replaced by software.”</p>
<p>But, of course, automation never completely erases human labor. Lee’s prediction of total replacement of knowledge work is a profound exaggeration, as a report by the think tank Data &amp; Society makes plain: “AI technologies reconfigure work practices rather than replace workers,” while at the same time, “automated and AI technologies tend to mask the human labor that allows them to be fully integrated into a social context while profoundly changing the conditions and quality of labor that is at stake.” Investigating grocery store self-checkout, researchers found that Luddite customers hated and avoided the technology. In response, management cut staff to make lines so unbearable that customers gave up and used the machines instead. Even then, cashiers were still required to assist and monitor transactions; rather than reduce workload, the technologies were “intensifying the work of customer service and creating new challenges.”</p>
<p>Self-checkout is an example of what technology journalist Brian Merchant calls “shitty automation”:</p>

            </section>

            
            <h2>And switching from init.vim to init.lua</h2>
            <p>If you, like me, never really understood Vimscript and hate the language
with a passion, you’re in the right place! You can now get rid of
Vimscript wholesale and replace it with a simpler, faster and elegant-er
language — Lua! <em>However</em>, this is only possible from Neovim 0.5
onwards<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and as of now, requires you to install Neovim from HEAD. How
to do that is left as an exercise to the reader. Also bear in mind that
the Lua API is fairly beta right now, and many Vim things don’t have
direct interfaces.</p>

<p>So assuming you’re now running Neovim <code>master</code>, head over to
<code>~/.config/nvim</code> and create your <code>init.lua</code>. Why, yes, we’re porting
over your <code>init.vim</code> to <code>init.lua</code> right now! Clear your calendar for
the next few hours — bikeshedding your text editor is top priority!</p>

<p>I also recommend going through
<a href="https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide" rel="nofollow">nanotee/nvim-lua-guide</a>
and <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/" rel="nofollow">Learn Lua in Y minutes</a>
before starting off.</p>

<h2>the directory structure</h2>

<p>Lua files are typically under <code>~/.config/nvim/lua</code>, and can be loaded as
Lua modules. This is incredibly powerful — you can structure your
configs however you like.</p>
<pre>$ tree .config/nvim
.
|-- ftplugin
|   `-- ...
|-- init.lua
|-- lua
|   |-- maps.lua
|   |-- settings.lua
|   |-- statusline.lua
|   `-- utils.lua
`-- plugin
    `-- ...
</pre>
<p>The common approach is to have different
bits of your config in Lua files under <code>lua/</code> and <code>require</code>’d in your
<code>init.lua</code>, so something like:</p>
<pre><span>-- init.lua</span>

require(<span>'</span><span>settings</span><span>'</span>)    <span>-- lua/settings.lua</span>
require(<span>'</span><span>maps</span><span>'</span>)        <span>-- lua/maps.lua</span>
require(<span>'</span><span>statusline</span><span>'</span>)  <span>-- lua/statusline.lua</span>
</pre>
<h2>the basics: setting options</h2>

<p>Vim has 3 kinds of options — global, buffer-local and window-local. In
Vimscript, you’d just <code>set</code> these. In Lua, however, you will have to
use one of</p>

<ul>
<li><code>vim.api.nvim_set_option()</code> — global options</li>
<li><code>vim.api.nvim_buf_set_option()</code> — buffer-local options</li>
<li><code>vim.api.nvim_win_set_option()</code> — window-local options</li>
</ul>

<p>These are fairly verbose and very clunky, but fortunately for us, we
have “meta-accesors” for these: <code>vim.{o,wo,bo}</code>. Here’s an excerpt from
my <code>settings.lua</code> as an example:</p>
<pre><span>local</span> o = vim.o
<span>local</span> wo = vim.wo
<span>local</span> bo = vim.bo

<span>-- global options</span>
o.swapfile = <span>true</span>
o.dir = <span>'</span><span>/tmp</span><span>'</span>
o.smartcase = <span>true</span>
o.laststatus = 2
o.hlsearch = <span>true</span>
o.incsearch = <span>true</span>
o.ignorecase = <span>true</span>
o.scrolloff = 12
<span>-- ... snip ... </span>

<span>-- window-local options</span>
wo.number = <span>false</span>
wo.wrap = <span>false</span>

<span>-- buffer-local options</span>
bo.expandtab = <span>true</span>
</pre>
<p>If you’re not sure if an option is global, buffer or window-local,
consult the Vim help! For example, <code>:h 'number'</code>:</p>
<pre>'number' 'nu'           boolean (default off)
                        local to window
</pre>
<p>Also note that you don’t set the negation of an option to true, like
<code>wo.nonumber = true</code>, you instead set <code>wo.number = false</code>.</p>

<h2>defining autocommands</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, autocommands in Vim don’t have a Lua interface — it is
being worked on.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Until then, you will have to use
<code>vim.api.nvim_command()</code>, or the shorter <code>vim.cmd()</code>. I’ve defined a
simple function that takes a Lua table of <code>autocmd</code>s as an argument, and
creates an <code>augroup</code> for you.</p>
<pre><span>-- utils.lua</span>

<span>local</span> M = {}
<span>local</span> cmd = vim.cmd

<span>function</span> <span>M</span>.create_augroup(autocmds, name)
    cmd(<span>'</span><span>augroup </span><span>'</span> .. name)
    cmd(<span>'</span><span>autocmd!</span><span>'</span>)
    <span>for</span> _, autocmd <span>in</span> ipairs(autocmds) <span>do</span>
        cmd(<span>'</span><span>autocmd </span><span>'</span> .. table.concat(autocmd, <span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span>))
    <span>end</span>
    cmd(<span>'</span><span>augroup END</span><span>'</span>)
<span>end</span>

<span>return</span> M

<span>-- settings.lua</span>
<span>local</span> cmd = vim.cmd
<span>local</span> u = require(<span>'</span><span>utils</span><span>'</span>)

u.create_augroup({
    { <span>'</span><span>BufRead,BufNewFile</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>/tmp/nail-*</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>setlocal</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>ft=mail</span><span>'</span> },
    { <span>'</span><span>BufRead,BufNewFile</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>*s-nail-*</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>setlocal</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>ft=mail</span><span>'</span> },
}, <span>'</span><span>ftmail</span><span>'</span>)

cmd(<span>'</span><span>au BufNewFile,BufRead * if &amp;ft == "" | set ft=text | endif</span><span>'</span>)
</pre>
<h2>defining keymaps</h2>

<p>Keymaps can be set via <code>vim.api.nvim_set_keymap()</code>. It takes 4
arguments: the mode for which the mapping will take effect, the key
sequence, the command to execute and a table of options (<code>:h
:map-arguments</code>).</p>
<pre><span>-- maps.lua</span>

<span>local</span> map = vim.api.nvim_set_keymap

<span>-- map the leader key</span>
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;Space&gt;</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>'</span>, {})
vim.g.mapleader = <span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span>  <span>-- 'vim.g' sets global variables</span>


options = { noremap = <span>true</span> }
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;leader&gt;&lt;esc&gt;</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>:nohlsearch&lt;cr&gt;</span><span>'</span>, options)
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;leader&gt;n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>:bnext&lt;cr&gt;</span><span>'</span>, options)
map(<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>&lt;leader&gt;p</span><span>'</span>, <span>'</span><span>:bprev&lt;cr&gt;</span><span>'</span>, options)
</pre>
<p>For user defined commands, you’re going to have to go the <code>vim.cmd</code>
route:</p>
<pre><span>local</span> cmd = vim.cmd

cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! WQ wq</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! WQ wq</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! Wq wq</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! Wqa wqa</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! W w</span><span>'</span>)
cmd(<span>'</span><span>:command! Q q</span><span>'</span>)
</pre>
<h2>managing packages</h2>

<p>Naturally, you can’t use your favourite Vimscript package manager
anymore, or at least, not without <code>vim.api.nvim_exec</code>ing a bunch of
Vimscript (ew!). Thankfully, there are a few pure-Lua plugin managers
available to use<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> — I personally use, and recommend
<a href="https://github.com/savq/paq-nvim/" rel="nofollow">paq</a>. It’s light and makes use of
the <a href="https://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/" rel="nofollow"><code>vim.loop</code></a> API for async I/O.
paq’s docs are plentiful, so I’ll skip talking about how to set it up.</p>

<h2>bonus: writing your own statusline</h2>

<p>Imagine using a bloated, third-party statusline, when you can just write
your own.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> It’s actually quite simple! Start by defining a table for
every mode:</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

 <span>local</span> mode_map = {
	[<span>'</span><span>n</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>normal </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>no</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>n·operator pending </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>v</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>visual </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>V</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>v·line </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span></span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>v·block </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>s</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>select </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>S</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>s·line </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span></span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>s·block </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>i</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>insert </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>R</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>replace </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>Rv</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>v·replace </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>c</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>command </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>cv</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>vim ex </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>ce</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>ex </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>r</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>prompt </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>rm</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>more </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>r?</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>confirm </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>!</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>shell </span><span>'</span>,
	[<span>'</span><span>t</span><span>'</span>] = <span>'</span><span>terminal </span><span>'</span>
}
</pre>
<p>The idea is to get the current mode from <code>vim.api.nvim_get_mode()</code> and
map it to our desired text. Let’s wrap that around in a small <code>mode()</code>
function:</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

<span>local</span> <span>function</span> mode()
	<span>local</span> m = vim.api.nvim_get_mode().mode
	<span>if</span> mode_map[m] == <span>nil</span> <span>then</span> <span>return</span> m <span>end</span>
	<span>return</span> mode_map[m]
<span>end</span>
</pre>
<p>Now, set up your highlights. Again, there isn’t any interface for
highlights yet, so whip out that <code>vim.api.nvim_exec()</code>.</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

vim.api.nvim_exec(
<span>[[
</span><span>  hi PrimaryBlock   ctermfg=06 ctermbg=00
</span><span>  hi SecondaryBlock ctermfg=08 ctermbg=00
</span><span>  hi Blanks   ctermfg=07 ctermbg=00
</span><span>]]</span>, <span>false</span>)
</pre>
<p>Create a new table to represent the entire statusline itself. You can
add any other functions you want (like one that returns the current git
branch, for instance). Read <code>:h 'statusline'</code> if you don’t understand
what’s going on here.</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

<span>local</span> stl = {
  <span>'</span><span>%#PrimaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  mode(),
  <span>'</span><span>%#SecondaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%#Blanks#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%f</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%m</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%=</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%#SecondaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%l,%c </span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%#PrimaryBlock#</span><span>'</span>,
  <span>'</span><span>%{&amp;filetype}</span><span>'</span>,
}
</pre>
<p>Finally, with the power of <code>table.concat()</code>, set your statusline. This
is akin to doing a series of string concatenations, but way faster.</p>
<pre><span>-- statusline.lua</span>

vim.o.statusline = table.concat(stl)
</pre>
<p><img src="https://x.icyphox.sh/statusline.png" alt="statusline"></p>

<h2>this is what being tpope feels like</h2>

<p>You can now write that plugin you always wished for! I sat down to write
a plugin for <a href="https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy" rel="nofollow">fzy</a><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>, which you can
find <a href="https://git.icyphox.sh/dotfiles/tree/config/nvim/lua/fzy" rel="nofollow">here</a>
along with my entire Neovim config<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup>. I plan to port a the last of my
<code>plugin/</code> directory over to Lua, soon™.</p>

<p>And it’s only going to get better when the Lua API is completed. We can
all be Vim plugin artists now.</p>

the traffic flows. For example, here's a reverse tunnel that allows only users from
IP address 1.2.3.4 access to port 80 on the SSH client through an SSH server.</p><p data-v-4fc16f31="">SSH tunnels are encrypted TCP connections between SSH clients and servers
that allows traffic entering one side of the tunnel to transparently exit
through the other. While the term originally referred to tunnels using TUN/TAP virtual
network interfaces, it's commonly used to refer to SSH port forwarding nowadays.
Use cases include:</p><ul data-v-4fc16f31=""><li data-v-4fc16f31="">Providing encrypted channels for protocols that use plaintext</li><li data-v-4fc16f31="">Opening backdoors into private networks</li><li data-v-4fc16f31="">Bypassing firewalls</li></ul><p data-v-4fc16f31="">This page is a work-in-progress.

remote services over an encrypted connection as if they were local services.
Example use cases:</p><ul data-v-47beec60=""><li data-v-47beec60="">Accessing a remote service (redis, memcached, etc.) listening on internal IPs</li><li data-v-47beec60="">Locally accessing resources available on a private network</li><li data-v-47beec60="">Transparently proxying a request to a remote service</li></ul></div><div data-v-47beec60=""><h4 data-v-47beec60="">Remote port forwarding</h4><p data-v-47beec60="">Remote port forwarding allows you to forward traffic on an SSH server

<p>Last week I spoke at the <a href="http://newpublic.org/">New_Public festival</a> in an “online park” where designers, urbanists, and artists explored how to create better “digital public spaces”. While preparing for the session I hosted, I started questioning how we came to understand our social media platforms as the “new public square” in the first place. The road to widespread internet adoption was paved with spatial metaphors, which helped non-technical people wrap their heads around this brand new technology. We drove down the information super<em>highway</em>, we visited cyber <em>space</em>, we navigated to web <em>sites</em>. Software designers were known as digital <em>architects</em> who built virtual places for work and play. We talked about the internet as if it was <em>outside</em> of us —&nbsp;an environment to wander around in, an ocean to surf.</p>

<p><img src="https://aaronzlewis.com/images/digital-sensorium/internet.gif"></p>

<p>But <a href="https://twitter.com/fIowerstructure">É. Urcades</a>, one of my favorite technologists on the interwebs, has challenged me to think differently about digital spaces. “websites”, he says, “are absolutely not places or architecture, they are temporary bodies … when you design interfaces you are -literally- designing the sensory organs people use to perceive information — interface design is organ design.” When our organs of perception get augmented by new technologies, we experience subtle shifts in our relationships with each other and with our selves. Throughout the 2010s, some <a href="https://qz.com/677218/this-woman-a-self-described-cyborg-can-sense-every-earthquake-in-real-time/">wannabe</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Harbisson">cyborgs</a> have already undergone extremely invasive procedures to augment their default “hardware”. But if É. Urcades is right, you don’t even need risky surgery to acquire new senses. You just have to turn on your (pocket) computer.</p>

<p>Thirty years into the digital age, it’s safe to say the internet isn’t just an <em>external</em> environment that we travel through or a “public space” that we stroll around in. It’s fully entangled with our nervous systems now, and it has re-shaped our minds in ways that aren’t always easy or comfortable to articulate. This process became even more apparent during 2020 —&nbsp;a year in which screens swallowed the last remaining bits of our “offline” culture and daily lives. I don’t think we’ll be able to create the sort of digital publics that the New_Public festival is aiming towards until we’ve adequately taken stock of what happens <em>within us</em> when we <a href="https://twitter.com/HipCityReg/status/1340760227021533186?s=20">live</a> with the technologies we’ve built.</p>

<p>To that end, I wrote up 8 first-person stories about the new psychologies that have emerged under the influence of digital media. These accounts are based on a number of conversations with internet friends and strangers over the last few years. This is no doubt a small sampling of the subjective experiences that have been created by our software “sense organs.” What other unique sensory configurations are floating around out there, waiting to be discovered? Starting today, I’m opening up a digital <a href="https://j200lig809x.typeform.com/to/aKlUewsm">hotline</a> in order to find out. You can think of the stories below as the very first submissions to the hotline. Perhaps you’ll even recognize some of the experiences they describe as your own.</p>

<strong>subject: Exoskeletal unease</strong><br></p>

<p>You know that feeling when you outgrow your wardrobe? When you no longer feel like yourself in your old clothes? That happens to me with my virtual avatars and profile photos. Or maybe my accounts are more like <a href="https://twitter.com/ctbeiser/status/1171603433301790720?s=20">exoskeletons</a> that I have to shed as I grow, and they absolutely need to be maintained because they’re as much “me” as anything else. My physical body no longer feels like the “center of gravity” of my identity… my sense of presence is forever <a href="https://hipcityreg.substack.com/p/the-concurrency-pool">fractured</a> and distributed all over the place. I close my eyes and imagine all the screens that are displaying my content at this very moment, I wonder about the total number of pixels I currently occupy, I feel like I am nowhere and also everywhere. After a while, the exoskeleton I wear online doesn’t really feel like a true expression of my inner self. It’s so much <a href="https://twitter.com/matildepark_/status/1258240760698286080?s=20">work</a> to keep it up to date, but I basically don’t have a choice because that’s where I do most of my socializing nowadays. To be honest, my internet friends are the only people who really understand what I’m about —&nbsp;everyone else is stuck with a shallow, incomplete version of me. As you can probably tell, I pour a lot of my self into these apps. When they die, like Vine did a few years ago, it feels almost like a psychological amputation. I’m permanently cut off from a part of my exoskeleton, and I have to grow a whole new shell.</p>

<p>So I started putting together a wiki of all my personal knowledge about 4 years ago, before Roam and Notion and Are.na were even a thing. I really wanted to be able to surf across my own mind the way other people surf across the web. My database is an always-growing <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1091506683036164096?s=20">network</a> of quotes, speculations, Bible verses, synchronistic hyperlinks, and interesting juxtapositions of information that I’ve collected from all over the place. Now that I’ve been building this wiki for a few years, my perception seems way more hyperlinked than it used to. Any random object or situation gives me like 400 flashbacks to books X, Y, Z and obscure historical references 1, 2, 3. I can’t look at a thing anymore and just see the thing. I filter all new info through the lens of my digitally extended mind and it feels like a superpower, or like that NZT-48 drug from the movie <em>Limitless</em>. Guess you could say I run my own little intelligence agency. Sometimes I even prefer video chat to IRL convos because I can easily reference my external brain without the other person noticing. If I ever lost access to my database, I’m not really sure <em>what</em> I’d do. I think the networked note-takers are really on the front lines of creating the Global Social Computer in the Cloud. Part of me suspects that someday, after I’m gone, someone will be able to use all my data to bring me back to life in deepfake form, like they <a href="https://adage.com/article/advertising/parkland-victim-joaquin-oliver-comes-back-life-heartbreaking-plea-voters/2285166">did to that kid</a> who died in the Parkland shootings. It gives me peace of mind to think that maybe, just maybe, my digital soul will survive into the far future —&nbsp;long after my meatspace body has decomposed.</p>

<p>Twitter has definitely changed my relationship with my internal monologue. Just like my vocal cords and larynx turn my silent neural activity into vibrating air molecules, my <em>external</em> voice box on twitter dot com turns my inner rumination into text on someone else’s screen. Before I started posting, my thoughts were more abstract and non-verbal —&nbsp;like blobs of play-doh floating around a zero gravity chamber. I used to spend a lot of time re-molding these amorphous thought forms into Twitter-friendly nuggets. But nowadays my internal monologue speaks tweet by default. Thoughts bubble up from the depths of my psyche readymade for the timeline, already twisted into the pre-programmed shape of a Post. I wonder if the algorithm is starting to interfere with the way my subconscious works. What if it’s filtering out thoughts that it doesn’t think will perform well online? Every day, thousands of strangers upload little slices of their consciousness directly into my mind. My <a href="https://reallifemag.com/podcast-passivity/">concern</a> is that I’m prone to mistake their thoughts for my own — that some part of me believes I’m only hearing myself think. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning, I’ll scroll through my old posts just to remind myself of myself. It feels like looking in the mirror. I’m swallowing my (digital) self so that I’m <em>me</em> instead of someone else.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I basically spent all my childhood building worlds in SimCity and Rollercoaster Tycoon and zooming into random cities on <a href="https://reallifemag.com/springtime-everywhere/">Google Earth</a>. These apps definitely inspired my decision to work in urban planning. This might sound weird, but when I walk through a building I can usually <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronzlewis/status/1260366804184117248?s=20" title="">tell you</a> what version of AutoCad they used to design it. After spending years and years in rendering software, you sort of get a sixth sense for the tools &amp; features that the architect had access to, and the IRL built environment starts to feel kinda fake — like the different “towns” inside Disney World. On top of that, the POV of the virtual camera follows me out into the “real world.” I’m pretty good at hallucinating what my surroundings would look like from the drone’s eye view. (The other day, one of my friends was telling me that he can convince himself he’s playing The Sims or a first-person shooter game with his own body, monitoring the little green bars, making sure his stats are all good). When I look at the gradient of a beautiful sunset, or the hairline cracks in a concrete sidewalk, or the murky texture of a cumulonimbus cloud, I can’t help but think about how hard it’d be to make something like that in Unity. It’s almost like the world is a big game engine and God is the supernatural renderer. Maybe one of these days I’ll turn around too quickly and spot a glitch. Sometimes I mix up my IRL memories with memories from my VR experiences, but that’s a whole other story…</p>

<p>I’ve been on TikTok a lot lately, and it’s kind of changed the way I see and hear things. When I’m scrolling the For You page, I’m not really taking in each video as a whole —&nbsp;I’m always deconstructing it in my mind. I process the audio separately from the visuals and try to figure out how I might re-use the sound for my own content ideas. The weird thing is that this “Song Exploder” mode of hearing has seeped into my everyday life. When I’m out and about, I’m constantly sensing my auditory environment through the TikTok filter in my head. When I’m hanging out with friends who spend a lot of time on the app, we can basically speak a whole different language together. We’ve memorized enough videos that we can have a whole ass conversation using only obscure quotes and …</p></section></div></div>

<h2>Is Software Abstraction Killing Civilization?</h2>

<p><b>Or: Jonathan Blow is wrong but also right and we still
need to prevent the collapse of civilization</b></p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<p>
I recently stumbled upon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">a talk by game
development guru Jonathan Blow</a>, about how software 
abstraction will lead to the end of civilization. Quick summary:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information passed on between generations is diluted.
    Practise is better than theory for keeping skills alive.</li>
  <li>Software runs the world.</li>
  <li>Abstraction fosters ignorance about low level programming.</li>
  <li>If we forget low level stuff, civilization will fall apart
    since we won't be able to keep vital software running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was one of those 
talks that might at a first glance seem perfectly reasonable, not least 
because similar ideas are regularly discussed in programmer circles by a
great number of 
people. Then you start thinking about what's said, and all the errors and 
misconceptions presented makes you feel troubled, because it's both 
tempting and easy to perpetuate the punchlines without
considering their implications. <b>I agree with Blow that it's
important to pass knowledge between generations. Therefore, the veracity
of that information is extremely important.</b> I propose that
the information given in the very talk about the importance of
such information, is in fact wrong on many counts.
</p>

<p>
That's why I, in this rather long text, have tried to examine Blow's
claims in detail. (TL;DR: Someone is wrong on the Internet - man with
ample spare time on his hands to the rescue!)
</p>

<h3>Some examples of collapsed civilizations and artefacts lost in time</h3>

<p>
I'm not a historian and will not comment on this first part of the talk. It doesn't matter much, though; my gripe is mainly with the second part.
</p>

<h3>Five nines</h3>

<p>
Blow says we used to use the "five nines" (99.999% uptime) metric when selling computer systems. Since his laptop has the habit of rebooting when in sleep mode, it can never be a candidate for 99.999% uptime. This part is true: five nines means a total yearly downtime of just above five minutes. This is presented as proof that we have lost a rhetoric of quality. This part is false.
</p>

<p>
In reality, five nines usually applies to things like emergency response switchboards (911), hospital systems, financial transaction processing, etc. It's also a metric usually accompanied by long contracts detailing various downtime scenarios that couldn't possibly count as downtime. It has never, ever been used to sell consumer laptops or the word processors we run on them.
</p>

<p>
It's also incorrect that five nines isn't used anymore: several companies, such as IBM and Amazon, sell such systems and services. Incidentally, IBM actually goes further and claims their Power9 platform can provide even higher availability. Provided, I'm sure, the network used to reach it is functioning and the client computers are working and, and, and... you get the point.
</p>

<p>
So, no, we haven't lost this rhetoric of quality. We've simply never used it the way Blow claims.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, my laptops never reboot unless I tell them to and one of them currently has an uptime of 55 days.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/endofciv/uptime_brumbrum.png" alt="A photo of my laptop's screen, showing a 55 day uptime.">
</p>

<h3>"The industry hasn't produced robust software for decades"</h3>

<p>

What is robust? Is it my iPhone, going for weeks and months without a 
reboot? Is it
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years/">the famous uptime of Novell's file and printer servers</a>, 
with documented instances running for 16 years? Is it the multi-year 
uptimes of a plethora of Unix, Windows and VMS machines? Is it the 365+ 
days (and counting) uptime of some random Linux web server I've got 
access to? Is it turnkey systems like IBM i, offering continuous 
availability?

</p>

<p>
Apparently none of the above, according to Blow.
</p>

<h3>"Tech companies are no longer about pushing tech forward"</h3>

<p>
Well, yes and no. I agree that the lifestyle app startups of Silicon Valley (and elsewhere) are hardly about pushing tech forward - but people more interested in making money rather than amazing technology has always been around. Was Infocom's umpteenth text adventure about pushing tech forward? Was any of the ten bazillion (a rough estimate) jumpy-shooty platform games produced? Was MS-DOS, single-tasking its way through 15 years of building Microsoft's empire right up until its last breath in version 6.22?
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of exciting stuff happening on the "hard tech" front. Blow does mention machine learning earlier in his talk, but "boring" things like file systems, web servers, databases and programming languages are also continually developed and improved upon. A lot of effort is also going into improving the various layers of abstraction, virtualization and containerization Blow is so adverse to - but him disliking them doesn't mean they're not about pushing tech forward.
</p>

<h3>"Abstraction leads to loss of capability."</h3>

<p>
Blow lists a number of programming languages, some of which have fallen out of fashion because of abstraction. His take basically boils down to learning assembly coding, memory management and pointers.
</p>

<p>
I agree that a large number of programmers today (myself included) are very happy with not having to deal with things like memory allocation and pointers. And yes, there are certainly horrifying examples of when abstraction gets the better of us. Plenty of web sites use a lot of completely unnecessary JavaScript framework voodoo to render a simple blog and plenty of supposed "desktop apps" are really running (very slowly) inside a bundled browser.
</p>

<p>
Despite that, I'm willing to bet a few bucks there are more people 
around today (including youngsters) who can program in C than ever 
before, and that more C and assembly code is being written than ever 
before. Linux and NetBSD, for example, are continuously being ported to 
pretty much everything that even vaguely resembles a CPU. Rust, a new 
language with a heavy focus on robustness, <b>does</b> feature pointers and 
lets the programmer manage memory. Harvard's introduction to Computer 
Science, CS50, is publicly available on Youtube and each year it 
features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF6YkH-8vFk">a two hour
lecture on stuff like memory layout, pointers,
malloc() and free()</a>.
</p>

<p>
I agree that the things mentioned here are good to know about and I think anyone seriously into programming should at least try them out some time, if for no other reason than to understand why a lot of us prefer to avoid them if given the option to do so.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and garbage collection and functional programming aren't new 
abstractions. Lisp did both in the late 1950s and it's been used in a 
lot of "hardcore" settings, including
<a href="http://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab</a>.
And, unsurprisingly, a Lisp programmer will of course claim that Lisp
makes you much more productive than something with malloc() ever will.
</p>

<h3>"The productivity of Facebook employees is approaching zero"</h3>

<p>
Here we're shown some graphs of the rising number of Facebook and Twitter employees and Blow states that since Facebook doesn't really get that many new features each year, all those programmers mostly sit around and do nothing.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I'm pretty sure Facebook employs a wide range of staff who are not feature developers: lawyers, accountants, graphical 
designers, sysadmins, researchers, HR, middle management, etc. When not working on Facebook the site, employees of Facebook the company 
are also working on Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR to name some of their other pursuits. I'd also argue that (measurable) individual 
output in general drops as a result of a company growing. You need to reach a certain critical mass to have a whole team working hard on 
a feature only to, by some managerial decision, drop it right before it's finished. Things like that happen all the time in large 
software companies and won't show up in Blow's rather flimsy metric.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Blow constructs this argument around the assumption that Facebook's product is Facebook, in the sense of the social platform. This is of course wrong. Facebook doesn't have to add or change very many features on their social platform every year, they just have to keep things smooth enough for those who actually use those functions to stay content.
</p>

<p>
This is because Facebook's real product is an ad delivery platform.
</p>

<p>
As such, it collects massive amounts of personal and private data and churns it into targeted ads, all the while sucking people in with cleverly designed attention-grabbing dark patterns. I'm sure plenty of work is done on this by a whole lot of programmers, but it'll never appear as "features" to the user, only as corporate revenue. In that respect, Facebook programmers seem to be highly productive.
</p>

<h3>Ken Thompson's "Three Week Unix"</h3>

<p>
First off, I'm not out to belittle Ken Thompson's efforts here. Writing an assembler, editor and basic kernel in three weeks is highly respectable work by any standard. It's also a great piece of computer lore and fits Blow's narrative perfectly - especially with Kernighan's little quip about productivity in the end. Of course, we don't know how "robust" Thompson's software was at this stage, or how user friendly, or what kind of features it had. I'm going to boldly claim it would've been a hard sell today, even if it did run on modern hardware.
</p>

<p>
I'm also pretty sure Thompson dealt with little or nothing of the following during those three weeks: documentation, code reviews, daily standups, backlog grooming, user stories, unit tests, customer demands, A/B testing, writing commit messages and adhering to a corporate code formatting standard. We are after all talking about a guy who, when he could pick any names he wanted, opted for "creat", "mv" and "cp".
</p>

<p>
I'm also certain Thompson could work alone in a private office, rather than share an open floor plan with fifty colleagues incessantly shouting into cellphones, shuffling furniture around or having animated discussions about football two feet from his desk.
</p>

<p>
It's important to remember that apart from hardware and software, the working conditions for most developers are vastly different …</p></div></div>

<p>New Year’s Eve morning, I decided to start the new year with Roam. </p>



<p>A few days ago, I noticed, I passed the threshold of 5,000 notes in Evernote. The last two years, my daily-not-so-daily Logs are missing a piece of organization, that I might find in Roam. That’s how Travis Daily started his post on <a href="https://travisdailey.com/migrate-to-roam-research/">how to migrate from Evernote to Roam</a> “I have 5000 plus notes in my Evernote account”. </p>







<h2 id="0-roam-sources">Roam Sources</h2>



<ul><li><a href="https://travisdailey.com/migrate-to-roam-research/">Migrate From Evernote To Roam Research With Notion</a> by Travis Daily</li><li><a href="https://www.roamtips.com/">Roam Tips by </a>Mark Traphagen (<a href="https://twitter.com/marktraphagen">@marktraphagen</a>)</li><li><a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam">Roam: Why I Love It and How I Use It</a> by <strong>Nat Eliason</strong> – one of my long reads of this week. </li></ul>



<p>The first time,  I heard about Roam was on the<a href="https://reactpodcast.simplecast.com/episodes/104"> 104th episode of the React podcast by Chantastic</a>. <a href="https://jevakallio.dev/">Jani Eväkallio</a> talked  about Roam and about his app called <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/">Foam</a>, that allows you to transform your VSCode instance to a Roam app. The ideas on Roam are all based on <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/">Tiago Forte’s work</a> and <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Build a Second Brain</a> approach. There is actually a <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-second-brain-manifesto/">“Second Brain Manifesto”</a></p>



<p><strong>Roam Research </strong>doesn’t have an API yet for further integration with other tools but there is a <a href="https://github.com/artpi/roam-research-private-api">‘Private API’</a> by <a href="https://piszek.com/">Artur Piszek</a> from Warsaw,  working at Automattic. Artur also created the <a href="https://deliber.at/wp-roam-block/">Roam Block plugin</a>, I have yet to test. </p>



<h2 id="1-strong-import-all-evernote-items-to-notion-strong">Import all Evernote items to Notion</h2>



<p>I already have a Notion account I started and then never used from 2019.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="268" height="238" src="https://icodeforapurpose.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-31-at-11.34.36-AM.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Turns out my notes numbers (over 5,000) are inflated. In 2012, in a misguided attempt to preserve Twitter Favorites, I sync them with Evernote via IFTTT, to never looked at them again. I let it run between  Dec 14, 2012 to April 29, 2015, and I accumulated 2112 single notes. Those won’t come over to RoamResearch. Since then, I archive Tweets, favorites aka likes and follows on Google Sheet.  </p>



<p>I felt great relief when Notion’s import script showed me the breakdown of notes in notebooks,  so I can select the ones I would want to import.  The breakdown also reveals some abandoned attempts to organize my notes. </p>



<p>It takes more than a couple of minutes, I guess. 30 minutes into the import time, I could only see notes back to 2018. It seems, the connection only imported about 550 of the 2872 notes and then stopped. I tried to start it again, and it counted through the imported once rather quickly so there seems to be a duplicate check. I am happy about that. I read through the documentation on Evernote import, and it didn’t mention any rate limits. </p>



<p>I started a chat through the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Help-Support-e040febf70a94950b8620e6f00005004">Help and Support pages at Notion</a>. I connected with two people. <em>“This is definitely not intended behavior and has been filed with our engineering team. Unfortunately, we may not have a fix right away, but know it’s on our to-do list.</em>” Meanwhile, I’ll follow this advice: <em>“Sometimes it’s caused by a single (usually large) page. If you are importing multiple notebooks, would you mind trying to import your notes in smaller batches? If there are lots of photos, videos, etc. I’d try importing those a few at a time, but if they’re just text you can import them in larger batches :)”</em></p>



<p>Moving in Evernote only works with 50 Notes at a time. God, my grandmother was right. </p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Computers are a colossal waste of time! </p><cite>Oma Pauli</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I copy/pasted today’s#1023 note over to Roam to get acquainted with the future interface. I might as well go on our lunch run. </p>



<p>15 days in I am still in love with Roam and now really need to continue the work to migration Evernote content to Roam Research. </p>



<h2 id="2-from-notion-to-roam-research">From Notion to RoamResearch</h2>



<p>So now that many notes have been imported to Notion, I exported them as instructed. The import into RoamResearch works, but it’s only 10 files at a time. 🤦‍♀️</p>



<p>I also expected that <em>RoamResearch</em> would be able to read the created date and import it accordingly. Now all have today’s date. I had to change every note’s name to turn it into a Daily Note. For that purpose, a 10 file limit is probably good. </p>



<h2 id="3-private-api">Private-api</h2>



<p>I had hoped that Artur Priszek’s private-api would get me started, but it doesn’t have much documentation beyond the read me and the roam-quick command, I could get working. I need to dive into code, to figure out how it would work beyond. I can see myself creating a little CLI app that hides away the access credentials and lets me write via the command line something like <code>rem 'Call your mother tomorrow' </code>and have it show up in the Quick Capture of the app, when I switch over to the app again.  </p>



<h2 id="4-what-i-like-about-using-roam-research">What I Like about using Roam Research</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Command + K works</strong> for adding link to highlighted text. It also uses pure Markdown [link text](linkurl) and converts it to links once you leave the editing mode. </li><li><strong>Adding a tag is as easy </strong>as adding a # before the work. </li><li><strong>Can import JSON + Markdown.</strong> </li><li><strong>Slash command</strong> and first item on the list is the TODO item once I hit enter my checkbox are back.</li><li>The <strong>Sidebar</strong> shows me all Todos in one screen as well as the “Done” items. </li><li>The <strong>auto-creation of daily pages</strong> is neat and a time saver. I started adding future dates to do items or preparation for meetings etc. very helpful. In the morning, I open the RoamResearch app and see what my past self has in store for me. </li><li>Easy page merge: So with any other notes app, that has a tagging feature, I would never get the spelling right for hashtags and other tags and end up with too many tags that are misspellings, and they are a pain to consolidate, so I never did. With RoamResearch, when I discover I two similar tags, I decide on a single one and just change the page title of the other one, and it merge the two page. Brilliant. </li><li>The biggest tools especially after I import the Evernote notes will be the <strong>‘Unlinked references’</strong> it finds for a certain topic. It unloads the cognitive loads, you have to put into document management, for when you forget the coding of certain things. </li></ul>

<ul><li>Definitely an <strong>API to integrate with other services</strong>. </li><li><strong>Faster load on mobile.</strong> It’s spins for multiple seconds until I can start adding text, and sometimes I can’t get it to sync from other devices. </li><li>Seems at publishing date, the right sidebar is broken. It’s just shows an empty column. </li></ul>

<p>After a month of using it, I am definitely comfortable, sometimes still lost. February will be the month going from Novice to competent user on the Dreyfus’ “Five-Stage Model of Mental Activities Involved in Directed  Skill Acquisition”. I just read it. Speaking of Reddit, there is a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/">RoamResearch community</a> and in a pinned post, are some thoughts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/eho7de/building_a_second_brain_in_roamand_why_you_might/">how to work on projects</a>. That’s my next adventure. </p>

It could become an energy efficient building material in the future.</p>  <p>Wood is made of two basic ingredients: cellulose, which are tiny fibres, and lignin, which bonds those fibres together to give it strength.</p>  <p>Tear a paper towel in half and look closely along the edge. You will see the little cellulose fibres sticking up. Lignin is a glue-like material that bonds the fibres together, a little like the plastic resin in fibreglass or carbon fibre. The lignin also contains molecules called chromophores, which give the wood its brown colour and prevent light from passing through.</p>  <p>Early attempts to make transparent wood involved removing the lignin, but this involved hazardous chemicals, high temperatures and a lot of time, making the product expensive and somewhat brittle. The new technique is so cheap and easy it could literally be done in a backyard.</p>  <p>Starting with planks of wood a metre long and one millimetre thick, the scientists simply brushed on a solution of hydrogen peroxide using an ordinary paint brush. When left in the sun, or under a UV lamp for an hour or so, the peroxide bleached out the brown chromophores but left the lignin intact, so the wood turned white.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Researchers demonstrated after brushing a coat of hydrogen peroxide on the opaque wood material, and exposing it to one hour of sunlight, it turns transparent.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Next, they infused the wood with a tough transparent epoxy designed for marine use, which filled in the spaces and pores in the wood and then hardened.&nbsp;This made the white wood transparent.</p>  <p>You can see a similar effect by taking that same piece of paper towel, dip half of it in water and place it on a patterned surface.&nbsp;The white paper towel will become translucent with light passing through the water and cellulose fibres without being scattered by refraction.</p>  <p>The epoxy in the wood does an even better job, allowing 90 per cent of visible light to pass through.

The clear wood&nbsp;is lighter than glass, with better insulating properties, which is important because windows are a major source of heat loss in buildings. It also might take less energy to manufacture clear wood because there are no high temperatures involved.</p>  <p>Transparent wood could become an alternative to glass in energy efficient buildings, or perhaps coverings for solar panels in harsh environments. There could be no end of uses.</p>      <p>Many different types of wood, from balsa to oak, can be made transparent, and it doesn't matter if it is cut along the grain or against it. If the transparent wood is made a little thicker, it would be strong enough to become part of the structure of a building, so there could be entire transparent wooden walls.</p>  <p>While this technology has yet to&nbsp; be scaled up to industrial levels, the researchers say it has great potential as a new building material. In fact, they say that theoretically, an entire house could be made transparent. It is not clear why anyone would want to live in a transparent house, but for people who do, it would be OK to throw stones…</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A researcher holds up a 10-centimetre long slab of the see-through wood.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Images copyright Xia et al.&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" rel="license">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>,&nbsp;</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Over the last few months, I’ve been working on solving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe">Ultimate Tic Tac Toe</a>, also known as (Tic Tac Toe)². I’ve made considerable progress, but, as of this writing, am still some distance away from the solution being feasible in an amount of compute time and money I’m willing to spend. This section of the site is dedicated to documenting my work so far and some next steps.</p><p>Solving Ultimate Tic Tac Toe isn’t a particularly important goal in and of itself, but I’ve found this project a great opportunity to learn about a fairly wide range of topics; I’m hopeful this writeup can bring some of those lessons to others who have similar interests, or just who want to follow along with a nerdy deep-dive into game tree search and high-performance Rust while we’re all stuck at home.</p><p>As of this writing, I have a high-performance Ultimate Tic Tac Toe solver written in Rust. This solver includes:</p><ul><li>A <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/efficient-representation/">high performance implementation</a> of an Ultimate Tic Tac Toe engine.</li><li>An <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-dfpn/">efficient parallel proof tree search algorithm</a>, consisting of a combined two-level <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-search/">Proof Number search</a> and <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-search/dfpn/">Depth-First Proof Number Search</a> search.</li><li>A <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-dfpn/tt/">high-performance parallel transposition table</a>.</li><li>An <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pruning/">positional analysis engine</a> capable of solving some positions and moves without tree search, in order to prune the search tree.</li></ul><p>The solver is presently capable of solving Ultimate Tic Tac Toe positions after about 20 ply (10 moves by each player) in a few hours of search on my Ryzen 3900X desktop. I (very roughly) estimate this implies a total computational cost of a few hundred million CPU-hours to solve the whole game without further optimization. CPU time on AWS costs something like 2 cents an hour, suggesting a cost in the $2M - $10M range. I thus believe the solution is solidly within the realm of “technically feasible”, but certainly well outside my budget. Further optimizations will be required to knock off a few more orders of magnitude in order to complete the project.</p><ul><li>You can find <a href="https://github.com/nelhage/ultimattt">the code</a> on Github. I’ve also tried to include links to relevant files throughout this site.</li><li>If you’re unfamiliar with the game of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, start with <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/the-game">my writeup</a> of the game.</li><li>The core of my solver is based on the <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-search/">Proof-Number search</a> family of algorithms. You can <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-search/">read my background information about that family</a>, or jump to <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/pn-dfpn/">the writeup of my search algorithm</a>.</li><li>If you’re curious about my efficient implementation of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, including what I suspect of being the first-ever SIMD Tic Tac Toe implementation, <a href="https://minimax.dev/docs/ultimate/efficient-representation/">find that here</a>.</li></ul></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div id="post-body">
        <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Al_Grigor/status/1357028887209902088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">The other day on Twitter</a></p><blockquote>Most candidates cannot solve this interview problem:<p>Input: "aaaabbbcca"</p><p>Output: [("a", 4), ("b", 3), ("c", 2), ("a", 1)] Write a function that converts the input to the output I ask it in the screening interview and give it 25 minutes How would you solve it?</p></blockquote><p>I thought about it for a few minutes while I was doing other things, came up with the answer, congratulated myself (yay me!) and went on to other things.</p><p>Then it was posted on a tech forum. How would you answer the question? Lots of folks weighed in, all with seemingly (to me) long-winded coding solutions. Surely they didn't realize the genius of &nbsp;my solution in F#! So I posted it.</p><blockquote>In F#, t looks to me like “aaaabbbcca” |&gt; Seq.countBy id;;<br>I don’t know how to make it any simpler than that.</blockquote><p>Once again, I congratulated myself (yay me!) and moved on. Later that day, I logged on again and a commenter was nice enough to give me my comeuppance.</p><blockquote>Unfortunately, this doesn’t return the expected output. That last “a” is what throws a wrench in solutions like this.</blockquote><p>Looking back at that tweet, holy shit! I missed that second "a"! Well hell, this is a completely different kind of problem than I first thought. I'll just copy the input string from the website and bang something out in order to save my honor. A wrong must be righted.</p><p>I spent the next hour or two staring at the code and wondering what the hell is going on. Twenty lines of code and it doesn't compile. Gives me something like:</p><blockquote>error FS0010: Unexpected character '“' in interaction</blockquote><p>Did I cast something the wrong way? I tried recasting things. Did I hose up my environment? I reloaded. Is my code structure off in subtle ways? Nothing I did seemed to work. Finally, out of desperation, I started a new project and re-typed everything in by hand.</p><p>It worked.</p><p>The problem? When I copied and pasted the input code, it was using typographic quotes, not programming quotes. It was a copy-and-paste problem, of the freaking input data, that had defeated me all of that time.</p><p>Once that was out of the way, I kicked out the solution rather quickly, first coding it up as a strongly-typed function and then removing the type restrictions to make it one day a generic library function. As another commenter pointed out, this is classic Run Length Encoding, so that's what I named the function.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>
let runLengthEncode&lt;'a when 'a:equality&gt; inputSeq =
  let rec rleInnerLoop inputSeq acc =
    if inputSeq|&gt;Seq.isEmpty then acc else
    let itemWereWatching=inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head
    let chunk=inputSeq |&gt; Seq.takeWhile itemWereWatching.Equals
    let chunkLength=chunk|&gt;Seq.length
    let newInputSeq = inputSeq |&gt; Seq.skip chunkLength
    let newItem=seq{itemWereWatching, chunkLength}
    rleInnerLoop newInputSeq newItem |&gt; Seq.append acc
  rleInnerLoop inputSeq Seq.empty
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The only type constraint I had was that whatever stream of stuff I'm processing, it has to support equality, or a=b, otherwise how could I remove duplicates? I'm also quite taken back by the size of the code. Now my code was the big honking solution. Yikes!</p><p>Could I shorten it? Well sure, since it's pure FP and written in an idiomatic style, the whole thing could collapse to one line of code. But why do that? All of those labels in there are for my benefit, in case I need to debug. Until I've tested the hell out of it, I need the labels. (Plus the labels and size shouldn't matter to the compiler anyway, if I can collapse it, the compiler should be able to collapse it)</p><p>But something about this feels odd to me, as if it were one of those situations where non-idiomatic code might be better for performance reasons. That's what happens under-the-hood with some F# library functions. For now, though, I'll let the library guys worry about optimization and I'm stay happy with a solved problem. yay me</p><p>Of course I have to write the inverse function, Run Length Decode:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>let runLengthDecode (inputSeq:seq&lt;'a*int&gt;) =
  seq {yield! inputSeq|&gt;Seq.collect(fun x-&gt;Seq.replicate (snd x) (fst x))}
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>That's a lot shorter and makes me happy. When I see functions like the first one I worry that I've gone far afield of the best solution, perhaps by reinventing the wheel. When I see functions like the second one, I am reassured that this is a common problem. Many others have been here before me. (This goes back to my statement that "I need the labels until I've tested the hell out of it" Other people have done the testing work. Woot!)</p><p>What lessons were learned? Well, I really suck at coding in my head. I knew already but continue to be amazed when it happens with only the simplest problems. One of the major points of <a href="https://leanpub.com/info-ops2">Info-Ops II</a> is that our belief in our understanding of the code, no matter what it is, is much more unfounded than founded. Even with "perfect" code, battle-tested and hardened, the most you can say is that it works, it has no bugs, and you can trust it. You can't say you understand all that's going on. Modern programming if far, far too complex for that ever to be true. </p><p>We're all like that, even non-coders. As much as some of us think we can code in our head, it doesn't work that way, even many times with the most trivial of problems. That doesn't stop us, though. There are people who think they can talk at length about deep issues like foreign policy, all the while maintaining a logical and coherent set of symbols. They're being logical. They're running the code they've created in their head. Other folks, though, are not. (Other folks see this the same way, only with the players reversed) </p><p>This is true in policy discussion for the exact same reasons it's true with coding. There's simply too much depth and nuance in language for it to work like code, and even if it did work like code, we'd think we understood far, far more than we actually do. We lose either way.</p><p>Secondly, test cases don't always save you. Yes, my initial mistake was not having test cases, just doing it in my head, but once I had test cases and started coding it out, the major part of my hang-up was dealing with some kind of IDE/OS/Unicode/UTF-8 crap, not the code itself. Doesn't matter, I still would have taken more than the allotted 25 minutes. I do not get the job.</p><p>But I had fun. That made it worth the effort.</p><p>P.S. For those interested in how this all would collapse into one line, here's a hint:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>let runLengthEncode2&lt;'a when 'a:equality&gt; inputSeq =
  let rec rleInnerLoop inputSeq acc = match inputSeq|&gt;Seq.isEmpty with |true-&gt;acc|false-&gt;rleInnerLoop (inputSeq |&gt; Seq.skip ((inputSeq |&gt; Seq.takeWhile (inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head).Equals)|&gt;Seq.length)) (seq{(inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head), ((inputSeq |&gt; Seq.takeWhile (inputSeq |&gt;Seq.head).Equals)|&gt;Seq.length)}) |&gt; Seq.append acc
  rleInnerLoop inputSeq Seq.empty
</code></pre>

When left in the sun, or under a UV lamp for an hour or so, the peroxide bleached out the brown chromophores but left the lignin intact, so the wood turned white.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902789.1612553066!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>Researchers demonstrated after brushing a coat of hydrogen peroxide on the opaque wood material, and exposing it to one hour of sunlight, it turns transparent.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Next, they infused the wood with a tough transparent epoxy designed for marine use, which filled in the spaces and pores in the wood and then hardened.&nbsp;This made the white wood transparent.</p>  <p>You can see a similar effect by taking that same piece of paper towel, dip half of it in water and place it on a patterned surface.&nbsp;The white paper towel will become translucent with light passing through the water and cellulose fibres without being scattered by refraction.</p>  <p>The epoxy in the wood does an even better job, allowing 90 per cent of visible light to pass through.

The clear wood&nbsp;is lighter than glass, with better insulating properties, which is important because windows are a major source of heat loss in buildings. It also might take less energy to manufacture clear wood because there are no high temperatures involved.</p>  <p>Transparent wood could become an alternative to glass in energy efficient buildings, or perhaps coverings for solar panels in harsh environments. There could be no end of uses.</p>      <p>Many different types of wood, from balsa to oak, can be made transparent, and it doesn't matter if it is cut along the grain or against it. If the transparent wood is made a little thicker, it would be strong enough to become part of the structure of a building, so there could be entire transparent wooden walls.</p>  <p>While this technology has yet to&nbsp; be scaled up to industrial levels, the researchers say it has great potential as a new building material. In fact, they say that theoretically, an entire house could be made transparent. It is not clear why anyone would want to live in a transparent house, but for people who do, it would be OK to throw stones…</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5902787.1612553101!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/transparent-wood-qinqin-xia-university-of-maryland.jpg"></p></div><figcaption>A researcher holds up a 10-centimetre long slab of the see-through wood.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Qinqin Xia, University of Maryland/Science Advances)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Images copyright Xia et al.&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" rel="license">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license</a>,&nbsp;</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Competition among businesses is obviously vital to a functioning market. A business that doesn’t have to compete doesn’t have to offer <em>competitive</em> products, pay, etc. Competition on one hand and regulation on the other form an opposing pair of constraints that channels a business’s pursuit of growth, dominance, profit, and development into benefit for society. I posit that the typical root cause of so-called greedy business practices (such as poverty wages, price gouging, lay-offs, cutting costs via human and animal cruelty, environmental pollution, and so on) is not a moral failing of the chief decision-makers, but rather inadequate regulation.</p><p>Yesterday my wife said to me “Kroger is offering to pay $100 to each employee who gets the COVID vaccine. Funny how they’ll do that, but they won’t give hazard pay for working during the pandemic!”.</p><p>“Well, hazard pay would be a lot more expensive, wouldn’t it?”</p><p>“Yes — $4 per hour in Seattle.” So after one week, this would exceed the one-time $100 bonus for full-time employees. “I know it would be costly, but the work is dangerous right now. The employees deserve it.”</p><p>“I agree,” I said, “but to control costs a company can’t pay a whole lot more than the market rate for whatever type of labour it needs. Outspending the competition for the same thing is bad for business.”.</p><p>“I don’t really care what’s bad for business. Paying workers fairly is the right thing to do. The greed required to put profit before ethics is disgusting.”</p><h2 id="whats-bad-for-business">what’s bad for business</h2><p>So, why don’t businesses generally “do the right thing” even if it’s costly? So what if the competition outcompetes them? Winning isn’t everything, right? Sure, but losing <em>is</em> everything. In a stable market, there’s a kind of competitive equilibrium. An uncompetitive company risks being driven out of the market by competitive companies.</p><p>Couldn’t a company just take some money out of profits to pay better, to make more environmentally friendly choices, or whatever? Well, profit makes a company an attractive investment. A company competes not only for customers, but for investors, too. If one company becomes a less attractive investment than its competitors, investors reallocate their investments for better performance. Sacrificing for the greater good <em>is a sacrifice</em>, and the cost is market share.</p><p>Okay, so why don’t businesses make the sacrifice — give up market share or possibly go out of business — in the service of ethics? Because less market share means less power to do the right thing. Companies that have made such sacrifices don’t dominate the market. “Unethical” companies do. One might be able to do the right thing for a little while, but one’s contribution to society will be short-lived.</p><h2 id="whats-bad-for-consumers-and-workers">what’s bad for consumers and workers</h2><p>Some say consumers should vote with their wallets. It feels good to support small local businesses, to boycott sweatshops, to put your money where your morals are. Unfortunately it’s more costly. What Walmart lacks in charm and scruples it makes up for in discounts.</p><p>Other than wealthy consumers who can afford the luxury of consistent ethical choices in the market, the rest of the consumers are in a bind. It’s a matter of preservation of quality of life (or in the extreme, self-preservation) to seek the best deal we can get. The principal form of competition among consumers is not so much “keeping up with the Joneses” as it is making our dollar go as far as everyone else’s. For each ethical spending decision we make, we have less money overall to work with than someone with a similar income who makes the most economically rational choice. So are we going to pay extra for cruelty-free eggs or for cruelty-free clothes? We can’t do this for everything all at once. If <em>all</em> of our purchases are the ethical option, we can’t afford some things that others can afford. Something has to give, and because we are competing with other wage-earners, the result is downward class mobility, a slow spiral into poverty.</p><h2 id="if-not-individual-choices-then-what">If not individual choices, then what?</h2><p>So businesses and consumers both are in a bind where competition dictates that they make economically rational choices or lose. Efficiency is maximised at great environmental and social cost. Individual choices mean squat because “the invisible hand” of the market punishes certain ethical choices and eventually diminishes the influence of ethical agents such that their agency has little effect.</p><p>But what if everyone did the right thing? A market full of agents voluntarily choosing the right thing is wide open for someone to take advantage.</p><p>Okay, but what if everyone <em>had to do the right thing</em>? Consider the minimum wage. Apart from a few egregious loopholes, businesses in most industries have to abide by it. Does Kroger suffer a competitive loss by paying its employees the minimum wage? No, because all of the other grocers have to do likewise. Something still has to give, but it’s not a consumer’s standard of living or a business’s market share. The money really can come out of profits in this case. If it’s coming out of all grocers' profits, investors can’t very well get out of paying for it by divesting from one grocer (or one industry) to invest in another. Almost the whole economy is equally affected, so investors don’t have much of an alternative to taking the loss and moving on. When everyone is forced to make an ethical choice, competitive standing is no longer at stake in making it.</p><h2 id="the-economy-as-a-game">the economy as a game</h2><p>Imagine a sport very much like football (not American hand-egg) wherein there is no such thing as a foul. It would be a perfectly valid (if unethical) strategy to injure the other team relentlessly until they were unable to mount a competent opposition, and then to score goals unchallenged for the remaining time. (Trust me - as a kid, I tested this strategy in Fifa 98 with fouls turned off.)</p><p>Well, perhaps not unethical if you consider that the risk would be obvious and participation voluntary. Participation in the market is hardly voluntary (apologies to any hunter-gatherers I may offend), though the risks are obvious.</p><p>So how do we achieve the utilitarian outcome of minimising the risk of injury in our sport, given that everyone is entered into this tournament at birth? We could just try to play ethically on an individual basis, or try to shift the general attitudes of many players against violence. But the people who kick shins will end up playing the most matches in this tournament, because their strategy still works. We choose to lose by abstaining from exploitation individually, so we choose to allow the shin-kickers to dominate. We’re in a bind. The “ethical” choice does not fix the systemic problem that causes the bad outcome. With this set of rules, either choice leads to the same bad outcome. Well, obviously we need to reinstate the foul rule! If it’s impossible to win by kicking shins, there ceases to be any competitive advantage in doing so, and we can all benefit from a game with less shin-kicking.</p><p>Choosing ethically in commerce may assuage our guilt, but it does not make the world a better place. Regulations would actually make a difference.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>The Mediocre Programmer? What's that?</p>
<p>The Mediocre Programmer is a book about the journey of becoming a better programmer. But before we can become better programmers we have to pass through being mediocre programmers. Mediocre doesn't mean a bad programmer --- far from it. It means lacking skill. As beginners we start our journey full of fresh ideas of how we'll be great programmers, but as we learn more we realize that the gap between being a beginner and an expert programmer requires us to be mediocre for a time. And that period of mediocrity can be frustrating. As beginning programmers we're given all the encouragement to explore and make mistakes. As we move to the intermediate and mediocre stages of programming that encouragement fades. Instead of encouragement we are faced with expectations, both from ourselves and from others. We start to question our abilities. Why do we have to keep looking things up? Shouldn't we already know this? Why does programming feel like a struggle? Am I ever going to be good at this? </p>
<p>This book is about helping you along on the journey of being a mediocre programmer. Together we'll uncover some of common misconceptions we have about programming, failure, and growth and come to understand that the act of programming and development is something we undertake each day and improve in small ways. It's these small changes that over time transform us from being mediocre programmers into better programmers.</p>
<p>There are plenty of books on how to become a better programmer out there. Books like this tend to have checklists and other advice that the author deems important enough for you to do in order to become a better programmer. They tend to focus on specific improvements like choosing a better editor, writing better test cases, or drinking lots of water. Those books have lots of useful advice, but they read like a laundry list of things that you must do all at once in order to succeed. This book will try not to saddle you with more work (you likely have enough as it is). Rather, we'll discuss what it feels like to be a programmer. We'll talk about the emotions in being a programmer; the feelings of frustration, guilt, anger, and inadequacy. We'll cover the struggles in learning new things and keeping your skills current. We'll talk about those times when you feel like giving up and walking away from computing and whether those feelings come from a place of love or a worry that you're not keeping up.</p>
<p>This book is a personal journey for both of us. It's a memoir of my time as a programmer and my feelings along the way. I've thought many times about giving up and finding a different career path but doing anything other than being a computer programmer scares me even more. Does that mean I'm stuck in a perverse ouroboros of self-pity and self-doubt? Hardly. It means that I need to dig deeper to understand why I chose the path of being a programmer and realize that it took a lot to get here and it's going to take a lot more to get where I want to be. It's a commitment to seeing things as they are now and moving forward from wherever I'm standing.</p>
<p>I hope you'll join me on this journey.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Day One - Exiting the Pyramid</strong></p><p>On December 17, I stopped eating for seven days. I consumed nothing but water, coffee, and an occasional pinch of salt. I did it to achieve cellular regeneration, spiritual contemplation, and a temporary break in my furious, constant consumption of every calorie within ten feet.</p><p>I was following in the footsteps of a man who tried to starve himself to death. In 1887, Dr. Henry S. Tanner stopped eating, having apparently decided that he deserved an agonizing demise after failures in marriage and business. As the first few famished days passed, he wondered when the sweet release of death would cease its tardiness. But, by the tenth day, he didn’t feel hungry anymore—in fact, felt vigorous and healthy. He saw no reason to stop fasting, and, in the end, fasted for a month, before repeating the feat repeatedly in the presence of puzzled doctors.</p><p>However, though Dr. Tanner did much to popularize fasting in the modern era, he wasn’t my immediate inspiration. I’d been influenced to try water fasting by friends in the tech sector, where fasting has become something of a trend. Not everyone is happy about this. The Harper’s Bazaar article “<a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/beauty/diet-fitness/a28577713/silicon-valley-fasting/">Inside Silicon Valley’s Dangerous New Obsession with Fasting</a>,” for example, claims that fasting is merely disordered eating rebranded and that its tech sector purveyors are being unjustly lauded for habits that are condemned in teen girls. There’s also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/21/extreme-fasting-how-silicon-valley-is-rebranding-eating-disorders">this one</a>, and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/01/silicon-valley-extreme-diets-fasting/581566/">this one</a>, and many other works of literature penned by the nutrition and psychology experts of progressive Twitter.</p><p>They’re all mostly wrong. They’re also probably somewhat culturally motivated; it’s hard to imagine any of these publications putting out something called The Dark Side of Ramadan: Inside the Muslim World’s Dangerous Obsession with Fasting.</p><p>But I don’t blame them for being wrong. Their opinions are to be expected. They’ve been educated by a culture that teaches you the gospel of three meals a day, every day—that constant eating is a necessity for happiness. From birth, they’ve been pumped full of propaganda prepared by agribusiness and government, including conceptual ideas like the Food Pyramid, that compellingly geometric menu that has dug many an early grave. If I told them, or, really, most anyone off the street that I wasn’t going to eat for seven days, they’d probably wonder if I were committing suicide.</p><p>But fasting for surprisingly long periods of time <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6314618/">doesn't actually seem dangerous</a>, for most. In a sense, this finding is obvious; if human beings weren’t able to use our fat stores to survive, we wouldn’t have made it out of the ancestral environment, where occasional scarcity was simply a given.</p><p>However, fasting <em>is</em> hazardous, in a way. It punches this weird food-shaped hole in consensus reality. Doing it can change the way you think about, at the very least, food, disease, and the progress of science—which is to say, a big chunk of human life.</p><p>Oh, and, at times, it does totally suck. The first day is tricky. Your body is trained by your normal habits, developing hunger pangs in response to the release of a hormone called ghrelin. When you just skip all of that day’s meals, the ghrelin assault is uncomfortable. But then you sit through it, and your hunger pangs just… go away, leaving you, mysteriously, alive.</p><p><strong>Day Two - Big Nothing</strong></p><p>Sometimes, I wish there were a Big Nothing lobby—some sort of agency devoted to studying what would happen if we did less. For example, let’s say the government became fixated on some problem with social welfare. Is there anyone to study what would happen if we did nothing? Would it just get better on its own? Similarly, what would happen if, in response to population-level health issues, instead of taking supplements or treatments, we just ate nothing for an interval?</p><p>Unfortunately, profit motives rule out this potential world. There is no Nothing Lobby. Which is a shame, because if Pfizer or Merck stumbled upon a drug that could do half of what fasting appears to, their entire R&amp;D apartments would be frothing at the mouth and gripping their calipers tightly.&nbsp;</p><p>Though it’s touted as a weight loss intervention, fasting’s health effects go way beyond that. When you read the fasting literature, you have all these moments of, like, <em>what, really? </em>For example, if you come down with cancer, you might want to fast, because <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048045/">fasting appears to protect the body during chemotherapy, allowing higher doses of radiation to be administered with fewer side effects.</a> On the other hand, maybe you should’ve fasted earlier: studies in mice suggest that fasting <a href="https://osher.ucsf.edu/patient-care/integrative-medicine-resources/cancer-and-nutrition/faq/cancer-and-fasting-calorie-restriction">might be effective in slowing or preventing tumor growth</a>. If you’re just not interested in getting sick at all, you should know that <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/abstract/S1934-5909(14)00151-9">fasting appears to promote the generation of new white blood cells, thus potentially reinvigorating the immune system</a>. It could also keep you sharp, and by that I mean keep you sharp when you’re 80 years old. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3106288/">Fasting appears to promote neuronal health, potentially making it a defense against neurodegenerative diseases</a>.</p><p>But, if weight loss is what you’re looking for, supervised fasting appears to be strikingly effective. For example, in 1965, a 456lb man named Angus Barbieri went without eating for a year with no apparent negative consequences, went down to around 180, and kept the weight off for his whole life. And, while this result is uncommon in degree, a brief peak at <a href="http://reddit.com/r/fasting">reddit.com/r/fasting</a> reveals that it’s not unusual in kind.</p><p>We maybe understand why this happens. It seems to be down to autophagy—literally, self-ingestion. Your body constantly recycles old material, but, when you’re fasting, that process is dramatically accelerated. Old cells are broken down. Excess fat is turned into ketone bodies so the brain can continue operating. (Many who lose weight during fasting are surprised to find that they don’t have loose skin because their bodies literally ate it.) After all of the old stuff is recycled, the hypothesis goes, your body functions better.</p><p>But, overall, we’re still ignorant of the mechanisms of water fasting, despite the fact that it’s been advocated for thousands of years—Pythagoras required it of his students, finding that it promoted lucidity and focus. We don’t know what the ideal fasting protocol is. We don’t exactly understand its effects on longevity. It’s possible that repeat fasts in a short period of time could be damaging, specifically to the kidneys—where exactly are the healthy limits? We don’t know.</p><p>Several luminaries of the fasting scene, which is a thing that exists, have figured out how to make money off Nothing. One prominent advocate of no food, Dr. Jason Fung, sells highly readable books on fasting and helps run <a href="http://thefastingmethod.com/">a clinic</a> that coaches people through the fasting lifestyle. Another, Dr. Valter Longo, also sells books, as well as <a href="https://prolonfast.com/">ready-made meals</a> which are low-calorie enough to help fasters maintain a fasting state, but nutritive enough to make the process more tolerable.</p><p>This is all great, but, for the time being, the Nothing Lobby will be eclipsed by the mountains of cash involved in soybean oil, corn syrup, dietary supplements, and bariatric surgeries. And so, for the foreseeable future, fasting may remain poorly-explained and under-promoted, a personal rebellion against the entrenched interests undermining our health.</p><p>Perhaps this should make us furious. I know a fair number of fat people who want to lose weight. They’re given diets that don’t work, supplements that don’t work, and then shamed, which also doesn’t work. But, as it turns out, they might not need any of that. With medical supervision, they could probably solve the problem by not eating for a month or two. It could be a really shitty month or two—but better than struggling for decades, if losing weight is what you want to do. But if they read Harper’s Bazaar, or other maintainers of the dietary Overton Window, they might be dissuaded from even investigating this possibility.</p><p>On day two, fasting is doing weird things to me. Usually, I’m hot all over, but, without calories, my extremities go through thermal alternation—my nose is cold, then hot again. My breath smells great, then awful. At random moments, I’m seized by waves of incredible energy, thoughts of conquest, and the lust for food. At other moments, I lust for nothing and dwell in profound neutrality. I’m more diurnal; whereas I normally tend towards nocturnal activity, I wake with the sun, and my energy plunges the moment it’s dark.</p><p><strong>Day Three - First Principles</strong></p><p>Perhaps one reason that fasting has become popular in Silicon Valley is that it’s an applied crash course in First Principles Thinking. This term has only become a tired cliche in tech circles because it’s a principle that’s served so effectively in the past. The best (and worst) technological innovations have come from asking questions so basic only a curious child or a frenzied entrepreneur would think to ask them, and the process continues today. We don’t live on Mars. Why? We have to drive our cars. Why? We should eat a shit-ton of food every day, without interruption. Why?</p><p>The reason is not immediately apparent. On the third day of my fast, I wake up feeling fine, if still not totally normal. There is this basic knowledge that my bowels are empty. My interior feels strikingly vacant. But, generally, my physical condition is less notable than it was the day before.</p><p>What’s more notable is how surreal it all is. Our days are broken up by meals and punctuated by snacks. Once you take that away, what’s left?&nbsp;</p><p>Great expanses of time. The day just goes on and on and on. In that ocean of minutes, I’m unusually productive. Uninterrupted by the 100,000 snack breaks I usually take in a day, I double my usual daily writing output. Moreover, I’m weirdly focused. The energy that would usually go into digesting fistfuls of random stuff from the fridge is being directed into my laptop.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a change in mood, too. Most emotion drops away, positive and negative. I’m not interested in listening to fun …</p></div></div>

Well, I spent the next year struggling to reconcile this view with my startup at the time, which was focused on building a passion economy solution for indie developers. And while I am very proud of everything I built with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://saasify.sh/">Saasify</a>, the platform itself hit some <a href="https://transitivebullsh.it/saasify-vc-feedback">major roadblocks</a>. I had my founder blinders on (which can be both good and bad depending on the circumstances) and felt weighed down by the sunk costs I'd already put into bootstrapping Saasify.</p><p>I needed a change of pace. To reflect. To <a href="https://transitivebullsh.it/saasify-key-takeaways">revisit my assumptions</a> and explore what got me excited about this space in the first place.</p><h3 data-id="9858840eb22546f8997ea1174cb393f2"><a href="#9858840eb22546f8997ea1174cb393f2" title="And that, folks, brings me to today"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>And that, folks, brings me to today</span></h3><p>The idea of moving towards a more independent <em>and</em> fulfilling future of work just aligns so well with my values that I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.</p><p>I've spent the past few months voraciously researching, networking, and thinking about the passion economy. I think this is a very important step in the creative process for founders to develop their own deep, holistic understanding of a space before diving into building products and solutions (a mistake I've fallen prey to in the past).</p><p>And I'm absolutely loving it.</p><p>Regardless of where this journey takes me, I know that I'm thoroughly enjoying the ride. I believe that as long as I control my own destiny and am passionate about the space / journey / people, then great things are bound to happen along the way.</p><p>And this is a large part of why the passion economy resonates with me on such a deep and personal level.</p><h3 data-id="01566e9d19ec4c9ab85842fff9e07baf"><a href="#01566e9d19ec4c9ab85842fff9e07baf" title="Open Source Sustainability"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Open Source Sustainability</span></h3><div><p>After <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/transitive-bullshit">nearly 20 years of contributing to open source</a>, I started this journey originally focused on the problem of open source sustainability.</p></div><p>For many software developers, open source is like the wild west. It represents a completely open territory to explore and paint my ideas upon with no rules or regulations. This has led to some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://coss.media/">unbelievably successful commercial open source products</a> being built that would've otherwise been very difficult to bring to market in a more traditional, closed source world. It's also led to an amazing amount of long-tail value creation and experimentation in the form of smaller OSS projects that have found insane amounts of adoption around the world.</p><p>I think it's safe to say that open source software has had profound effects on the world, but as with many passion projects, the key difficulty lies in making your passion sustainable. When you start off working on a project, it's almost always out of intrinsic motivation; that is to say, it's because you're excited about something and want to scratch your own itch. As your project(s) grow in popularity and usage over time, you inevitably get more and more support requests and people complaining about bugs or missing features. What started as a purely intrinsic passion project has now become a burden, and the only real way to reconcile this problem is to introduce extrinsic motivation (usually in the form of money or followers) that will help you sustain your interest in growing a community around your work.</p><p>There are tens of thousands of these talented indie devs out there who are passionate about open source. And more generally, there are millions of talented creators out there who are passionate about their own creative outlets, whether they be music, videos, teaching, writing, art, comedy, and so much more.</p><h3 data-id="72ec651bcfb54da9829c85fc7f70474f"><a href="#72ec651bcfb54da9829c85fc7f70474f" title="Human passion is universal"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Human passion is universal</span></h3><p>This brings me back to the passion economy and its cool cousin, the creator economy.</p><p>I fundamentally believe in the boundless potential of humanity. I know that sounds a little idealistic and bullshit-y, but you're literally reading a blog called Transitive Bullshit...</p><p>One thing that I find so much beauty in is all of the different ways that human creativity and passion manifest themselves.</p><p>No matter where you are in the world..</p><p>No matter what your background is..</p><p>No matter what your motivations are..</p><p>No matter what your creative outlets are..</p><p>No matter who you are..</p><p>The internet and platforms built on the internet unlock so much hidden opportunity for you.</p><p>Human passion is truly universal, and the internet is the ultimate tool to unlock the power of human creativity on a scale that is hard to comprehend. In this respect, I believe that we're still in the very early stages of discovering all of the second &amp; third order effects that the internet will have on humanity. I also love thinking about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html">humanity as a species that is experiencing an unprecedented rate of exponential evolution</a> and how fundamental forces like the internet, AI, and human passion are driving this evolution forward. It's an exciting time to be alive.</p><p>And these days, there are just so many inspirational stories out there of people striving to better themselves and help their audiences in unique, authentic, and creative ways.</p><p>Human passion and creativity are truly universal, and we're seeing a long-term change in the way people view their passions and creative outlets versus traditional work.</p><figure><div><p><img src="data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAAAQAgCdASoQAA8ABUB8JbACsAERHzma9luAAP7v0t51jxw+/73aT08qIIRPHhVPfeRNAwJmGw5TOmQU0dwRAnPsxOGEaUzsAAA=" alt="Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life Might Just Help You Live a More Fulfilling Life" width="1124" height="1063" decoding="async"><img src="https://ssfy.io/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.notion.so%2Fimage%2Fhttps%253A%252F%252Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%252Fsecure.notion-static.com%252Ff89a085d-937e-49bd-9aac-a8a4fcb10f40%252FUntitled.png%3Ftable%3Dblock%26id%3D95d34e25-7272-433e-8960-b302309e5a07%26cache%3Dv2" alt="Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life Might Just Help You Live a More Fulfilling Life" width="1124" height="1063" decoding="async" loading="lazy"></p></div><figcaption><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/ikigai-the-japanese-secret-to-a-long-and-happy-life-might-just-help-you-live-a-more-fulfilling-9871d01992b7">Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life Might Just Help You Live a More Fulfilling Life</a></figcaption></figure><h3 data-id="68733797765f454d9ddcc2abaf2a6658"><a href="#68733797765f454d9ddcc2abaf2a6658" title="Passion First, Economy Second"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Passion First, Economy Second</span></h3><p>I was recently listening to a Clubhouse room where <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/ljin18">Li Jin</a> (no surprise! haha) was interviewing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/allenlau">Allen Lau</a>, the co-founder of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.wattpad.com/">Wattpad</a>, a platform that makes it easy for writers to share stories, which just sold for $600M. One of the things which stood out for me was something Allen said about passion always coming first, and monetization coming second.</p><blockquote>"99% of people who write are motivated by their fanbase and engagement. Only a small portion really go into things focused on monetization." (Allen Lau)</blockquote><p>This is an incredibly important point to keep in mind, especially for founders building solutions in this space that naturally tend to focus on reducing barriers to monetization — because it's easier to get funding for products with clear monetization models.</p><p>This naturally leads to the question: is the "passion economy" even a good thing? Should our passions remain our passions and our work remain our work?</p><p>I think there's no one answer to this, but I can share two key insights that have really clicked with me recently.</p><p>The first insight is Li's answer to this question. She is a strong proponent of consumer choice and enabling the option to monetize as opposed to it being full of friction, and I couldn't agree with this more. The easier you make the option of monetizing your passion via different methods and platforms, the more creators will experiment with these solutions and naturally find a healthy balance that works for them.</p><p>The second insight comes from this article: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/my-product-is-my-garden/">my product is my garden</a>. The author does a great job exploring different forms of monetization and sustainability around his love for building software side projects. In the end, he views his work as a garden and finds peace in the process of tending to his garden.</p><h3 data-id="0d7a2eaa371b4ef3bd2b9c5688b300c3"><a href="#0d7a2eaa371b4ef3bd2b9c5688b300c3" title="Inspiration comes in many forms"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7.775 3.275a.75.75 0 001.06 1.06l1.25-1.25a2 2 0 112.83 2.83l-2.5 2.5a2 2 0 01-2.83 0 .75.75 0 00-1.06 1.06 3.5 3.5 0 004.95 0l2.5-2.5a3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95-4.95l-1.25 1.25zm-4.69 9.64a2 2 0 010-2.83l2.5-2.5a2 2 0 012.83 0 .75.75 0 001.06-1.06 3.5 3.5 0 00-4.95 0l-2.5 2.5a3.5 3.5 0 004.95 4.95l1.25-1.25a.75.75 0 00-1.06-1.06l-1.25 1.25a2 2 0 01-2.83 0z"></path></svg></a><span>Inspiration comes in many forms</span></h3><p>As I continue to explore the passion economy and the future of work, I'm actively looking to connect with other co-founders, developers, creators, and builders who are excited about this space.</p><p>I try to always keep in mind how small my view of the world is, so I'm looking to meet other passionate folks who will bring their own unique insights to the table in order to challenge my assumptions.</p><p>I'm particularly interested in building solutions that will help enable a more independent and fulfilling future of work. I believe that helping ambitious creators and domain experts to follow their passions via more sustainable, frictionless business models is one of the most important, impactful, and universal problems that we are uniquely poised to solve today.</p><p>This is a pretty grandiose mission when you think about it. It has a lot of overlap with:</p><ul><li>Traditional VC models of enabling entrepreneurship</li></ul><ul><li>Influencers and the future of media and entertainment</li></ul><ul><li>Evolving the concept of work from full-time employment to more flexible, lightweight models</li></ul><ul><li>Making knowledge more accessible at scale</li></ul><p>And finally, as an anime otaku myself, I wanted to leave you with one last bit of inspiration coming from an entirely different field.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                


<p>So, I moved places this year and for the first couple of weeks I used the
fritzbox 7350 from my ISP. While it’s good, it lacks the flexibility that I want
in my home network. I like some VLANs, some options to play with and a solid
control on my firewall.</p>

<h2>The hunt for a replacement</h2>

<p>My ISP has 3 requirements for a router:</p>

<ul>
<li>be able to build up a PPP connection,</li>
<li>support VLAN 10 tagging,</li>
<li>have Gigabit Ethernet ports (otherwise, the speed will be limited to 100 Mbps).</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve used an Ubiquiti Edgerouter lite 3 before of which I’m quite happy. It
offers a lot of solid features at a good pricepoint (and with some hacking, <a href="https://openwrt.org/toh/ubiquiti/edgerouter.lite#flash_layout">can
be flashed with other
OSes</a>). Some
router with good support for OpenWRT would also be a good fit.</p>

<p>But hearing some good things about the <a href="https://pcengines.ch/apu2.htm">PCEngine
APU2</a> boards (and it’s relatives) and it being
x86, offering most Linux flavors as OS and having quite the community behind
them, I ended up picking the <a href="https://pcengines.ch/apu2e4.htm">APU2E4</a>. This
mainly because the ,theoretically more performant Intel i210AT NIC vs Intel
i211AT NIC in the other models and with 3 ethernet ports I have enough.</p>

<h2>Installing Nixos</h2>

<p>After waiting a couple of days, all equipment has arrived and I can start
installing Nixos. This is easy enough:</p>

<ol>
<li>Construct the APU in it’s enclosure and mount the mSata drive</li>
<li>Flash Nixos image on USB drive</li>
<li>Insert USB drive in APU2</li>
<li>Connect console cable to APU</li>
<li>Boot (read the notes below)</li>
<li>Select the USB drive</li>
<li>Install Nixos according to the <a href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#ch-installation">installation guide</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some remarks on the installation process:
* When booting, hit tab to edit the boot entry. Normally Nixos does not output to
  serial in the boot process, so we need to enable is by appending
  <code>console=ttyS0,115200</code> to the boot entry. All characters appear twice, so just
  make sure you type it correctyl ;) . <code>ctrl+l</code> can be used to refresh the screen.
* After installing, you want to make sure that the <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixos-hardware/blob/master/pcengines/apu/default.nix">PCEngine
  APU</a>
  entry from the Nixos hardware repo is present, as it enables the console port.</p>

<h2>Configuring as a router</h2>

<p>So, now we have an embedded device with Nixos, so lets turn this into a router.
First thing we’ll need to do is enable IP forwarding on this machine, since we’ll
definitely forward packets.</p>

<pre><code>boot.kernel.sysctl = {
  # if you use ipv4, this is all you need
  "net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding" = true;

  # If you want to use it for ipv6
  "net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding" = true;

  # source: https://github.com/mdlayher/homelab/blob/master/nixos/routnerr-2/configuration.nix#L52
  # By default, not automatically configure any IPv6 addresses.
  "net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_ra" = 0;
  "net.ipv6.conf.all.autoconf" = 0;
  "net.ipv6.conf.all.use_tempaddr" = 0;

  # On WAN, allow IPv6 autoconfiguration and tempory address use.
  "net.ipv6.conf.${name}.accept_ra" = 2;
  "net.ipv6.conf.${name}.autoconf" = 1;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Next up, lets configure some interfaces. The physical interfaces won’t be used by
me. I need a <code>wan</code> interface to handle the WAN side of the router. It’s couple to
the <code>wan</code> VLAN and doesn’t use DHCP since I’ll be setting up PPPoE on top of it.
And then we also have a <code>lan</code> and <code>iot</code> interface and VLAN, each we assign a
static IP to.</p>

<pre><code>networking = {
  useDHCP = false;
  hostName = "router";
  nameserver = [ "&lt;DNS IP&gt;" ];
  # Define VLANS
  vlans = {
    wan = {
      id = 10;
      interface = "enp1s0";
    };
    lan = {
      id = 20;
      interface = "enp2s0";
    };
    iot = {
      id = 90;
      interface = "enp2s0";
    };
  };

  interfaces = {
    # Don't request DHCP on the physical interfaces
    enp1s0.useDHCP = false;
    enp2s0.useDHCP = false;
    enp2s0.useDHCP = false;
    
    # Handle the VLANs
    wan.useDHCP = false;
    lan = {
      ipv4.addresses = [{
        address = "10.1.1.1";
        prefixLength = 24;
      }];
    };
    iot = {
      ipv4.addresses = [{
        address = "10.1.90.1";
        prefixLength = 24;
      }];
    };
  }:
};
</code></pre>

<p>So after a <code>nixos-rebuild switch</code>, we should see all the interfaces and vlans
appear with the settings we specified. As mentioned before, I need a PPPoE
session. Luckily, Nixos makes this incredibly easy:</p>

<pre><code># setup pppoe session
services.pppd = {
  enable = true;
  peers = {
    edpnet = {
      # Autostart the PPPoE session on boot
      autostart = true;
      enable = true;
      config = ''
        plugin rp-pppoe.so wan
        
        # pppd supports multiple ways of entering credentials,
        # this is just 1 way
        name "${secrets.pppoe.username}"
        password "${secrets.pppoe.pass}"

        persist
        maxfail 0
        holdoff 5

        noipdefault
        defaultroute
      '';
    };
  };
};
</code></pre>

<p>When the system starts up <code>pppd-edpnet.service</code>, you should now see a <code>ppp0</code>
interface with an IP address (note: if you already have a default gateway set on
the system when the PPPoE seesion comes online, it <strong>will not</strong> replace the
degault gateway).<br>
Now onto the firewall configuration. I prefer to use
<a href="https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page">nftables</a>. So let’s
disable the Nixos firewall and enable nftables.</p>

<pre><code>networking = {
  ...
  nat.enable = false;
  firewall.enable = false;
  nftables = {
    enable = true;
  };
};
</code></pre>

<p>And then we can setup a straight forward <code>nftables</code> ruleset for a basic firewall.
The <code>iot</code> vlan will get locked down, when we add devices to this later, we’ll
open op the vlan as is needed.</p>

<pre><code>networking = {
  ...
  nftables = {
    ...
    ruleset = ''
      table ip filter {
        # enable flow offloading for better throughput
        flowtable f {
          hook ingress priority 0;
          devices = { ppp0, lan };
        }

        chain output {
          type filter hook output priority 100; policy accept;
        }

        chain input {
          type filter hook input priority filter; policy drop;

          # Allow trusted networks to access the router
          iifname {
            "lan",
          } counter accept

          # Allow returning traffic from ppp0 and drop everthing else
          iifname "ppp0" ct state { established, related } counter accept
          iifname "ppp0" drop
        }
        
        chain forward {
          type filter hook forward priority filter; policy drop;

          # enable flow offloading for better throughput
          ip protocol { tcp, udp } flow offload @f

          # Allow trusted network WAN access
          iifname {
                  "lan",
          } oifname {
                  "ppp0",
          } counter accept comment "Allow trusted LAN to WAN"

          # Allow established WAN to return
          iifname {
                  "ppp0",
          } oifname {
                  "lan",
          } ct state established,related counter accept comment "Allow established back to LANs"
      }

      table ip nat {
        chain prerouting {
          type nat hook output priority filter; policy accept;
        }

        # Setup NAT masquerading on the ppp0 interface
        chain postrouting {
          type nat hook postrouting priority filter; policy accept;
          oifname "ppp0" masquerade
        } 
      }
    '';
  };
};
</code></pre>

<p>This should cover a fairly basic <code>nftables</code> ruleset that offers internet
connectivity to <code>lan</code> and locks <code>iot</code> completely to local connections only. At
the end, lets install some handy packages for a router.</p>

<pre><code>environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  vim                 # my preferred editor
  htop                # to see the system load
  ppp                 # for some manual debugging of pppd
  ethtool             # manage NIC settings (offload, NIC feeatures, ...)
  tcpdump             # view network traffic
  conntrack-tools     # view network connection states
];
</code></pre>

<h2>DHCP server</h2>

<p>So, now that we got the routing part set up, we need to make sure that devices
that plug into these networks can get some IP addresses. For this, we spin up a
quick DHCP server on the router (or any other compute connected to the networks).</p>

<pre><code>services.dhcpd4 = {
    enable = true;
    interfaces = [ "lan" "iot" ];
    extraConfig = ''
      option domain-name-servers 10.5.1.10, 1.1.1.1;
      option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;

      subnet 10.1.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        option broadcast-address 10.1.1.255;
        option routers 10.1.1.1;
        interface lan;
        range 10.1.1.128 10.1.1.254;
      }

      subnet 10.1.90.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
        option broadcast-address 10.1.90.255;
        option routers 10.1.90.1;
        option domain-name-servers 10.1.1.10;
        interface iot;
        range 10.1.90.128 10.1.90.254;
      }
    '';
  };
</code></pre>

<h2>Performance tuning</h2>

<p>The squeeze the most out of this timy box, I played around a bit with some
interrupt steering and packet handling settings. After a few minutes I found what
seemed to work optimally for me and wrote up this little script that is called at
startup. It sets the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/performance_tuning_guide/s-cpu-irq">smp
affinity</a>
and
<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/performance_tuning_guide/network-rps">RPS</a>.
Generally, you want to avoid CPU core handling the HW interrupts from SMP
affinity for RPS.</p>

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env sh

smp1=8
rps1=7
smp2=8
rps2=7

# set balancer for enp1s0

<p>Hardly anyone nowadays believes the earth is flat. Many people, however, wrongly believe that people during the Middle Ages <em>thought</em> the world was flat. In reality, however, the sphericity of the earth was common knowledge throughout the entire Middle Ages. The idea that people in the Middle Ages thought the earth was flat is a canard invented in the Early Modern Period by authors who wanted to portray the Middle Ages as a time of backwardness and superstitious regression.</p>



<p><strong>Origins of the model of the spherical earth</strong></p>



<p>There really was a time when people did believe that the earth was flat, but it was long, <em>long</em> before the Middle Ages. Prior to around 500 BC or thereabouts, it seems most people believed that the earth was flat like a table and that the sky was a dome covering it. This, for instance, seems to have been the worldview of the ancient Sumerians and other early Mesopotamians, the pharaonic Egyptians, and the authors of the Hebrew Bible.</p>



<p>Interestingly, although the authors of the Hebrew Bible seem to agree that the earth is flat, they don’t seem to have had a clear impression of what shape it is. You can find contradictions about the shape of the earth even within the same book. For instance, the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+11%3A12&amp;version=NRSV">Book of Isaiah 11:12</a> mentions there being “four corners of the earth,” which makes it sound as though the earth is flat and shaped like a square. The <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+40%3A22&amp;version=NRSV">Book of Isaiah 40:22</a>, however, describes the earth as a “circle”:</p>



<blockquote><p>“It is he who sits above the circle of the earth,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers;<br>who stretches out the heavens like a curtain,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spreads them like a tent to live in;”</p></blockquote>



<p>The early Greeks believed that the earth was flat too. The prevailing view among the early Greeks seems to have been that the earth was disc-shaped:</p>



<ul><li>The <em>Iliad </em>and the <em>Odyssey </em>describe the world as flat, with the Underworld lying beneath the ground and Tartaros lying beneath the Underworld.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The philosopher Anaximenes of Miletos (lived c. 586&nbsp;– c. 526 BC) describes the earth in fragment 13.A.6 as “πλατεῖαν μάλα,” which means “very flat.”</li></ul>



<ul><li>The philosopher Anaxagoras of Klazomenai (lived c. 510&nbsp;– c. 428&nbsp;BC) repeatedly describes the earth in his surviving fragments as “πλατείας,” meaning “flat.”</li></ul>



<ul><li>The poet Empedokles of Akragas (lived c. 494&nbsp;– c. 434&nbsp;BC) describes the earth in fragment 31.A.56 as “κυκλοτερής,” which means “circular” or “disc-shaped.”</li></ul>



<p>We do not know who the first person to propose the notion of the sphericity of the earth was. The Greek biographer Diogenes Laërtios, who lived in around the third century AD, cites conflicting reports in his book <em>The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers</em> claiming that the sphericity of the earth was discovered by the poet Hesiodos of Askre (lived c. eighth century BC), by the philosopher Pythagoras of Samos (lived c. 570&nbsp;– c. 495&nbsp;BC), or by the philosopher Parmenides of Elea (lived c. 515 – late fifth century BC). Here is the passage in question, <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=D.+L.+8.1">as translated by R.D. Hicks</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Favorinus says that our philosopher [i.e. Pythagoras] used definitions throughout the subject matter of mathematics ; their use was extended by Socrates and his disciples, and afterwards by Aristotle and the Stoics. Further, we are told that he was the first to call the heaven the universe and the earth spherical, though Theophrastus says it was Parmenides, and Zeno that it was Hesiod.”</p></blockquote>



<p>All three of these reports are most likely spurious. Hesiodos’s poems have survived and they strongly indicate that he believed the earth was flat. The claim that Pythagoras discovered the sphericity of the earth seems to be based solely on a pseudepigraphical poem written long after the historical Pythagoras’s death. Finally, we know about Parmenides’s cosmology from surviving fragments of his work and from his appearance in Plato’s dialogue <em>Parmenides</em> and he doesn’t seem to have been a round-earther.</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: Photograph <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kapitolinischer_Pythagoras_adjusted.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from Wikimedia Commons</a> of a Roman marble bust of the Greek philosopher Pythagoras on display in the Capitoline Museum. The representation here is fictional; no one knows what Pythagoras really looked like.</em></p>



<p>We do know, however, that, by around the end of the fifth century BC or thereabouts, the sphericity of the earth was common knowledge among educated people in the Greek world. The Athenian philosopher Plato (lived c. 428 – c. 347 BC) explicitly describes the earth as spherical in his<em> Phaidon</em> 108d-109a, in which one of his speakers says this, <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D108">as translated by Harold North Fowler</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>“…the earth is round and in the middle of the heavens, it needs neither the air nor any other similar force to keep it from falling, but its own equipoise and the homogeneous nature of the heavens on all sides suffice to hold it in place; for a body which is in equipoise and is placed in the center of something which is homogeneous cannot change its inclination in any direction, but will remain always in the same position. This, then, is the first thing of which I am convinced.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Plato’s student Aristotle of Stageira (lived 384 – 322 BC), whose writings were widely studied during the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance, presents several cogent arguments for the sphericity of the earth in <a href="https://archive.org/stream/worksaristotle06arisgoog#page/n368/mode/2up">Book Two of his treatise <em>On the Heavens</em></a>, based on empirical evidence:</p>



<ul><li>Gravity pulls all matter towards the center of the earth, which inevitably results in a planet that is roughly spherical.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The earth always casts a circular shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse. A sphere is the only shape that always casts a circular shadow no matter what direction the light is hitting it from.</li></ul>



<ul><li>When a person travels north or south, the stars that are visible change, meaning the surface of the earth must be curved.</li></ul>



<p>Aristotle’s evidence for the sphericity of the earth was so compelling that basically every educated person writing after him accepted the earth as spherical.</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: Photograph <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aristotle_Altemps_Inv8575.jpg">from Wikimedia Commons</a> of a Roman marble bust of Aristotle. The oldest surviving argument for the sphericity of the Earth based on empirical evidence comes from Aristotle</em>.</p>



<p>Perhaps the only Greek flat-earther after Aristotle who is worth mentioning is the philosopher Epikouros of Samos (lived 341 – 270 BC), a younger contemporary of Aristotle who founded his entire philosophy on the rejection of Plato and made a point to disagree with Plato on just about everything he possibly could.</p>



<p>Epikouros probably only embraced flat-earthism because he didn’t have access to a copy of Aristotle’s <i>On the Heavens</i> and he wasn’t aware of the empirical evidence for the sphericity of the earth. If he had had access to a copy of the book, I suspect he probably would have accepted that the earth is a sphere, since he firmly believed in empiricism.</p>

<p><strong>Evidence for belief in a spherical earth during the Middle Ages</strong></p>



<p>Knowledge of the sphericity of the earth did not disappear with the end of classical antiquity in the fifth century AD; on the contrary, sphericity remained well-known among scholars. The Northumbrian monk Bede the Venerable (lived c. 672 – 735 AD) clearly outlines the mainstream position of medieval scholars in his treatise <em>On the Reckoning of Time</em>, which is that the earth is roughly a sphere. Bede writes in chapter 46, as translated by William D. McCready:</p>



<blockquote><p>“We refer to the sphere of the earth, not that it is perfectly spherical in shape, given the great difference of mountains and plains, but that it would constitute a perfectly formed sphere if all of the lines were enclosed in the circumference of its circuit. Hence it is that the stars of the northern region are always visible to us, while southern ones never are. Conversely, these northern stars are never seen in southern regions, owing to the obstruction of the globe of the earth. The country of the Troglodytes, and Egypt, which is adjacent to it, do not see the Great and Little Bear, and Italy does not see Canopus.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Around five hundred years after Bede, a scholar named Johannes de Sacrobosco (lived c. 1195 – c. 1256 AD) wrote an introductory astronomy textbook titled <em>Tractatus de Sphaera</em>, which was used for centuries after his death and has survived to the present day. In the very first chapter, Johannes states that the earth is a sphere and explains how astronomers know this. Here is his explanation, as translated by Lynn Thorndike:</p>



<blockquote><p>“That the earth, too, is round is shown thus. The signs and stars do not rise and set the same for all men everywhere but rise and set sooner for those in the east than for those in the west; and of this there is no other cause than the bulge of the earth. Moreover, celestial phenomena evidence that they rise sooner for Orientals than for westerners.

<p>After reviewing countless resumes at Amazon and in my free time, I was surprised to find that the majority of them lacked substance. It was as if I were living in Aldous Huxley’s <em>Brave New World</em>– where everyone’s story was the same and there was little to no sense of individuality.</p>



<p>This is odd for multiple reasons, but one of the main ones is that in reality, everyone is different. These differences are what define us. Owning your individuality will help you stand out and set you apart from thousands of other applicants that look the same on paper.</p>



<p>Reflecting on my experience, it’s evident that most people don’t personalize their resume enough. And I’m not talking about updating your resume with zany fonts and layouts. I’m talking about leveraging your specific accomplishments and the impact they’ve made.</p>



<p>What’s worse is that a lot of the advice out there focuses on the minutia- font, margin size, keywords etc. Don’t get me wrong, these are important, but what’s more important is effectively conveying your worth through strong personal experiences.</p>



<p>I’m going to explain how you can do this in three steps.</p>



<h3>Why you should care</h3>



<p>According to a 2018 <a href="https://www.theladders.com/static/images/basicSite/pdfs/TheLadders-EyeTracking-StudyC2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, you have an average of <strong>7 seconds</strong> to impress your recruiter before it’s too late.</p>



<p>Your resume is your most important asset in getting you noticed by companies. It’s your first opportunity to make a good impression. Therefore, writing a winning software engineering resume is crucial for landing interviews. This is especially the case at competitive companies like Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc.</p>



<p>So here we go.</p>



<h3>The three steps to writing a winning resume</h3>


<ol>
<li>
<ol id="block-aed15bc6-0960-4d86-ade0-5754af74923e" tabindex="0" role="group" contenteditable="true" aria-multiline="true" aria-label="Block: List" data-block="aed15bc6-0960-4d86-ade0-5754af74923e" data-type="core/list" data-title="List">
<li>Use your accomplishments</li>
<li>Be specific</li>
<li>Add supporting data</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p><em>Note: I won’t be covering how to format your resume in this post. If you need help on that, check out <a href="https://github.com/jakeryang/resume" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jake’s resume</a> as a starting point.</em></p>



<p>Let’s walk through each of these steps by understanding why they’re important, and build up to an example that’s on my actual resume.</p>



<h5>1. Use your accomplishments <img loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" src="https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trophy.png" alt="software-engineering-resume-accomplishments" srcset="https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trophy.png 500w, https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trophy-300x300.png 300w, https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trophy-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 85vw, 500px"></h5>



<p>I’ve seen too many resumes where candidates merely list their job responsibilities as bullet points under their Work Experience. This is absolutely not the way to go.</p>



<p>Responsibilities across software engineering roles are largely the same. They generally include writing testable code, designing systems, integrating software components, etc. Recruiters and hiring managers don’t care about what you were supposed to do; they care about <strong>what</strong> <strong>you</strong> <strong>actually</strong> <strong>accomplished</strong>. Let’s look at an example.</p>



<p><strong>Bad</strong>: <em>“<span>Responsible for designing systems and writing testable code to satisfy customer requirements</span>”</em><br><strong>Better</strong>: <em>“<span>Designed and implemented an internal tool for customers</span>”</em></p>



<p>Notice how I’ve differentiated myself by simply using a personal accomplishment instead of a job responsibility.</p>



<p>Although this is an improvement, it’s not quite there yet. Keep reading to see how we can build on this example by being specific and adding data.</p>


<hr>
<p><strong>What if I don’t have many accomplishments?<br></strong>This is common for college students looking for their first internship or job. I recommend that you focus on highlighting your accomplishments and passion for engineering through <strong>personal projects</strong>.</p>
<hr>



<h5>2. Be specific <img loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" src="https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/detail.png" alt="software-engineering-resume-specifics" srcset="https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/detail.png 500w, https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/detail-300x300.png 300w, https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/detail-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 85vw, 500px"></h5>



<p>It’s all in the details. Details add scope, perspective, and give the recruiter a deeper look into your work. They also give the recruiter additional information for whether you’d be a good fit for the role. Don’t be vague, but at the same time, don’t provide excessive detail.</p>



<p>Let’s further differentiate ourselves by adding specific details to our example from the previous step.</p>



<p><strong>Better</strong>: <em>“Designed and implemented a <span>self-service</span> internal tool for clients <span>to onboard onto CompanyName’s customer relationship management system</span>”</em></p>



<p>Notice how you can now tell that the candidate has experience with CRMs and onboarding automation for clients. This is a lot better than what we started with.</p>



<h5>3. Add supporting data <img loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" src="https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/graph.png" alt="software-engineering-resume-data" srcset="https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/graph.png 500w, https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/graph-300x300.png 300w, https://montywrites.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/graph-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 85vw, 500px"></h5>



<p>Most candidates don’t use data to quantify the impact of their accomplishments. This puts them at a disadvantage because recruiters won’t have much insight into why their accomplishments are important.</p>



<p>Let’s pretend I optimized a web app to reduce page-load latency. What was the impact? Was it a reduction in latency? If so, how much did I reduce it by? It’s important to mention <strong>what</strong> the impact was, and <strong>how much</strong> impact it had.</p>



<p>Let’s wrap up the example by adding data to quantify its impact.</p>



<p><strong>Better</strong>: <em>“Designed and implemented a self-service internal tool for clients to onboard onto CompanyName’s customer relationship management system, <span>reducing client onboarding time by 85% (14 hrs to 2 hrs)</span>“</em></p>



<p>Notice how adding the <strong>what</strong> (reducing client onboarding time) and the <strong>how much</strong> (by 85%) elevate the accomplishment significantly, setting it apart from others.</p>


<hr>
<p><strong>What if I don’t have data for my accomplishments?<br></strong>Do your best to get the data. It’s a bit more challenging if you no longer have access to that data (e.g. you left the company), but you may consider reaching out to your old manager if that’s the case.&nbsp; <strong>Protip</strong>: Always add metrics to your work.</p>
<hr>



<h2>What Now?</h2>



<p>There you have it- three steps to writing a winning resume by focusing on your individual accomplishments. In the words of Winnie the Pooh, “<em>the things that make me different are the things that make me.</em>” So go forth, iterate on your resume, and make it your own.</p>

<p>Published on <span id="pubdate">2021-02-02</span>. Modified on <span id="moddate">2021-02-02</span>.</p>
<p>In my previous article "Why you should migrate everything from Linux to BSD", in the <a href="https://www.unixsheikh.com/articles/why-you-should-migrate-everything-from-linux-to-bsd.html#license">License problems</a> section, I very briefly addressed one of the problems with the GPL license. I have since received a few emails asking for elaboration on the subject, which is what I will try to do in this article.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-the-gpl">What is the GPL?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU Public License (GPL)</a> was created to be the "antithesis" of the standard proprietary license. Any modifications that were made to GPL licensed software required to be given back to the GPL community and any application that used or linked to GPL source code was required to be under the GPL.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the GPL is to disallow incorporation of GPL licensed software into proprietary software.</p>
<p>The GPL is rather complex:</p>
<ul>
    <li>You cannot sell GPL licensed software, but you can charge as much as you want for distributing, supporting, or documenting the software.</li>
    <li>If GPL licensed source code is required for a program to compile, the program must also be under the GPL. Linking statically to a GPL library requires a program to be under the GPL.</li>
    <li>Because the Linux kernel is licensed under the GPL, any code statically linked with the Linux kernel must be GPL licensed itself. This requirement can be avoided by dynamically linking loadable kernel modules. This permits companies to distribute binary drivers, but has the disadvantage that they will only work for a particular versions of the Linux kernel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the complexity of the GPL, its legality is mainly being ignored in many parts of the world in regard to Linux and related software.</p>

<h2 id="hijacking">The GPL encourages "hijacking" and political maneuverings</h2>
<p>The GPL and licenses modeled on it impose the restriction that source code must be distributed or made available for all works that are derivatives of the GNU copyrighted code.</p>
<p>While this may look like a noble strategy, it is a condition that is typically unacceptable for commercial use of software. In practice, it usually ends up hindering free sharing and reuse of code and ideas rather than encouraging it.</p>
<p>One of the problems is that when a company cannot fully control how they share their code, they either don't use the software, or instead try hard to "hijack" the project by political maneuvering, as we have seen with e.g. Red Hat.</p>
<p>Pressure to put proprietary applications on Linux became overwhelming in the beginning of 1990. Such applications often must link with system libraries. The pressure was so great that it resulted in a modified version of the GPL called the LGPL ("Library", since renamed to "Lesser", GPL). The LGPL allows proprietary code to be linked to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_C_Library">GNU C library (glibc)</a>. You do not have to release the source code which has been dynamically linked to an LGPL licensed library. On the other hand, if you statically link an application with glibc, which is what is very often required in embedded systems, you cannot keep your application proprietary, that is, the source must be released.</p>
<p>This kind of restriction sometimes put a company in a sore spot. Instead of releasing source code they try to influence the upstream project by hiring one or more of the developers, and then try to effect the project to make changes upstream that helps the company implement whatever solutions they require. Once this political maneuvering begins it often has very damaging result on the free software community because it doesn't stop there.</p>
<p>One such clear example is Red Hat trying hard to get rid of the <code>/etc</code> configuration directory on Linux.</p>
<p>Red Hat wants this change because in their specific business product for the embedded market, <code>/etc</code> gets in the way. Having Linux as an operating system not depend upon <code>/etc</code> is very important for Red Hat, which is also why they have hardcoded DNS servers from Google, Cloudflare and Quad9 into the systemd-resolved network application, so that it can run completely without any setup in <code>/etc</code>. This is also why they are trying to change the way home directories work and systemd-homed is the first major step in that direction. Getting rid of <code>/etc/passwd</code> and related files is currently one of the top priority projects at Red Hat as that will enable getting rid of the rest of <code>/etc</code> more easily.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the corporate interests of Red Hat is the very reason behind the existence of systemd in the first place. And it is also the very reason why systemd isn't just an init system, but rather has become a huge pile of interdependent building blocks to make "an operating system" that better serves their interests, both in their embedded market and on the other market shares they have.</p>
<p>Red Hat needs these major changes to become an integrated part of the major Linux distributions such that all third party software works on this setup, rather than on the current setup in which Red Hat have to work around a lot of issues, which is both very time consuming and difficult.</p>
<p>As I have already explained in my article <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/the-real-motivation-behind-systemd.html">The real motivation behind systemd</a>, Red Hat addressed several third party projects and tried to convince them to make their projects depend upon systemd, such as the attempts made by Lennart Poettering on <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2011-May/msg00427.html">the Gnome mailing list</a>, and the attempt made by Red Hat developer "keszybz" on the <a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/428">tmux project</a>. Most of these attempts were disguised as technical issues, however when you read the long email correspondence on the Gnome mailing list and elsewhere, the real intent becomes quite clear.</p>
<p>In another example, Red Hat purchased Cygnus, an engineering company that had taken over development of the FSF compiler tools. Cygnus had developed a business model in which they sold support for GNU software. This enabled them to employ some 50 engineers and drive the direction of the programs by contributing the preponderance of modifications.</p>
<p>While the Linux kernel and Linux distributions used to be mainly community driven projects, the corporate interests of some of the major companies has changed this a lot. Some contributions has benefitted the communities, but a lot of maneuverings has not, and currently Linux, as an operating system (not the kernel alone) is undergoing major changes, changes that reach out far beyond the kernel and the GNU tools.</p>
<p>This kind of "hijacking" and political maneuverings never happen with a permissive license like the BSD or MIT licenses.</p>
<p>With a permissive license the company can do whatever they want. The situation never arises in which it becomes a part of their interest to "hijack" the upstream project or directly influence they way it is going.</p>
<p>On the contrary, companies who benefit from the permissive license often contribute code back to the project because it is in their interest to have their contributions available in the source code, while at the same time they keep "specific company related" changes private.</p>
<p><a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a>, which is release under a permissive license, and which originally is a project started at Apple in 2005, is another really good example of the problems with the GPL. GCC is licensed under the terms of the GPL version 3, which requires developers who distribute extensions for, or modified versions of, GCC to make their source code available, whereas LLVM, which is the clang backend, has a BSD-like license that does not have that requirement.</p>
<p>Because of this Apple chose to develop a new compiler front end from scratch, supporting C, Objective-C and C++. The clang project was then open sourced in 2007 and now contributors who is making improvements and changes to both LLVM and clang includes several of the free software projects such as all the BSD projects, and it also includes major companies like Microsoft, Google, ARM, Sony, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).</p>
<p>Because the GCC source code is a large and difficult system for developers to work with, and because companies often develop specific extensions which they do not want to share, the GCC is now slowly being abandoned, not benefiting from any of the major improvements, and instead a real free alternative is slowly taking its place.</p>

<h2 id="damage">The damage done by proprietary companies</h2>
<p>Some companies will make improvements which they never share when they build software with a permissive license and they will possibly even make billions of dollars doing it. But this is really not damaging free software in the least.</p>
<p>What is being damaged is society in general, such as the damage done by Microsoft, Apple and Google with their proprietary spyware operating systems, their copyright licenses and their creepware.</p>
<p>But this damage has absolutely nothing to do with the free software. This damage is the result of the capitalistic political system, and this damage will always exist as long as the political system favors profit over people.</p>
<p>And of course the damage that the capitalistic political system is causing is not limited to software or freedom, but extends its greedy reach far into all the other corners of life with devastating consequences as a result. Just look at the current global environment crisis! Or the global rise of extreme poverty! Or the horrifying treatment of animals! All in the name of profit!</p>
<p>Whether the GPL or more free software licenses exist or not, this greed and the damage caused by it will always exist. The point is that the GPL doesn't help in the least. The damage will be done regardless of what software licenses are in usage, and it is a problem that needs to be addressed on the political arena, not on the software development arena.</p>
<p>The very "soul" of a true free license is encouraging cooperation, it is helping people, and thereby also companies (as they consists of people working together), to see that it doesn't benefit …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After getting some criticism on my last post, I decided to dig a bit deeper into best profiling tools for Python/Cython. While I am familiar with Python’s cProfile and time modules, my good friend, <a href="https://github.com/shapr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shapr</a> pointed me towards <a href="https://github.com/benfred/py-spy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">py-spy</a> as a very low overhead option implemented in Rust. This profiler would also give me visual feedback in the form of a <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">flame graph</a>, so I could see which parts of my code were taking the longest.</p>
<p>Most of the information here has been pulled together from various sites linked through the py-spy repo, but I haven’t seen a full config in a single place with the given constraints and demands that I had. One of the biggest limitations of CProfile was that any of the cdef methods I have defined in my code (which I need in order to release the GIL) can’t be picked up by typical Python profilers. py-spy is able to do this through using <code>--subprocesses</code> and <code>--native</code> flags as seen below.</p>
<p>In my Cython program I had to add the following to my <code>setup.py</code> file</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>"ext_modules"</span><span>:</span> cythonize<span>(</span>extensions<span>,</span> emit_linenums<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> compiler_directives<span>=</span><span>{</span><span>'language_level'</span><span>:</span> <span>3</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Compiling with this default option means that the generated cpp code has line numbers that correspond to the original Cython code in the .pyx files. You can check that this has worked by looking in the Cython generated cpp files for lines that look like this:</p>

<p>I also included the following directive in the headers for all my .pyx files:</p>

<p>My personal machine is a Mac, which works fine for some of the functionality of py-spy, except for profiling native functions (meaning being able to get at the cpp processes in my code that I really wanted to see!). As a result, I made a docker container and ran py-spy with Linux.</p>

<p>I used python 3.6 in my image based on some open issues on py-spy which said they couldn’t get subprocesses to work with newer versions of Python. My requirements for the program are pretty minimal, only cython and numpy at this point for the actual program execution, as well as py-spy. The other parts of the Dockerfile are to install sudo (you’ll need to run py-spy as root in the container) and to automatically compile my Cython library.</p>
<p>Once I had an image, I ran the following to get a container with the right permissions.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>docker run -td --cap-add SYS_PTRACE <span>$IMAGE_NAME</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After that, I could run the actual py-spy profiler on my sample file.</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>sudo</span> docker <span>exec</span> -t <span>$CONTAINER_NAME</span> <span>bash</span> -c <span>"PYTHONPATH=/code/src &amp;&amp; 
py-spy record --subprocesses --native -o profile.svg -- python cython_test.py"</span>"</code></pre></div>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code>docker <span>cp</span> <span>$CONTAINER_NAME</span>:/code/tests/open_mp_tests/profile.svg ~/open_mp_tests/</code></pre></div>
<p>The lines above allow me to produce an interactive flamegraph, which is then copied to the original directory.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Back in <a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-4/">Part 4 </a>I continued the repairs and donated the money from the first batch of the repaired Pis to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. <br></p>



<p>In this post I will be covering what the money went towards and go over the current repair status.</p>



<blockquote><p>I’ve confirmed that your donation has been allocated to Pi Drop. It should fund approximately three deployments of Pi 400+monitor+webcam to disadvantaged young people in the UK. Thanks again for the donation (and for putting more Pi 1 units back in the field).</p><cite>Eben Upton – Founder Raspberry Pi Foundation</cite></blockquote>



<p>The money donated so far has funded three computers for disadvantaged young people that require a computer to learn from home. Whilst this might not seem like a lot from selling 27 Raspberry Pi 1’s please keep in mind this includes a Raspberry Pi 400 or a Raspberry Pi 4 with keyboard, mouse, monitor and SD card. </p>



<p>In terms of continuing the repairs and donations I have a goal in my head that I would like to meet and I will be listing a further 30 repaired  Model B’s for sale today!</p>



<p>I will also be listing 10 “Model A’s” – More about these below.</p>



<h2>Salvaging dead Pis by removing components</h2>



<p>I came across a fair amount of Pis with dead Ethernet and/or dead USB ports. This issue was caused by a failed Ethernet IC.</p>



<p>Eben Upton did offer to see if they had any spare Ethernet IC’s for the Pi 1. I could have used them to restore full functionality to these devices however I had already started converting them to Model As and the chance of spare IC’s for such an old device laying around seemed slim. </p>



<blockquote><p>&nbsp;was thinking perhaps we might have some 9512 chips lying around, but it’s been so long since we transitioned to 9514 that we almost certainly don’t.</p><cite>Eben Upton – Founder Raspberry Pi Foundation</cite></blockquote>



<p>Instead I removed the Ethernet IC and associated circuitry – More of this can be seen in <a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part 3</a>.</p>



<p>I have completed 10 of these so far and they will also be listed for sale today! </p>



<p>These devices are almost identical to the original Model A with the missing Ethernet port, IC and top USB port. <br></p>

<p>Some of these boards might have residual flux left over from the repairs although I have cleaned them up as best as I can! </p>



<p>They also have a mixture of 256MB and 512MB of RAM meaning some of them are an upgrade over the original model A!</p>



<h2>Replacing damaged SD card slots</h2>



<p>I already went over this in<a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-4/"> part 4</a> however I’m further along with the repairs. 30 of these have been repaired in total so far and I also re-enforced the slots with a small amount of Epoxy Resin to stop them being snapped from the board. <br></p>

<p>Please keep in mind when purchasing these – Not all of the Pi’s listed for sale today will include a new SD card slot. Some of the Pis literally had the SD card slots ripped off damaging the pads and a small amount of the devices have had trace wires added to the board to repair the missing pads. These are small and almost unnoticeable but please keep this in mind! </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<div><p>These devices are now listed for sale – as with the last batch the Model Bs will be sold in pairs with one device having been repaired previously and the other working but not repaired. Although both devices have been tested and proved to work I will only guarantee one of the Pis. </p><p>Model Bs x2 for £15: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Raspberry-pi-model-b-x2/274673808835</p><p>Model As x1 for £7: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Raspberry-pi-model-A/274673810787</p><p>All money raised from these will be donated to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. </p><p>If you have any thoughts on this please let me know below! </p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header><p>February 06, 2021</p></header><section><p>As companies had to adjust to remote working last year, many were open to hiring outside their location.  When deciding what to pay a software engineer, most do a quick search for market rates in that area and then offer a salary around that rate.</p>
<p>I have been working remotely from Mexico for years and have also hired freelance software engineers and designers.  I have had no shortage of work at multiples of the market rate (a few thousand dollars a month) in my area, Guadalajara, for years.  If you make me an offer at market rates, I will never accept.  Neither would many other engineers I have met in Guadalajara who also earn significantly more than the market rate.</p>
<p>Companies that are known for adjusting heavily for the cost of living, such as GitLab, tend to offer low salaries even considering market rates. Whenever I encounter this situation, I can guarantee the company is not hiring the best engineers in the area.</p>
<p>I recently received an email for a job that pays in the range of 110k - 170k USD.  If I actively search for a job, I know I can find more offers of a similar, or better, salary range.  I was 22 when I was no longer “employable” in Mexico because of the salary I demanded.</p>
<p>I have learned that there are two types of companies that hire remotely.  The first type looks to hire engineers at a cheaper rate.  The second type wants to hire the best engineers.  Be the latter.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

  <p>I’ve been using <a href="https://nomie.app/">Nomie</a> for the past few months to track things in my life.</p>
<img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/nomie.jpeg" alt="Nomie">
<p>For example, I can tap <strong>Coffee</strong> to record a cup of coffe (<code>#coffee</code>), select <strong>Mood</strong> and <strong>3</strong> to record my mood (<code>#mood(3)</code>), or type <code>I have a #headache</code> to record a headache.</p>
<p>Recently, I tried to track my water intake. Whenever I drank some water, I counted the number of sips and logged them into Nomie (<code>#water(5)</code>). It worked for a few days, but it quickly became tedious. There had to be a better way.</p>

<p>I looked online for smart water bottles, but these kept showing up:</p>
<img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/smart-water.png" alt="Smartwater bottles">
<p>Eventually, I came upon <a href="https://hidratespark.com/">HidrateSpark</a>, a brand of smart water bottles that pair to your phone via Bluetooth and automatically track your water intake. They looked cool, but their starting $60 price tag seemed a bit steep.</p>
<img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/hidratespark3.gif" alt="HydrateSpark 3">
<p>I happen to quite like my current water bottle. Paired with <a href="https://www.humangear.com/gear/capcap">humangear’s capCAP</a>, my <a href="https://www.hydroflask.com/">Hydro Flask</a> bottle is hard to beat. If only it were smarter…</p>
<img src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/hydroflask.jpg" alt="Hydro Flask 40oz + humangear's capCAP">
<p>I tried to make it smart. I really did. I spent way too much time researching and designing a device that would make any wide-mouth bottle smart. Wireless charging, ultrasonic transducer, Bluetooth Low Energy; I had put all the important keywords together. My <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/">AliExpress</a> cart was overflowing with electronic parts, despite never having held a soldering iron in my life. The scope creep became difficult to ignore. NFC tags would be easier.</p>

<p>Years ago, I purchased a bunch of NFC tags. I thought they were cool, but I never found a use for them. Until now. I would put them on my bottles and touch them with my phone whenever I took a sip. Genius.</p>

<p>The first thing I learned was that NFC tags don’t play well with metal surfaces. My phone wasn’t broken, my tags weren’t broken, but my knowledge of electromagnetic induction was broken. I had put the tag on a metal bottle, and no amount of touching it with my phone would fool physics.</p>
<p>Putting it on the cap, which is made of plastic, solved the issue.</p>
<!-- TODO: Insert photo of bottle with NFC tag on cap. -->
<p>The second thing I learned was that NFC tags don’t know they’re on a water bottle, or supposed to track water intake. In fact, my tags didn’t know anything. They were empty, and I had to put data on them.</p>
<p>When I track my water intake with Nomie, it creates a note that looks like <code>#water(5)</code>, indicating that I had 5 sips of water. If touching the tag with my phone meant I took 1 sip of water, then its content should be something like <code>#water(1)</code>. I used <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&amp;hl=en_CA&amp;gl=US">NFC Tools</a> to write <code>#water(1)</code> to the tag.</p>
<p>The third thing I learned was that Nomie doesn’t support NFC tags. When my phone touches an NFC tag containing <a href="https://google.com/">https://google.com</a>, it knows to open Google in a browser. When my phone touches an NFC tag containing <code>#water(1)</code>, it doesn’t even flinch. I needed to teach my phone to notice this tag and tell Nomie about it.</p>
<p>Many apps can be used to do that. Although I started with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en_CA&amp;gl=US">Tasker</a>, I ended up using <a href="https://llamalab.com/automate/">Automate</a>, which I find much more enjoyable to use.</p>
<p>My Automate flow works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detect NFC tags whose content match the regex <code>#.*(.*)</code></li>
<li>Create a deep link that adds a note to Nomie: <br><code>https://open.nomie.app/history?note=#water(1)</code></li>
<li>Open the deep link</li>
</ol>
<p>I touched the tag with my phone, and it worked!</p>
<video width="360" height="640" controls="">
  <source src="https://miguelrochefort.com/img/nomie-nfc.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p>Over time, I made some improvements to my Automate flow to make it more generic and useful. For example, I can change the content of my NFC tag from <code>#water(1)</code> to <code>#water(?)</code>, which will prompt me to input the number of sips when I trigger the NFC tag. Likewise, I can change <code>#water</code> to any other tag, such as <code>#coffee</code>, <code>#beer</code>, or <code>#ibuprofen</code>.</p>
<p>If you’re an Android user, <a href="https://llamalab.com/automate/community/flows/33417">you can download my Automate flow here</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re an iOS user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/dt32tl/auto_log_18oz_of_water_when_i_scan_the_nfc_sticker/">you can use Shortcuts to implement something similar</a>.</p>

<p>Tracking water intake is just the tip of the NFC tracking iceberg.</p>
<p>While it really shines when tracking frequent activies, such as drinking water, it can reduce friction when tracking pretty much anything. And because NFC tags are so cheap (less than $0.25), why not stick them all over the place?</p>
<p>Just think of the opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#beer</code> on your beer coaster</li>
<li><code>#peed</code> on the toilet flush</li>
<li><code>#sneezed</code> on your Kleenex box</li>
<li><code>#flossed</code> on your dental floss</li>
<li><code>#mood(?)</code> on your mirror</li>
<li><code>#water(?)</code> on a water bottle</li>
<li><code>#weight(?)</code> on a body weight scale</li>
<li><code>#pullup(?)</code> on a pull-up bar</li>
<li><code>#spent(?)</code> on your wallet</li>
<li><code>#ibuprofen(200)</code> on an Advil bottle</li>
</ul>
<p>My roll of <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001812489613.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.470964e46R1AjC&amp;algo_pvid=0ad44ea7-5d2a-4aa8-bc98-7d5ce42dc428&amp;algo_expid=0ad44ea7-5d2a-4aa8-bc98-7d5ce42dc428-5&amp;btsid=0b0a555716120278972485847eab63&amp;ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_,searchweb201603_">100 NFC stickers</a> is on the way.</p>

    <article>
  
  <p>Feb 6, 2021</p>
  <p>If you maintain an open-source project in the range of 10k-200k lines of code, I strongly encourage you to add an <code>ARCHITECTURE</code> document next to <code>README</code> and <code>CONTRIBUTING</code>.
Before going into the details of why and how, I want to emphasize that this is not another “docs are good, write more docs” advice.
I am pretty sloppy about documentation, and, eg, I often use just “simplify” as a commit message.
Nonetheless, I feel strongly about the issue, even to the point of pestering you:-)</p>
<p>I have experience with both contributing to and maintaining open-source projects.
One of the lessons I’ve learned is that the biggest difference between an occasional contributor and a core developer lies in the knowledge about the physical architecture of the project.
Roughly, it takes 2x more time to write a patch if you are unfamiliar with the project, but it takes 10x more time to figure out <em>where</em> you should change the code.
This difference might be hard to perceive if you’ve been working with the project for a while.
If I am new to a code base, I read each file as a sequence of logical chunks specified in some pseudo-random order.
If I’ve made significant contributions before, the perception is quite different.
I have a mental map of the code in my head, so I no longer read sequentially.
Instead, I just jump to where the thing should be, and, if it is not there, I move it.
Mental map is the source of truth.</p>
<p>I find <code>ARCHITECTURE</code> file to be a low-effort high-leverage way to bridge this gap.
As the name suggest, this file should describe the high-level architecture of the project.
Keep it short: every recurring contributor will have to read it.
Additionally, the shorter it is, the less likely it will be invalidated by some future change.
This is the main rule of thumb for <code>ARCHITECTURE</code> — specify only things which are unlikely to frequently change.
Don’t try to keep it synchronized with code.
Instead, revisit it a couple of times a year.</p>
<p>Start with a bird’s eye overview of the problem being solved.
Then, specify a more-or-less detailed codemap.
Describe coarse-grained modules and how they relate to each other.
Codemap should answer “where’s the thing that does X?”.
It should also answer “what does the thing that I am looking at do?”.
Avoid going into details of <em>how</em> each module works, pull this into separate documents or (better) inline documentation.
Codemap is a map of a country, and not an atlas of maps of its states.
Use this as a chance to reflect on the project structure.
Are the things you want to put near each other in the codemap adjacent in <code>exa -TD</code>?</p>
<p>Do name important files, modules, and types.
Do not directly link them (links go stale).
Instead, encourage the reader to use symbol search to find the mentioned entities by name.
This doesn’t require maintenance, and will help to discover related, similarly named things.</p>
<p>Explicitly call-out architectural invariants.
Often, important invariants are expressed as an <em>absence</em> of something, and it’s pretty hard to divine that from reading the code.
Nothing in the model layer specifically doesn’t depend on the views.</p>
<p>Point out boundaries between layers and systems as well.
A boundary implicitly contains information about the implementation of the system behind it.
It even constraints all <em>possible</em> implementations.
But finding a boundary by just randomly looking at the code is hard — good boundaries have measure zero.</p>
<p>After finishing the codemap, add a separate section on cross-cutting concerns.</p>
<p>A good example of <code>ARCHITECTURE</code> document is the one from rust-analyzer:
<a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/d7c99931d05e3723d878bea5dc26766791fa4e69/docs/dev/architecture.md">architecture.md</a>.</p>

This means that you can add basically anything inside them, e.g. a list:
</p><div id="code-16">
<pre><code>My favorite list is:
\Ul[
\li[aa]
\li[bb]
]
because it is simple.
</code></pre></div><p>
which renders as a single paragraph.</p></div></div><div><p><span><a href="#p-40">🔗</a></span></p><p>One major advantage of this, is that when writing documentation, you often want to keep lists or code blocks inside a given paragraph, so that it is easy to reference the entire paragraph with an ID. Think for example of paragraphs in the C++ standard.</p></div><div><p><span><a href="#p-44">🔗</a></span></p><div id="p-44"><p>Equivalent sane version:
</p><div id="code-18">

Equivalent sane version:
</p><div id="code-20">
<pre><code>The website \a[http://example.com][example.com] is cool.
</code></pre></div><p>which renders as:</p><blockquote id="q-8"></blockquote><p>
If the custom text is empty, an autolink is generated. This is often useful if you want your link to be followed by punctuation:
</p><div id="code-21">
<pre><code>The website is really cool: http://example.com[].
</code></pre></div><p>which renders as:</p><blockquote id="q-9"></blockquote><p>
This could also be achieved with the sane syntax of course, but this pattern saves a tiny bit of typing.</p></div></div><div><p><span><a href="#p-54">🔗</a></span></p><div id="p-54"><p>Link with multiple paragraphs inside it:

</p><div id="code-24">
<pre><code>a &lt;a href="http://example.com"&gt;

To prevent expansion, you have to escape the protocol with a backslash <code>\</code>, e.g.:
</p><p>
Empty domains like:
</p><p>
don't becomes links however. But this one does:
</p></div></div><div><p><span><a href="#p-60">🔗</a></span></p><div id="p-60"><p>Insane links end when either the end of the document or one of the following characters is found:</p><div><ul id="ul-14">

<li id="l-45">open or close square bracket <code>[</code> or <code>]</code></li>

</ul></div></div></div><div><p><span><a href="#p-61">🔗</a></span></p><div id="p-61"><p>As a consequence, to have an insane link followed immediately by a punctuation like a period you should use an empty argument as in:
</p><div id="code-28">
<pre><code>Check out this website: http://example.com[].
</code></pre></div><p>which renders as:</p><blockquote id="q-11"></blockquote><p>
otherwise the punctuation will go in it. Another common use case is:
</p><div id="code-29">
<pre><code>As mentioned on the tutorial (http://example.com[see this link]).
</code></pre></div><p>which renders as:</p><blockquote id="q-12"></blockquote></div></div><div><p><span><a href="#p-66">🔗</a></span></p><div id="p-66"><p>If you want your link to include one of the terminating characters, e.g. <code>]</code>, all characters can be escaped with a backslash, e.g.:
</p><div id="code-30">
<pre><code>Hello http://example.com/\]a\}b\\c\ d world.
</code></pre></div><p>which renders as:</p><blockquote id="q-13"></blockquote></div></div><div><p><span><a href="#p-69">🔗</a></span></p><div id="p-69"><p>Note that the <code>http://example.com</code> inside <code>\a[http://example.com]</code> only works because we do some post-processing magic that prevents its expansion, otherwise the link would expand twice:
</p><div id="code-31">
<pre><code>\P[http://example.com]

\a[http://example.com]
</code></pre></div><p>which renders as:</p><blockquote id="q-14"></blockquote><p>
This magic can be observed with <a href="#help-macros" title="internal link

<p data-css="tve-u-1771d6b107a">KiCad 6.0 is expected to arrive in the second or third quarter of 2021 and is the first major release since 2018. I took much of January to "play" with the KiCad nightly builds, tagged "KiCad 5.99", which will eventually become KiCad 6.0.</p>
<p data-css="tve-u-1771d6af22e">In this article, I document many of the most important changes that the KiCad developers have introduced to KiCad 6, including numerous "under the hood" improvements, and new productivity features in the front end.</p>

<div>
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto" spellcheck="true">
<p dir="ltr">KiCad is arguably the world’s best open-source printed circuit board CAD program.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s been around for almost 30 years. Its community has been growing steadily both in terms of end-users and contributors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">KiCad’s importance as a fully-featured alternative to closed-sources PCB design tools has grown since version 4 came out in 2015. That’s about the time that I committed to using KiCad, after playing around with other commercial and open-source alternatives. I was so impressed with KiCad that I decided to teach others how to use it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m pleased with my choice. As an educator and electronics hobbyist, KiCad has everything I need, without the limits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When KiCad 5 came out in July 2018, KiCad presented an image of maturity. In my opinion, KiCad 5 was a significant milestone in its history because it signified a new approach to the development of the tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The core development team, composed of members that give most of their time to the project, is supported by community donations and CERN.</p>
<p dir="ltr">KiCad 5 raised KiCad as a serious contender in the PCB CAD space. KiCad 5 was powerful enough to be used in corporate engineering departments as well as by hobbyists.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">After more than two years since the publication of version 5, version 6 is visible in the horizon. I expect that KiCad 6.0 will become a reality sometime in the second or (more likely) third quarter of 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I wanted to take a deep dive in KiCad 6 and report on my findings in this article. As I am writing this post, it is middle of January 2021, a few months after a feature freeze was declared in late 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After months of playing with the nightly builds containing the work in progress towards KiCad 6.0, I decided that it was time to take a closer look.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I felt confident that my findings would be useful to anyone wondering about KiCad 6.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this article, I document the most important new and updated features coming in KiCad 6.0. In many cases, I make a Kicad 6 vs KiCad 5 comparison so that you can see these changes in context.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For my testing, I use the nightly build of KiCad, which is currently labelled “5.99”. The nightly development builds are snapshots of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">development branch</a> of the KiCad repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I’m running KiCad 5.99 on an <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu 20.04</a> virtual machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you want to learn how to install the nightly build, look for instructions at the end of this article.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I am comparing KiCad 5.99 (which will morph into KiCad 6 later this year) with <a href="https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad/-/tree/5.1.9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KiCad 5.1.9</a> running on an <a href="https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu 18.04</a> virtual machine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Please note that I will be using the designation “KiCad 6” in this article, even though I did my testing on the KiCad nightly release designated “KiCad 5.99”. During this article’s writing, I updated my copy of KiCad 5.99 almost daily to make sure I worked with the latest available code.</p>

<h2 id="t-1611031599240">KiCad 6 impressions in a nutshell</h2>
</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">KiCad 6 includes several big changes and many smaller ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many of those changes are under the hood, designed to improve reliability and performance and set the stage for the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, there are numerous changes in the front end, the user interface, that will impact how you interact with KiCad.</p>
</div>
<p>
<h3 id="t-1611031599241">New file format</h3>
</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">In my opinion, the most significant changes are the ones we can’t see.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the top of these changes, you’ll find the introduction of a new format for the schematic files, which uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">S-Expressions notation</a>. S-Expressions can represent data in a tree structure format as a nested list. The new file format makes schematic and layout file human-readable, and, just as important, much easier to manipulate programmatically using Python or other programming languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">S-Expression notation is not new to KiCad. Layout (".kicad_pcb") and footprint files (".kicad_mod") have used S-Expression notation in KiCad 5. But with KiCad 6, the transition is complete.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bellow, you can see a side-by-side comparison of the same schematic file section. KiCad 6 on the left, KiCad 5 on the right. In both cases, the text describes a PWR symbol with designation “PWR07”.</p>

<div>
<p dir="ltr">The new S-Expressions notation file format is more verbose and takes more disk space, but it is much easier to read, edit by hand, or edit programmatically.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Symbol libraries are also moving to S-Expressions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new file format means that the main KiCad apps can soon be complemented by an abundance of plugins and extensions that can introduce new features. Think of plugins that can import PCB projects from other CAD programs or wizards that can create a new KiCad project within milliseconds to save you time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new file format is not backward compatible. You will not be able to open a KiCad 6 file with KiCad 5, but you will be able to import KiCad 5 projects and convert them to KiCad 6.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another important attribute of the new file format for Eeschema is that schematic symbols will be embedded to the file (not linked, as they currently are). This means that in KiCad 6, Eeschema files will be self-contained and will not depend on libraries. You will be able to publish and share these files and be sure that they will open properly on other people's KiCad 6 instances. No more "[??]" indicating broken links to symbol libraries.</p>
</div>
<p>
<h3 id="t-1611031599242">Tools and Workflow</h3>
</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">If you already know how to use KiCad 5, or even KiCad 4, you will find that the KiCad 6 individual apps also known as “tools”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">You still have the main KiCad app, which allows you to launch the individual apps:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Eeschema,&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">Pcbnew,</li>
<li dir="ltr">the editors for custom symbols and footprints,&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">and auxiliary apps like the Gerber file viewer, the image converter, the calculators and the schematic worksheet editor.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Some of these tools, like the Convert Image tool, are virtually unchanged.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most tools, however, contain small or significant improvements without changing their traditional look and feel.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The KiCad workflow is also streamlined without changing its fundamentals. You will still create PCBs by iterating through Eeschema and Pcbnew, but the two tools are now better integrated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s good—no need to re-learn KiCad.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>
<h3 id="t-1611031599243">User interface</h3>
</p>
<div>
<p dir="ltr">KiCad 6 features a refreshed user interface.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The layout of the menus and windows has been improved.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Menu items have been re-organised to make them easier to find.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Toolbars have also been updated. Almost all buttons have been redesigned with an elegant modern look, but match one-on-one with their original counterparts from KiCad 5.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Pcbnew you will find that the right toolbar has been greatly expanded to include many brand-new productivity-enhancing tools.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most dialogue boxes have also been redesigned.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both Eeschema and Pcbnew have updated Setup dialogue boxes under the File menu. With these dialogue boxes, you can define many of the attributes of your schematic and layout design working environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">These Setup windows also existed in KiCad 5, but in KiCad 6 they were expanded to include features distributed in other menus and windows. Having one place with all (or at least most) configuration capabilities represents another productivity boost.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Eeschema, the Electrical Rules Check capabilities are …</p></div></div></div></div>

Popular air purifier brands are making a lot of promises about what they can do to keep your home safe, but a CBC <em>Marketplace</em> investigation found that a homemade DIY purifier can actually outperform some of the most well-known brands on the market.</p>  <p>There are plenty of claims for consumers to wade through: "the only air purifier, heater&nbsp;and fan to clean a whole room properly;" "UV-C light killing germs;" and "true HEPA filter" are just some of the promises <em>Marketplace </em>investigated.</p>  <p>University of Toronto engineering professor Jeffrey Siegel, a leading expert on ventilation, filtration and indoor air quality, calls it "a marketing jungle."</p>  <p>Working with Siegel and his team, <em>Marketplace</em> put five popular brands to the test: the Levoit LV-H132, GermGuardian AC5350B, Dyson Pure Hot + Cool, BlueAir Blue Pure 211+ and the Honeywell HPA 160, as well as a DIY box fan with an added filter.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Air purifier sales in Canada jumped nine per cent in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic 2019, totalling $136 million, according to statistics from market research firm Euromonitor.</p>  <h2>Clearing out COVID-19</h2>  <p>Siegel said a good air purifier can also help clear out coronavirus particles and reduce the air's viral load.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_300/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_460/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_620/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5900805.1612454054!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/original_780/jeffrey-siegel.jpeg"></p></div><figcaption>Jeffrey Siegel is a professor of civil engineering at the University of Toronto who has been studying indoor air quality for over 20 years.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Anu Singh/CBC)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>But air purifiers need to be efficient and sized appropriately for the space they are in. Air flow is also key. However Siegel warns all of those things are not enough on their own to protect your family from COVID-19. You still need masks, hand-washing and physical distancing to keep the virus at bay.</p>  <p>A HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter is a key part of the equation, too. Viruses such as the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 often attach themselves to dust or droplets, and a good air purifier with a HEPA filter can help capture them.</p>  <p>All <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-hepa-filter-1"><u>HEPA filters</u></a> are supposed to remove at least 99.97 per cent of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and airborne particles. All of the models we tested use pleated HEPA filters.</p>  <p><em>Marketplace</em> purchased 15 devices in total — three of the same models for each of the five brands used in our tests. Using incense smoke, Siegel and his team tested each device to see how much air-cleaning power it delivers — what's known as the Clean Air Delivery Rate&nbsp;(CADR).</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH | Marketplace test reveals the most effective air purifier:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="Why more expensive air purifiers aren't always the best" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1854941251682-metadata-" title="Why more expensive air purifiers aren't always the best"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/562/851/WEB_CleanAir.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>An $800 Dyson air purifier we tested doesn’t clean your air as well as some less-expensive products. Here’s what we found.<!-- --> <!-- -->3:09</span></span></span></p>  <p>The CADR measures how long an air-purifying device takes to remove pollen, smoke and dust; different CADR numbers correspond to each one. The benchmark allows consumers to compare the effectiveness of portable air purifiers. You'll find the CADR listed in either cubic feet per minute (cfm), or, in Canada, in cubic metres per hour (m3/hour).&nbsp;</p>  <p>Siegel recommends looking for a CADR rating for smoke of about 200-300 m3/hour (118-176 cfm) for cleaning small to medium-sized rooms. The smoke CADR is generally the lowest and most conservative number, said Siegel.&nbsp;</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH&nbsp;|&nbsp;Here's how our test worked:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><div><div title="This is how the University of Toronto tested air purifiers for Marketplace's test" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div aria-labelledby="1854855747661-metadata-" title="This is how the University of Toronto tested air purifiers for Marketplace's test"><div><p><img src="https://thumbnails.cbc.ca/maven_legacy/thumbnails/481/295/mp_amy_embedded_xcode_mix_320_frame_856.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></p></div></div></div></div></div><span>University of Toronto PhD student Amy Li explains how the lab calculates the clean air delivery rate.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:33</span></span></span></p>  <p>Siegel also threw another set of air purifiers into the mix — a do-it-yourself version that consists of a box fan and a filter, taped together with painter's tape. The filter he used was not a HEPA, but a MERV-11 filter, which is cheaper and easier to find.

<em>Custom ortholinear keyboard by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ImportedGuy/">u/ImportedGuy</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/8tjau8/dsa_legacy_on_the_xd75re/">r/mk</a></em></p>
<p>If you're a person who types on a keyboard for most of the day, then you may have come across the world of custom keyboard enthusiasts. One notable keyboard community is <a href="https://reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards">Reddit's mechanical keyboards subreddit</a>, where you'll find a dizzying array of customization options, from switches to keycaps to keyboard layouts. Some of these customizations are purely cosmetic, some are in search of a particular tactile or aural aesthetic, and some are for improved ergonomics.</p>
<h3 id="staggered-vs-ortholinear-layout">Staggered vs Ortholinear Layout <a href="#staggered-vs-ortholinear-layout">#</a></h3>
<p>One interesting customization from the world of custom keyboards is an ortholinear layout. An ortholinear layout has all the keys organized in a straight up and down grid, as opposed to the staggered layout of traditional keyboards.</p>
<p>Here is a traditional staggered keyboard layout:</p>
<p><img src="https://peterxjang.com/img/typing-practice.jpg#medium" alt="Staggered keyboard with finger positions"></p>
<p>Note the color coding based on finger positions. For proper touch typing, each finger is responsible for a certain set of keys. What's odd is due to the staggered nature of the keyboard, these sets of keys are all on a slant. This makes it a little tricky to learn. For example, the right index finger rests on the J key, and is responsible for the number 7. But you can see that 8 is the number key directly above the J key, which can create some cognitive dissonance. So why do most keyboards use a staggered layout? It's because they were modeled after old-school typewriters, which needed the staggered layout to make room for each hammer:</p>
<p><img src="https://peterxjang.com/img/typewriter.png#medium" alt="Typewriter patent"></p>
<p>So most modern computer keyboards are designed with this staggered layout due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence">path dependency</a>; it's just what people are used to. Once you realize this, it's hard not to ask the question "What would it be like to use a keyboard without any staggering?"</p>
<p>Enter the ortholinear layout:</p>

<p>From what I can tell, the term "ortholinear" was invented by Jack Humbert, who created the Planck keyboard described in the video. The Planck may not have been the first non-staggered keyboard on the market, but it was very influential in the relatively small world of custom keyboard enthusiasts. Originally you would have to buy keyboards like these as a kit, which required soldering and assembly to complete. Now there are quite a few pre-built ortholinear keyboard options to choose from - there's the minimalist <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/planck">Planck EZ</a>, the ergonomically curved <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/">Kinesis Advantage</a>, the fully-split <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/">Moonlander</a>, etc. Prebuilt options are quite pricey, since it's a small market, so if you wanted to save money you could build your own from the individual components.</p>
<h3 id="the-ortholinear-learning-curve">The ortholinear learning curve <a href="#the-ortholinear-learning-curve">#</a></h3>
<p>Before getting into how to build a custom ortholinear keyboard, it's worth mentioning the learning curve. I've come across multiple reviews of different ortholinear keyboards where the reviewer said the layout change was too much of a learning curve, and they prefer the staggered layout. Here are some example video reviews which discuss just how difficult the switch can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdXA1D8y4TI">Rhinofeed's Planck review</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyoB9rEzOeY">Chryosan's Planck review</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpJQtzaThmM">Laptop Retrospective's GergoPlex review</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJMl4O6uO9M">Jarred Walton's Kinesis Advantage review</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This wasn't at all similar to my experience with my first ortholinear keyboard. It took me about a day before I was just as fast on my new keyboard, and I was also able to switch between an ortholinear layout and my laptop's staggered layout without any issue. This is because my first ortholinear board was the <a href="https://kprepublic.com/products/xd75re-xd75am-xd75-xiudi-60-custom-keyboard-pcb?variant=958306058284">XD75re</a>, which has plenty of keys (5 rows and 15 columns), so I was able to create a layout that was nearly identical to a traditional keyboard.</p>
<p>First let's look at the default layout on a Planck keyboard:</p>
<p><img src="https://peterxjang.com/img/planck-layout.png" alt="Default layout on the Planck keyboard"></p>
<p>The Planck has 4 rows and 12 columns, which means you're missing your number row and a lot of symbols. In order to type numbers, you'll need to hold down the Raise key, which activates the color-coded layer. Other symbols require holding the Lower key. The reasoning here is to keep every single key no more than one key away from your home row position, which is ideal from a touch typing perspective. But there is a huge learning curve involved with switching to a keyboard like this! The Planck allows you to customize your layout any way you want, but in the end you'll have to relearn where your numbers and symbols are located using several layers.</p>
<p>Now let's look at a layout on the XD75re:</p>
<p><img src="https://peterxjang.com/img/xd75-layout1.png" alt="Custom layout for XD75 keyboard"></p>
<p>This layout uses 14 columns, with extra keys left over to customize as you see fit. The only key that is moved is the escape key, which I moved to the normal location of the caps lock key (you can actually customize this keyboard's firmware such that the key is control on hold, escape on release). The most important thing is that you aren't required to use any layers to access your numbers or symbols (except for your function keys, which can map directly on your number keys).</p>
<p>Notice that the space bar takes up a huge number of keys, which isn't necessary. If you are okay with moving 2 more keys around, you could have a layout like this instead:</p>
<p><img src="https://peterxjang.com/img/xd75-layout2.png" alt="Custom layout for XD75 keyboard"></p>
<p>This layout uses 13 columns, with 2 extra columns in the middle and a couple of unused keys on the bottom to customize as you see fit. The extra two columns in the middle creates some space between your hands, which I find to be a little more comfortable. Only 3 keys are out of their normal positions, so it's pretty easy to get used to this layout. The point is that this particular keyboard gives you the flexibility to start with a traditional layout so you can focus on getting used to a non-staggered ortholinear layout. Once you feel comfortable, you can customize your layout to your heart's content!</p>
<p>If you're interested in trying an ortholinear layout, I would suggest trying a keyboard with labeled keycaps and at least 5 rows and 13 columns. Most available ortholinear keyboards have 12 columns, which keeps things symmetric (6 columns for each hand), but immediately requires repositioning several symbol keys on layers. You'll have a much easier time learning an ortholinear layout if you don't have to memorize new layer layouts at the same time. You can always add layers and optimize your layout with a larger keyboard as well, so it's a win-win!</p>
<h3 id="building-a-keyboard-from-scratch">Building a keyboard from scratch <a href="#building-a-keyboard-from-scratch">#</a></h3>
<p>The only downside with the XD75re is that it does not come as a prebuilt keyboard, you'll need to source your own parts and assemble it yourself. Fortunately, this is all a lot easier than it sounds, because the XD75re board has all components already soldered on it. This means all you need to do is purchase the right parts and put it all together, no wiring or soldering necessary!</p>
<p>This video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMHXMAeKkI6HXlPfLiYvo9g">Taeha Types</a> does a good job of breaking down all the possibilities when it comes to building your own mechanical keyboard:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NpNygIrnaQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>This particular build is as simple as it gets, since the XD75re is a hot-swap PCB, which means you don't need to solder any components. It is compatible with either PCB or plate-mounted switches, which makes it easier to find switches. And since every key is only 1 unit in size, you don't need any stabilizers. All you need to do is assemble the pieces. Here's what you need for this XD75re build:</p>
<ul>
<li>PCB (KPRepublic sells the <a href="https://kprepublic.com/products/xd75re-xd75am-xd75-xiudi-60-custom-keyboard-pcb?variant=958306058284">XD75re</a>)</li>
<li>Case (the XD75re can theoretically fit in any 60% case, <a href="https://kprepublic.com/products/stainless-steel-bent-case-for-xd75re-60-custom-keyboard-acrylic-panels-acrylic-diffuser?_pos=31&amp;_sid=625d1f5a9&amp;_ss=r">this one</a> is specifically built for the XD75)</li>
<li>Switches (the XD75re uses MX switches, sold by <a href="https://novelkeys.xyz/collections/switches">NovelKeys</a>, <a href="https://flashquark.com/product-category/switches/">FlashQuark</a>, many others)</li>
<li>Keycaps (you'll need uniform-profile MX keycaps with all 1u sizes, like <a href="https://kprepublic.com/products/dsa-pbt-top-printed-legends-white-blue-keycaps-laser-etched-gh60-poker2-xd64-87-104-xd75-xd96-xd84-cosair-k70-razer-blackwidow?_pos=6&amp;_sid=ce2218b96&amp;_ss=r&amp;variant=1410114584620">this</a>)</li>
<li>Plate (sometimes optional, the case linked above has a built-in plate)</li>
<li>Cable (the XD75re uses a USB C cable)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can follow this build log by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/6r30tp/xd75_re_build_log/">/u/snowypowers</a> to see how to assemble this exact board with this exact case:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One thing to note - I have this exact case, and the screws it came with were too short. This is probably because the case was made for the XD75 and the XD75re PCB, the latter being a little taller in height due to its hot-swap sockets. I had to purchase some longer M2 screws, which cost less than a dollar total. Easy enough fix, but something to be aware of.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The total cost of this build will be somewhere between 100 and 200 USD. Which is a pretty reasonable price for a custom keyboard, but definitely pricey compared to something you can buy at a store, no doubt. And this particular PCB is sold by KPRepublic, a store located in China, which means it will take more than a month to receive your package (I believe my order took about 2 months to ship to the US in Chicago). I had a great experience with KPRepublic and have ordered from them multiple times, but you can't avoid the long wait times for certain products like these, which are manufactured by small local vendors and not large corporations. Building custom mechanical keyboards is a great hobby, but it's characterized by long wait times and potentially expensive purchases. If that's unappealing, then turn around before it's too late! Otherwise, let's take a look at the last piece of the puzzle - programming your new keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="customizing-the-keyboard-firmware">Customizing the keyboard firmware <a href="#customizing-the-keyboard-firmware">#</a></h3>
<p>The XD75re can be customized using the <a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/">QMK firmware</a>, which is an open source keyboard firmware project that enables complete customization of your keyboard. If you are a programmer, you can write custom C code to program your keyboard down to each keypress. If you are not a programmer, no worries - they provide an online graphical configuration tool which is much more user friendly. This tutorial by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdfrYMwAJ8LHvy8-j_WIxAw">MechMerlin</a> walks you through every step:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-imgglzDMdY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>This is the fun part - you have complete control of the layout and functionality of each key. You can have dedicated buttons to control volume, brightness, and media playback. You can customize a key to be Control on hold, Escape on release, as I mentioned earlier. Literally every key can have a wide range of functionality.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p><em><a href="https://brentozar.com/">Brent Ozar</a> is a SQL Server expert and Microsoft Certified Master who’s helped companies like Google and Stack Overflow get the most out of their SQL Servers.</em></p><p><em>We sat down (virtually) with Brent to talk about the future of Microsoft SQL Server, and the DBAs who’ve built their careers on it, in the new world of the cloud.</em></p><p><strong>Forrest Brazeal: Brent, you’re a performance specialist who’s worked with massive SQL Server deployments; how does it make you feel when you hear cloud architects saying things like&nbsp;“relational databases don’t scale?” What do you wish they knew?</strong></p><p>Brent Ozar: They’re right. Nothing scales worth a damn. Even stuff that looks easy, like Amazon S3 file storage, can run into scaling problems if you design it without an analysis of how AWS partitions reads,&nbsp;and how you have to watch out for your object prefixes.</p><p>But the thing is, nobody <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/the-career-changing-art-of-reading-the-docs">reads the documentation</a>.</p><p>Oh sure, they read page 1, they build the Hello World version, and then they start building an app without any regards whatsoever for how the design is gonna perform. (Sometimes, there’s not even a design – folks just start coding willy-nilly.)</p><p>So I kinda chuckle when I see folks say that something won’t scale – nothing will. It’s a poor musician that blames his instrument. Pick the persistence layer that you know the best, because that’s a hedge against you making dumb design decisions that will come back to haunt you later. The more mistakes you’ve made in the past with a tool, the more likely it is that you won’t make those mistakes again.</p><p>If you choose a persistence layer you’ve never used in production before, and your app becomes popular, you’re gonna be paying for the mistakes you made early on – or the mistakes the persistence layer made for you.</p><p><strong>So with that said, are there other reasons to choose SQL Server today, beyond “it’s what I already know?”</strong></p><p>When your application gets implemented at a 10,000-employee company, you start to get a lot more enterprise-sounding requests from different departments. For example, Sam from security needs to audit which users have changed data over the last 30 days, and Annabel from accounting needs your app to sync tax data with SAP.</p><p>In environments like this, it’s much more common to use Grandpa’s relational database because it’s already got a lot of built-in functionality to help accomplish these goals, and it’s easier to hire people off the street who know how to do it.</p><p>If you’re building a new web site or SaaS tool, and you’re going to be the only company that ever hosts it, then you have a lot of flexibility to choose the data persistence layer you want. You can use Database du Jour without problems. But if you wanna sell an app into 10,000-employee companies, you’re gonna get faster sales if you use a database they support.</p><p><strong>You’ve achieved such renown for your eponymous SQL Server helper tools that your name is sometimes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6758016561585487872/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simply listed as a required skill on DBA job postings</a>. This is probably not a realistic goal for most of us. That said, what are a few career steps you recommend to become a trusted DBA?</strong></p><p>[Laughs] Yeah, that was surreal.</p><p>To become a trusted DBA – or a trusted anything – freely share what you know on a web site with your name on it.</p><p>Sharing knowledge accomplishes several different things. First, if a prospective boss or coworker Googles you, they’ll find your name, read what you wrote, and say, “Hey, this person really does seem to know stuff that I don’t know.” The dates on your blog posts also establish a track record of what you’ve known over time, and how it’s grown.</p><p>In the beginning, your goal is to be found if people Google your name. That’s fairly easy. Later on, as you start to accumulate more writings, people are also going to run across them when they Google for the subject matter, too, even without including your name. That’s when you’ll start building an audience – and people worry about that first, but hold off. Just start by building a public track record under your name, and the rest will start to snowball.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>If you’re looking to get skilled up on Azure, Microsoft is currently offering 50% off AZ-900 exam vouchers to anyone who completes <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/az-900-microsoft-azure-fundamentals">ACG’s free prep course</a>!</em></p><hr><p><strong>AWS has recently announced an open-source translation tool called Babelfish, which is an aggressive attempt to get people off SQL Server and onto open-source database engines such as Postgres. What are your thoughts on this tactic?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I adore Babelfish because it keeps the pressure on Microsoft to continue innovating.&nbsp;The database market is kinda like this:</p><ul><li>Oracle – massively expensive</li><li>Microsoft SQL Server – pretty doggone expensive</li><li>AWS RDS Postgres and Aurora – inexpensive to mildly expensive</li><li>Postgres – free to inexpensive, depending on support</li></ul><p>If you’re Microsoft, and you wanna make more money, you look at Oracle’s pile of cash, and you build features that will help Oracle users migrate down to SQL Server and save money. If you’re AWS, you look at Microsoft’s pile of cash, and you build features like Babelfish that will help SQL Server users migrate down and save money. Everything slowly becomes a less expensive commodity. (If this kind of thing interests you, search for <a href="https://acloudguru.com/course/wardley-mapping">Wardley value mapping</a> – it’s really neat stuff.)</p><p>I’m really excited about AWS Babelfish because it encourages Microsoft to start defending their value proposition. Microsoft has to start&nbsp;shipping new stuff that makes AWS RDS &amp; Aurora customers aspire to using the Real Deal SQL Server (and/or Azure SQL DB).</p><p>SQL Server 2017 &amp; 2019 started bringing that with query optimizer improvements such that your code will just run faster – that’s a good down payment, but they gotta keep making those payments. If they don’t, projects like Babelfish will start to win over customers if/when they ship.</p><p><strong>SQL Server on Linux: smart play by MSFT, or failed experiment?</strong></p><p>If you go down the list of popular databases, the only ones that are Windows-only are SQL Server and Access. I think it made sense for Microsoft to hedge their bets and start making the investments necessary to survive in datacenters 10-20-30 years from now. It’s a hedge, though: it shouldn’t be your first default choice for running SQL Server. The full feature capability isn’t there, and the high availability &amp; disaster&nbsp;recovery story is still pretty sketchy.</p><p>I think of SQL Server 2019 on Linux as an alpha release. It’s there if you&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it, but otherwise, you should wait for a few years until you really need it. Right now, it’s just kinda there for experiments.</p><p>The one place where you might&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;to have it is throwaway environments for continuous integration. If you need to quickly and inexpensively stand up and shut down a lot of temporary SQL Servers to test your code, then sure, it makes sense there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What’s the future of SQL Server in the cloud, anyway? Is it the next Oracle (as AWS is trying to position it), widely disliked and mostly legacy, or can it compete with managed OSS engines like Postgres and MySQL on its own terms?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Don’t think about the dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the name brand of the database engine.</p><p>Think about dislike &amp; legacy in terms of the&nbsp;<em>features</em>&nbsp;that have to be implemented: auditing, fine-grained single sign on security, integration with Active Directory, compatibility with reporting systems, GDPR compliance, encryption, etc. Here’s a great place to start:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.enterpriseready.io/">https://www.enterpriseready.io</a></p><p>Developers HATE those features. That’s why Amazon and others say that Oracle and SQL Server are disliked, legacy applications: they support all the features that enterprise users demand, but developers hate. I hate those features too, but…enterprises demand ’em.</p><p>If you’re not in an enterprise, and you don’t have plans to sell your app to an enterprise, then don’t use an expensive relational database. Use something cheaper and cloud-native like Amazon’s touting. I agree that it’s a better choice.</p><p><strong>Finally, what does a DBA role look like in, say, 2025?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>2025 is just four short years from now, and most orgs still aren’t even&nbsp;<em>planning</em>&nbsp;for a cloud-native future. They’re just talking about it. The DBA job description in 2025 will still look the same as it looks today: managing data stored in a bunch of diverse platforms, all of which have their own management, troubleshooting, and performance tuning.</p><p>If you stretch it out to 2031 or 2036, 10-15 years from now, it’ll be easier. We’ll have less worries around backups, corruption repair, and restores. But you know what we’ll still be dealing with? Troubleshooting (because everybody assumes it’s a database problem first), security, encryption, performance tuning, and architecture.</p><p>The cloud doesn’t architect itself.</p><p><em>This interview is part of ACG’s <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/tag/cloud-conversations">Cloud Conversations</a> series.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago, I received an email from Revolut (a British fintech company) in which they proudly unveiled their new logo. Previously, Revolut had a distinct and instantly recognizable logo. They replaced it with… something I was sure I had seen before.</p><figure id="w-node-3786e8b28af7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51cf030355219306e8edf_revolout-logo-old-new.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The previous Revolut logo had a unique font, a recognizable color gradient, and it was slanted. If you were to put 100 financial or tech companies’ logos next to each other, the old logo would be easy to find at a glance.</p><p>If you put the new one in the same 100 logos pile, it would drown in the sea of sameness.</p><h2>Sans serif invasion</h2><p>There is a trend in logo design that started around 2017-2018. It’s as if many companies decided that being unique was a handicap and that it was better to be like everyone else. Or at least, that’s how it feels to me.</p><p>The trend started with fashion logos. Many iconic fashion companies ditched their recognizable logos and switched to a bland and very similar version of a sans serif font.</p><p>The technology sector followed soon after.</p><figure id="w-node-519323ea72d8-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51d96d2b8eae559c71d90_tech-fashion-logos-sans-serif.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>All the quirks, peculiarities, and idiosyncrasies of both tech and fashion logos were dropped and replaced with a simple sans serif font.</p><p>It looked like two huge industries decided to use the services of one designer, and not a particularly inventive one at that.</p><p>The tech industry is in slightly better shape because they didn’t go all in, and at least they kept the colors. With the colors, there’s at least <em>some </em>variability:</p><figure id="w-node-1efc3a7d060a-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dc4daea171c45c758db_tech-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Variability in new fashion logos, in full color:</p><figure id="w-node-b31dea70a84e-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51dd2ab19486dcee8bcea_fashion-logos-color.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Serif and sans serif—what’s the difference?</h3><p>First, what’s the difference between serif and sans serif fonts?</p><figure id="w-node-7e6a894d6cf3-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e06556217fb8d809964_serif-sans-serif.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The small features on the ends of strokes in some fonts are known as ‘serifs’.</p><p>Fonts without those small features are called ‘sans serif’ (<em>‘sans’</em> means <em>‘without’</em> in French).</p><p>Sans serifs are missing a few of the typical anatomical features (serifs, spurs, swashes and other flourishes). Because of that, this typeface lacks the level of detail and design differentiation that serif typefaces can have.</p><p>While the simplicity of sans serif fonts makes them readable and versatile, it has its drawbacks. Without additional details and features, sans serif fonts have far fewer options for differentiation. While you can vary things like the height, weight, and slant, sans serif fonts simply have fewer features to work with than their more intricate fellow fonts.</p><p>This results in logos that look very similar. Gone are all the elaborate little details of the previous era.</p><p>When you add brands’ tendency to go black-and-white, you end up with a sea of logo sameness which is the opposite of what logos should be.</p><p>The purpose of a logo is to be instantly recognizable, different, memorable, and, if possible, to refer to the brand’s values. Blending into everyone else’s achieves none of these things.</p><h3>Sans serif history</h3><p>Sans serif lettering and fonts, first created in 1816, were popular for their clarity and legibility at a distance in advertising and display use when printed very large or small.</p><p>Because sans serif type was often used for headings and commercial printing, many early sans serif designs did not feature lowercase letters.</p><p>Simple sans serif capitals, without the use of lowercase, became very common in uses such as tombstones of the Victorian period in Britain.</p><p>Also, a significant reason for serif faces in the older days of imprecise letterpress and less consistent paper surface sizing was to compensate for ink spread and aberrations. Serifs on the fonts helped in cases where corners would otherwise fail to fully imprint.</p><h2>Possible reasons</h2><p>What are the possible reasons for this sans serif trend taking over? And why do hardly any of them matter?</p><h3>‘Modern utility’</h3><p>Branding specialists point to the practical benefits of what they call the ‘modern utility’ of sans serif typefaces. Cleaner and more legible, they are better suited to a variety of media and work particularly well online. The purity of these fonts allows the brands to be an empty vessel, ready to accommodate rapidly shifting trends.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> That may be true, but isn’t the whole value of a brand to <em>not</em> be an empty vessel? The big brands have worked decades for their identity and recognition, only to throw most of it away?</p><h3>Simplification</h3><p>Another reason cited by brand specialists is that it’s a natural step for brands to take as they grow from scrappy startups into established brands. The goals have shifted from making noise and standing out to being a trusted, dependable part of people’s everyday lives. That heartfelt personality and idiosyncrasy that defined a brand as they started out, and won over their early adopters, can be a limitation as they aim for broad appeal and bigger revenue.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Simplification as a reason to blend in for broad appeal? I don’t buy it. Logos should be simple, yes, but they should be simple in a memorable way. Think more in terms of Nike swoosh (simple, memorable),&nbsp; and less in a one-size-fits-all sans serif font.</p><h3>Brands are more than logos now</h3><p>People at the head of these powerful brands know that they are not defined by their logo anymore but by the product or service they provide. They are strong thanks to what they allow <em>you</em> to do with them.</p><p>Before, logo designers would look for a ‘concept’ when designing a logo. That is not necessary anymore: <em>The brand is the concept</em>.</p><p>Their thinking goes that logos may look similar, but what they offer is completely different and effective, and that’s what ultimately counts for the consumer.</p><p>As some brands become words (or even better, verbs) in our daily language (to Google, to Uber, to Skype), they have a lesser need for a recognizable logo. Many of those brands now spend on designing custom typefaces instead of logos: a custom typeface becomes their recognizable voice on every platform or device.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Some big brands may indeed have a lesser need for a very distinct logo but that doesn't mean that they should get rid of an important differentiator. You don’t see Nike replacing their swoosh logo with sans serif <strong>NIKE</strong> text. If you have something valuable that you <em>can</em> live without, it doesn’t mean that you <em>must</em>.</p><h3>Readability</h3><p>One of the main reasons for the sans serif logo trend is readability. Especially on mobile, but everywhere else as well: from huge billboards to tiny footer links at the bottom of mobile websites.</p><p>After all, that’s the very reason why sans serif fonts were invented: for better readability in advertising headlines.</p><p><strong>Counterpoint:</strong> Readability is obviously important. Mobile too—it’s where everything happens nowadays. But this is becoming less of an issue with improvements in technologies like retina displays and 4k screens becoming popular.</p><figure id="w-node-38988d1753c7-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51e96e07b893538cbb00b_sans-serif-logos-on-iphone-11.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Here’s how a bunch of logos looks on my iPhone 11</figcaption></figure><p>If it’s easy to fit 30 decently looking logos on one-third of a phone screen, it should be trivial to make one logo, however quirky, look perfect on mobile.</p><p>Revolut seems to be torn here. They did replace the logo everywhere inside the app, but how does their new app icon look like?</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fb51ed3fd0200eeffdc690d_revolut-app-icon.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>What next?</h2><p>There’s nothing bad in wanting your logo to look simpler, better, mobile-ready, or universal enough to appeal to the broadest possible audience.</p><p>But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p><p>Shoot for simplicity and legibility, but keep your distinguishing features. Don’t throw away what the brand has been working on for decades.</p><p>Otherwise, you may end up in a situation where you could slap any logo on any product and hardly anyone would notice a difference:</p><figure id="w-node-01df0773e426-27e1f180"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f1b01fee505292d2d6a6979/5fbf32ea6160018ba6a9cb84_sans-serif-bags.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>One of these bags is real.</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]>

<p>There is a very straightforward no BS way to measure the quality of your business idea research process.</p>
<p>When we do research we usually start with a hypothesis and then try to confirm or reject it.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that how we set up our hypothesis is usually shit.</p>
<p>We base our hypothesis on things we already know.
And to be honest, usually we don't know much about anything regarding the new business.</p>
<p>You would think that a better way would be to first gather more data by trying to learn more about things that we know we don't know well. It will give us a much better understanding of the field and we will be better at creating our hypothesis.</p>
<p>But we can do even better.</p>
<p>We can go and try to find as many things that we didn't even know are a thing.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<p><strong>Measure every conversation based on how many completely new things you have learned that you didn't know existed before. Usually, this will open a completely new point of view that we couldn't have otherwise.</strong></p>
<p> This will give us more insight than simply validating our half-baked hypothesis.</p>
<p>I believe that even just learning one such thing per conversation is a a job well done.</p>
<p>How to do that and how to ask such questions? </p>
<p>I have no idea. </p>
<p>But I know a few things that might help.</p>
<p>Read <a href="http://momtestbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Mom Test</a> book. Also, check this <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/im-jason-cohen-founder-of-wp-engine-ama-6d28f97cfb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">#AMA from Jason Cohen</a>, it is pure gold.</p>
<p>Let me now get back to building my businesses and not following any of the above advice... (Because I am a moron 🤠)</p>

<p>Today hackers were able to briefly take over the <a href="https://google.lk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google.lk</a> domain, the Google’s search engine page for Sri Lanka and redirect it to bring awareness to an ongoing crisis in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>To be clear the hackers did not took over the Google.lk domain by hacking Google servers, but the hackers were able to somehow modify the DNS settings either by poisoning the DNS of the ISPs, or changing the DNS setting of the ISPs that is linked to the Google.lk domain name.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://nic.lk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NIC.lk</a> is responsible for maintaining the DNS settings for the .LK websites, .LK is the country specific domain on Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>And it seems for a brief period of time all the ping requests to Google.lk were redirected to an IP address maintained by Digital Ocean, probably an IP address that is linked to a droplet.</p>
<p><strong>The hackers were using this opportunity to bring awareness to an ongoing crisis in Sri Lanka.</strong> </p>
<p>Sri Lanka is an exporter of one of the world’s finest tea (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_production_in_Sri_Lanka" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_production_in_Sri_Lanka" target="_blank">Ceylon Tea</a>), however estate workers who work on these estates only make a daily wage of around 4 USD.</p>
<p>The estate workers have been fighting to increase their daily wage to at least $5 for nearly half a decade, however, there is disagreement with the government and the estate owners in providing a daily minimum wage of $5 USD.</p>
<p>Protests are being carried out at estates around the country demanding the minimum wage to be raised to $5 USD per day. And for a brief moment, hackers were able to become activists on the internet.</p>
<h2>The page was titled <strong>“Is this really freedom?”</strong></h2>
<blockquote><p>Really Freedom?<br>Tea estate Workers’ lives dark as the tea kettle. Still, they are fighting for their 1000(approx 5$ per day) Rupess salary for the last several years. But 1000 Rupees also not enough at this time.

<p>This is not the first time where hackers were able to exploit the .LK domain registry. In January 2013, hackers dumped personal details of all the .LK domain owners.</p>
<p>I even wrote about the hack on my 2013 Tumblr blog.</p>

<p>I’m sure the government will look into this, and we might be able to find out who did this, and how they did it in the coming days.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka has to really think hard about their cyber security, even though startups tend to be more secure, the government websites and services are more hit and miss.</p>
<p>Back in November I was able to gain access to the now fixed COVID Tracking system. The developers fixed the vulnerability after I informed them about it.</p>

<p>You have to walk before you can run! Start your journey here in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/syntax">part 1</a>, where we'll learn the basics of Rust's syntax.</p>

<p>One of the things that distinguishes Rust from Haskell is the way it handles memory. Rust is meant to be more performant than Haskell, so it forces us to think more about memory while we're programming. In <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/memory">part 2</a> of the series, we'll see what this looks like.</p>

<p>Data types are one area where Rust borrows some great ideas from Haskell! Take a look at <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/data">part 3</a> to learn more!</p>

<p>Like any good language, Rust comes with a development toolchain for package management and dependency handling. Cargo is very much Rust's equivalent to Stack. And in <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/cargo">part 4</a>, we'll see how to use it.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust/lifetimes">fifth and final part</a> of this series, we'll explore a couple more topics that will round out your Rust eduction. We'll first see how to use collection types in Rust. Then we'll see some of the implications of Rust's memory model on these types. This will lead us to an exploration of the concept of lifetimes.</p>

<p>Sometimes, it helps to see things in action, rather than just reading about them! In our <a href="https://www.mmhaskell.com/rust-video-tutorial">Rust video tutorial</a>, we'll go through all the concepts from this series from scratch, starting with installation! You'll get to see specific examples, and what a general development flow looks like.</p>

            <p>Lately I have been hanging out in Clubhouse to have interesting discussions about Tech, AI, Programming and other things. </p><p>It has been a great way to fill the silence of working from home listening to random Lo-Fi playlists that I started to really dislike. </p><p>Clubhouse is invite-only and iphone only at the moment, but it seems that a lot more users are joining the app, notoriously people like Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg. </p><p>Needless to say that I love the application and I'm having a lot of fun using it. The following is not a guide but more a collection of things that I tried out to understand how someone would write an automated bot for the platform. I am not releasing any source code since I don't want to contribute to anything negative, so consider it a writeup from someone who likes to tinker with things. </p><p>Many users on the plattform have a second account in the form of a second phone they use to organize or moderate rooms while keeping their main account separated. I did not want to go down that route since "there must be a better way". </p><h2 id="finding-interesting-conversations">Finding interesting conversations</h2><p>The main thing that makes the app interesting is the different rooms that are available. A room is a virtual space people join to discuss different topics. The main way to find or discover new rooms is by following people that you like or people who discuss interesting things and then get recommendations from rooms they like or clubs they follow. A club is essentially a group of people, just like Facebook groups. </p><p>After some time, the room view gets bloated with uninteresting stuff that I'm not really into like "Learn to dream big by joining this bootcamp - as a millionaire" and other fake/conspiracy theory stuff. While I can see the appeal I don't want to have it suggested everytime. There are currently two ways to find rooms, the main view (aka suggested to you or "Upcoming for you") or the general view that lists all the discussions around the world ("Upcoming for All", &nbsp;very hard to navigate). </p><figure><img src="https://funnybretzel.com/content/images/2021/02/clubhouseviews.PNG"><figcaption>App view</figcaption></figure><p>It is difficult to filter out through what I consider is fluff and find what is interesting to me. I don't want to be coached, I don't want to buy a course or whatever I just want to discuss or listen to interesting people that are not trying to sell me something. </p><p>There are also a LOT of rooms that people call "Silent networking" where they join and mainly follow each other recursively lol. These rooms are just for clout and absolutely useless, I hide them everytime but they keep coming back up. It's really like it sounds, rooms filled with people who just want to get their follower count up without having to put in any work or learn anything. &nbsp;</p><h2 id="oldest-trick-in-the-book">Oldest trick in the book</h2><p>Naturally something I grew very good in is automation and writing programs to automate whatever it is I am doing, from GUI's to apps to websites. Everything that can be automated should be automated is my mantra, it leaves time for life. </p><p>So what do you do in this case? </p><p>The first and natural option is to try to reverse engineer the app or in other words try to understand how it works and reproduce or automate those parts. In order to do that, one common way is to use a technique called "Man in the middle" which is essentially setting up a proxy on your phone to intercept the requests that the app is sending and then... modify them and send them again without all the finger tapping action!</p><p>Naturally, I began using <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/">mitmproxy</a> which is an excellent tool to do just that but it looked like Clubhouse is using certificate pinning. This means I cannot use my custom certificate to intercept the traffic. The app was throwing NSURLErrorDomain errors &nbsp;which implies just that. </p><p><a href="https://blog.netspi.com/four-ways-to-bypass-ios-ssl-verification-and-certificate-pinning/">There are MANY ways online to circumvent this</a>, the main one is to use a jailbroken iPhone with some other tools and bypass that custom certificate... I will not elaborate much on this one however but you can learn it with some youtube and reading some other blogs.</p><p>So, doing that you can find out things like how Clubhouse is built and what endpoints it is using, what authentication methods... </p><p>One main discovery is that Clubhouse is using a REST api at clubhouseapi.com for authentication, registration, searching rooms and co. It uses Agora (audio chat) and Pubnub (real-time communication) under the hood for all the audio related stuff. </p><p>Someone posted a <a href="https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhuowei/ClubhouseAPI/main/doc/openapi.yaml#/default/get_get_all_topics">Swagger specification of the private Clubhouse API here</a> (USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!):</p><figure><img src="https://funnybretzel.com/content/images/2021/02/clubhouse-api.PNG"><figcaption>Clubhouse API</figcaption></figure><p>It is possible to get the Agora SDK to tinker around with things and get the audio after the token has been extracted. </p><p><a href="https://zerforschung.org/posts/gespraeche-aus-dem-clubhouse/">This guide/writeup (in German) explains how it is possible to do fancy stuff with the Agora</a> to listen into ANY room in Clubhouse and do whatever you want with the audio, which is nice I'd say. You just need the Token from the Clubhouse REST API.</p><p>So the point of the whole thing is this: </p><figure><img src="https://funnybretzel.com/content/images/2021/02/clubhouse-list-rooms.PNG"><figcaption>Search all the relevant rooms using a keyword</figcaption></figure><p>Now I can list all the rooms that have a certain topic of interest in their title, get their ID and programmatically join them to listen! This is a fully automated clubhouse experience. &nbsp;</p><p>I am working on a dashboard of interesting Clubhouse rooms and events but it is currently personal until Clubhouse releases a public API that is legit to access. This was a fun 2 hour project to implement :) </p><p>If you want to get notified of new stuff just follow me on Clubhouse as well, you can find me under "Karim Jedda", same picture as here.</p><p>Enjoy, have a great weekend and stay healthy. </p><p>Note: I was asked to contact the Clubhouse dev if they knew this was possible since it also would allow listening into rooms while remaining anonymous... so I tweeted them and let's see, hope that gets fixed easy peasy :)</p>

<p>One of the quiet, grotesque, longrunning scandals of the US legal system is PACER, the paywall that separates the people of America from their court records. It's a hard drive of non-searchable PDFs, and it costs Americans $150m+/year to run.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/08/turkeys-for-christmas-party/#recap">https://pluralistic.net/2020/08/08/turkeys-for-christmas-party/#recap</a></p>
<p>After decades of fights – including the stunt that put Aaron Swartz in the FBI's crosshairs – Congress is finally moving on the Open Courts Act, which makes substantial reforms to the PACER system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/8235/text">https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/8235/text</a></p>
<p>But as Carl Malamud – who has been a leader in the fight to free PACER – writes in an open letter to the bill's Congressional and Senate advocates, the Act doesn't go nearly far enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://law.resource.org/pub/us/cfr/regulations.gov.foia/uscourts.gov.20210204.pdf">https://law.resource.org/pub/us/cfr/regulations.gov.foia/uscourts.gov.20210204.pdf</a></p>
<p>The law is free as in speech – in the public domain, owned by no one. PACER should be a system for distributing whole copies of all US law to anyone who wants to host them (and it should be free for anyone who wants to confirm a copy's veracity).</p>
<p>As Malamud points out, distributing copies of the PACER corpus takes some of the pressure off revisions to PACER itself. PACER is total flaming garbage and needs a complete overhaul. In recognition of this, the bill contemplates <em>five years</em> before major changes are due.</p>
<p>But distributing copies of PACER – a mere 1b documents, peanuts compared to other open access projects – would enable public interest orgs to immediately build their own PACER mirrors to serve different audiences and use-cases.</p>
<p>The letter has an impressive roster of signatories, from EFF legal director Corynne McSherry to Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales to Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle to former CTOs of the USA, a former Chief Data Scientist of the USA, and more.</p>

<p>Aaron Epstein is a 90 year old who lives a couple miles from me in North Hollywood. He's been an AT&amp;T customer since 1960 and holy shit, is he ever <em>done with their shit</em>.</p>
<p>Epstein gets 3mbps (nominal)/1.5 mbps (actual) from AT&amp;T, in the heart of the entertainment industry's company town, where the studios are serviced by a 100gb fiber loop built at public expense (it passes under my house's foundation slab).</p>
<p>Like all of us in this part of LA, Epstein is not able to access this publicly funded fiber, because his city has given monopoly franchises to AT&amp;T and Charter, two of the most despicable monopoly companies in America.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T and Charter have absorbed billions – <em>billions</em> – in public subsidy to build out fast networks, and instead, they've gone on shopping sprees, buying up companies and running them into the ground, showering execs with money, and screwing over their workers.</p>
<p>Epstein took out quarter-page ads in the Manhattan and Dallas editions of the WSJ excoriating AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey (salary: $22.5m) for his failure to do literally the only thing anyone wants his company to do: provide fast broadband.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/raju/status/1356958555824414721">https://twitter.com/raju/status/1356958555824414721</a></p>
<p>In Ars Technica, Jon Brodkin speaks with Epstein, who sounds like a really excellent fellow, about the many frustrations he faces in his home and business with broadband from the cable/DSL duopoly.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/att-customer-since-1960-buys-wsj-print-ad-to-complain-of-slow-speeds/">https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/att-customer-since-1960-buys-wsj-print-ad-to-complain-of-slow-speeds/</a></p>
<p>"Epstein said he pays AT&amp;T about $100 a month at home for two phone lines and Internet service and $49 a month to Charter for cable Internet. Epstein also pays AT&amp;T for phone and Internet service at a business he owns in Sherman Oaks."</p>
<p>And Brodkin found a spokesweasel from AT&amp;T to comment on Epstein's letter. The anonymous spox provided the following drivel for publication: "We continually enhance and invest in our wireless and wireline networks."</p>
<p>It turns out that Mr Epstein is a goddamned legend and hero. He's from an impressive lineage, part of the "Pickwick Books" Epsteins, a legendary Hollywood bookstore founded by Russian immigrant Louis Epstein in 1938:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-05-25-we-5692-story.html">https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-05-25-we-5692-story.html</a></p>
<p>But Mr Epstein isn't just descended from greatness – he attained greatness in his own right. In 1999, he won a critical lawsuit that ended the corrupt practice of running Business Improvement Districts through "Property Owner Associations" not subject to sunshine laws.</p>
<p>The risible pretense that these were not local government bodies allowed BIDs to operate unaccountably, making significant changes to municipal policy under cover of darkness.</p>
<p><a href="https://michaelkohlhaas.org/wp/2014/10/30/no-one-shall-expel-us-from-the-paradise-epstein-has-created-for-us/">https://michaelkohlhaas.org/wp/2014/10/30/no-one-shall-expel-us-from-the-paradise-epstein-has-created-for-us/</a></p>
<p>Epstein sued the City of LA all the way to the Appellate Division, where the court actual mocked the City lawyers for their idiotic arguments, calling them the "The 'We Said We Didn’t "Create" the POA, So You Can’t Decide We Did'" gambit.</p>
<p>As Michael Kohlhaas wrote of the lawsuit, "Without Epstein’s pioneering work, BIDs wouldn’t have been known to be subject to the Brown Act and the California Public Records Act."</p>

<p>Amazon's Chicago DCH1 warehouse workers are pioneers of Amazon labor organizing. They met brutal treatment with walkouts, petitions and protests that wrung real concessions from Amazon, a company that pioneered worker brutality.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/amazon-gives-part-time-warehouse-workers-paid-leave-amid-coronavirus.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/amazon-gives-part-time-warehouse-workers-paid-leave-amid-coronavirus.html</a></p>
<p>But now DCH1 is being made to suffer. The company has demanded that these workers knuckle under to a new scheduling system called "Megacycles," which is corporatespeak for a ten-hour shift that runs from 1:20AM to 11:50AM.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3gk3w/amazon-is-forcing-its-warehouse-workers-into-brutal-megacycle-shifts">https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3gk3w/amazon-is-forcing-its-warehouse-workers-into-brutal-megacycle-shifts</a></p>
<p>Workers that refuse the new schedule – because there is no transit option to get them to their job at that hour, because they are caring for elderly relatives, because they have kids in distance ed – will lose their jobs.</p>
<p>And while this schedule would be a burden to any worker, it's an especially vicious way to treat women workers, who are far more likely to be in caregiving roles at home, and who face extra safety risks associated with midnight travel to their shift.</p>
<p>Amazon claims the benefit of "megacycles" is efficiency – and if "efficiency" means "paying fewer workers to do more work for less money," then they're obviously right.</p>
<p>"Jen Crowcroft, a spokesperson for Amazon, told Motherboard that the transition to megacycle provides a longer window for customers to place orders and an improved station experience, and makes it easier for different delivery stations to work together."</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. And also, it means that workers have to abandon their kids and parents and the company of non-nocturnal humans and work 10 hours straight in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>A petition from DCH1 Amazonians United calls for all Amazon workers to receive a $2/h wage premium for working "megacycles," accommodations for caretakers to allow them to work fractional shifts, and free Lyft rides to and from work.</p>
<p>"The National Employment Law Project found in a 2020 report on workplaces injuries in Amazon warehouses is twice that of the national average for the warehouse industry. " -Lauren Kaori Gurley, Motherboard.</p>

<h2>Is Software Abstraction Killing Civilization?</h2>

<p><b>Or: Jonathan Blow is wrong but also right and we still
need to prevent the collapse of civilization</b></p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<p>
I recently stumbled upon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">a talk by game
development guru Jonathan Blow</a>, about how software 
abstraction will lead to the end of civilization. Quick summary:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information passed on between generations is diluted.
    Practise is better than theory for keeping skills alive.</li>
  <li>Software runs the world.</li>
  <li>Abstraction fosters ignorance about low level programming.</li>
  <li>If we forget low level stuff, civilization will fall apart
    since we won't be able to keep vital software running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was one of those 
talks that might at a first glance seem perfectly reasonable, not least 
because similar ideas are regularly discussed in programmer circles by a
great number of 
people. Then you start thinking about what's said, and all the errors and 
misconceptions presented makes you feel troubled, because it's both 
tempting and easy to perpetuate the punchlines without
considering their implications. <b>I agree with Blow that it's
important to pass knowledge between generations. Therefore, the veracity
of that information is extremely important.</b> I propose that
the information given in the very talk about the importance of
such information, is in fact wrong on many counts.
</p>

<p>
That's why I, in this rather long text, have tried to examine Blow's
claims in detail. (TL;DR: Someone is wrong on the Internet - man with
ample spare time on his hands to the rescue!)
</p>

<h3>Some examples of collapsed civilizations and artefacts lost in time</h3>

<p>
I'm not a historian and will not comment on this first part of the talk. It doesn't matter much, though; my gripe is mainly with the second part.
</p>

<h3>Five nines</h3>

<p>
Blow says we used to use the "five nines" (99.999% uptime) metric when selling computer systems. Since his laptop has the habit of rebooting when in sleep mode, it can never be a candidate for 99.999% uptime. This part is true: five nines means a total yearly downtime of just above five minutes. This is presented as proof that we have lost a rhetoric of quality. This part is false.
</p>

<p>
In reality, five nines usually applies to things like emergency response switchboards (911), hospital systems, financial transaction processing, etc. It's also a metric usually accompanied by long contracts detailing various downtime scenarios that couldn't possibly count as downtime. It has never, ever been used to sell consumer laptops or the word processors we run on them.
</p>

<p>
It's also incorrect that five nines isn't used anymore: several companies, such as IBM and Amazon, sell such systems and services. Incidentally, IBM actually goes further and claims their Power9 platform can provide even higher availability. Provided, I'm sure, the network used to reach it is functioning and the client computers are working and, and, and... you get the point.
</p>

<p>
So, no, we haven't lost this rhetoric of quality. We've simply never used it the way Blow claims.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, my laptops never reboot unless I tell them to and one of them currently has an uptime of 55 days.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/endofciv/uptime_brumbrum.png" alt="A photo of my laptop's screen, showing a 55 day uptime.">
</p>

<h3>"The industry hasn't produced robust software for decades"</h3>

<p>

What is robust? Is it my iPhone, going for weeks and months without a 
reboot? Is it
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years/">the famous uptime of Novell's file and printer servers</a>, 
with documented instances running for 16 years? Is it the multi-year 
uptimes of a plethora of Unix, Windows and VMS machines? Is it the 365+ 
days (and counting) uptime of some random Linux web server I've got 
access to? Is it turnkey systems like IBM i, offering continuous 
availability?

</p>

<p>
Apparently none of the above, according to Blow.
</p>

<h3>"Tech companies are no longer about pushing tech forward"</h3>

<p>
Well, yes and no. I agree that the lifestyle app startups of Silicon Valley (and elsewhere) are hardly about pushing tech forward - but people more interested in making money rather than amazing technology has always been around. Was Infocom's umpteenth text adventure about pushing tech forward? Was any of the ten bazillion (a rough estimate) jumpy-shooty platform games produced? Was MS-DOS, single-tasking its way through 15 years of building Microsoft's empire right up until its last breath in version 6.22?
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of exciting stuff happening on the "hard tech" front. Blow does mention machine learning earlier in his talk, but "boring" things like file systems, web servers, databases and programming languages are also continually developed and improved upon. A lot of effort is also going into improving the various layers of abstraction, virtualization and containerization Blow is so adverse to - but him disliking them doesn't mean they're not about pushing tech forward.
</p>

<h3>"Abstraction leads to loss of capability."</h3>

<p>
Blow lists a number of programming languages, some of which have fallen out of fashion because of abstraction. His take basically boils down to learning assembly coding, memory management and pointers.
</p>

<p>
I agree that a large number of programmers today (myself included) are very happy with not having to deal with things like memory allocation and pointers. And yes, there are certainly horrifying examples of when abstraction gets the better of us. Plenty of web sites use a lot of completely unnecessary JavaScript framework voodoo to render a simple blog and plenty of supposed "desktop apps" are really running (very slowly) inside a bundled browser.
</p>

<p>
Despite that, I'm willing to bet a few bucks there are more people 
around today (including youngsters) who can program in C than ever 
before, and that more C and assembly code is being written than ever 
before. Linux and NetBSD, for example, are continuously being ported to 
pretty much everything that even vaguely resembles a CPU. Rust, a new 
language with a heavy focus on robustness, <b>does</b> feature pointers and 
lets the programmer manage memory. Harvard's introduction to Computer 
Science, CS50, is publicly available on Youtube and each year it 
features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF6YkH-8vFk">a two hour
lecture on stuff like memory layout, pointers,
malloc() and free()</a>.
</p>

<p>
I agree that the things mentioned here are good to know about and I think anyone seriously into programming should at least try them out some time, if for no other reason than to understand why a lot of us prefer to avoid them if given the option to do so.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and garbage collection and functional programming aren't new 
abstractions. Lisp did both in the late 1950s and it's been used in a 
lot of "hardcore" settings, including
<a href="http://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab</a>.
And, unsurprisingly, a Lisp programmer will of course claim that Lisp
makes you much more productive than something with malloc() ever will.
</p>

<h3>"The productivity of Facebook employees is approaching zero"</h3>

<p>
Here we're shown some graphs of the rising number of Facebook and Twitter employees and Blow states that since Facebook doesn't really get that many new features each year, all those programmers mostly sit around and do nothing.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I'm pretty sure Facebook employs a wide range of staff who are not feature developers: lawyers, accountants, graphical 
designers, sysadmins, researchers, HR, middle management, etc. When not working on Facebook the site, employees of Facebook the company 
are also working on Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR to name some of their other pursuits. I'd also argue that (measurable) individual 
output in general drops as a result of a company growing. You need to reach a certain critical mass to have a whole team working hard on 
a feature only to, by some managerial decision, drop it right before it's finished. Things like that happen all the time in large 
software companies and won't show up in Blow's rather flimsy metric.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Blow constructs this argument around the assumption that Facebook's product is Facebook, in the sense of the social platform. This is of course wrong. Facebook doesn't have to add or change very many features on their social platform every year, they just have to keep things smooth enough for those who actually use those functions to stay content.
</p>

<p>
This is because Facebook's real product is an ad delivery platform.
</p>

<p>
As such, it collects massive amounts of personal and private data and churns it into targeted ads, all the while sucking people in with cleverly designed attention-grabbing dark patterns. I'm sure plenty of work is done on this by a whole lot of programmers, but it'll never appear as "features" to the user, only as corporate revenue. In that respect, Facebook programmers seem to be highly productive.
</p>

<h3>Ken Thompson's "Three Week Unix"</h3>

<p>
First off, I'm not out to belittle Ken Thompson's efforts here. Writing an assembler, editor and basic kernel in three weeks is highly respectable work by any standard. It's also a great piece of computer lore and fits Blow's narrative perfectly - especially with Kernighan's little quip about productivity in the end. Of course, we don't know how "robust" Thompson's software was at this stage, or how user friendly, or what kind of features it had. I'm going to boldly claim it would've been a hard sell today, even if it did run on modern hardware.
</p>

<p>
I'm also pretty sure Thompson dealt with little or nothing of the following during those three weeks: documentation, code reviews, daily standups, backlog grooming, user stories, unit tests, customer demands, A/B testing, writing commit messages and adhering to a corporate code formatting standard. We are after all talking about a guy who, when he could pick any names he wanted, opted for "creat", "mv" and "cp".
</p>

<p>
I'm also certain Thompson could work alone in a private office, rather than share an open floor plan with fifty colleagues incessantly shouting into cellphones, shuffling furniture around or having animated discussions about football two feet from his desk.
</p>

<p>
It's important to remember that apart from hardware and software, the working conditions for most developers are vastly different …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> In a new paper, a team of EPFL spatial-analysis experts and neurologists from Geneva University Hospital (HUG) show that the probability of developing Parkinson's disease is higher in the canton of Geneva's urban centers than in its rural areas. This constitutes an important contribution to the study of the causes of this neurodegenerative disease, which are still poorly understood.<br></p><div id="news-content-text" itemprop="description"><p>Parkinson's disease, which progressively destroys certain types of brain neurons, affects some 15,000 people in Switzerland. It’s the second-most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's. Its frequency increases with age and it tends to occur more frequently in men. Although the cause is still largely unknown, scientists agree that in most cases a combination of hereditary and environmental factors play a role.</p><p>By studying the geographic distribution of Parkinson's patients in a given area, scientists can identify clusters of higher or lower prevalence and, based on this, extrapolate potential environmental risk factors. In 2018, <a href="https://www.hug.ch/neurologie">HUG neurologists</a> Pierre Burkhard and Vanessa Fleury carried out Switzerland’s first assessment of the incidence of Parkinson's disease, in the canton of Geneva. They used their findings to compile an anonymized database of Parkinson's patients. “Prof. Burkhard had noticed that several of his patients lived close together, and thought there might be localized clusters of the disease in the canton. Then I worked with him to find a way to scientifically substantiate his hypothesis,” says Fleury.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Are there places where Parkinson's disease is more prevalent than elsewhere?</p></blockquote><p>Fleury&nbsp;met with Dr. Stéphane Joost and his student Rebecca Himsl, after being put in touch by the <a href="https://www.hug.ch/medecine-premier-recours/unite-epidemiologie-populationnelle-uep">Population Epidemiology Unit at HUG </a>and&nbsp;Prof. Idris Guessous – a long-time research partner of EPFL's <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lasig/">Geographic Information Systems Laboratory (LASIG)</a>. Himsl subsequently selected this topic for her Master's project. Bringing clinicians and spatial-analysis experts together on a cross-disciplinary team proved to be highly effective. “We looked at the situation from an epidemiological point of view and asked: Are there places where Parkinson's disease is more prevalent than elsewhere?” says Himsl, now a flood-risk analyst for a Canadian company. The results of the study were published in&nbsp;<em>Parkinsonism &amp; Related Disorders</em>&nbsp;on 1 February.</p><p><strong>New perspectives</strong></p><p>The study's findings are enlightening, above all in terms of the methodology used, which puts forth a new approach to environmental epidemiology research. The team linked environmental and epidemiological data regarding the age, gender and address of the canton's 1,115 Parkinson's disease patients, and drew up detailed maps of case distribution based on specific environmental exposure factors. To create a control group, they incorporated data on 12,614 Geneva residents collected by the Population Epidemiology Unit's Health Bus between 1995 and 2014. This approach based on individual cases differs from the more conventional method of aggregating data, which can be less accurate for detecting highly localized areas of disease prevalence.</p><div><figure><img alt="" height="471" src="https://actu.epfl.ch/static/upload/fckeditorimage/b6/e1/192abba7.jpg" width="622"><figcaption>Distribution of Parkinson's disease hotspots (red points) and coldspots (blue points) in the canton of Geneva&nbsp;© LASIG</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>“A very complex set of causes”</strong></p><p>“We geolocated patient groups taking into account known confounding factors such as age and gender. This allowed us to pinpoint local hotspots with a higher prevalence of Parkinson's disease. Such spatial dependence concerns a small percentage of patients (6%), but remains statistically significant even after all factors that could contribute to Parkinson's disease have been eliminated,” Himsl explains. Her findings, generated in part by a probability model, also make it possible to identify “coldspots” – areas where fewer people than average are affected by Parkinson's disease.</p><blockquote><p>It's all part of a very complex set of causes. Sometimes, however, we can identify a dominant factor</p></blockquote><p>The study shows that most Parkinson's hotspots are located close to downtown Geneva, in contrast to coldspots, which are situated on the outskirts. “There is a significant positive correlation between these hotspots and the degree of air pollution, which leads us to suspect that there is a link between Parkinson's and atmospheric pollution. Our study highlights two key facts: the multifactorial nature of Parkinson's disease, and the importance of improving air quality to prevent the disease,” explains Fleury. Joost adds: “It's all part of a very complex set of causes. Sometimes, however, we can identify a dominant factor, as we did here, which is very likely air pollution.”</p><div><figure><img alt="" height="472" src="https://actu.epfl.ch/static/upload/fckeditorimage/db/77/4412fccc.jpg" width="622"><figcaption>Distribution of Parkinson's disease hotspots and coldspots in the canton of Geneva, associated with air pollution. © LASIG</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Matching results – with two exceptions</strong></p><p>When Joost picked up Himsl’s work after she graduated, he incorporated data recently made available by the Greater Geneva agglomeration concerning concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and suspended particulate matter. He then superimposed these data on Himsl’s maps and saw that they matched up across all the hotspots – except for the Eaux-Vives district near the city center, where air quality seems to be better, and the Les Délices coldspot, which shows high levels of nitrogen dioxide. “We will now try to identify one or more possible explanatory factors and publish them in a new paper,” says Joost, who already posits that a confluence of positive factors close to home may reduce the risk of developing the disease.</p><p>“Thanks to the areas of prevalence that the study identified, it could be of use to healthcare providers,” says Joost. “We have shown that there is a greater likelihood of developing Parkinson's disease in certain types of neighborhoods, which could lead policymakers to introduce measures to protect residents or improve facilities in these communities. Our findings will also help the HUG neurologists we worked with, who can now focus on looking for other factors that explain the onset of this disease.”</p></div></div>]]>

  <p>Feb 5, 2021</p>




<p>With the events that
<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/26/iran-blocks-signal-messaging-app-after-whatsapp-exodus">the private messaging app Signal has been blocked in Iran</a>,
Signal has come up with an “proxy” solution akin to
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>’s
<a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/bridges/">Bridges</a>, and have given
instructions on how to do it.</p>
<p>For people who prefer FreeBSD over Linux like myself, we obviously can’t run
Docker, which is what Signal’s instructions focus on.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Docker image is just a fancy wrapper around nginx,
<a href="https://twitter.com/ahfaeroey/status/1357878573785362437">and the configs can be ported to any OS</a>.
Here, I’ll show you how to set up a Signal Proxy on FreeBSD.</p>

<p>You will need a FreeBSD server that is not running anything on Port 80 or 443.
If you don’t run FreeBSD, you can substitute the commands with ones specific to
your OS or Linux distro.</p>
<p>You can also substitute <code>acme.sh</code> with another ACME-compatible Let’s Encrypt
client, or use another CA. I used <code>acme.sh</code> with ZeroSSL, but won’t describe
the latter here for simplicity’s sake.</p>

<p>First, you’ll need to install <code>acme.sh</code> and <code>nginx</code>:</p>
<pre><code>pkg install acme.sh nginx
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you’ll need to get an SSL certificate:</p>
<pre><code>acme.sh --register-account -m neel@neelc.org --server zerossl
acme.sh --issue --standalone -d DOMAIN
</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>DOMAIN</code> with the hostname you want to use.</p>
<p>Next, use the following config for <code>/usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>load_module /usr/local/libexec/nginx/ngx_stream_module.so;
user www;

    server {

        access_log            off;
     }

</code></pre>
<p>Again replace <code>DOMAIN</code> with the domain your Signal proxy is on.</p>
<p>After you have set the <code>nginx</code> config, enable it via sysrc:</p>
<pre><code>sysrc nginx_enable=YES
</code></pre>
<p>And start it:</p>
<pre><code>service nginx start
</code></pre>
<p>You should have a fully-functioning Signal proxy.</p>

<p>While the official Signal instructions are very Docker-centric for the tech
part, it does have other useful information on sharing the proxy securely.
This means I won’t duplicate the information here.</p>

   <article>

        

        <section>
            <div><p>I wanted to write to you all and share that I've launched my first eBook called <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/serverless-for-everyone-else">"Serverless For Everyone Else"</a> - within the first three hours of launch, nobody bought a single copy and I thought that I'd got it all wrong.</p>
<p>The "everyone else" is a reference to how complicated and difficult cloud-based and Kubernetes-based FaaS has become. The eBook sets out to help indie developers, and individuals within corporations build and deploy functions using a new version of OpenFaaS (<a href="https://github.com/openfaas/faasd">faasd</a>) which is open source and can run on a single VM or VPS without much overhead.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/2028406193591/asset_previews/741f2ad46ff0a08e16aaf48d21810ba7/retina/social4.png" alt="New design"></p>
<p>The real power of functions comes in extending existing systems through webhooks, polling, or querying and updating state. I'll share some of these use-cases below including how I used functions to extend how the Gumroad marketplace worked.</p>
<p>Why did I decide to write an eBook? If you've ever written about tech or spoken at a conference, then Packt has probably approached you on LinkedIn about writing for them. From what I hear, that kind of arrangement means writing in a word doc, with tight deadlines and cranking out 300+ pages. It wasn't for me.</p>
<p>I'd seen <a href="https://twitter.com/dvassallo">Daniel Vassallo</a> create an eBook about AWS and Twitter. Daniel had really good results using Gumroad to sell his self-published eBooks. Then there's <a href="https://twitter.com/adamwathan">Adam Wathan</a> who built Tailwind CSS and trained himself up as a UI designer. He wrote his own eBook and in his yearly review mentioned that it did 600k USD in passive sales, without any promotion.</p>
<p>Whilst I didn't expect to get anywhere close to those numbers with a specialist topic, I did want to know if people would buy something from me.</p>
<h2 id="thetiersatlaunch">The tiers at launch</h2>
<p>I launched with three tiers, with names and clear differentiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimalist - 25 USD - just the eBook</li>
<li>DevOps PRO - 50 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard and the YAML for faasd to enable it</li>
<li>The learner - 99 USD - the eBook, plus a Grafana dashboard,  the YAML for faasd to enable it and a video workshop ready in 7 days</li>
<li>The team player - the learner, but for 5 people in your company</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your options add some value, it seems that people enjoy the choice and are willing to pay a little more.</p>
<p>So I tweeted about the eBook and then nothing happened for three hours.</p>
<p>I interpreted this as a failure. I'd been reading <a href="https://amzn.to/38N5uZy">"The Right It: Why So Many Ideas Fail and How to Make Sure Yours Succeed"</a>, and had convinced myself that this was a sign that nobody wanted the material.</p>
<p>Then I got my first sale, and felt a little relief, maybe I was wrong?</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810538-27b57080-57ed-11eb-905b-d042d3046adf.png" alt="Sale email"></p>
<p>My sales graph had one initial spike on the Friday, and kept going into the Sunday. What had happened? My Twitter audience and GitHub Sponsors came to lend their support.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErzMnuOXMAA_REk?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Initial spike"></p>
<p>Then things died down, and over the course of the week I wondered if I'd failed to find market fit. <a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a> was sending me almost no organic traffic, and nobody was landing on the page via SEO.</p>
<p>It was still more money than I had expected to earn from the eBook within the first week, but I felt like with so much interest in OpenFaaS, that there was a broader audience to reach.</p>
<h2 id="gettingasecondpeak">Getting a second peak</h2>
<p>After the first week, I released the video workshop to the people who'd purchased that tier (99USD), and to get some feedback, I offered a free upgrade to the workshop for the tier just below (50USD). That resulted in another large spike in interest.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e204e93dcfc33679c997c739fbf4f651fdf268d23961bae6f9b4c25ad4ec145/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f45735a3372753258634155513451673f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6d656469756d" alt="Video workshop"></p>
<p>How did I fulfil the upgrade / discount? I did it by writing a function and deploying it to my Raspberry Pi, so that Gumroad would send a webhook, my code would query the dollar amount, and then send out an email to the customer over AWS SES.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EscxNxbXAAEHD8z?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="The function running"></p>
<p>Get the source code here: <a href="https://github.com/alexellis/gumroad-responder">alexellis/gumroad-responder</a></p>
<p>After the second peak, I saw a complete drop-off again - and started to wonder why?</p>
<p>99% of referrals came from Twitter and email, so had I exhausted my network?</p>
<p>I went ahead and added a link on openfaas.com and on my blog at the end of each post, to try and get more views on the eBook. It's too early to tell if that is going to work out, but has resulted in a few conversions already.</p>
<p>One of the bits of feedback I got on the eBook was how users enjoyed the use-cases, and practical examples. I'd recently started video streaming, so invited a friend to my YouTube channel to talk about serverless use-cases.</p>
<p><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/544dffaf339a4ff44439db1c14cd953de385640b99231688f8a49db61294a02e/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f457378444745505841415968724c4f3f666f726d61743d6a7067266e616d653d6c61726765" alt="Video on use-cases"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzuXVuccaqI&amp;feature=youtu.be">Watch the recording</a></p>
<p>The recording generated a lot of interest and engagement for existing eBook customers, but no additional sales.</p>
<p>You can get the <a href="https://gist.github.com/alexellis/c72d7a385f801cc9b8deb7fcaa531b69">show notes</a> here which have lots of links for use-cases from hobbyists, indie devs and corporate users of OpenFaaS.</p>
<h2 id="mynextmilestone">My next milestone</h2>
<p>I am pleased with the results so far, and have learned a lot along the way. I also had a few people reach out to me directly asking for help who had taken inspiration from seeing someone actually go ahead and take a calculated risk.</p>
<p>I haven't quite got to 10k USD, which is a nice round number to aim for, but I can roughly understand what each peak means here, and whether they are repeatable.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EtARGclXMAg7nJ-?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" alt="Approaching 10k"></p>
<p>Once the sales do cross that threshold, I'll write-up a how to guide and share the command lines and tools I used to generate the eBook.</p>
<h2 id="whatsnext">What's next</h2>
<p>I committed to providing free updates - because the eBook was partially experimental and I wanted to validate that it was useful. Using the <a href="https://slack.openfaas.io/">OpenFaaS Slack</a> helped here - I opened a new channel for people who'd bought the book, and enjoyed the feedback and engagement from this.</p>
<p>Some people charge extra for community, but it felt too hard to enforce the access for this.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6358735/104810333-b628f280-57eb-11eb-8be9-a2f6c773346b.png" alt="Original cover"></p>
<p>I generated my own eBook cover originally and then only later, got a professional designer involved.</p>
<p><img src="https://static-2.gumroad.com/res/gumroad/2028406193591/asset_previews/741f2ad46ff0a08e16aaf48d21810ba7/retina/social4.png" alt="New design"></p>
<p>It turns out that the cover may not matter with Gumroad, as long as it's not awful. Since changing cover, I've only seen two new sales.</p>
<p>Now that I have some initial feedback and have learned that people will buy things from me, I want to let goodwill rebuild, and my audience "recover" before launching a second eBook. I've done a lot of free blog posts and writing on Kubernetes, Docker, Golang and Raspberry Pi and analytics from my blog shows me what's popular.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 14 days, I've received more money than OpenFaaS corporate users have paid into the project over 4 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just because something you give away for free is popular, doesn't mean that anyone will be willing to pay for it. OpenFaaS itself is testament to that, with many corporations using it in production, without contributing code or finances back.</p>
<p>The Right It has taught me not to invest too much effort up front in any one idea - as it's likely to fail. Instead I'll be testing ideas - getting feedback by investing a few hours or days, not weeks.</p>
<p>I am sure I've missed out lots of details here, so feel free to ask me questions.</p>

                    The path to World War Two originated from unresolved territorial issues between France and Germany at the end of World War One. These, coupled with economic and social upheaval in Germany and Italy, old colonial ambitions and a desire for conquest led by Hitler and Mussolini resulted in the second world war.

            <h3>The End of World War One and the Paris Peace Conference</h3>

            <p>
                                    World War I was the most terrifying carnage humanity had ever known. At the end of the 52 months of war, the statistics were shattering: over 9 million lives lost, with probably the same number of people suffering from some kind of illness or disability after the battles.

            <h3>Hitler’s Rise to Power</h3>

            <p>
                                    After his unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the government of the province of Bavaria, Hitler was imprisoned. In prison, he wrote his autobiographical book Mein Kampf, ‘My Struggle’. Mein Kampf was the reference work for the entire Nazi ideology. It was the inspiration which ‘justified’ Germany’s expansion and its entire genocidal policy.

            <h3>Nazi Germany</h3>

            <p>
                                    Once Hitler had taken over Germany’s destiny, foreign policy turned towards destroying the diplomatic edifice of the Treaty of Versailles, which many Germans saw as a humiliating ‘Diktat’. The occupation of the demilitarized area of the Rhineland was a definitive failure of the collective security. It opened up the way for the Second World War.

            <h3>Blitzkrieg</h3>

            <p>
                                    Blitzkrieg literally means ‘lightning war’. This tactic describes an offensive military doctrine used by the German Army during World War Two.

            <h3>Japan on the Path to World War Two</h3>

            <p>
                                    The path that led Japan on one side, and the United States, China and Britain on the other to war is long and complex. The origins of the conflict can be identified in Japan's unique history and culture, nurtured by the expansionist tendencies of its leaders in the 1930's.

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Back in <a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-4/">Part 4 </a>I continued the repairs and donated the money from the first batch of the repaired Pis to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. <br></p>



<p>In this post I will be covering what the money went towards and go over the current repair status.</p>



<blockquote><p>I’ve confirmed that your donation has been allocated to Pi Drop. It should fund approximately three deployments of Pi 400+monitor+webcam to disadvantaged young people in the UK. Thanks again for the donation (and for putting more Pi 1 units back in the field).</p><cite>Eben Upton – Founder Raspberry Pi Foundation</cite></blockquote>



<p>The money donated so far has funded three computers for disadvantaged young people that require a computer to learn from home. Whilst this might not seem like a lot from selling 27 Raspberry Pi 1’s please keep in mind this includes a Raspberry Pi 400 or a Raspberry Pi 4 with keyboard, mouse, monitor and SD card. </p>



<p>In terms of continuing the repairs and donations I have a goal in my head that I would like to meet and I will be listing a further 30 repaired  Model B’s for sale today!</p>



<p>I will also be listing 10 “Model A’s” – More about these below.</p>



<h2>Salvaging dead Pis by removing components</h2>



<p>I came across a fair amount of Pis with dead Ethernet and/or dead USB ports. This issue was caused by a failed Ethernet IC.</p>



<p>Eben Upton did offer to see if they had any spare Ethernet IC’s for the Pi 1. I could have used them to restore full functionality to these devices however I had already started converting them to Model As and the chance of spare IC’s for such an old device laying around seemed slim. </p>



<blockquote><p>&nbsp;was thinking perhaps we might have some 9512 chips lying around, but it’s been so long since we transitioned to 9514 that we almost certainly don’t.</p><cite>Eben Upton – Founder Raspberry Pi Foundation</cite></blockquote>



<p>Instead I removed the Ethernet IC and associated circuitry – More of this can be seen in <a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part 3</a>.</p>



<p>I have completed 10 of these so far and they will also be listed for sale today! </p>



<p>These devices are almost identical to the original Model A with the missing Ethernet port, IC and top USB port. <br></p>

<p>Some of these boards might have residual flux left over from the repairs although I have cleaned them up as best as I can! </p>



<p>They also have a mixture of 256MB and 512MB of RAM meaning some of them are an upgrade over the original model A!</p>



<h2>Replacing damaged SD card slots</h2>



<p>I already went over this in<a href="https://blog.jmdawson.co.uk/i-bought-200-raspberry-pi-model-bs-and-im-going-to-fix-them-part-4/"> part 4</a> however I’m further along with the repairs. 30 of these have been repaired in total so far and I also re-enforced the slots with a small amount of Epoxy Resin to stop them being snapped from the board. <br></p>

<p>Please keep in mind when purchasing these – Not all of the Pi’s listed for sale today will include a new SD card slot. Some of the Pis literally had the SD card slots ripped off damaging the pads and a small amount of the devices have had trace wires added to the board to repair the missing pads. These are small and almost unnoticeable but please keep this in mind! </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<div><p>These devices are now listed for sale – as with the last batch the Model Bs will be sold in pairs with one device having been repaired previously and the other working but not repaired. Although both devices have been tested and proved to work I will only guarantee one of the Pis. </p><p>Model Bs x2 for £15: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Raspberry-pi-model-b-x2/274673808835</p><p>Model As x1 for £7: https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Raspberry-pi-model-A/274673810787</p><p>All money raised from these will be donated to the Raspberry Pi Foundation. </p><p>If you have any thoughts on this please let me know below! </p></div>

<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/974/">xkcd sourc</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://xkcd.com/974/" target="_blank">e</a></p>



<p>This post began as a response to a teacher who posted in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/673921113090580">Unity Teach Community</a> Facebook group that he had been advised by college video game teacher that object oriented programming (OOP) is a key skill needed for success in collegiate video game programming.</p>



<p>OOP was, in part, a reaction to increasingly larger code bases and increasingly more programmers on projects. Creating OOP can feel unnecessarily verbose for small programs (it often is). Using OOP can often feel like calling magic functions that do things with no understanding of what is happening or how it is happening. I’m brand new to Unity, but already seeing this problem. If the goal is to create video games, no worries, if the goal is to educate students on how OOP works, there might be some concern.</p>



<p>OOP can be tough to crack because the term has conflated a lot of different concepts and taken on somewhat of a religious tone in certain circles. Let me try to break down the different meanings.</p>



<p>OOP is sometimes and incorrectly conflated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming">Structured Programming</a>. Structured Programming is ReallyGood&lt;tm&gt; stuff and is easier to learn with a pure (read not OOP) procedural language. It is, however, quite possible to write structured code in an OOP language where you end up with procedural Java or C# or C++. This aspect of the definition is often just assumed, though, and rarely explicitly discussed.</p>



<p>OOP also has the concept of data hiding sometimes referred to as “black boxes”. This is one step beyond Structured Programming in that you build black boxes that take input and produce output and the programmer using the boxes do not need to know what is going on inside. This is a wonderful thing and it allows programmers to use libraries without having the slightest clue of how they internally work. There is, however, overhead (both code performance and increased coding time) in creating libraries this way and there is a very real argument that merely teaching students to <em>use</em> black boxes is to short change them on the ability to <em>create </em>them.</p>



<p>Next we have inheritance which is a very abused but very powerful concept that is especially powerful in video game programming.  Imagine you have a sprite. It can go up, down, left, right. It has an image associated with it. Now you want to create a tank in your game. Tanks can do everything a sprite can do <em>and</em> more, say shoot another sprite as a projectile. So you inherit all the things a sprite can do, don’t have to recreate that particular wheel, and add only the new things the tank is and does.</p>



<p>Mind blowingly powerful when used correctly in video game programming and other programming fields. Painful when twisted for unsuited uses.</p>



<p>Lastly, OOP is about data protection aka public and private (and protected and a few other things better left for another time). This is related to the concept of black boxes. Data protection provides the opaqueness that is needed to protect the inside of the boxes from the outside world.</p>



<p>It would be nice to just be able to set the rules for libraries in a procedural programming language and tell the other programmers “use this, don’t use that, assume this, don’t assume that”. Reality is programmers rarely follow those rules and history is rife with programmers taking advantage of “undocumented features”. So OOP actually allows you to <em>enforce </em>some set of the rules on programmers. Some things are public, fair game for any use by anyone, some things are private, that is inside the black box and, even if you can figure out how it works, you can’t directly access it.</p>



<p>I’ll add that there is a more pure definition OOP coming out of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">SmallTalk </a>world, primarily, where the entire goal is to pass messages from one object to another to enforce some of the above. This is largely a theoretical approach and isn’t so consistent with modern Java, C++, C# and the like. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210">Objective C</a> was somewhat in this vein. Honestly, Objective C just gave me a headache.</p>



<p>Learning or teaching OOP can be made much easier by breaking each of the above parts into separate components as one tends to be overwhelmed by all the concepts that get thrown around. With all that said, to loop around to the beginning, OOP is a tool and sometimes a very useful tool (especially in video game programming) but it is a screwdriver and doesn’t help so much driving nails.</p>

<p>Historical analogies are a way for us to find our footing. Psychologists regard them as a key plank in the learning process. ‘History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,’ they say. So it’s no surprise that the coronavirus crisis draws comparison with a range of historic events.</p>



<p><strong>The disease itself has been compared with the flu pandemic of 1918.</strong> Although there have been other flu pandemics since, the ‘Spanish flu’ of 1918 is known for its heavy death toll of 20-50 million. Like all analogies there are differences and a stand-out one here is that the 1918 flu targeted the young, while coronavirus seems to target the old. That it was, oddly, largely forgotten as a historical event is a feature that also doesn’t seem to resonate given the way life is being experienced under coronavirus.</p>



<p><strong>The public response has been compared with the Second World War.</strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8150155/Virus-causes-surge-WW-II-references-merited.html" target="_blank">Angela Merkel said (on 18 March)</a>, “Since the Second World War, there has been no challenge to our nation that has demanded such a degree of common and united action.” Meanwhile, in the UK, commentators have summoned the spirit of the Blitz to ease the burden from social restrictions. Of course, this time both nations are fighting a common enemy. And <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://london.ac.uk/about-us/history-university-london/story-behind-keep-calm-and-carry" target="_blank"><em>Keep Calm and Carry On</em> is being used a lot more now than it was back then</a>.</p>



<p><strong>The suddenness is being compared with 9/11.</strong> Worldviews changed that day, just as they may be changing again. 9/11 heralded a fear of terror on a scale never before confronted. Like today’s virus, the terror did not discriminate. It is hard to believe that eight weeks ago the stock market was making new highs and the prospect that the state could legislate against basic human freedoms to the extent it has was ridiculous. In the space of a few weeks travel restrictions escalated from a few flights being cancelled from ‘high risk’ places like Beijing and Northern Italy, to flights being cancelled because demand for non-essential travel collapsed, to flights being cancelled because countries literally closed their borders.</p>



<p><strong>From an economic perspective, the analogy is the global financial crisis of 2008.</strong> Company finances are being ravaged and monetary authorities are rolling out many of the packages to ease strains in the financial system that they moth-balled after the 2008/09 financial crisis. In fact, the CEO of Marriott International, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SprFgoU6aO0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arne Sorenson, went as far as to say</a> on 20 March that “Covid-19 is having a more severe and sudden financial impact on our business than 9/11 and the 2009 financial crisis combined.” On Thursday 26 March, US jobless claims jumped to 3.28 million, four times the prior peak in records that have been compiled since 1967. JPMorgan economists expect US GDP to be down 40% in 2Q with unemployment hitting 20%.</p>



<p>Other analogies abound. The Great Depression of the 1930’s; natural disasters; and Prohibition – which amputated from the economy an entire industry in the way that industries such as hospitality are being poleaxed today.</p>



<p><strong>Of them all, the financial crisis of 2008 seems to offer the best framework. But not for its steer on the economic fallout, rather for the spotlight it shines on our understanding of the virus itself.</strong></p>



<h2>Mark to Market</h2>



<p>One of the challenges in the early stages of the financial crisis was dimensioning the losses that were building. No-one knew how big they were, nor where they were. <a href="https://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission report</a> recalls that in early 2007 “Goldman marked mortgage-related securities at prices that were significantly lower than those of other companies.” The divergence came to a head in April 2007 when Goldman valued a Bear Stearns hedge fund’s positions at between 65 cents and 100 cents on the dollar. A few weeks later it revalued the positions, going as low as 55 cents on the dollar. Ralph Cioffi, the manager of the Bear Stearns fund, resisted. He proposed using fair value marks based on his team’s models, implying losses that were significantly less than those using Goldman’s marks.</p>



<p>The different approach to marks back then is reflected in the different approach to testing today. On 1 March Nassim Taleb tweeted this. His point was that the “losses” were by then endemic; it was just that some countries were measuring them more accurately than others.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>There is a marked-to-market problem.<br>Low incidence = low testing.</p><p>Only places that mark to market properly seem to be Singapore and Bella Italia. <a href="https://t.co/seSrdFy3X8">pic.twitter.com/seSrdFy3X8</a></p></div>— Nassim Nicholas Taleb (@nntaleb) <a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1233927807845183490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Several weeks later the lack of wholesale testing still makes it difficult to dimension the true scale of the problem. By now it is apparent that the number of confirmed cases (2 million globally at the time of writing) is not a valid reflection of the number of actual cases. But how many actual cases there are remains unknown.</p>



<ul><li>An <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/covid19estimates/#/details/United_Kingdom" target="_blank">Imperial College study</a> estimates that 4.04% of the UK population has been infected as at 14 April (with 95% confidence between 2.87% and 5.67%).</li></ul>



<ul><li>The UK based <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/severity/global_cfr_estimates.html" target="_blank">Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases</a> estimates that 3.6% of symptomatic cases in the UK were reflected in official reported numbers as of 14 April (with 95% confidence between 3.1% and 7.7%).</li></ul>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/less-than-1-of-austria-infected-with-coronavirus-new-study-shows#maincontent" target="_blank">A survey of 1,500 people in Austria</a> found that 0.33% were “acutely infected” at the beginning of April (with 95% confidence between 0.12% and 0.76%).</li></ul>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/04/10/coronavirus-covid-19-small-nations-iceland-big-data/2959797001/" target="_blank">Iceland’s small population</a> and developed healthcare system has allowed it to test more of its population than any other nation. By 11 April it had tested 10% of its population with results implying that between 0.3% and 0.8% of the country could be infected.</li></ul>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/eradicated-coronavirus-mass-testing-covid-19-italy-vo" target="_blank">In Italy all the residents of the small town of Vò were tested</a> in the two weeks leading up to 20 March. The process found that at the time of the first symptomatic case some 3% of the population had already been infected.</li></ul>



<p>Like with the Bear Stearns hedge funds over a decade ago, some countries are also incentivised to under-represent their caseload. One example is Japan, where the number of confirmed cases began to ramp up immediately after the Tokyo Olympics had been officially postponed, leading some to speculate the number had been artificially suppressed. China too was criticised for under-reporting the severity of the disease when it first broke out in Wuhan in December 2019.</p>



<h2>Mark to Model</h2>



<p><strong>As well as questioning the validity of valuations being employed, the financial crisis also exposed flaws in the models used to underpin various financial structures. </strong>“Financial institutions and credit rating agencies embraced mathematical models as reliable predictors of risks, replacing judgment in too many instances. Too often, risk management became risk justification.” (<a href="https://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_full.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission report</a>).</p>



<p>Right now, policy is being steered by a range of epidemiology models that are being used to predict the spread of the virus. The problem with these models – as with all models, including those used on Wall Street in 2007/08 – is that they are only as good as the assumptions they rest on. “All models are wrong,” said statistician George Box, (“but some are useful.”) When it comes to epidemiological models there is a broad range of uncertainty around many of the inputs.</p>



<p>That uncertainty can be categorised in three buckets.</p>



<p><strong>The first covers the quality of the data,</strong> such as the number of people infected. As outlined above, this remains a key unknown. Some models use statistical techniques to infer total infections, such as the one from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/severity/global_cfr_estimates.html" target="_blank">Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases</a> which extrapolates from fatalities; others use sampling such as in Iceland. Even the hardest variable of all – fatalities – is subject to uncertainty. The UK’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public#number-of-cases-and-deaths" target="_blank">Department of Health and Social Care (DHSE)</a> reports daily the number of people who died in hospital before 5pm the previous day. But what about those who didn’t die in hospital, but died in care homes or at home? (My neighbour was allowed home from hospital to die – where does he appear in the DHSE dataset?) And what about those who died anyway from other causes – those who died <em>with</em> Covid rather than <em>from</em> Covid (like a friend’s father)? There is also typically a lag between when the death occurs and when it is recorded in the data – incurred but not reported is the jargon used in the insurance industry. If that lag is consistent it may not impact the output of the model much, but <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/longevitymatt/status/1247449180165017601" target="_blank">any change to the lag can skew resulting projections materially</a>.</p>



<p>The amount of data being generated through this crisis is immense. Unlike in 1918 when ‘20-50 million’ died, by the time this is over we will know <em>precisely</em> how many died. But it may take hindsight to discern the signal from the noise. When I look back at my notes from the financial crisis, there were a lot of datapoints that were fleetingly useful yet turned into dead ends.</p>



<p>Data quality is further compromised when comparing between countries. Datasets between countries are not really compatible with each other, yet with every political system on the planet confronted with a common challenge, there is a tendency for commentators to compare responses. While the overall shape of the spread looks similar, mortality rates remain stubbornly different. There are many explanations include healthcare capacity, population density, global connectedness, prevalence of underlying conditions like obesity, lockdown initiation, and demographics. But it may not be until we are further along the curve that robust comparisons can be made. Singapore had the virus under control before seeing a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Singapore" target="_blank">second wave emerge in April</a>. Germany is being seen as a leader in testing, yet its regime <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/corona-challenge-germany-reaching-the-upper-limit-of-testing-capacity-a-4d75e7bd-dd0e-41e3-9f09-eb4364c43f2e" target="_blank">is not without criticism</a>. Sweden has resisted a lockdown on the scale mandated in other European countries; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://unherd.com/2020/04/jury-still-out-on-swedish-coronavirus-strategy/" target="_blank">the jury is still out on its strategy</a>.</p>



<p><strong>The second source of uncertainty stems from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nucleardiner.wordpress.com/2020/04/07/the-ihme-epidemiological-model/" target="_blank">how the models have been calibrated</a>.</strong> The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf" target="_blank">Imperial College model</a> is a bottom-up “individual-based simulation …</p></div></div>

<p>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — Planned legislation to establish new business areas in Nevada would allow technology companies to effectively form separate local governments.</p>

<p>Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak announced a plan to launch so-called Innovation Zones in Nevada to jumpstart the state’s economy by attracting technology firms, Las Vegas Review-Journal reported  Wednesday.</p>

<p>The zones would permit companies with large areas of land to form governments carrying the same authority as counties, including the ability to impose taxes, form school districts and courts and provide government services.</p>


<p>The measure to further economic development with the “alternative form of local government” has not yet been introduced in the Legislature.</p>

<p>Sisolak pitched the concept in his State of the State address delivered Jan. 19. The plan would bring in new businesses at the forefront of “groundbreaking technologies” without the use of tax abatements or other publicly funded incentive packages that previously helped Nevada attract companies like Tesla Inc.</p>


<p>Sisolak named Blockchains, LLC as a company that had committed to developing a “smart city” in an area east of Reno after the legislation has passed.</p>


<p>The draft proposal said the traditional local government model is “inadequate alone” to provide the resources to make Nevada a leader in attracting and retaining businesses and fostering economic development in emerging technologies and industries.</p>

<p>The Governor’s Office of Economic Development would oversee applications for the zones, which would be limited to companies working in specific business areas including blockchain, autonomous technology, the Internet of Things, robotics, artificial intelligence, wireless, biometrics and renewable resource technology.</p>


<p>Zone requirements would include applicants owning at least 78 square miles (202 square kilometers) of undeveloped, uninhabited land within a single county but separate from any city, town or tax increment area. Companies would have at least $250 million and plans to invest an additional $1 billion in their zones over 10 years.</p>

<p>The zones would initially operate with the oversight of their location counties, but would eventually take over county duties and become independent governmental bodies.</p>

<p>The zones would have three-member supervisor boards with the same powers as county commissioners. The businesses would maintain significant control over board membership.</p>

<p>The governor’s economic development office did not respond to questions about the zones Wednesday.</p>

      <p>What is said to be the 'smallest reptile on earth' - that we know of - has been discovered in Madagascar. The reptile, which is a subspecies of the chameleon, is the size of a seed.</p>
<p>With a body size of 13.5mm, the male version of the aptly named 'micro-chameleon' (or Brookesia nana), was discovered by a German-Madagascan expedition. The size from head to toe is 22mm.</p>
<p>Along with the male, a female was also discovered which is considerably bigger than her mate, at 29mm.</p>
<p>The discovery makes the male the smallest of about 11,500 known species of reptiles, according to the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Munich.</p>

    <section id="post-title">
    
    <p>How I am using 50+ sources of my personal data
    </p></section>
    <!-- are sections appropriate for that? -->

    <section id="post-content">
    <p>
This is the list of personal data sources I use or planning to use with rough guides on how to get your hands on that data if you want it as well.
It's still incomplete and I'm going to update it regularly.
</p>
<p>
My goal is collecting almost all of my digital trace, <b>automating data collection to the maximum extent possible</b> and making it work in the background, so one can set up pipelines once and hopefully never think about it again.
</p>
<p>
This is kind of a follow-up on my previous post on the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html">sad state of personal data</a>, and part of my personal way of getting around this sad state.
</p>
<p>
If you're terrified by the long list, you can jump straight into <a href="#consumers">"Data consumers"</a> section to find out how I use it.
In addition, check out <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/myinfra.html">my infrastructure map</a>, which might explain it better!
</p>

<div>
<h2 id="why"><a href="#why">¶</a><span>1</span> Why do you collect X? How do you use your data?</h2>
<div>
<p>
All things considered, I think it's a fair question!
Why bother with all this <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#infra">infrastructure</a> and hoard the data if you never use it?
</p>
<p>
In the next section, I will elaborate on each specific data source, but to start with I'll list the rationales that all of them share:
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="backup"><a href="#backup">¶</a>backup</h3>
<p>
It may feel unnecessary, but shit happens. What if your device dies, account gets suspended for some reason or the company goes bust?
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="lifelogging"><a href="#lifelogging">¶</a><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#lifelogging">lifelogging</a></h3>
<div>
<p>
Most data in digital form got timestamps, so automatically, without manual effort, constitutes data for your timeline.
</p>
<p>
I want to remember more, be able to review my past and bring back and reflect on memories. Practicing lifelogging helps with that.
</p>
<p>
It feels very wrong that things can be forgotten and lost forever.
It's understandable from the neuroscience point of view, i.e. the brain has limited capacity and it would be too distracting to remember everything all the time.
That said, I want to have a <b>choice</b> whether to forget or remember events, and I'd like to be able to potentially access forgotten ones.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="qs"><a href="#qs">¶</a><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#quantifiedself">quantified self</a></h3>
<p>
Most collected digital data is somewhat quantitative and can be used to analyze your body or mind.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="what"><a href="#what">¶</a><span>2</span> What do I collect/want to collect?</h2>
<div>
<p>
As I mentioned, most of the collected data serve as a means of backup/lifelogging/quantified self, so I won't mention them again in the 'Why' sections.
</p>
<p>
All my data collection pipelines are <b>automatic unless mentioned otherwise</b>.
</p>
<p>
Some scripts are still private so if you want to know more, let me know so I can prioritize sharing them.

<li>Google collects lots of data, which you could put to some good use. However, old data is getting <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/takeout-data-gone.html">wiped</a>, so it's important to export Takeout regularly.</li>

<h3 id="jawbone"><a href="#jawbone">¶</a>Jawbone</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: via API.
Jawbone is dead now, so if you haven't exported it already, likely your data is lost forever.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>sleep data for the <a href="#dashboard">dashboard</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="kindle"><a href="#kindle">¶</a>Kindle</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: manually exported <samp>MyClippings.txt</samp> from Kindle. Potentially can be automated similarly to <a href="#kobo">Kobo</a>.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#search">better search</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>



<div>
<h3 id="nomie"><a href="#nomie">¶</a><a href="https://nomie.app/">Nomie</a></h3>
<div>
<p>
How: regular copies of <samp>/data/data/io.nomie.pro/files/_pouch_events</samp> and <samp>/data/data/io.nomie.pro/files/_pouch_trackers</samp>
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>could be a great tool for detailed lifelogging if you're into it</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="nutrition"><a href="#nutrition">¶</a>Nutrition</h3>
<div>
<p>
I tracked almost all nutrition data for stuff I ingested over the course of a year.
</p>
<p>
How: I found most existing apps/projects clumsy and unsatisfactory, so I developed my own system.
Not even a proper app, something simpler, basically a domain-specific language in Python to track it.
</p>
<p>
Tracking process was simply editing a python file and adding entries like:
</p>
<div>
<pre>
<span>july_09</span> = F(
  [  
       spinach * bag,
       tuna_spring_water * can,       
       beans_broad_wt    * can * 0.5, 
       onion_red_tsc     * gr(115)  , 
       cheese_salad_tsc  * 100,       
       lime, 
  ],
  [
     
  ],
  tea_black * 10,     
  wine_red * ml * 150, 
)

<span>july_10</span> = ... 
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Comments added for clarity of course, so it'd be more compact normally.
</p>
<p>
Then some code was used for processing, calculating, <a href="https://postimg.cc/bdSVc43Y">visualizing</a>, etc.
</p>
<p>
Having a real programming language instead of an app let me make it very flexible and expressive, e.g.:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
I could define composite dishes as Python objects, and then easily reuse them.
</p>
<p>
E.g. if I made four servings of soup on 10.08.2018, ate one immediately and froze other three I would define something like <samp>soup_20180810 = [...]</samp>, and then I can simply reuse <samp>soup_20180810</samp> when I eat it again.
(date was easy to find out as I label food when put it in the freezer anyway)
</p></li>
<li>I could make many things implicit, making it pretty expressive without spending time on unnecessary typing</li>
<li>I rarely had to in nutrient composition manually, I just pasted the product link to supermarket website and had an automatic script to parse nutrient information</li>
<li>For micronutrients (that usually aren't listed on labels) I used the <a href="https://github.com/alyssaq/usda-sqlite">USDA sqlite database</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The hard thing was actually not entering, but rather not having nutrition information if you're eating out. That year I was mostly cooking my own food, so tracking was fairly easy.
</p>
<p>
Also I was more interested in lower bounds, (e.g. "do I consume at least recommended amount of micronutrients"), so not having logged food now and then was fine for me.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
I mostly wanted to learn about food composition and how it relates to my diet, and I did
</p>
<p>
That logging motivated me to learn about different foods and try them out while keeping dishes balanced.
I cooked so many different things, made my diet way more varied and became less picky.
</p>
<p>
I stopped because cooking did take some time and I actually realized that as long as I actually vary
food and try to eat everything now and then, I hit all recommended amounts of micronutrients, so I stopped.
It's kind of an obvious thing that everyone recommends, but one thing is hearing it as a common wisdom
and completely different is coming to the same conclusion <b>from your data</b>.
</p></li>
<li>nutritional information contributes to <a href="#dashboard">dashboard</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="photos"><a href="#photos">¶</a>Photos</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: no extra effort required if you sync/organize your photos and videos now and then.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li>obvious source of lifelogging, in addition comes with GPS data</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pdfs"><a href="#pdfs">¶</a>PDF annotations</h3>
<div>
<p>
As in, <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/annotating.html#pdfs">native PDF annotations</a>. 
</p>
<p>
How: nothing needs to be done, PDFs are local to your computer. You do need <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/my/blob/master/my/pdfs.py">some tools</a> to crawl your filesystem and extract the annotations.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
experience of using your PDF annotations (e.g. searching) is <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/annotating.html#comparison"><b>extremely poor</b></a>
</p>
<p>
I'm improving this by using <a href="#orger">orger</a>.
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<h3 id="notes"><a href="#notes">¶</a>Plaintext notes</h3>
<div>
<p>
Mostly this refers to org-mode files, which I use for notekeeping and logging.
</p>
<p>
How: nothing needs to be done, they are local. 
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#search">search</a> comes for free, it's already local</li>
<li><a href="#promnesia">better browsing history</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3 id="rtm"><a href="#rtm">¶</a>Remember the Milk</h3>
<div>
<p>
How: ical export from the API.
</p>
<p>
Why:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
<a href="#search">better search</a>
</p>
<p>
I stopped using RTM in favor of org-mode, but I can still easily find my old task and notes, which allowed for a smooth transition.

			    <p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="5:1-5:469"><strong>The EU wants to have all private chats, messages, and emails automatically searched for suspicious content, generally and indiscriminately. The stated aim: To prosecute child pornography. The result: Mass surveillance through fully automated real-time messaging and chat control and the end of secrecy of digital correspondence. This blog post was first published on the <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/?page_id=594160&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">website of Pirate MEP Patrick Breyer</a>.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="7:1-7:835">In 2020, the European Commission <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/com/2020/0568/COM_COM(2020)0568_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">proposed “temporary” legislation</a> aimed at allowing the search of all private chats, messages, and emails for illegal depictions of minors and attempted initiation of contacts with minors. This is to allow the providers of Facebook Messenger, Gmail, et al, to scan every message for suspicious text and images. This takes place in a fully automated process and using error-prone “artificial intelligence”. If an algorithm considers a message suspicious, its content and meta-data are disclosed automatically and without human verification to a private US-based organization and from there to national police authorities worldwide. The reported users are not notified.</p>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="9:1-9:301">Some U.S. providers of services such as Gmail and Outlook.com are already performing such automated messaging and chat controls. Through a second piece of legislation, the EU Commission intends to oblige all providers of chat, messaging and e-mail services to deploy this mass surveillance technology.</p>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="11:1-11:29"><strong>How does this affect you?</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto" data-sourcepos="13:1-20:0">
<li data-sourcepos="13:1-13:273"><strong>All of your chat conversations and emails</strong> will be automatically searched for suspicious content. Nothing remains confidential or secret. There is no requirement of a court order or an initial suspicion for searching your messages. It occurs always and automatically.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="14:1-14:315">If an algorithms classifies the content of a message as suspicious, <strong>your private or intimate photos may be viewed</strong> by staff and contractors of international corporations and police authorities. Also your private nude photos may be looked at by people not known to you, in whose hands your photos are not safe.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="15:1-15:222"><strong>Flirts and sexting may be read</strong> by staff and contractors of international corporations and police authorities, because text recognition filters looking for “child grooming” frequently falsely flag intimate chats.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="16:1-16:464"><strong>You can falsely be reported and investigated</strong> for allegedly disseminating child sexual exploitation material. Messaging and chat control algorithms are known to flag completely legal vacation photos of children on a beach, for example. According to Swiss federal police authorities, 90% of all machine-generated reports turn out to be without merit. 40% of all criminal investigation procedures initiated in Germany for “child pornography” target minors.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="17:1-17:235">On your next <strong>trip overseas</strong>, you can expect big problems. Machine-generated reports on your communications may have been passed on to other countries, such as the USA, where there is no data privacy – with incalculable results.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="18:1-18:245"><strong>Intelligence services and hackers may be able to spy on your private chats and emails</strong>. The door will be open for anyone with the technical means to read your messages if secure encryption is removed in order to be able to screen messages.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="19:1-20:0"><strong>This is only the beginning</strong>. Once the technology for messaging and chat control has been established, it becomes very easy to use them for other purposes. And who guarantees that these incrimination machines will not be used in the future on our smart phones and laptops?</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="21:1-21:12"><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="23:1-23:716">Trilogue negotiations are underway between representatives of the European Parliament and EU governments with participation of the EU Commission regarding the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0568&amp;from=EN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">legislative proposal</a>.<a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/20201217_Four_Column_Tabe_ePrivacy_Derogation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"> The different positions of the three institutions are listed here in detail (English)</a>. Child protection organizations are exerting massive pressure. All parliamentary groups are in favor of indiscriminate messaging and chat control, with the exception of Greens/EFA and the Left. The adoption of the legislation could take place in March.</p>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="25:1-25:223">In April the EU Commission intends to make a second legislative proposal, which is to force all providers of email, messaging and chat services to comprehensively search all private messages in the absence of any suspicion.</p>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="27:1-27:547">According to the <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=232084&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">case-law of the European Court of Justice</a> the permanent and comprehensive automated analysis of private communications violates fundamental rights and is prohibited (paragraph 177). For this reason, Member of the European Parliament Patrick Breyer has filed a complaint against U.S. companies Facebook and Google with the data protection authorities for violating the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>

</ul>
<p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="52:1-52:40"><strong>Additional information and arguments</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto" data-sourcepos="54:1-61:0">
<li data-sourcepos="54:1-54:720"><strong>All citizens are placed under suspicion, without cause, of possibly having committed a crime.</strong> Text and photo filters monitor all messages, without exception. <strong>No judge is required to order to such monitoring – contrary to the analog world which guarantees the privacy of correspondence and the confidentiality of written communications.</strong> According to a judgment by the European Court of Justice, the permanent and general automatic analysis of private communications violates fundamental rights (case C-511/18, Paragraph 192). Nevertheless, the EU now intends to adopt such legislation. For the court to annul it can take years. Therefore we need to prevent the adoption of the legislation in the first place.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="55:1-55:391"><strong>The confidentiality of private electronic correspondence is being sacrificed.</strong> Users of messenger, chat and e-mail services risk having their private messages read and analyzed. Sensitive photos and text content could be forwarded to unknown entities worldwide and can fall into the wrong hands. NSA staff have reportedly circulated nude photos of female and male citizens in the past.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="56:1-56:263"><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control wrongfully incriminates hundreds of users every day.</strong> According the Swiss Federal Police, 90% of machine-reported content is not illegal, for example harmless holiday photos showing nude children playing at a beach.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="57:1-57:563"><strong>Securely encrypted communication is at risk.</strong> Up to now, encrypted messages cannot be searched by the algorithms. To change that back doors would need to be built in to messaging software. As soon as that happens, this security loophole can be exploited by anyone with the technical means needed, for example by foreign intelligence services and criminals. Private communications, business secrets and sensitive government information would be exposed. Secure encryption is needed to protect minorities, LGBTQI people, democratic activists, journalists, etc.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="58:1-58:419"><strong>Criminal justice is being privatized.</strong> In the future the algorithms of corporations such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft will decide which user is a suspect and which is not. The proposed legislation contains no transparency requirements for the algorithms used. Under the rule of law the investigation of criminal offences belongs in the hands of independent judges and civil servants under court supervision.</li>
<li data-sourcepos="59:1-59:502"><strong>Indiscriminate messaging and chat control creates a precedent and opens the floodgates.</strong> Deploying technology for automatically monitoring all online communications is dangerous: It can very easily be used for other purposes in the future, for example copyright violations, drug abuse, or “harmful content”. In authoritarian states such technology is to identify and arrest government opponents and democracy activists. Once the technology is deployed comprehensively, there is no going back.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-area"><p>I've been working with software for well over a decade, and honestly cannot remember when I started using Git. I used to be a bit wary of many commands but thought I had a good grasp on what to do when it came to git. Then I started a new role at a larger company, which had strict git guidelines. No more messy branches, no crappy commit messages, everything rebased. </p>
<p>Here is a list of all the things I wish I knew before starting this role. </p>
<p>Despite Git being very complicated, for day to day use it is really simple. I tend to make the workflow as simple as possible - I don't use aliases for git commands, I use the full arguments (<code>--force</code>) instead of the shortened ones (<code>-f</code>).</p>
<h2 id="basic-concepts-of-git-i-already-knew-and-was-very-familiar-with">Basic concepts of Git I already knew and was very familiar with:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>git add</code> will 'stage' files, ready to be committed. </p>
<ul>
<li>A 'staged' file is a version of a file that is ready to be committed. If you use a GUI it will probably handle all of that for you, if not you can add files to be staged with <code>git add .</code> (or specific files).</li>
<li><code>git add .</code> to stage all</li>
<li><code>git add --patch</code> to interactively stage chunks of code (useful to review what changes you made)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git checkout</code> to change to a branch</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git checkout -</code> to checkout the previous branch. So you could do <code>git checkout main; git pull; git checkout -; git rebase main</code> to checkout <code>main</code>, pull in changes, switch back to your original branch, and then rebase that original branch on main</li>
<li><code>git checkout -b create-a-new-branch</code> create a new branch. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git commit</code> creates a commit from the 'staged' files</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git commit --amend</code> updates the previous commit with the 'staged' files</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>git status</code> tells you what the current status is (e.g. in the middle of a merge)</li>
<li>
<p><code>git diff</code> tells you what changed</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git diff --staged</code> to see the difference in staged files</li>
<li><code>git diff commit1..commit2</code> or <code>git diff branch1..branch2</code> show diff between commits/branches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git push</code> will send the current branch to the remote repo (such as Github.com)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git push --force</code> overwrite changes when pushing</li>
<li><code>git push --force-with-lease</code> a safer version of <code>git push --force</code>, that will only overwrite if other commits were not added on the remote branch (e.g. by other users).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>git pull</code> will grab the changes from the remote location (such as Github.com)</li>
<li>
<p><code>git log</code> shows a log of commits with their commit hash &amp; messages</p>
<ul>
<li><code>git log --oneline</code> - easier to digest version</li>
<li><code>git log --graph</code> - useful to see branches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>git show</code> shows a commit's change</li>
<li>
<p><code>git bisect</code> to find out which commit introduced a bug</p>
<ul>
<li>binary search through commits (given a 'good' commit and a 'bad' commit). This is not a commonly used command for me so I won't go into detail but it is extremely handy to know about when needing to figure out when a bug was introduced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The file <code>.gitignore</code> has a list of files to exclude from the git repo</li>
<li><code>git merge</code> I use this so rarely now that I can't remember the syntax at all.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basic-concepts-of-git-i-wish-i-knew">Basic concepts of Git I wish I knew:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A commit is like a list of changes to file(s), on a very basic level could be thought of as saying <code>change 5 characters on line 10 to "xxxxx"</code></li>
<li>
<p>Branches are like a pointer, they just point to a commit. Multiple branches can point to the same commit. When you are on a branch and you add a new commit, the branch is updated to point to your new commit.</p>
<ul>
<li>I used to think a branch was much more complicated than this.</li>
<li>You can change what commit a branch points to by checking out that branch (<code>git checkout some branch</code>) then setting it to point at a new commit hash (<code>git reset --hard 5255841aa</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can checkout single commits (<code>git checkout 5255841aaff441d275122b4abfb099b881de7cb5</code>) just like you can checkout branches (<code>git checkout some-branch</code>)</li>
<li>If you do something like <code>git commit --amend</code> to update the previous commit, the old commit is still around. (<code>git gc</code> will garbage collect these, but they stay around for at least a couple of weeks).</li>
<li>Every single change (even if you cannot easily find it by other means) can be found by looking at <code>git reflog</code>. It contains every single change, including changing branches, merging, rebasing. If you mess something up you can just look at the reflog and checkout a commit from before your changes. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="undoing-all-changes-since-your-last-commit">Undoing all changes since your last commit</h2>
<p>(You will lose staged/unstaged changes, this is a destructive command!)</p>
<p> If you have made some changes but decided you want to return to the state of the previous commit you can use <code>git reset --hard</code> to undo everything. This will mean any staged files (from <code>git add .</code>) will be removed.</p>
<p> A less destructive way to do this is to use <code>git stash</code>. It has the same effect, but the 'stashed' changes are still available. (see next section)</p>
<h2 id="use-git-stash">Use <code>git stash</code></h2>
<p>Git stash scared me. I used to use PHPStorm's 'shelve changes' as it felt a bit easier. Now I find that more awkward to use, as <code>git stash</code> is so simple.</p>
<p>You can use <code>git stash</code> to take any uncommitted changes and saves it in a temporary location. (This is not sent to Github when you push). </p>
<p>The changes are then undone, so you are back to the same state as your previous commit.</p>
<p>It will only stash files that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>either already being tracked by Git (in other words: files that exist elsewhere in your git repo)</li>
<li>and other files not yet tracked by Git (not in any commits) but are staged (e.g. from <code>git add .</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Git stash will not stash ignored files (from <code>.gitignore</code>), or new files that are not already elsewhere in your git repo and have not been staged (use <code>git add</code> to include them first)</p>
<p>You can then run <code>git stash apply</code> to replay those changes.</p>
<p>You can list all 'stashes' with <code>git stash list</code>, and then use <code>git apply 4</code> to apply the 4th one.</p>
<h2 id="use-git-rebase-and-git-rebase--i">Use <code>git rebase</code> and <code>git rebase -i</code></h2>
<p>I see <code>git rebase</code> and interactive git rebase (<code>git rebase -i</code>) as two completely separate commands. I'll cover them separately.</p>
<h3 id="git-rebase">Git rebase</h3>
<p>If you have 3 commits on the <code>main</code> branch:</p>
<pre><code><span> mainCommit1</span>
<span> mainCommit2</span>
<span> mainCommit3</span></code></pre>
<p>and then make a branch from mainCommit 3, and add a couple of commits:</p>
<pre><code><span> mainCommit1</span>
<span> mainCommit2</span>
<span> mainCommit3</span>
<span>   </span><span>\_</span><span>______ branch1Commit1</span>
<span>            branch1Commit2</span>
<span>            branch1Commit3</span></code></pre>
<p>But then on the <code>main</code> branch more commits are added:</p>
<pre><code><span> mainCommit1</span>
<span> mainCommit2</span>
<span> mainCommit3</span>
<span>   </span><span>\_</span><span>______ branch1Commit1</span>
<span>            branch1Commit2</span>
<span>            branch1Commit3</span>
<span> mainCommit4</span>
<span> mainCommit5</span></code></pre>
<p>You may now want to 'rebase' your <code>branch1</code> commits on top of <code>main</code>.
This means you want to 'play' the changes in <code>branch1Commit1</code>, <code>branch1Commit2</code>, and <code>branch1Commit3</code> on top of <code>mainCommit5</code></p>
<p>If you run <code>git checkout branch1; git rebase main;</code> it will check out the <code>branch1</code> branch, and rebase it on top of the most recent commit on <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>So now it would look like this:</p>
<pre><code><span> mainCommit1</span>
<span> mainCommit2</span>
<span> mainCommit3</span>
<span> mainCommit4</span>
<span> mainCommit5</span>
<span> branch1Commit1</span>
<span> branch1Commit2</span>
<span> branch1Commit3</span></code></pre>
<h4 id="when-is-this-useful">When is this useful?</h4>
<p>If you are working on your branch (<code>working-branch</code>), you realise a dependency needs updating. Maybe you create a new branch (<code>fix-dependency</code>), open up a new PR to update that dependency, and it gets merged into the <code>main</code> branch. Now you want to go back to <code>working-branch</code> and use the dependency. But of course, your branch was created before the dependency update was in <code>main</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span> someCommit</span>
<span>    </span><span>\_</span><span>_______ working-branch-commit1</span>
<span>              working-branch-commit2</span>
<span> fixDepencencyCommit</span></code></pre>
<p>So you would <code>checkout working-branch; rebase main</code> to rebase your commits in <code>working-branch</code> on top of <code>main</code>, and it would look like this:</p>
<pre><code><span> someCommit</span>
<span> fixDepencencyCommit</span>
<span> working-branch-commit1</span>
<span> working-branch-commit2</span></code></pre>
<p>So you now have access to that branch.</p>
<p>Before understanding how <code>git rebase</code> worked I would have used <code>git cherry-pick</code>, which lets you get a specific commit and run those changes.</p>
<p>Note: You will often get merge conflicts when it tries to rebase. I love PHPstorm's interface for this. I think people who deal with complicated merge conflicts with just the command line tools are mental.</p>
<h3 id="interactive-rebase-git-rebase--i">Interactive rebase <code>git rebase -i</code></h3>
<p>This used to be the scariest thing for me to do, but now I am used to it interactive rebase is simple.</p>
<p>The typical syntax is: <code>git rebase -i $FROM_COMMIT</code>, where $FROM_COMMIT is the oldest commit you want to look at. I almost always just type <code>git rebase -i HEAD~10</code> which will be the 10th oldest one. </p>
<p>(<code>HEAD</code> points to the currently checked out branch's commit or the current commit).</p>
<p>Once you have typed <code>git rebase -i HEAD~4</code> you will see something like this (the commit summary messages are going to be whatever you enter - I've added the filenames to make this easier to explain):</p>
<pre><code><span>pick 913f120 feat: new blog - add blog.php</span>
<span>pick 2c2631b feat: add contact form - add contact.php</span>
<span>pick 67da3b4 fix: replace contact captcha - fix contact.php</span>
<span>pick 076c54a feat: update navbar with blog link - update navbar.php</span>

<span># Rebase 913f120..2c2631b onto 5dc1032 (4 commands)</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Commands:</span>
<span># p, pick &lt;commit&gt; = use commit</span>
<span># r, reword &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but edit the commit message</span>
<span># e, edit &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but stop for amending</span>
<span># s, squash &lt;commit&gt; = use commit, but meld into previous commit</span>
<span># f, fixup &lt;commit&gt; = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message</span>
<span># x, exec &lt;command&gt; = run command (the rest of the line) using shell</span>
<span># b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')</span>
<span># d, drop &lt;commit&gt; = remove commit</span>
<span># l, label &lt;label&gt; = label current HEAD with a name</span>
<span># t, reset &lt;label&gt; = reset HEAD to a label</span>
<span># m, merge [-C &lt;commit&gt; | -c &lt;commit&gt;] &lt;label&gt; [# &lt;oneline&gt;]</span>
<span># .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's</span>
<span># .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was</span>
<span># .       specified). Use -c &lt;commit&gt; to reword the commit message.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Note that empty commits are commented out</span></code></pre>
<p>What this is saying is that it will 'pick' those 4 commits, and run them in that order.</p>
<pre><code><span>pick 913f120 feat: new blog - add blog.php</span>
<span>pick 2c2631b feat: add contact form - add contact.php</span>

<p>Update: There was a delightful discussion about functional programming and the nature of Rust at <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language">lobste.rs</a>.</p>
<p>Some quotes...</p>
<div>
  <div>
    <blockquote>
<p>Functional languages take away mutability from the “mutability + aliasing = bugs” equation; Rust takes away the aliasing — or at least, the uncontrolled aliasing. To me, it then makes sense to feel comfortable using mutability (and the advantages it offers), safe in the knowledge that the compiler is helping you avoid bugs. [<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_slxmwj">vfoley</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess I don’t really agree with all of this. I agree that Rust gets the nice properties of functional languages at least when it comes to mutation, but if someone read the body of Rust code I have written and came back and said, “it really resembles the code I typically write on Lisp/ML/Haskell,” then I would be really surprised. I rarely write higher order functions. I rarely write recursive functions or folds. I rarely use persistent data structures and instead use mutation without reservation. [<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_aucsix">burntsushi</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/434bly/is_rust_functional_programming_language#c_zbcp7s">andyc</a> pointed to <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/notes-on-a-smaller-rust/">Notes on a smaller Rust
</a> and quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As I said once, pure functional programming is an ingenious trick to show you can code without mutation, but Rust is an even cleverer trick to show you can just have mutation.</p>
</blockquote>

  </div>
  <p><a href="">expand&nbsp;</a>
</p></div>

<hr>
<p>The book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust/9781491927274/">Programming Rust</a> introduces Rust as...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>not really an object-oriented language, although it has some object-oriented characteristics. Rust is not a functional language […] It’s probably best to reserve judgement about what sort of language Rust is, and see what you think once you’ve become comfortable with the language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time for judgement has come! In the following I will lay out my view on how Rust’s language features influence programming style. I do agree with the aforementioned quote that Rust is not a single-paradigm language. Yet, the code written in idiomatic and safe Rust shares quite some similarities with code of functional programming languages.</p>
<p>“Functional programming language” is not a clearly defined term. From the various properties that are typically associated with functional programming I only want to focus on one: “Immutability” and referential transparency. Immutability means that data structures can be treated as values - once you have them, they will not change underneath you. If you want to express modification, you can construct a new data structure, maybe reusing (unchanged) parts of existing data. This enables referential transparency: If a function (or method) cannot change anything internally, its output only depends on its input. Given some input the function evaluation and the result it returns can be treated as the same. The function is said to be pure.</p>
<p>Immutability is often regarded as a very positive property:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure code is deterministic and considered to be easier to reason about as the number of possible state combinations is limited.</li>
<li>If a function only depends on explicitly defined parameters, testing it is often easier.</li>
<li>Immutable data can be passed to concurrent code without worrying about synchron^izing access.</li>
<li>And it is free of cycles (unless you allow <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Tying_the_Knot">lazily evaluation</a>), making it easier to serialize and deserialize.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now Rust clearly allows for data to be mutable. Rust also does not provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure">persistent data structures</a> in its standard library (although there are <a href="https://crates.io/crates/im">third-party</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/rpds">options</a>) which are typically used to model immutable data efficiently. Yet, Rust’s rules around ownership require full control over what can be changed and when. To the extent that I have been working with Rust, a lot of it feels quite similar to programming Clojure from the point of view of designing programs.</p>
<h2 id="ownership-sharing-exclusivity">Ownership, sharing, exclusivity</h2>
<p>Each piece of data in (safe) Rust has exactly one owner. In the following example the variable <code>val</code> owns the String:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello World"</span>.to_string();
</code></pre></div><p>Using <code>val</code> we can create references to the string:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
<span>// both val and val_ref can be used to read the string value:
</span><span></span>println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, val);
println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, val_ref);
</code></pre></div><p>However we cannot modify either <code>val</code> or <code>val_ref</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// cannot borrow `val` as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable
</span><span></span>val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);

<span>// error: "cannot borrow `*val_ref` as mutable, as it is behind a `&amp;` reference"
</span><span></span>val_ref.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>So in order to change <code>val</code> we need to declare it <code>mut</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>); <span>// OK
</span></code></pre></div><p>But now we cannot take a reference at the same time anymore:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
<span>// error: cannot borrow `val` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
</span><span></span><span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
val.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>And similarly we can write to the reference if we declare it <code>mut</code> but then we cannot get another reference at the same time:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> val <span>=</span> <span>"Hello"</span>.to_string();
<span>let</span> val_ref <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span>val;
<span>// error: cannot borrow `val` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
</span><span></span><span>let</span> val_ref2 <span>=</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> val;
</code></pre></div><p>This example demonstrates Rust’s ownership rules: We can get multiple shared (read-only) references to one piece of data but as soon as we indicate to modify the data by declaring either the owning variable or a reference as <code>mut</code> we cannot hold shared references at the same time. <code>mut</code> means first and foremost <em>exclusive</em> access to the underlying data (and only secondarily <em>mutable</em>).</p>
<p>Similarly, functions that want to modify parameters (or <em>self</em> in case of methods) need to indicate that they need exclusive access. This means that the caller can only use this function it has exclusive access to the parameters to be passed as <code>mut</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>add_world</span>(val_ref: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> String) {
    val_ref.push_str(<span>" World"</span>);
}
<span>// ...
</span><span></span>add_world(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> val);
</code></pre></div><p>All this is to say: Mutability in Rust needs to be explicitly declared and the rules around exclusive access are statically enforced. A thing can only change if no one is looking — reducing the number of accidental state combinations and highlighting the parts of the code base that can introduce change clearly. A Rust function that only accepts shared references and owned values (that do not provide interior mutability) and that does not use unsafe code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, is referentially transparent.</p>
<h2 id="interior-mutability">Interior mutability</h2>
<p>There are a number of use cases where not being able to modify shared references can become very limiting. For example consider this <a href="https://gtk-rs.org/">GTK+3</a> app:</p>


  <figure>
    <img src="https://robert.kra.hn/posts/2021-02-03_is-rust-fp/interior_mutability.gif"> 
  </figure>


<p>The implementation for this looks something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>let</span> container <span>=</span> gtk::Box::new(gtk::Orientation::Vertical, <span>2</span>);
<span>// A label that will be modified
</span><span></span><span>let</span> label <span>=</span> gtk::Label::new(Some(<span>"Button not yet clicked"</span>));
<span>let</span> button <span>=</span> gtk::Button::with_label(<span>"Click me"</span>);
<span>// We clone label so we can send it into the closure.
</span><span></span><span>let</span> label_clone <span>=</span> label.clone();
button.connect_clicked(<span>move</span> <span>|</span>_<span>|</span> {
    label_clone.set_label(<span>"Button has been clicked!"</span>);
});
container.add(<span>&amp;</span>button);
container.add(<span>&amp;</span>label);
</code></pre></div><p>As you can see the <code>label</code> is added to the container so that it gets displayed <em>and</em> is bound inside the closure where it gets modified.</p>
<p>Rust uses two mechanisms in combination for that to work: The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-05-interior-mutability.html#having-multiple-owners-of-mutable-data-by-combining-rct-and-refcellt"><code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> pattern</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. First, a reference counted pointer <code>std::rc::Rc</code> that is quite similar to C++’s <code>shared_ptr</code>. <code>Rc</code> takes ownership of another object. <code>Rc</code> implements <code>Clone</code> that will increase the ref count and hand out a new pointer. Those can be passed freely around. Inside of the ref-counted pointer a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html">RefCell</a> can be placed. It will allow to request exclusive access to the data owned. I.e. it will — at runtime! — produce a <code>mut</code> reference to the object wrapped and check that it is indeed not borrowed somewhere else. Should this not be the case, the borrow will fail (and possibly panic if <code>borrow_mut()</code> was used).</p>
<p>For more details about the internals of smart pointers and interior mutability I can highly highly recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O0Nt9qY_vo">this screen cast by Jon Gjengset</a> that walks you through possible implementations of (among others) <code>Rc</code> and <code>RefCell</code>.</p>
<p>So Rust provides ways<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> around the statically enforced access rules that normally restrict modification of data. This provides enough abstractions to even implement an interface to an object-oriented system such as Glib / GTK+. Following that, you might argue that Rust is supporting multiple paradigms, and I will agree. Yet, similar to Clojure that provides “interior mutability”-equivalents like <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/atoms">atoms</a> I will point out that overly relying on those features is not considered idiomatic. In Clojure the best practice is to use atoms sparingly. Mostly at the outside of the app, extracting state that is passed into the inner layers of the app that will then transform the state immutably into a new derived version. Atoms then clearly highlight where state changes can be expected. In practice, this then provides a good compromise. In case of stateful bugs, you only have to have a limited amount of possible sources to check and possible combinations of state transitions are still limited to simplify reasoning.</p>
<p>The <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> pattern is also not all that ergonomic. Yes, you can define type aliases like Glib does, Rust still makes it easier to not have nested, cyclic relationships between objects. To say it with book Programming Rust again (from the section “Taking Arms Against a Sea of Objects”):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When everything depends on everything else like this, it’s hard to test, evolve, or even think about any component in isolation.
One fascinating thing about Rust is that the ownership model puts a speed bump on the highway to hell. […] It works unreasonably well: not only can Rust force you to understand why your program is thread-safe, it can even require some amount of high-level architectural design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is exactly the point I would like to convey with this article and the reason why I’m personally so fascinated with Rust: The set of features it does (not) provide are forcefully guiding the design of systems you build. This is quite contrary to how a lot of programming languages that attempt to provide a high degree of flexibility work (looking at you, Scala).</p>
<p>And then this is my claim: The ownership model, standard library, emphasize on iterators, and numerous other things do lead to code …</p></div></div>

If things go well, we might be able to do initial human trials later this year,” Musk replied.&nbsp;</p> <p>Neuralink, a neural tech startup Musk co-founded in 2016, aims to help people with neurological conditions by planting computer chips on human brains to create artificial intelligence.

            <div id="content">
                
<blockquote>
<p>They know the water best who have waded through it.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>– Proverb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a Heaven did exist, it would not be a place where we have everything made for us; rather, it would be a place where everything we make is without defects.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Now, I know a lot about software bugs. I’ve written most of them. Sometimes nobody notices; at other times they cause serious &amp; embarrassing incidents. They bloom like flowers in a meadow. They take root in every garden. But they aren’t wild: everybody knows who planted them. And, if you will allow my stretching the simile to its furthest limits, they make our vibrant industry look like a flower shop.</p>
<p>An old joke goes that the chief executive of a large tech company gives a speech in which he asserts that, had cars been developed like software, they would cost a hundredth of what they do now &amp; run twice as far on a litre. “Yes”, an automotive exec replies later, “and they would crash once a week &amp; when you call for service, they’d tell you to reinstall the engine.”</p>
<p>Software is great: it does amazing things. But software is also bad: it’s bloated &amp; full of bugs. It may not be as buggy as it was twenty years ago, &amp; clearly it was never buggy enough for people not to use it, but it’s bad enough even so. You can easily confirm this yourself by searching a news aggregator for “software bug” or “software glitch” &amp; finding, as I now find from the past week alone, articles about <a href="https://www.computing.co.uk/news/4025865/software-errors-wipes-thousands-arrest-records-police-databases">150,000 arrest records disappearing in the UK</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-software/volkswagen-recalls-56000-golf-models-for-software-update-idUSL8N2JN2HL">56,000 defective cars being recalled</a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-covid-19-vaccine-drive-tribal-rural-areas-challanges-7149270/">interruptions in the Indian vaccination drive</a> &amp; so on.</p>
<p>Or to borrow someone else’s words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s highly embarrassing for this profession that “program crashes/hangs/malfunctions” is such a common occurrence that 5 billion non-developers are not only acutely aware of it, but consider it an unsurprising state of things.</p>
<p>It’s as if large parts of humankind were familiar with civil engineering jargon because collapsing bridges were a daily occurrence.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What, then, to do? In general, you can get better at not writing bugs (1) by practicing writing code, (2) by changing the conditions that make them more likely &amp; (3) by figuring out which sorts of behaviours can prevent them. Here I want to discuss that last one: how should we write code so as to reduce the risk of introducing bugs? That means I won’t discuss tooling, learning, project management or anything of that sort: I will limit my discussion to the activity of programming &amp; will consider this in the context of software that is running in production systems, serving thousands or more users &amp; for which defects can have serious adverse consequences.</p>
<h2 id="consider-not-writing-the-code-in-the-first-place">Consider Not Writing the Code in the First Place <a href="#consider-not-writing-the-code-in-the-first-place">#</a></h2>
<p>Wayne Gretzky said that you miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. I say that you have 0% chance of introducing bugs in code you don’t write.</p>
<p>If your software is not written yet, you will obviously need to write code. Or change may be necessary: you may be in a business where competition drives you to always come up with new ways of adding value, or maybe your software needs to adapt to changing external conditions. These are all good reasons to write code, but they are not all the reasons that we write code. <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2021/01/04/A-culture-of-stability-and-reliability.html">There’s no reason to think that software needs to change forever.</a> Many features are negotiable.</p>
<p>Two types of code changes are relevant here, I think. The first is a change needed to implement new features. The second is refactoring, that is changing code in order to better structure it without modifying its behaviour.</p>
<p>A code change that implements a new feature is additive &amp; therefore makes the software more complex. It is harder to avoid writing bugs in complex software. It is also harder to diagnose &amp; fix bugs in complex software. Therefore, additive code changes involve both a direct risk &amp; an indirect risk of introducing new bugs. That should make us think twice as hard before introducing new features, but in fact it is usually taken for granted that new features are good for software. Rid yourself of that assumption. You or somebody else should, before implementing a new feature, ask yourselves the question: how much marginal value does this feature provide for the user?</p>
<p>Refactoring is praised everywhere. And I’m not here to say it isn’t important; it is our finest weapon in the perpetual war against entropy. But every time you refactor something, there is a risk that you introduce a new bug.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> The risk can be reduced with robust testing, as we shall see below. But it will never go away completely.</p>
<p>You need to balance the need for refactoring against the need for reliability &amp; stability. Ask yourself questions like, how long will the software be maintained? how important is reliability &amp; stability to it? how much do you expect the intended change will improve the code? &amp; so on. Think critically. We often start refactoring code not because it is in a particularly bad condition but because <em>we can &amp; know how to do it</em>. But that is a mistake. We are making ourselves slaves to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician%27s_syllogism">the politician’s syllogism</a>, which, adapted somewhat, says: we must refactor things; I can refactor this thing; therefore, I must refactor this thing.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-do-have-to-make-a-change%2C-make-it-as-small-as-possible">If You Do Have to Make a Change, Make It As Small As Possible <a href="#if-you-do-have-to-make-a-change%2C-make-it-as-small-as-possible">#</a></h2>
<p>The second maxim is a corollary of the first. It begins with the observation that, in practice, it can be tempting to make some changes that are not directly related to whatever it is you are doing at the time. For example, maybe you are fixing a bug but notice that the component or function you’re looking at is very long &amp; could, so you reason, be split up into several smaller, composable functions. That’s an admirable aim. But it increases the risk of introducing a new bug, at least in the short term. If it happens, consider not making that additional change, or, if you do decide to go through with it, making the change separately from the fix. That is better because small, monadic changes are easier to test &amp; easier to review.</p>
<p>I make an exception here for whenever you can actually meaningfully reduce complexity, such as by removing branches from a conditional expression. Another exception would be to refactor code as an initial step prior to making functional changes to a component, but that should be done in the spirit of the following maxim.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-want-to-refactor-something%2C-make-sure-it%E2%80%99s-covered-by-automated-tests">If You Want to Refactor Something, Make Sure It’s Covered by Automated Tests <a href="#if-you-want-to-refactor-something%2C-make-sure-it%E2%80%99s-covered-by-automated-tests">#</a></h2>
<p>Imagine that you are a spy. You are breaking into somebody’s apartment in order to find &amp; take copies of some or other document. Being a good spy, it is important to you that that the owner of the apartment doesn’t notice that you’ve been there. So before rummaging around, you take photos of every room in order that, once you have found &amp; copied the document, you can restore the apartment to its original condition. The photos you have taken are an external check on whether you are leaving the room in the same condition that you found it in. It doesn’t guarantee that nothing is out of place. But it increases the probability that there is no discernible change.</p>
<p>Refactoring something means changing its implementation internally without changing its behaviour externally. You can create an external check similar to the spy’s photos when refactoring by making sure that the thing you are refactoring is covered by automated tests.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> That way you can be more confident that the changes you make are not affecting the behaviour. You could almost make them without thinking at all, which brings me to the final maxim …</p>
<h2 id="when-you-make-a-change%2C-make-sure-you-understand-what-you%E2%80%99re-doing">When You Make a Change, Make Sure You Understand What You’re Doing <a href="#when-you-make-a-change%2C-make-sure-you-understand-what-you%E2%80%99re-doing">#</a></h2>
<p>Before personal desktops were able to compile code, it had to be compiled on mainframes which often had to be booked in advance.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> That meant that programmers had to check their code carefully before compiling it, so as not to risk, should the program fail to compile, having to wait again in order to redo it. These days, we get near-instant feedback, not only from our compilers but also from running &amp; testing our code. This feedback loop has been shortened further by advances like hot reloading. This is great because it helps us to iterate quickly &amp; work in a state of flow. But it also allows us to code without really thinking hard about what we are doing.</p>
<p>Exactly that happens to me now &amp; again, usually when I’m lacking mental energy. Maybe I’m not considering all the possible inputs that a function can receive, or maybe I’m not thinking about all the possible branches in a conditional expression. I am confident that the thing I’m doing right now is correct. But I don’t know whether it is messing something up elsewhere.</p>
<p>When this happens, there is a kind of hill to climb, a hill from which everything is visible in a clearer light. I know this, but still I don’t always find it in myself to go there. This is pure weakness of the will. The hard thing is to notice it. Having noticed it, you can either put the task aside to do when you have more energy, or summon up the strength to do the thing properly.</p>
<p>It may help you to imagine that you are going to deploy your change to be tested by a grizzled old no-nonsense manual tester. If there’s a bug in your code, this tester is going to find it. Manual testing is like the tort system: as when a person is injured by a product they can sue the manufacturer, causing manufacturers to worry about their products’ safety, so the manual tester can file a report when they discover a bug, causing you to worry about your code’s correctness. But you can worry without the punitive threat, too.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>What normally happens to bugs is that they are fixed &amp; forgotten. When we discover them, we are interested in fixing them, not in understanding the reasons why they happened; &amp; even if we are so interested, we only rarely remember the conditions of their origin anyway. But it doesn’t have to be like that. The way out of this is obvious. To avoid error, we must study error.</p>
<p>Never let a good incident go to waste. Each bug is an invitation to …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Friday, February 5, 2021</p><p>Sanakirja is a key-value store based on B trees, written in Rust. In this post, I reflect on some design and programming methodology mistakes I’ve made. Benchmarks show that the latest version beats LMDB, the fastest C equivalent, by 20%-50% on a use case similar to my most common load (storing graphs in Pijul).</p><p>My last post about Sanakirja sparked a few really constructive discussions, and made me realise that people still cared about the problem of on-disk key-value stores, as unfancy as that problem may sound. This post looks back on some design mistakes I’ve made when I wrote it, and includes benchmarks showing <a href="#benchmarks">it’s now faster than the fastest equivalent C library</a>.</p><p>Also, as some readers have noted, “sanakirja” means “dictionary” in Finnish.</p><h2 id="why">Why?</h2><p>A long time ago, Pijul was using <a href="https://symas.com/lmdb/">LMDB</a> as its backend, with a number of fundamental limitations, including:</p><ul><li><p>Being <strong>restricted to two datatypes</strong>: an array of B+ trees where keys are byte strings and values are either (1) byte strings or (2) B+ trees where keys are bytestrings and values are zero-sized. In Rust terminology, this is equivalent to roughly 500 <em>tables</em>, where a <em>table</em> is either <code>BTreeMap&lt;&amp;[u8], &amp;[u8]&gt;</code> or <code>BTreeMap&lt;&amp;[u8], BTreeMap&lt;&amp;[u8], ()&gt;&gt;</code> (a.k.a. <code>BTreeMap&lt;&amp;[u8], BTreeSet&lt;&amp;[u8]&gt;&gt;</code>).</p></li><li><p>Being written in C, meaning that it is potentially fast, but <strong>hard to extend</strong> in any nontrivial way. About the “fast” part, <a href="#benchmarks">my benchmarks</a> show that indeed, it is quite fast — just not as fast as a carefully-designed Rust version.</p></li><li><p>More importantly, I needed to <strong>fork tables</strong> efficiently, without copying anything. This was especially important back then, when Pijul tables for small repositories often weighed dozens of megabytes. It may be slightly less relevant now, but now that it’s there, there is no reason not to use it.</p><p>This is implemented with an extra table storing reference counts of each page that is referenced at least twice (in order to avoid infinite recursions, the table itself isn’t clonable, and therefore all its pages are referenced once).</p></li></ul><h2 id="why-a-redesign">Why a redesign?</h2><p>There were just too many reasons: performance was first, then the overly complicated concurrency model, the suboptimal algorithmic design, and the suboptimal software design. I’ll explain these in the reverse order (so skip ahead if you only want to see my benchmarks).</p><h3 id="personal-anecdote">Personal anecdote</h3><p>Sanakirja was the first Rust project I completed, and yet it requires all the worst memory tricks I’ve ever needed in Rust. In hindsight, I needed that crate, so it was right to write it, but this wasn’t the right way to learn Rust at all. I also knew very little about disk performance, and my goal at the time was really writing Pijul, not profiling databases. And as <a href="#benchmarks">the benchmarks</a> show, it wasn’t terribly slow either.</p><h3 id="no_std">#[no_std]</h3><p>That’s right, this new version works without the standard library. It’s fairly restricted in that case, since there’s no mmap. However, the allocator is generic, meaning that it could in principle be used to allocate different things, like hard drive sectors in a filesystem.</p><h3 id="software-engineering">Software engineering</h3><p>Implementing B trees isn’t particularly hard in theory, but some bits of practice make it non-trivial, like keys of varying sizes (these can even cause the tree to increase its depth in order to stay balanced and keep their long-term performance guarantees!). Another complication is that the main costly operation in an on-disk datastructure is accessing a sector that isn’t in RAM, either for reading or for writing, and keys and values may be large, so we need to avoid copying or moving things around. Yet another nontrivial feature is that we want operations to be transactional, and allow readers to access the database concurrently with a writer (in which case readers see the database as it was before the current writer started).</p><p>One issue is that in a first-time implementation, it isn’t obvious to tell what belongs to the “B tree level” (which handles the high-level operations and does the “page management”, meaning allocating and freeing pages), from the underlying “node level” implementation (dealing with byte representation of data). Before you know it, the two levels are mixed and make hypotheses on one another. This makes it hard to see what matters performance-wise, and what doesn’t. After looking at my code again recently, I’ve tried to formalise here the lessons I’ve learned since my first steps in Rust back in 2015:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Trust the Rust compiler!</strong> In a stage of the learning where you spend most of your time <em>fighting</em> the borrow checker (it was worse then, we have non-lexical lifetimes now), it is sometimes hard to see past that stage and imagine how the compiler will optimise your code, or what the LLVM pass will do. Also, on-disk B trees must define their own data representation, since data stored with one version of the Rust compiler must be readable from another version. However, one thing I’ve noticed when rewriting it was that I was often reasoning about what branches the compiler would cut, what loops it could unfold, etc.</p><p>I guess what I mean here is, sometimes you don’t need complex genericity everywhere in order to reach your performance goals, checking a constant parameter at runtime, or thinking carefully about mutable and immutable variables, can actually become compile-time optimisations.</p></li><li><p>I usually tend to try and get stuff to work as quick as possible, then profile and improve (the <strong>make it work, then make it fast</strong> idea). However, this particular crate made we question that approach in some cases, because it tends to mix the different levels, and make them less clear. One thing I’ve learned is that spending time building, benchmarking and profiling <em>basic blocks</em> may seem like it can delay the overall plan; however, in this case, exploring different designs for the basic parts made it clear which features of the basic blocks were varying, and which were necessary, yielding a more modular design in the end, which was key to the performance improvements I got.</p></li><li><p>Part of the art of writing mathematical proofs, especially in a larger paper, is finding the <strong>“min-cuts” of the graph of arguments</strong>. In the case of proofs, this means finding the smallest set of hypotheses you need for a lemma, which can also be proven independently in other lemmas. This isn’t easy, because a smaller conclusion may sometimes mean you’ve lost some hypotheses you had during the proof, and you won’t be able to use them anymore. The same happens in code, when you refactor common operations and try to use nice, readable abstractions: while that sounds like a good thing to do, you may lose hypotheses on what is behind the abstractions.</p><p>Concretely, in Sanakirja, we can’t always write to pages to modify them, for example if they’re pointed to by another tree, or if the are visible to concurrent readers. This isn’t very complicated in the case of insertions, because the worst thing that may happen is a page split. The 169 lines of Rust for the <a href="https://nest.pijul.com/pmeunier/sanakirja-1.0:main/OP6SVMOD2GTQ6.PAGQA">new version of <code>put</code></a> reflect that.</p><p>However, deletions are harder, since page merges might cascade: if two pages A and B are meant to be merged, the key between them in their parent P must be deleted from P, and that deletion might cause P to merge with its neighbour Q. However, if P is read-only and Q isn’t, doing the operation lazily means that we can merge P’s items directly into Q, rather than first copying P to delete a key, and then merging.</p><p>When I first wrote Sanakirja, I remember being pretty proud of the following trick to achieve this: I refactored common code in order to use the same function for merging, rebalancing and splitting pages: I would first create an iterator, and then “spread” it on one page (when merging) or two pages (when splitting or rebalancing). While this may seem an elegant refactoring of common code between the three main operations of a B tree, it is also “lossy” in terms of the hypotheses it can make over the items of the iterator.</p><p>More precisely, here is an edited version of what I was doing before (<code>iter_all</code> returns an iterator, a <code>struct</code> with private fields):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>      </span><span>// Build an iterator for the left page

<h2>Is Software Abstraction Killing Civilization?</h2>

<p><b>Or: Jonathan Blow is wrong but also right and we still
need to prevent the collapse of civilization</b></p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<p>
I recently stumbled upon
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko">a talk by game
development guru Jonathan Blow</a>, about how software 
abstraction will lead to the end of civilization. Quick summary:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Information passed on between generations is diluted.
    Practise is better than theory for keeping skills alive.</li>
  <li>Software runs the world.</li>
  <li>Abstraction fosters ignorance about low level programming.</li>
  <li>If we forget low level stuff, civilization will fall apart
    since we won't be able to keep vital software running.</li>
</ul>
<p>
It was one of those 
talks that might at a first glance seem perfectly reasonable, not least 
because similar ideas are regularly discussed in programmer circles by a
great number of 
people. Then you start thinking about what's said, and all the errors and 
misconceptions presented makes you feel troubled, because it's both 
tempting and easy to perpetuate the punchlines without
considering their implications. <b>I agree with Blow that it's
important to pass knowledge between generations. Therefore, the veracity
of that information is extremely important.</b> I propose that
the information given in the very talk about the importance of
such information, is in fact wrong on many counts.
</p>

<p>
That's why I, in this rather long text, have tried to examine Blow's
claims in detail. (TL;DR: Someone is wrong on the Internet - man with
ample spare time on his hands to the rescue!)
</p>

<h3>Some examples of collapsed civilizations and artefacts lost in time</h3>

<p>
I'm not a historian and will not comment on this first part of the talk. It doesn't matter much, though; my gripe is mainly with the second part.
</p>

<h3>Five nines</h3>

<p>
Blow says we used to use the "five nines" (99.999% uptime) metric when selling computer systems. Since his laptop has the habit of rebooting when in sleep mode, it can never be a candidate for 99.999% uptime. This part is true: five nines means a total yearly downtime of just above five minutes. This is presented as proof that we have lost a rhetoric of quality. This part is false.
</p>

<p>
In reality, five nines usually applies to things like emergency response switchboards (911), hospital systems, financial transaction processing, etc. It's also a metric usually accompanied by long contracts detailing various downtime scenarios that couldn't possibly count as downtime. It has never, ever been used to sell consumer laptops or the word processors we run on them.
</p>

<p>
It's also incorrect that five nines isn't used anymore: several companies, such as IBM and Amazon, sell such systems and services. Incidentally, IBM actually goes further and claims their Power9 platform can provide even higher availability. Provided, I'm sure, the network used to reach it is functioning and the client computers are working and, and, and... you get the point.
</p>

<p>
So, no, we haven't lost this rhetoric of quality. We've simply never used it the way Blow claims.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and in case anyone's wondering, my laptops never reboot unless I tell them to and one of them currently has an uptime of 55 days.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://www.datagubbe.se/endofciv/uptime_brumbrum.png" alt="A photo of my laptop's screen, showing a 55 day uptime.">
</p>

<h3>"The industry hasn't produced robust software for decades"</h3>

<p>

What is robust? Is it my iPhone, going for weeks and months without a 
reboot? Is it
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/epic-uptime-achievement-can-you-beat-16-years/">the famous uptime of Novell's file and printer servers</a>, 
with documented instances running for 16 years? Is it the multi-year 
uptimes of a plethora of Unix, Windows and VMS machines? Is it the 365+ 
days (and counting) uptime of some random Linux web server I've got 
access to? Is it turnkey systems like IBM i, offering continuous 
availability?

</p>

<p>
Apparently none of the above, according to Blow.
</p>

<h3>"Tech companies are no longer about pushing tech forward"</h3>

<p>
Well, yes and no. I agree that the lifestyle app startups of Silicon Valley (and elsewhere) are hardly about pushing tech forward - but people more interested in making money rather than amazing technology has always been around. Was Infocom's umpteenth text adventure about pushing tech forward? Was any of the ten bazillion (a rough estimate) jumpy-shooty platform games produced? Was MS-DOS, single-tasking its way through 15 years of building Microsoft's empire right up until its last breath in version 6.22?
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of exciting stuff happening on the "hard tech" front. Blow does mention machine learning earlier in his talk, but "boring" things like file systems, web servers, databases and programming languages are also continually developed and improved upon. A lot of effort is also going into improving the various layers of abstraction, virtualization and containerization Blow is so adverse to - but him disliking them doesn't mean they're not about pushing tech forward.
</p>

<h3>"Abstraction leads to loss of capability."</h3>

<p>
Blow lists a number of programming languages, some of which have fallen out of fashion because of abstraction. His take basically boils down to learning assembly coding, memory management and pointers.
</p>

<p>
I agree that a large number of programmers today (myself included) are very happy with not having to deal with things like memory allocation and pointers. And yes, there are certainly horrifying examples of when abstraction gets the better of us. Plenty of web sites use a lot of completely unnecessary JavaScript framework voodoo to render a simple blog and plenty of supposed "desktop apps" are really running (very slowly) inside a bundled browser.
</p>

<p>
Despite that, I'm willing to bet a few bucks there are more people 
around today (including youngsters) who can program in C than ever 
before, and that more C and assembly code is being written than ever 
before. Linux and NetBSD, for example, are continuously being ported to 
pretty much everything that even vaguely resembles a CPU. Rust, a new 
language with a heavy focus on robustness, <b>does</b> feature pointers and 
lets the programmer manage memory. Harvard's introduction to Computer 
Science, CS50, is publicly available on Youtube and each year it 
features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF6YkH-8vFk">a two hour
lecture on stuff like memory layout, pointers,
malloc() and free()</a>.
</p>

<p>
I agree that the things mentioned here are good to know about and I think anyone seriously into programming should at least try them out some time, if for no other reason than to understand why a lot of us prefer to avoid them if given the option to do so.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and garbage collection and functional programming aren't new 
abstractions. Lisp did both in the late 1950s and it's been used in a 
lot of "hardcore" settings, including
<a href="http://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html">NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab</a>.
And, unsurprisingly, a Lisp programmer will of course claim that Lisp
makes you much more productive than something with malloc() ever will.
</p>

<h3>"The productivity of Facebook employees is approaching zero"</h3>

<p>
Here we're shown some graphs of the rising number of Facebook and Twitter employees and Blow states that since Facebook doesn't really get that many new features each year, all those programmers mostly sit around and do nothing.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I'm pretty sure Facebook employs a wide range of staff who are not feature developers: lawyers, accountants, graphical 
designers, sysadmins, researchers, HR, middle management, etc. When not working on Facebook the site, employees of Facebook the company 
are also working on Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR to name some of their other pursuits. I'd also argue that (measurable) individual 
output in general drops as a result of a company growing. You need to reach a certain critical mass to have a whole team working hard on 
a feature only to, by some managerial decision, drop it right before it's finished. Things like that happen all the time in large 
software companies and won't show up in Blow's rather flimsy metric.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, Blow constructs this argument around the assumption that Facebook's product is Facebook, in the sense of the social platform. This is of course wrong. Facebook doesn't have to add or change very many features on their social platform every year, they just have to keep things smooth enough for those who actually use those functions to stay content.
</p>

<p>
This is because Facebook's real product is an ad delivery platform.
</p>

<p>
As such, it collects massive amounts of personal and private data and churns it into targeted ads, all the while sucking people in with cleverly designed attention-grabbing dark patterns. I'm sure plenty of work is done on this by a whole lot of programmers, but it'll never appear as "features" to the user, only as corporate revenue. In that respect, Facebook programmers seem to be highly productive.
</p>

<h3>Ken Thompson's "Three Week Unix"</h3>

<p>
First off, I'm not out to belittle Ken Thompson's efforts here. Writing an assembler, editor and basic kernel in three weeks is highly respectable work by any standard. It's also a great piece of computer lore and fits Blow's narrative perfectly - especially with Kernighan's little quip about productivity in the end. Of course, we don't know how "robust" Thompson's software was at this stage, or how user friendly, or what kind of features it had. I'm going to boldly claim it would've been a hard sell today, even if it did run on modern hardware.
</p>

<p>
I'm also pretty sure Thompson dealt with little or nothing of the following during those three weeks: documentation, code reviews, daily standups, backlog grooming, user stories, unit tests, customer demands, A/B testing, writing commit messages and adhering to a corporate code formatting standard. We are after all talking about a guy who, when he could pick any names he wanted, opted for "creat", "mv" and "cp".
</p>

<p>
I'm also certain Thompson could work alone in a private office, rather than share an open floor plan with fifty colleagues incessantly shouting into cellphones, shuffling furniture around or having animated discussions about football two feet from his desk.
</p>

<p>
It's important to remember that apart from hardware and software, the working conditions for most developers are vastly different …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-00ce522ec52eb743ceca"><div><p>Many evolutionary psychologists argue that humans have a sophisticated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_immune_system">‘behavioral immune system’</a>. We are, so the story goes, endowed with a suite of sophisticated, evolved psychological mechanisms that enable us to effectively detect and avoid disease causing parasites and pathogens. Unfortunately, work on the ‘behavioral immune system’ is plagued by one key methodological issue, and ethnographic evidence points to a more complex picture.</p><p>The core problem with existing research on the ‘behavioral immune system’ is that it is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065260115000246">largely</a> restricted to surveying people in modern nation-state societies. This is a big problem for two reasons. One, people in modern nation states tend to be aware of the germ theory of disease. That is, for cultural-historical reasons, they have scientifically informed knowledge of how disease is transmitted. This means disease-avoidance behavior can follow for reasons that are socially learned, and not the result of evolved mechanisms to avoid pathogens per se. </p><p>Consider for example an ethnographic account I <a href="https://traditionsofconflict.com/blog/2018/8/1/the-cause-of-illness">wrote of</a> previously, which demonstrates the behavioral contrast between someone with culturally learned knowledge of how pathogens spread compared to beliefs in a society with a different understanding of disease: “In <em>The Afterlife is Where We Come From</em> (2004), anthropologist Alma Gottlieb describes her fieldwork among the Beng farmers of West Africa. In this book, Gottlieb recounts her failure to persuade Beng villagers to boil their drinking water;</p><p>During our stays in Beng villages, Philip and I have always either boiled or filtered our own drinking water. To our dismay, our neighbors often derided our laborious efforts. One day we thought to explain our mysterious actions. The village had been experiencing an especially crippling outbreak of Guinea worm. After reading about the disease, Philip and I were convinced that polluted drinking water was the cause of our neighbors’ misery. We urged our friends to boil their water as protection against future infestation. But even our closest and most open-minded friends dismissed our suggestion with casual laughter. </p><p>“Can you see the worms in our water?” our friend Yacouba challenged us. We admitted we couldn’t. </p><p>“There’s nothing wrong with the water,” he insisted. “Anyway, even if the Guinea worms come to us through the water, they’re put there by witches.” Yacouba added emphatically, “Boiling the water wouldn’t stop the witches.” (Gottlieb, 189).”</p><p>Second, people in state societies often have access to culturally developed antiseptic systems and substances, facilitating greater pathogen avoidance than was often possible historically. This is important for an evolutionary model—if we want to investigate a pan-human ‘behavioral immune system’, and consider how it evolved, we should be looking at behavior in places where people don’t have historically recent knowledge of the germ theory of disease or access to antiseptic inventions, where they have to grapple with pathogens in contexts more similar to our evolutionary history than the <a href="https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/WeirdPeople.pdf">WEIRD</a> environments of today.</p><p>Let us consider a few domains where there is evidence across traditional societies that complicates that ‘behavioral immune system’ framework. </p><p>First, putrid or rotting meat. Anthropologist Frank Marlowe <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520253421/the-hadza">writes</a> of the Hadza hunter-gatherers of East Africa that, “the Hadza often eat very rotten week-old meat they scavenge from carnivores,” adding that, “The scavenged (and sometimes very rotten) meat also gives them stomachaches, even after they cook it, but not often enough to keep them from eating it.”</p><p>Anthropologist C.R. Hallpike touches on this a great deal in his book <em>Ship of Fools</em>, writing that, “In Papua New Guinea the people are even less fastidious about their pork when it is stinking, even cutting it up under water when the smell is too bad. And yes, sometimes they died from it. Biologists often tell us that we are protected by the vomiting reflex from eating meat that has begun to smell as it goes bad, but no one seems to have told primitive peoples about this.”</p><p>Missionary Angel Turrado Moreno <a href="https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?method=citation&amp;forward=searchFullContext&amp;col=collection(%27/eHRAF/ethnography/SouthAmer/SS18%27)&amp;docId=ss18-006&amp;tocOffsetId=tocPubInfoP">writes</a> among the Warao of the Amazon of the, “Fish and meat, half raw, spoiled, and even rotten, which they eat without the slightest scruple at any hour of the day or night.” Among the Yaghan of Tierra del Fuego beached whales were <a href="https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?method=citation&amp;forward=searchFullContext&amp;col=collection(%27/eHRAF/ethnography/SouthAmer/SH06%27)&amp;docId=sh06-003&amp;tocOffsetId=tocPubInfoP">often</a> feasted upon, even when putrid or rotting, and digestive disorders caused by spoiled meat were <a href="https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?method=citation&amp;forward=searchFullContext&amp;col=collection(%27/eHRAF/ethnography/SouthAmer/SH06%27)&amp;docId=sh06-001&amp;tocOffsetId=tocPubInfoP">said</a> to be common.</p><p>Now, to some degree this can fit within the ‘behavioral immune system’ framework, with the important acknowledgement that tradeoffs matter a great deal. In their paper on ‘Human pathogen avoidance adaptations’, evolutionary psychologists Joshua M. Tybur and Debra Lieberman <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X15001670">write</a> that, “Individuals should be more willing to accept the potential costs of infection via food if nutrients are more needed.” Under this logic, the willingness to consume rotting or putrid meat reflects necessity borne from a scarcity or shortage of nutrients. This seems reasonable, although I think this is something that would still require greater investigation.</p><p>It is clear that ecological and cultural factors play an important role in disease avoidance behaviors to a degree that indicates the limitations of assuming humans have a powerful and predictably expressed ‘behavioral immune system’. For example, opportunities for good hygiene are often quite rare across many small-scale societies, and even if they are ecologically possible cultural beliefs and knowledge determine to a large degree what hygiene practices do or do not develop. Hallpike writes that, “Where water is scarce and is arduous to fetch, drinking and cooking take priority over hygiene by a wide margin, and I never saw the Konso [of Ethiopia] (or the Tauade [of New Guinea], for that matter) wash their hands before eating.”</p><p>Anthropologist Ran Singh Mann <a href="https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?method=citation&amp;forward=searchFullContext&amp;col=collection(%27/eHRAF/ethnography/Asia/AZ02%27)&amp;docId=az02-012&amp;tocOffsetId=tocPubInfoP">writes</a> among the Onge Andaman Islanders “The raw material for food is not properly cleaned. It is boiled in dirty water containing mud and dust. The utensil in which the food is cooked is hardly cleaned. It is used over and over again without being cleaned. Layers of dirt keep on accumulating on the utensils used for cooking and eating purposes. The dogs also eat the left-overs in the same containers.”</p><p>Beyond limited hygiene practices, extensive and visceral interactions with dead bodies offers one of the most powerful complications for the ‘behavioral immune system’ framework. Hallpike quotes a patrol officer writing in 1945 that among the Tauade, ““A recently bereaved widow had an arm bone, several rib bones and the complete hand of the late departed hanging on a string around her neck. She did not appear to mind the offensive odour.”” Among the <a href="https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?method=citation&amp;forward=searchFullContext&amp;col=collection(%27/eHRAF/ethnography/NorthAmer/NA10%27)&amp;docId=na10-001&amp;tocOffsetId=tocPubInfoP">Inuit</a> on Kodiak Island, “Nobody was afraid to touch a corpse,” and burials would not be conducted until the fourth day after death, “Until then the corpse is never left alone,” and is given a place in the main room of the house. Rituals involving corpses where also common among whale hunters in the region: “The whale hunters preserved the bodies of renowned men in caves, where they assembled prior to the hunt, <strong>carried the corpses to nearby streams, laid them in the water, and drank from this water</strong>.”</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1612593965665_14924"><div><p>In Australia, James Dawson <a href="https://twitter.com/Evolving_Moloch/status/1030540750209966080">writes</a> that, “Before the minds of the aborigines were poisoned by the superstitions of the white people, they had not the slightest dread of the dead body of a friend, nor had they any repugnance to remain beside it." And, as I noted in a <a href="https://traditionsofconflict.com/blog/2018/6/19/visceral-insulation">previous article</a> touching on this topic, anthropologist Bruce Knauft described mourning rituals among the Gebusi of New Guinea,</p><p>The following morning, Dugawe’s body was grossly bloated. His swollen limbs oozed corpse fluid, and his peeling skin exposed putrid yellowgreen flesh. His belly and even his genitals had swelled with the gases of decomposition. The stench was unforgettable; it burned up my nose, down my throat, and into my brain. Equally powerful were the actions of Dugawe’s female kin. With unearthly sobs, they draped themselves physically over the corpse, lovingly massaged its slime, and drew back its skin. They rubbed their arms and legs with the ooze of the body. Corpse fluid on one’s skin is a tangible sign of grief, of physical as well as emotional connection to the deceased—making one’s own body like the corpse. Seeing this, Dugawe’s departing soul was said to know how much they cared for him and ease his anger at having died, at least a little (Knauft, 51).</p><p>See also <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2016/10/mummy-photography-ulla-lohmann/">mummification practices</a> among the Anga of New Guinea. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_(disease)">kuru</a>, the prion disease that spread through ritual cannibalism among the Fore of New Guinea. </p><p>Blood rituals are also not <a href="https://twitter.com/Evolving_Moloch/status/1028119118329700353">uncommon</a>. As I previously <a href="https://traditionsofconflict.com/blog/2018/6/19/visceral-insulation">noted</a>, “Men of the Arunta foragers of Australia would drink some of each other’s blood under the belief that it would make them stronger and prevent treachery. Anthropologists Francis Gillen and Walter Spencer <a href="http://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?method=citation&amp;forward=browseAuthorsFullContext&amp;id=oi08-001">wrote</a> that, “If [a man] refused to drink the blood, then, as actually happened in one case known to us, his mouth would be forced open and blood poured into it, which would have just the same binding influence as if the drinking had been a voluntary one.” Gillen and Spencer also discuss practices of treating sickness with blood, adding that, </p><p>When a woman is very ill and weak, one of her male Umba, to whom she is Mia alkulla – that is, he is the son of one of her younger sisters – may volunteer to strengthen her with his blood, in which case all the women and children are sent away from her. <em>The man draws a quantity of blood from [his] sub-incised urethra, and she drinks part of it</em>, while he rubs the remainder over her body, adding afterwards a coating of red ochre and grease. [italics added]”</p><p>Warriors in some societies may <a href="https://twitter.com/Evolving_Moloch/status/1033189575269670913">smear the blood</a> of enemies on their bodies, or consume body parts to gain power. Among the <a href="https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/ehrafe/citation.do?col=collection%28%27%2FeHRAF%2Fethnography%2FNorthAmer%2FNA08%27%29&amp;docId=na08-002&amp;forward=searchFullContext&amp;method=citation&amp;tocOffsetId=tocPubInfoP">Ingalik</a> hunter-gatherers of Alaska, “a warrior may eat the eye of a respected opponent whom he has killed.

    <h2 id="hn-hijacks-your-brain">HN hijacks your brain</h2>
<p>You're an engineer who looks at Hacker News 2-5 times a day. HN is a good way to <em>fill the gaps</em> in time. You scan the front page- repeatedly- for links of interest... reading titles, eyeing scores... often jumping directly to the (overtly contrarian) comments to see if a link is even worth the energy.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>That cycle hits a sickening <strong>5</strong>/10 of Tristan Harris's <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3">list of mind hijacks</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  Control the Menu, Control the Choices</li>
<li>(3)  Fear of missing something important</li>
<li>(4)  Social Approval (upvotes)</li>
<li>(6)  Bottomless bowl</li>
<li>(10) Forecasting</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These hijacks  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">aren't</a> intentional, they're just a byproduct of link aggregation platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stoics are turning in their graves, where instead of knowing what's important, the links on HN <em>become</em> what's important, no matter how trivial, pedantic, hyped, or irrelevant.</p>
<p>So if you want help breaking this negative feedback loop, I encourage you to reclaim your attention by turning HN into and RSS feed;</p>
<p>Get more <a href="https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13">done</a>. Ignore the comments and the <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">mooks</a>. Set limits. It's incredibly liberating to finish your RSS feed and think to yourself, <em>now what</em>?</p>

<p>Declaring what deserves your attention is the defining feature of RSS, so it's important to declare what aspect of HN you like. Generally people look at high scores. Fortunately HN already has a url specifically for its most "important" (i.e. upvoted) links: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best"><code>/best</code></a>.</p>
<p>So if we can subscribe to the links from that page, we'll get the bulk of the links that deserve our attention.</p>
<p>For me, it's critically important for RSS to be a self-hosted solution. No third parties <small>(I'm looking at <em>you</em>, Feedly)</small>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what's the point of retaking control, you're just shunting control to yet another third party.</p>
<p>My personal setup goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the Raspberry Pi you bought but never used</li>
<li>Install Docker</li>
<li>Run FreshRSS</li>
<li>Add HN <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best"><code>/best</code></a> as an RSS feed</li>
<li>(Optional) Port forwarding and DNS setup</li>
<li>(Optional) Pick out a smartphone app to sync with</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the first thing that worked for me, so by no means is it the guaranteed best. Recommendations and alternatives are welcome! You can, of course, tailor the following guide if you'd like to use a VPS.</p>

<h3 id="prepare-the-pi">Prepare the Pi</h3>
<h4 id="install-git">Install git</h4>
<p>Do a standard Raspbian setup the with <a href="https://soapstone.mradford.com/raspberry-pi-automatic-wifi-and-ssh">internet/ssh/hostname</a>. Then install git:</p>
<pre><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install git
</span></pre><h4 id="install-docker">Install Docker</h4>
<pre><span>curl -sSL</span><span> https://get.docker.com | </span><span>sh
</span></pre><pre><span>sudo</span><span> usermod</span><span> -aG</span><span> docker pi &amp;&amp; </span><span>sudo</span><span> reboot
</span></pre><h4 id="install-docker-compose">Install Docker-compose</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This method is specifically for Raspbian, if you're using a VPS or non-ARM machine, install docker-compose the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">conventional</a> way.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install</span><span> -y</span><span> libffi-dev libssl-dev
</span><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install</span><span> -y</span><span> python3 python3-pip
</span><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get remove python-configparser
</span><span>sudo</span><span> pip3 install docker-compose
</span></pre>
<pre><span>git</span><span> clone https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS

cd FreshRSS/Docker
</span></pre>
<p>We're using a Raspberry Pi, so you'll need to pick out the ARM image! Use your favorite editor to modify these lines of the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>
<pre><span># docker-compose.yml
</span><span>-    image: freshrss/freshrss:latest
</span><span>+    image: freshrss/freshrss:arm
</span></pre>
<p>Now you're ready to execute FreshRSS:</p>
<pre><span>docker-compose</span><span> up</span><span> -d
</span></pre>
<p>Once that's complete, head to your Pi's IP address (or hostname, if you opted for that) on port <code>8080</code> in your laptop's/desktop's browser (something like http://1.2.3.4:8080), and go through the initial setup.</p>

<p>Add <code>https://hnrss.org/best</code> as an RSS feed (from <a href="https://hnrss.github.io/">hnrss.github.io</a>).</p>
<p>Congratulations! You've officially RSS-ified HN!</p>
<h3 id="optional-port-forwarding-and-dns-setup">(Optional) Port forwarding and DNS setup</h3>
<p>Unless you went with the VPS route, you're probably behind a LAN, so if you want to access your RSS outside your LAN, you'll need to set up port forwarding and/or DNS. That's beyond the scope of this guide, but there are many guides online that can get you there.</p>
<h3 id="optional-pick-out-an-app">(Optional) Pick out an app</h3>
<p>You could just expose the pi to the internet, and read RSS directly from the browser, but I think having an app is a nice touch.</p>
<p>First you'll need to enable API access in FreshRSS. Go to <code>Authentication</code> and check the box to allow API access:</p>
<p><img src="https://soapstone.mradford.com/freshrss-auth.png" alt="fresh-rss-screenshot1"></p>
<p>Then create an API key under <code>Profile</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://soapstone.mradford.com/freshrss-profile.png" alt="fresh-rss-screenshot2"></p>
<p>Now you can use the API url and the API key in your selected app to pull data down locally. Nice!</p>
<p>Here's a non-exhaustive list of open-source (Android) apps to get you started.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/readrops/Readrops">Readrops</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readrops.app">play store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/news-android">New Android</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.luhmer.owncloudnewsreader&amp;pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1">play store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nilsbraden/ttrss-reader-fork">ttrss-reader-fork</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ttrssreader">play store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fistons/TinyTinyFeed">TinyTinyFeed</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.poopeeland.tinytinyfeed">play store</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Truth be told, a lot of the closed source RSS apps I've checked out tend to be slightly higher in quality, so if you're willing to compromise on that front then they are worth exploring.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-did-we-gain">What did we gain?</h2>
<p>It may not seem like it, but we've gained a <strong>lot</strong> by doing this!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defeated the mind hijacks</strong>:

February 5, 2021 | https://liuliu.me/eyes/data-science-setup-with-swift-in-2021/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liuliu.me/eyes/data-science-setup-with-swift-in-2021/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I started to work on a new data science related project last year. Our initial setup was fairly traditional: it is Python-centric, with <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> for dependency management and environment setup.</p>

<p>Anaconda is interesting. It is probably useful if you have a ton of dependencies and the system tries really hard to figure out the package compatibilities with each other based on their claims (version numbers of their dependencies). For us though, we only use a handful of packages with clean dependencies on each other (your usual suspects: <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a href="https://numpy.org/">numpy</a>), and the version number check just means each time package upgrade is half-an-hour SMT solving.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I made my fortune in the past decade by doing app development (Facebook, Snapchat). I’ve been eyeing on Swift since the 1.0 version. Since then, the language matured a lot. After gaining some Swift experience with my last employer, it seems to be a good compromise between expressivity and performance. The noise from the language itself is minimal, and the performance can be tuned if you are hard on it, otherwise still better than raw Python.</p>

<p>After a few months of probing, investing, bug fixes, we’ve migrated our setup to Swift in last December. It has been serving us well so far.</p>

<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2>

<p>We have a small project, and the problem with packages mostly around package management and upgrade. Since Anaconda’s environment is not per project based, we have to switch back and forth when entering / leaving the project.</p>

<p>Our project, although small, is a bit exotic. Our core algorithm was implemented in C, and we don’t want to ship a Python plugin in-tree. Hence, we opt-ed to talk with the C lib through standard IO (subprocess). It turns out to be hairy and the core algorithm update process is more than terrible.</p>

<p>Pandas has a reasonable performance if these are builtin functions, once we drop to use apply / lambda, going through a few million rows for a particular column can take 30 to 40 seconds. For these cases, we also cannot use the rest of idle cores efficiently.</p>

<p>However, switching to a new language setup is not an easy task. Besides solving the above said problems, we would still like to keep a few things we liked with our old setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Jupyter notebook:</strong> we really liked to do data exploration with Jupyter notebooks. Anything requires us to compile / run / print would be a no go. The interactive data exploration experience is essential for our workflow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pandas:</strong> we liked Pandas, it is a Swiss Army knife for data science. It also has a big API surface that would be very hard to reimplement from scratch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>PyCharm or alike IDE:</strong> we liked to use PyCharm for Python development a lot. Data inspection, re-run, and in general, debugging experience within an IDE is no comparison with tools like vim (although I still use vim for a lot of development personally).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-potential-choices">Other Potential Choices</h2>

<p>Before embarking on this quest, we briefly looked at other potential choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>TypeScript / JavaScript:</strong> it has some interesting data exploration patterns, such as <a href="https://observablehq.com/">observablehq.com</a>. However, it doesn’t have good C library integration points, making the fore-mentioned core algorithm integration problem unsolved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rust:</strong> when I did my investigation, I didn’t notice the <a href="https://github.com/google/evcxr">evcxr</a> project. Other than that, the syntax for modeling would be a bit noisier than I’d like. The way to call Python through <a href="https://pyo3.rs/">PyO3</a> is a bit clumsy too.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Julia:</strong> if I have more experience with the language, I may have a different opinion. But as it stands, the language has its own ecosystem, and I didn’t see a good way to call Python libraries from the language*. On the C lib integration part, it seems to require dynamic linking, and that would be a little bit more hurdle on my toolchain setup.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="new-setup">New Setup</h2>

<h3 id="monorepo">Monorepo</h3>

<p>Our new setup is a monorepo, with Bazel as the build system for both our Swift code, C libraries and our Python dependencies. In the meantime, we still have some legacy Python libraries that are now managed by Bazel too.</p>

<p>Bazel’s new <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python">rules_python</a> has a pretty reasonable <code>pip_install</code> rule for 3rd-party dependencies. As I mentioned, because we use relatively a small number of Python packages, cross package compatibility is not a concern for us.</p>

<p>All our open-source dependencies are managed through <code>WORKSPACE</code> rules. This worked for our monorepo because we don’t really have a large number of open-source dependencies in the Swift ecosystem. The things we import mostly are Swift <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics">numerics</a>, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms/">algorithms</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser">argument-parser</a>.</p>

<h3 id="jupyterlab">Jupyterlab</h3>

<p>We don’t use a separate Jupyter installation anymore. Jupyterlab is installed as a <code>pip_install</code> requirement for our monorepo. Opening a Jupyterlab would be as simple as <code>bazel run :lab</code>. This enables us to in-tree our Swift Jupyter kernel. We adopted the <a href="https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter">swift-jupyter</a> and added <a href="https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter/pull/121">Bazel dependency support</a>. We also have a pending PR to upstream our sourcekit-lsp integration with the Swift Jupyter kernel.</p>

<p>This complicates a bit on plugin management for Jupyterlab. But we haven’t yet found a well-maintained out-of-tree plugin that we would like to use.</p>

<h3 id="python">Python</h3>

<p>To support calling Python from Swift, we opted to use <a href="https://github.com/pvieito/PythonKit">PythonKit</a> library. We’ve upstreamed <a href="https://github.com/pvieito/PythonKit/pull/28">a patch</a> to make Pandas work better within Swift. We made a few more enhancements around <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/PythonKit/commit/0973cebf0dfc66ffd486639108ea8e439c8212bd">UnboundedRange syntax</a>, <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/PythonKit/commit/af00ca39bc5366aff3a30d8841220128d1eec221">passing Swift closures as Python lambda</a>, which haven’t been upstreamed at the moment.</p>

<p>One thing that makes calling Python from Swift easy is the use of reference counting in both languages. This makes memory management cross the language boundary much more natural.</p>

<p>We also wrote a simple <code>pyswift_binary</code> macro within Bazel such that a Swift binary can declare their Python dependencies and these will be setup properly before invoking the Swift binary.</p>

<p>We haven’t yet vendoring our Python runtime at the moment. Just painstakingly making sure all machines on Python 3.8. However, we do intend to use <code>py_runtime</code> to solve this discrepancy in the future.</p>

<h3 id="c-libraries">C Libraries</h3>

<p>Swift’s interoperability with C is top-notch. Calling and compiling C dependencies (with Bazel) and integrating with Swift is as easy as it should be. So far, we’ve fully migrated our core algorithms to Swift. The iterations on the core algorithms are much easier.</p>

<h3 id="ide-integration">IDE Integration</h3>

<p>For obvious reasons, we cannot use PyCharm with Swift. However, we successfully migrated most of our workflow to VS Code. LLDB support makes debugging easy. However, we did compile our own Swift LLDB with Python support for this purpose (still in the process to figure out with the core team why the shipped Swift LLDB on Linux has no Python support).</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp">Sourcekit-lsp</a> doesn’t recognize Bazel targets. The work for Build Server Protocol support on both Bazel side and on sourcekit-lsp side seems stalled at the moment. We ended up writing a simple script to query compilation parameters from <code>bazel aquery</code> for all our Swift source code, and put these into <code>compile_commands.json</code>. Sourcekit-lsp just has enough support for Clang’s <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html">compilation database format</a> to make code highlighting, auto-complete, go to definition and inline documentation work again.</p>

<p>We committed <code>.vscode/settings.json.tpl</code> and <code>.vscode/launch.json.tpl</code> into the codebase. Upon initial checkout, a small script can run to convert these template files into actual <code>settings.json</code> and <code>launch.json</code>. We did this to workaround issues with some VS Code plugins requiring absolute paths. These two files will keep in sync with the templates as part of the build process ever since.</p>

<h3 id="bonus">Bonus</h3>

<p>Swift’s argument-parser library makes creating command line tools really easy. Furthermore, it also supports auto-complete in your favorite shells. We implemented one all-encompassing CLI tool for our monorepo to do all kinds of stuff: data downloading, transformation, model evaluation, launching Jupyterlab etc. With auto-completion and help messages, it is much easier to navigate than our previous <code>./bin</code> directory with twenty-something separate scripts.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-the-end">Is this the End?</h2>

<p>We’ve been happy with this new setup since the beginning of this year, but it is far from the end-all be-all solution.</p>

<p>Swift is great for local development, however, the Bazel support on Linux generates binary that dynamically links to Swift runtime. This makes deployment a little bit more involved than we’d like it to be.</p>

<p>Pandas uses internal data structure for DataFrame (column-based numpy). While we do have efficient numpy to tensor conversions, these cannot be leveraged in the context of Pandas (we want to lift the whole data frame, not just numpy-ready columns). Our current solution calls itertuples, which can be quite slow. We’d like to sponsor an open-source project to implement <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a> support for Swift. This should enable us to pass data from Pandas to Swift through Arrow in-memory format, which may be faster than what we currently do.</p>

<p>I recently had to produce reports on a table containing events of a user's account balance. The user can deposit and withdraw from their account, and support personnel can set the account's credit, which is the maximum amount the user can overdraw.</p>
<p>The table looked roughly like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>event</span><span>;</span>
<span> id | account |    type    |      happened_at       |               data</span>

<span>  1 |       1 | created    | 2019-08-01 15:14:13+03 | {"credit": 0, "delta_balance": 0}</span>
<span>  2 |       1 | deposited  | 2019-08-01 15:15:15+03 | {"delta_balance": 100}</span>
<span>  3 |       1 | withdraw   | 2019-08-02 09:35:33+03 | {"delta_balance": -50}</span>
<span>  4 |       1 | credit_set | 2019-08-03 16:14:12+03 | {"credit": 50}</span>
<span>  5 |       1 | withdraw   | 2019-08-03 14:45:44+03 | {"delta_balance": -30}</span>
<span>  6 |       1 | credit_set | 2019-08-03 16:14:12+03 | {"credit": 100}</span>

<p>To get the current balance of an account, we sum the changes in <code>delta_balance</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>SUM</span><span>((</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'delta_balance'</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>balance</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    <span>event</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
    <span>account</span><span>;</span>

<span> account | balance</span>
<span>---------+---------</span>
<span>       1 |     -30</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>data</code> field contains information specific to each type of event. To extract the value of <code>delta_balance</code> from the <code>data</code> column we use the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-OP-TABLE" rel="noopener">arrow operator provided by PostgreSQL</a>.</p>
<p>The result of the query shows that the current balance of account 1 is -30. This means the account is in overdraft. To check if this is within the allowed range, we need to compare it to the credit set for this account. The credit for account 1 was initially set to 0 when the account was created. The credit was then adjusted twice, and is currently set to 100.</p>
<p>To get the current state of an account, we need its aggregated balance and the latest credit that was set for it.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">The Problem</a></h2>
<p>In Oracle there is a function called <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions071.htm" rel="noopener"><code>last</code></a> we can be use to get the last <code>credit_set</code> event. A query using <code>last</code> might look like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>-- Oracle</span>
<span>SELECT</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>MAX</span><span>(</span><span>CASE</span> <span>WHEN</span> <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span> <span>THEN</span> <span>data</span> <span>ELSE</span> <span>null</span> <span>END</span><span>)</span>
        <span>KEEP</span> <span>(</span><span>DENSE_RANK</span> <span>LAST</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>credit</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    <span>event</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
    <span>account</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>PostgreSQL also has a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html#id-1.5.8.26.6.2.2.10.1.1" rel="noopener"><code>LAST_VALUE</code></a> analytic function. Analytics functions cannot be used in a group by the way aggregate functions do:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>LAST_VALUE</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>OVER</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>PARTITION</span> <span>BY</span> <span>account</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>id</span>
        <span>RANGE</span> <span>BETWEEN</span> <span>UNBOUNDED</span> <span>PRECEDING</span> <span>AND</span> <span>UNBOUNDED</span> <span>FOLLOWING</span>
    <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>credit</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    <span>event</span>
<span>WHERE</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
    <span>account</span><span>;</span>

<span>ERROR:</span><span>  column "event.data" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or be used in an aggregate function</span>
<span>LINE 3:</span><span>     LAST_VALUE(data) OVER (</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The error tells us that the <code>data</code> field used in the analytic function must be used in the group by. This is not really what we want. To use PostgreSQL's <code>LAST_VALUE</code> function, we need to remove the group by:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>LAST_VALUE</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>OVER</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>PARTITION</span> <span>BY</span> <span>account</span> <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> <span>id</span>
        <span>RANGE</span> <span>BETWEEN</span> <span>UNBOUNDED</span> <span>PRECEDING</span> <span>AND</span> <span>UNBOUNDED</span> <span>FOLLOWING</span>
    <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>credit</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    <span>event</span>
<span>WHERE</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span><span>;</span>

<span> account |     credit</span>
<span>---------+-----------------</span>
<span>       1 | {"credit": 100}</span>
<span>       1 | {"credit": 100}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>These are not exactly the results we need. Analytic, or window functions, operate on a set of rows, and not in a group by.</p>
<p><strong>PostgreSQL doesn't have a built-in function to obtain the first or last value in a group using group by.</strong></p>
<p>To get the last value in a group by, we need to get creative!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="old-fashioned-sql"><a href="#old-fashioned-sql">Old Fashioned SQL</a></h2>
<p>The plain SQL solution is to divide and conquer. We already have a query to get the current balance of an account. If we write another query to get the credit for each account, we can join the two together and get the complete state of an account.</p>
<p>To get the last event for each account in PostgreSQL we can use <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-select.html#SQL-DISTINCT" rel="noopener"><code>DISTINCT ON</code></a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>DISTINCT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>(</span><span>account</span><span>)</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'credit'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>credit</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    <span>event</span>
<span>WHERE</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span>
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>id</span> <span>DESC</span><span>;</span>

<span>account | credit</span>
<span>---------+--------</span>
<span>       1 | 100</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Great! Using <code>DISTINCT ON</code> we got the last credit set for each account.</p>

<p>The next step is to join the two queries, and get the complete account state:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span>
    <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>balance</span><span>,</span>
    <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>credit</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    <span>(</span>
    <span>SELECT</span>
        <span>account</span><span>,</span>
        <span>SUM</span><span>((</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'delta_balance'</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>balance</span>
    <span>FROM</span>
        <span>event</span>
    <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
        <span>account</span>

    <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>a</span>
    <span>JOIN</span>
    <span>(</span>

    <span>SELECT</span> <span>DISTINCT</span> <span>ON</span> <span>(</span><span>account</span><span>)</span>
        <span>account</span><span>,</span>
        <span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'credit'</span> <span>AS</span> <span>credit</span>
    <span>FROM</span>
        <span>event</span>
    <span>WHERE</span>
        <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span>
    <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span>
        <span>account</span><span>,</span>
        <span>id</span> <span>DESC</span>

    <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>b</span>

    <span>ON</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span><span>account</span> <span>=</span> <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>account</span><span>;</span>

<span> account | balance | credit</span>
<span>---------+---------+--------</span>
<span>       1 |     -30 | 100</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We got the expected result.</p>
<p>Before we move on, let's take a glance at the execution plan:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>                                         QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hash Join  (cost=44.53..49.07 rows=4 width=44)
   Hash Cond: (event.account = b.account)
   -&gt;  HashAggregate  (cost=25.00..27.00 rows=200 width=12)
         Group Key: event.account
         -&gt;  Seq Scan on event  (cost=0.00..17.50 rows=750 width=36)
   -&gt;  Hash  (cost=19.49..19.49 rows=4 width=36)
         -&gt;  Subquery Scan on b  (cost=19.43..19.49 rows=4 width=36)
               -&gt;  Unique  (cost=19.43..19.45 rows=4 width=40)
                     -&gt;  Sort  (cost=19.43..19.44 rows=4 width=40)
                           Sort Key: event_1.account, event_1.id DESC
                           -&gt;  Seq Scan on event event_1  (cost=0.00..19.39 rows=4 width=40)
                                 Filter: (type = 'credit_set'::text)
</pre></div>


<p>The event table is being scanned twice, once for each subquery. The <code>DISTINCT ON</code> subquery also requires a sort by <code>account</code> and <code>id</code>. The two subqueries are then joined using a hash-join.</p>
<p><strong>PostgreSQL is unable to combine the two subqueries into a single scan of the table.</strong> If the event table is very large, performing two full table scans, and a sort and a hash join, might become slow and consume a lot of memory.</p>
<div>
<p>common table expression</p>
<p>It's tempting to use common table expression (CTE) to make the query more readable. But, <a href="https://hakibenita.com/be-careful-with-cte-in-postgre-sql">CTE's are currently optimization fences</a>, and using it here will most definitely prevent PostgreSQL from performing any optimization that involves both subqueries.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-array-trick"><a href="#the-array-trick">The Array Trick</a></h2>
<p>Using good ol' SQL got us the answer, but it took two passes on the table. We can do better with the following trick:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db#=&gt;</span><span>SELECT</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>SUM</span><span>((</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'delta_balance'</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>int</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> <span>balance</span><span>,</span>
<span>    <span>(</span><span>MAX</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'credit'</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>FILTER</span> <span>(</span><span>WHERE</span> <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span><span>))[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span> <span>AS</span> <span>credit</span>
</span><span>FROM</span>
    <span>event</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
    <span>account</span><span>;</span>

<span> account | balance | credit</span>
<span>---------+---------+--------</span>
<span>       1 |     -30 |    100</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is so much simpler than the previous question, so let's break it down.</p>
<h3 id="how-postgresql-compares-arrays"><a href="#how-postgresql-compares-arrays">How PostgreSQL Compares Arrays</a></h3>
<p>To understand what exactly is going on here, we first need to understand <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html" rel="noopener">how PostgreSQL compares arrays</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Array comparisons compare the array contents element-by-element, using the default B-tree comparison function for the element data type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When comparing arrays, PostgreSQL will go element by element and compare the values according to their type. To demonstrate:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>greatest</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>200</span><span>],</span> <span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>100</span><span>]);</span>
<span> greatest</span>
<span>----------</span>
<span> {2,100}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The first element of the second array (2) is larger than the first element of the first array (1), so it's the greatest.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>greatest</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>200</span><span>],</span> <span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>201</span><span>]);</span>
<span> greatest</span>
<span>----------</span>
<span> {1,201}</span>
<span>(1 row)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The first elements of both arrays are equal (1), so PostgreSQL moves on to the next element. In this case, the second element of the second array (201) is the greatest.</p>
<h3 id="max-by-key"><a href="#max-by-key">Max by Key...</a></h3>
<p>Using this feature of PostgreSQL, we construct an array where the first element is the value to sort by, and the second element is the value we want to keep. In our case, we want to get the credit by the max <code>id</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>MAX</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'credit'</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span><span>])</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Not all events set credit, so we need to restrict the result to <code>credit_set</code> events:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>MAX</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'credit'</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>FILTER</span> <span>(</span><span>WHERE</span> <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The result of this expression is an array:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>db#=&gt;</span><span>SELECT</span>
    <span>account</span><span>,</span>
    <span>MAX</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'credit'</span><span>)</span><span>::</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>FILTER</span> <span>(</span><span>WHERE</span> <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span><span>))</span>
<span>FROM</span>
    <span>event</span>
<span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span>
    <span>account</span><span>;</span>

<span> account |   max</span>
<span>---------+---------</span>
<span>       1 | {6,100}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We only want the second element, the value of <code>credit</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>(</span><span>MAX</span><span>(</span><span>ARRAY</span><span>[</span><span>id</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>data</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>'credit'</span><span>)::</span><span>int</span><span>])</span> <span>FILTER</span> <span>(</span><span>WHERE</span> <span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'credit_set'</span><span>))[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And this is it! This way we can get the last credit set for each account.</p>
<p>Next, let's examine the execution plan:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>                          QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------
 HashAggregate  (cost=32.50..34.50 rows=200 width=16)
   Group Key: account
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on event  (cost=0.00..17.50 rows=750 width=72)

          <p>
    Posted on February  2, 2021
    
</p>


<p>These are some of the things I think about when trying to write clean, readable code.</p>
<h2 id="prioritize-clarity">Prioritize Clarity</h2>
<p>There are many ways to write any piece of code. Some will run faster, some will take less memory, some will be easier to test. And some will be more clear.</p>
<p>The first step to writing clear code is to make it a priority.</p>
<p>This means you have to deprioritize other aspects, like speed. There’s no such thing as prioritizing one thing without deprioritizing something else (when everything is a priority, nothing is).</p>
<h2 id="develop-a-sense-for-clarity">Develop a sense for clarity</h2>
<p>Writing well requires knowing what good writing looks like, and creating clear code requires knowing what clear code looks like. Reading well-regarded code can give you a sense of what good can look like.</p>
<p>A good sense for clear code won’t keep you from writing unreadable code, but it will tell you what parts don’t smell right.</p>
<h2 id="edit">Edit</h2>
<p>Your first idea for how to write the code will rarely be the most clear.</p>
<p>It’s often easier to find a readable way to write code after you’re finished with the mental work of getting the first version written down. Reading back over what you just wrote will help give ideas for how to improve it.</p>
<h2 id="start-by-explaining">Start by explaining</h2>
<p>If you’re not sure how to organize the code, start by explaining what needs to be done as though you are telling it to another person (or rubber duck). Write it down: “Well, we need to skip it if the user is deleted, or if the order is already in progress…” Take that explanation and transform it into code.</p>
<p>When laying out the code, it’s better to be thinking in terms of human communication rather than machine abstractions.</p>

<p>Add comments that explain why the code is doing what it is doing, or is structured the way that it is structured.</p>
<p>Just reading the logic won’t tell you why the author thought that was the right logic. There might be some business reason you don’t know about - perhaps users outside the US sometimes put the street number at the end of the first line of the address. Or maybe there is some little technical detail - this query is structured in this weird way to convince Postgres to optimize it correctly. These are added bits of context that don’t exist in the code itself.</p>
<p>Code can’t self-document if it isn’t there. If you decide to not write some code and don’t leave a comment explaining why, there will be nothing left to explain what you were thinking!</p>
<p>Even if it is possible to understand the reasoning from just reading the code, it’s hard mental work that can be very easily prevented.</p>
<h2 id="dont-mix-levels">Don’t mix levels</h2>
<p>Don’t mix levels of abstraction within a method.</p>
<p>This mixes levels of abstraction:</p>

<p>This doesn’t:</p>

<p>Mixing levels of abstraction makes the reader jump between thinking about what is being done and how it is implemented.</p>
<p>When you talk about what code does, you are talking about the current level of abstraction. When you talk about how the code does it, you are talking about the next level of abstraction down.</p>
<p>In the <code>welcome</code> method, what it does is send a welcome email if it has not already been sent. How it determines if the email was already sent is to query the database of past email records. Notice that the second version of <code>welcome</code> moves the ‘how’ to a separate method. It’s only concerned with the ‘what’, meaning it stays at one level of abstraction.</p>
<p>Make each function live at one level of abstraction, and delegate lower-level details to methods at lower levels of abstraction. Methods with a single level of abstraction tend to read like a story about what is going on.</p>
<h2 id="break-out-functions">Break out functions</h2>
<p>Big functions can (sometimes!) be made more readable by breaking them up into smaller functions.</p>
<p>Sometimes that function acts like a series of steps, in which case it works well to extract a function for each step. Other times, there are different decisions to be made, each of which could be made in a different function. Perhaps there’s parts of the function that act like making a decision and parts that act like taking action. There’s a lot of different dimensions you can use to split up a function. It takes practice to get good at seeing the right one to use.</p>
<p>Smaller functions have some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each bit of logic is given a name. This makes it easier to know what each bit of logic is for and helps you find where a bit of logic lives.</li>
<li>There are fewer variables in scope.</li>
<li>It’s easier to tell what the program was “thinking” when you look at a stack trace or run a debugger.</li>
<li>The small functions can be tested separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Computers would work fine with no functions at all. Functions exist for the sake of programmers, so make good use of them.</p>
<h2 id="dont-break-out-functions">Don’t break out functions</h2>
<p>The Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) idea is often taken too far.</p>
<p>Now, it’s a very good idea to extract magic numbers to constants and have one copy of the logic for making a particular decision. Repeating those bits of code is a bad idea.</p>
<p>DRY starts to go too far when two functions that happen to share a handful of lines become a target for deduplication. Completely avoiding duplicated lines means that you’ll end up with confusing, nonsense abstractions that exist only to hold those few shared lines. This makes the code weirdly hard to change because the structure of two unrelated pieces of code will be tied together.</p>
<p>The test for whether some pieces of code should be deduplicated is simple: would anything bad happen if one was changed without also changing the other? If the answer is yes, then make a single source of truth for it. If not, consider leaving it alone.</p>
<p>The point of DRY isn’t to run a manual compression process on the codebase, it’s to avoid a dependency where two parts of the code need to be manually kept in sync. Remember, deduplicating code is not the same thing as creating an abstraction.</p>
<h2 id="avoid-configurable-functions">Avoid configurable functions</h2>
<p>Prefer many functions to a few, configurable functions.</p>
<p>I’m sure you’ve seen stories like this one: you start off with a clean function that’s called in three different places. You want to use it in a fourth place, but it needs to do something slightly different, so you add a configuration parameter. Then the first caller gets a new feature, requiring two more configuration parameters. A fifth use case is added with its own special parameter. Caller #2 is too slow, so you add yet another parameter for skip part of the work.</p>
<p>Somehow, your clean function that started life doing one thing now has 5 configuration parameters and does potentially 2^5 = 32 different things (or more)!</p>
<p>It’s much better to have multiple functions, each of which does just one thing.</p>
<p>Once you have separate functions, there will of course be duplication. When those shared parts need to be kept in sync, apply DRY and extract them to shared functions. This is easier if the function is already broken down into subfunctions for decisions and steps.</p>
<p>Remember, a few duplicated lines is fine! If each of the separate functions has its own for-loop over a list, that’s very acceptable duplication.</p>
<p>One advantage of this approach is that when one use-case goes away, you can easily delete the relevant function. You don’t have to dig around in the logic of a complicated function to tease out the parts that were for that particular set of options.</p>
<p>Readers of a special-purpose function will find it much easier to understand what it does.</p>
<p>(Note that this is only the right approach if you control all the callers of the function. If you function is part of a public API, then the reasoning here doesn’t apply because you don’t know what all the usecases are or will be.)</p>
<h2 id="dont-prematurely-optimize">Don’t prematurely optimize</h2>
<p>Race cars go faster than normal cars, but at the expense of having hard seats, making lots of noise, and lacking A/C. If you don’t know that your function is going to need to be a race car, don’t strip out the A/C yet. Leave the creature comforts in - focus on writing code that is easy for humans to read instead of easy for computers to run.</p>
<p>The same is true about premature generalization. You wouldn’t buy a dump truck if you don’t need to haul huge loads of things, so you also shouldn’t make your code able to serve all kinds of needs that may never happen.</p>

<p>The Super Bowl is this weekend, and you know what that means: Superb Owl! and Sportsball! memes galore. But I noticed that many of my friends who mock the sport also love strategy games like Magic the Gathering, Starcraft, or 7 Wonders — and thus I know they can appreciate a well-designed game.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://thesportsarchives.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/playbook.jpg?resize=480%2C398" alt="Image result for football strategy" width="480" height="398" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://thesportsarchives.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/playbook.jpg?resize=480%2C398&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>There are plenty of reasons to criticize the NFL: a hypocritical position on brutal hits, stinginess in paying the refs, the exploitation of unpaid college athletes, and of course the (somewhat improving) issue of concussions and player safety.</p>



<p>But for my fellow nerds, here are some elements of the National Football League that you can look at on a strategic game-design level and say “Ok, that’s actually really cool.”</p>



<hr>



<h2>Nine? Elements of Football that Reflect Good Strategic Game Design</h2>



<h3>Resource Management:</h3>



<p>Like most good games, a key component is making smart decisions about where to invest your resources.</p>



<h4>Money: </h4>



<p>In the NFL, the collective bargaining agreement between owners and the players’ union sets a salary cap to set a maximum (and minimum) that teams can spend each year.</p>



<p>Would you want to pay premium for a star or spread that salary around and upgrade more positions? It might depend on synergies with the rest of your roster. (Or you can get lucky with a player like Tom Brady who takes less money than his market value so his team can surround him with more talent.)</p>



<p>Rookies, as unproven quantities, are typically signed on a very affordable contract for their first few years, whereas established veterans can be much pricier. Teams are faced with the question of where they can afford to have uncertainty on their roster — contenders rarely want to risk an unproven player at quarterback, while teams that are a bit further away can take that gamble.</p>



<h4>Time / (Plus Good Catch-up Mechanics):</h4>



<p>In any game, there’s incentive for the person losing to resort to riskier higher-variance strategies. In football, that’s passing plays, which have a chance of gaining a lot of yards or not being caught at all. A neat aspect of football is that incomplete passes can stop the clock.</p>



<p>When a team is behind, time is one of the most precious resources it has, so this means the game is structured to give them every opportunity to claw their way back. Deciding when to burn time (and time-outs) is cruicial, and something even the best coaches struggle to do well.</p>



<h4>Energy Level in Game:</h4>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.profootballhof.com/assets/1/19/AP_17268774082780.jpg?w=200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image result for football huddle" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.profootballhof.com/assets/1/19/AP_17268774082780.jpg?w=200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>This is a minor point, but one I found really neat: Playing defense tends to be more exhausting than playing offense. If an offense can run many plays in rapid succession without huddling up or substituting — and thus prevent the defense from substituting in fresh players as well — they can gain an edge over an increasingly-tired defense.</p>



<h3>Synergies Between Players and Schemes</h3>



<h4>Building a roster</h4>



<p>Of course, the downside of this kind of “Hurry up offense” is that the offense is also stuck with the same players on the field and doesn’t have as much time for coaches to call the next play. Teams that want to use more hurry-up offense may need to hire versatile players who can be counted on to run many types of play, and an experienced quarterback who can make smart changes on the fly.</p>



<p>Since players have unique skill sets, teams need to build around who’s coming out of college and who they can afford to sign. Just like putting together a Magic the Gathering or Netrunner deck to find and build on synergies, Football has fantastic interplay between skills, style, and strategy.</p>



<p>Finding a generational talent like Detroit’s ultra-elusive running back Barry Sanders opens up a host of new options for a team. The Detroit Lions never focused on their offensive linemen — who would try to clear the way for him — because, frankly, Barry could succeed without them. (Until he got fed up and retired early, which is a story of its own.)</p>



<p>If a team has a quarterback with pinpoint accuracy but a weak arm, paying for blazing fast wide receivers to race down the field and catch deep passes doesn’t make as much sense as signing shifty and precise route-runners. However, to make good use of a quarterback with a cannon-arm, fast receivers aren’t enough — he needs strong offensive linemen to protect him and give him time to throw.</p>



<p>There are countless interactions between strategic decisions and I love it.</p>



<h3>Strategic Structural Asymmetries</h3>



<h4>Stadiums and Cities Matter</h4>



<div><p>Even the stadium and climate in a city factor into a football team’s strategy.</p><p>Because it’s considered more difficult to pass the ball in cold and windy weather, teams in the frigid Northern divisions are more likely to focus on building a running attack and a defense that can stop the other team from running successfully. As winter approaches, they can count on the environment to limit the passing game.</p></div>



<div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/octanecdn.com/roofitforwardcom/B613E8A56F6C8DF5015D88C9634BC66C.jpg?w=350&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image result for nfl retractable roofs" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/octanecdn.com/roofitforwardcom/B613E8A56F6C8DF5015D88C9634BC66C.jpg?w=350&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>However, roughly a third of teams play in indoor stadiums — eliminating the weather and the wind to make passing strategies more effective. Since half a team’s games are played at home, it has disproportionate impact on how they want to build a roster. A few stadiums even have retractable roofs, which let them decide whether to allow the elements to impact the game!</p>



<h4>Leveraged Division Structure</h4>



<p>An NFL division is comprised of four teams who play each other twice every season. The team in each division with the best record is guaranteed a spot in the playoffs. (Even if NONE of the teams were very good – the Washington Football Team made the playoffs this year despite losing more than half their games!)</p>



<p>This makes it even more crucial to plan how to counter division opponents’ schemes, and those rivalry games are usually close and exciting.</p>



<p>If an opposing team in your division has exceptionally tall, strong receivers you can’t afford to be caught assigning small cornerbacks to guard them. You’d need to keep that in mind when building a roster.</p>



<h3>Well Designed Scoring System</h3>



<h4>Intermittent Scoring to Build Excitement Throughout</h4>



<p>In the NBA, a jaw-dropping feat of athleticism… gets 2 or 3 points. Since teams average over 100 points a game, there’s a limit to how impactful any one play can be until the last minutes of a game.</p>



<p>On the other end of the spectrum, each score in soccer is rare and thus hugely important. Unfortunately, goals are so infrequent that historically, over 30% of English league games end with neither team scoring more than once. Those rare goals are dramatic, but personally I find it difficult to get excited about the intervening dribbling and passing when I know it’s very unlikely to shape the final result.</p>



<p>It’s a tradeoff, and football’s rules situate it nicely between these extremes. There are typically around 8 scoring plays each NFL game, and even the non-scoring plays are impactful (see below).</p>



<h4>Building Progress / Tension</h4>



<p>Getting a player on base in baseball or softball, winning a game or a set in tennis’ Game/Set/Match structure, or defeating a video game monster and getting to heal at a save point — these smaller discrete goals build toward the larger one.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i2.wp.com/static01.nyt.com/images/2009/01/01/sports/01chains.1.600.jpg?w=350&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image result for first down" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/static01.nyt.com/images/2009/01/01/sports/01chains.1.600.jpg?w=350&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>Football is designed to have two key ways to make non-scoring plays significant. First, teams are only given four chances (downs) to score before they turn the ball over to the other team — but the count is reset every time they gain another 10 yards. Every third-down and fourth-down opportunity has more importance because it’s approaching that impactful mini-goal, breathing more life into a drive.</p>



<p>But even without this ratcheting structure, non-scoring progress matters because field position is a ‘stateful’ element which persists from one play to the next. Where one play ends, the next one begins. Every yard one team moves forward is an extra yard the opponents will need to win back. It’s a tug-of-war with scoring opportunities on the line at any time.</p>



<h3>“Legacy” Narratives</h3>



<p>Legacy games are all the rage, and for good reason. (Our country even decided to LARP a game of Pandemic Legacy!)</p>



<p>The fact that players, teams, and coaches have storylines, rivalries, and arcs is a big part of the human element to football. We’re watching some of the legends of their craft face off each week, with history between them and human motivations.</p>



<p>On Sunday, we get to watch completely different quarterbacks compete: young phenom Patrick Mahomes against the unaging Tom Brady. Mahomes, who won last year, is widely considered one of the best in the league despite being only 25. In contrast, Brady is 43 and amazingly this is his <em>tenth</em> Super Bowl appearance. He’s been playing at an elite level for decades, and he won his first Super Bowl in 2002 — when Mahomes was 6.</p>



<p>Most of Brady’s 20 years were spent under coach Bill Belichick, known for being brilliant and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2018/10/10/17961082/chiefs-patriots-bill-belichick-press-conference-hyped" target="_blank">famously taciturn</a>. (Unless, of course, you ask him about the history and minutia of football kicking rules, which makes him light up and talk for ages.) However, last year Brady decided to leave Belichick and the New England Patriots, so people were wondering whether he could succeed with a different coach. He’s answered those questions in dramatic fashion. </p>



<p>When storylines carry over from campaign to campaign or season to season, it’s a great way to build long narratives of meaning and importance.</p>



<hr>



<p>Whether or not you enjoy watching the sport, there’s a lot it does well from a design perspective and I recommend anyone who enjoys strategy to try playing some of the Madden video games — how I initially got excited about the game.</p>

Even if you have no machine learning experience, you can start with some of the simpler tools and expand from there. Use AI photo editing tools like Deep Art, an AI art generator like Deep Dream Generator, an AI image generator like Artbreeder (a.k.a. GANBreeder), an AI painting generator like AI Painter, a AI cartoon maker like Cartoonify, or draw with a neural network using Quick Draw. As tools to make AI art become more mainstream, AI artworks will increasingly embed themselves in our culture. We’re already seeing it in pop album covers, gracing traditional art gallery walls, within digital and pixel art, and expanding our notion of computer generated art. By mastering the tools to create AI generated art, and creating works while this field is in its infancy, you can help push the boundaries of human creativity forward. How will your neural network and AI experiments transform our creative potential? Join our exploration of machine learning art, and show us by leading the way!</p></div></div></div>]]>

      <h4>A look at trends from 100 weeks of AI news, and AI-generated AI news snippets!</h4>
      
      </div><div>
      <p>With this week’s “Last Week in AI,” Skynet Today has just released its 100th edition of <a href="https://lastweekin.ai/">our weekly newsletter summarizing each week’s major AI news</a>! 
That’s almost 2 years of covering the developments in AI, sifting through the often noisy AI news landscape for important trends, while highlighting potential hypes and concerns.</p>

<p>To commemorate this occasion, we’re publishing a few notable statistics on these past 100 weeks.
And, for fun, we’ve fine-tuned a GPT-2 model on all the AI news articles we’ve covered so far to generate a few AI news snippets.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-ai-news-trends-across-100-weeks">Weekly AI News Trends across 100 weeks</h2>

<figure>
 <img src="https://www.skynettoday.com/assets/img/digests/100_analysis/article_count.png" alt="Article Count">
  <figcaption>
    The number of articles per newsletter increased after mid-2019 when we adopted a more automated pipeline for collecting and filtering AI news articles.

<figure>
 <img src="https://www.skynettoday.com/assets/img/digests/100_analysis/keyword_trends_cumulative_ai_topics.png" alt="AI Topics">
  <figcaption>
    It seems like at least for the articles we collect, ones related to "robots" grew much faster than other areas.
    Note: keyword trends also count related terms - for example, "hardware" also counts mentions of "GPU"

  <figcaption>
    After late 2019, articles regarding facial recognition grew much faster than others, with Covid-19 articles making a sudden entrance starting early 2020.
    Articles regarding Deep Fakes also saw a sudden jump starting mid-2019.

  <figcaption>
    Perhaps unsurprisingly, Google dominates the AI news cycle in terms of mentions of institution names.
    In distant seconds are the other tech giants of Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft.

  <figcaption>
    Sentiment analysis of article summaries across various topics has some expected but neat results; some AI applications, such as art, have mostly positive coverage, while others such as surveillance have generally negative coverage.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="ai-generated-ai-news-articles">AI-Generated AI News Articles</h2>

<p>We finetuned a GPT-2 model on the AI articles we linked throughout our newsletters to generate the follow AI news snippets.
While they’re written in the style of AI news, mentioning the appropriate keywords and phrases, they’re generally logically inconsistent and contain obvious factual errors.
For example, the first snippet mentions a researcher by the name of Atushi Sakamoto.
While this name does belong to a real researcher, in real life he is a Professor of Integrated Life Sciences at Hiroshima University, not someone studying AI at the University of Tokyo.
This is unsurprising given how these models work (see <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/briefs/gpt2">here</a>, <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/editorials/humans-not-concentrating">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.skynettoday.com/briefs/gpt3">here</a>).</p>

<p>But, reading these generated snippets can still be an interesting experience - some are as bad as others are hilarious:</p>

    <h5> Researchers develop a traffic light for self-driving cars </h5> 
    <p><q>
    A pair of new papers from University of Tokyo Institute of Technology researchers and the World Health Organization claim to have addressed one of the great challenges of artificial intelligence: traffic lights. Thanks to machine learning, they can illuminate traffic for much more effective and safer operation than they could on paper. In research authored by Atsushi Sakamoto and colleagues at the Institute of Intelligent Systems and Decision Support in Tokyo, the team presents an efficient way to turn traffic lights on and off. In practice, however, identifying and setting the timing for lighting within a traffic space can prove difficult, as it’s often unpredictable and there may even be visual clues that indicate the start of a car ahead or the end of a short one. Sakamoto and colleagues came up with an efficiency-enabling solution based on approaches developed by researchers at Google, IBM, and Toyota.

    <h5> How I used NLP's GPT-3 to write the AI I Created </h5>
    <p><q>
    When it comes to creating AI, there are 2 main choices I have:- write a clean code or- just use the output from the original app to clean code. Either way, there are a lot of good articles and code examples on arxiv.com.The reason I choose the latter is both lovely and surprising: with a solid foundation of 30 lines of code (more on that later), this way of creating and using AI is fairly simple. I wanted a clean, sharp and concise writing experience that would let my coworkers and I take on difficult creative problems with clear writing. What I didn't expect was for the first part of the code to become a bottleneck, exposing the messiness of the AI. The second reason may be more complex: I was writing this sentence while driving, and as I was about to cross the street, I accidentally sent the car driving by on the bright day and ended up writing another code to keep driving. Despite its simplicity, the problem with GPT-3 is its inability to generate long sequences.

    <h5> AI researchers propose making chatbots and voice assistants more like their real-world peers </h5>
    <p><q> 
    Chatbots, which are a form of virtual personas, have long been the interface between human and machine. Advances in the past few years have democratized voice assistants, responding to the needs of multiple speakers at once, aiming to reduce set times and improve duration. But much of the field has proven difficult to apply conversational AI effectively in the real world, especially on sensitive tasks involving such as sales or customer service.To address this issue, a team from MIT Technology Review (MIT Tech Review) and Beijing-based research institute Beijing Brain Institute have developed a novel approach to training conversational AI systems on a dataset of short conversations over long periods of time. The researchers developed a chatbot named QUEBO after their lab name, which stands for QUEBO, "Quō-" or "QUE-BO." They say the research will serve as a benchmark to benchmark conversational AI’s capability to handle small conveniences like social media conversations in real time.

    <h5> Amazon to Retrain a Third of Its U.S. Workers as Automation Advances </h5>
    <p><q>
    So far, the American workforce has been largely in workers of color. But Amazon is about to ramp up hiring of some of its more 200,000 hourly workers, according to a person familiar with the company’s plans. The new hires won’t be those in the same field as its more self-professed “white-collar workers,” as the company abbreviates its growing staff. Instead, the roughly 1,000 new workers will be drawn from two large and multiracial groups: Amazon has laid off thousands of Black and Latinx workers, has laid off dozens of Latinx employees, and is currently seeking Federal Employment Development money to pay for new workers. “Right now, the numbers of Black, Latinx, and African American workers are shrinking, because there’s still not enough talent available to continue these high-volume, high-pressure work,” the person familiar with Amazon’s plans explained. Amazon declined to comment on the more than 1,000 new positions it plans to employ.

    <h5> Meet Microsoft's first AI-powered coffee machine </h5>
    <p><q>
    Jeff Dean, chair of Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) division, recently sat down with WIRED senior writer Will Knight to discuss the value of building products that do a lot of good, but don’t always do much of anything else. Dean tells WIRED that he thinks we’ll all need to find some sort of “general purpose product” — a conceptual mashup of software and hardware that completely reimagines the capabilities of a specific computer (or, more generally, a business) in order to tackle one task. It’ll probably require buy-in from product builders, analyst agnostics, human resources departments, call centers, product managers, and a few other well-intentioned minds, but Microsoft has a pretty good shot at that right now. Dean tells WIRED that while there’s certainly value in building product companies that “do something interesting,” they also need to do it in a way that can tackle customer needs.

            <p>Very interesting topic, isn't it? Many copies are broken, many different assumptions and reasoning. However, I have a printer ( <b>Epson l800</b>) worked out a huge resource (about <b>18 liters of ink</b>&nbsp; for almost 5 years). What is depressurization, I did not know. Although I am, in general, an ordinary user. Above the printer did not shake, prints, and okay. But, of course, sometimes he smeared some kind of oil from a spray, forgive me for such words :)</p>
<p>Cleansing launched with or without. He didn’t do deep, and he made sure that the ink crane was constantly open. In periods without printing, I wrapped it in a garbage bag for 120 liters (from dust). And in this form, he stood in the offseason. Some movements were made halfway along the path, I will write about this in detail in the next review.</p>
<p>Where did it all go? One of the readers of my site wrote to me that in the west there are no 6-color models with CISS. All officially announced four-color models. Malaysian and Indian models sold on Amazon are not taken into account. Of course, I am not a connoisseur of the European and American market, but a superficial search really did not reveal 6-color models.</p>
<p>Further seditious assumption was made: 4-color models are more reliable, because there are other inks. The thought is definitely not for the faint of heart. I have always considered the original 6-flower ink to be a very good product. Excellent color, good light fastness. But what can I say, to all who do not print much, I always advise original ink.</p>
<p>But the correspondent was very eloquent in his arguments (but he climbed through - he is a Siberian, they are persistent!). And actually, after a while, a thought popped into my head: who said that Epson is doing super-ink, especially for emerging markets?</p>
<p>All the information described below is a fantastic work of art about parallel universes, and has nothing to do with Seiko Epson Corporation.</p>
<h3>Epigraph:</h3>
<p>For every sage, quite simplicity. Now I understand that any crazy idea can lead to interesting results. And what you will do with these results is completely incomprehensible. If the experiment was originally intended for lighting, then of course, I would scan and photograph everything that was possible. And so, it was a brawl, for fun. Everything that was interesting was photographed by himself, that he did not, alas, have to take a word.</p>
<p>Again, I do not pursue the goal of exposing the evil bourgeoisie who staged a world conspiracy. Just for people with a brain, I think the published information will be useful, regardless of whether they agree with it or not.</p>
<p>If you throw back the heads, clogged with all kinds of incomprehensible ink, and another huge layer of GHGs killed while trying to reanimate 1-2 nozzles, then there are only two external signs of death of modern GHGs.</p>
<p><b>Death of PG No. 1</b>&nbsp; - This is very popular on the L800 and is called "head depressurization." <br><b>Death of PG No. 2</b>&nbsp; - It is very popular on expensive wide-format pigment devices from Epson Corporation. The story is usually very banal, everything was printed fine in the evening, in the morning there is no whole color channel.</p>
<p>So for starters, the popular question is: why does the printhead depressurize? The answer is simple, the “nozzle” plate is peeled off from the elements of the ink channels. More precisely, it does not completely peel off, but the sealant is torn. Next, the ink seeps into each other. The most classic case for the L800 is a mixture of cyan and manzhents.</p>
<p><b>The first symptoms of depressurization</b></p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/l800.ru/18/duz1.jpg" width="100%"></p><p><b>Progressive Depressurization</b></p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/l800.ru/18/duz2.jpg" width="100%"></p><p>There are many assumptions: a very powerful pump, bad dampers, etc. But here are very very few votes, what can just the original ink does not fit? After all, the print head was not specifically developed for the L800.</p>
<p>Hooked the cans on the side and voila. Sales are growing, the percentage of defects under the guarantee is sane. And how many carcasses of printers lies in closets, this is sorry, not our Japanese business :)</p>
<p>This would happen to one of the alternative ink suppliers, would instantly fly out of the market. And then the company, you can’t argue, can’t it be better? Again, with models in 4 colors, even in Russia there is no such a massive percentage of marriage. And by the way, they have a larger guarantee, and the claimed resource, although the print head is clearly simpler.</p>
<p>I will try to model the process of peeling off the nozzle plate on my fingers using a simple everyday example. <br> It is easy to draw an analogy with some brands of glue for thermo-pistols, it is glued so that the figs are torn off, but a drop of alcohol is enough, and the whole adhesive seam just bounces off the part with a bang. Is there a similar process in the bowels of the printheads?</p>
<p>Correspondence with the Siberian sluggishly lasted more than six months, I have my own work. Well, there’s no time to do tests at all. But as always the case helped, they presented me to the murdered l800, I don’t know what was poured into it (most likely intek), but half of the nozzles were missing. He died in the office, due to standing on the window in the sun without work for a year. Forgotten about him corny. After washing, only the extreme canals fully came to life, but that was enough. After that, the idea arose to conduct testing.</p>
<h3>Why do you need this?</h3>
<p>The answer is simple, I want to get a wider Epson. Their prices have become not humane, but by reliability a lot of negativity in the network. Before spending his hard-earned money with many zeros, I decided to understand the issue more thoroughly.</p>
<p>For inexpensive, cyan was purchased from the L800 - it was poured into a living extreme channel. In the next one, as I was spending it, everything I had was: DCTEC (it was generally like shoe polish - they changed the party, which started flakes in the cold) and revolutions. In all other colors (capacities), a yellow disitek was poured, there were a lot of it :)</p>
<p>The test consisted in the fact that when I was not lazy, I ran a script that printed test pages from these two channels. Type 20 sheets A4 and cleaning in line. And so in a circle, printing in RPM mode matte paper. The paper was clearly inserted into the usual most deshmansky ala maiden.</p>
<p>Well, the result was not long in coming. After about 4 months and 5 vials of the original, the head lost its tightness between the channels.</p>
<p>I understand perfectly that the test is not complete, not clean, etc. But from the moment of depressurization of the GHG everything was shot from me. Dismantling the PG - it was interesting to me, I photographed everything. I think you will not find such detailed photos. On the Internet, a lot of nonsense is written about the printheads for Epson, many do not even understand in detail how they work. I wanted to close this question for myself once and for all.</p>
<p>PG from Epson L800</p>

<p>Remove the seal on the ink channels</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/l800.ru/18/p03s.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>In this form, clean the GHG with especially severe blockages</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/l800.ru/18/p04s.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>We firmly throw off the connector board</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/l800.ru/18/p05s.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>As you can see, nozzles work in pairs on colors, i.e. 6 colors and 3 boards with piezo elements.</p>
<p>Remove the nozzle plate</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/l800.ru/18/p22s.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>It is useless to look for traces of sealant or something else on this plate, after a drop of washing and rubbing it is cleaned to a shine without any signs of ink exposure. By the way, traces of old ink were very well absorbed and did not wash off when washing the GHG. After rubbing the plate with his finger, it became a mirror. So that “hydrocephalus” is even “silly” with annual downtime. Those. the colors used to print the tests were washed with warm water, and what was before clogging was not removed without mechanical action.</p>
<p>Remove the nozzle plate</p>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/l800.ru/18/p29s.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>The front plate is made of a non-magnetic alloy, on the one hand there is clearly some kind of yellow spraying. On the other hand, under normal lighting, it looks like a stainless steel. But I clearly fell into a yellow tint, I did not want to change the light to normal, it was filmed as is. If you look closely at the foreground, ink traces are visible. But the color of the plate on the PG side is metallic.</p>
<p>GHG inspection</p>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/l800.ru/18/p06s.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>To go nuts, the membrane of the piezoelectric elements is eaten up like acid, of course, I touched it a little when I removed the plate, my hands are still crooked: (But look at the next frame.</p>
<p>GHG inspection</p>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/l800.ru/18/p08s.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>I took a toothpick and began to poke hard on the membrane in adjacent channels. Everything is normal, dense and very soft material (similar to silicone), it is difficult to break through. And in the extreme I just touched how the ashes all crumbled. Well I do not know. If I drove off the acid, and then the original ink, and not a long period of time. By the way, in this shot it was possible to select a wavelength well, and the sealant began to “phosphorize” in white. No obvious violations are visible anywhere.</p>

<p>I show large channels of ink approach to nozzles, for those who have not yet understood these thin ribs of adjacent channels are glued with sealant (it was possible to highlight it well), the rib thickness is probably about 0.1 mm. And any violation of tightness will cause a violation of normal operation, at least kosostruy with the mutual influence of nozzles of different colors on each other. And in the worst case, a mixture of different colors. The sealant is tricky, more like glass, or polymerized UV glue, very hard, and a very thin layer, I think the thickness is only a few microns. I did not see any signs of separation from the GHG base between the channels. Most likely, the “snapping” of the adhesive layer occurs, as in the case with hot-melt adhesive. Although I tried to soak a couple more goals in solvent, acetone, etc. I was not able to dissolve this sealant. The front plate sat like a glove.</p>

<p>Annual reports are part and parcel of every public company’s life. It is a document that the public corporations must provide annually to shareholders that describes their operations and financial conditions. In the U.S., companies typically file the Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
One fine day, as I was following the internet rathole, I landed myself on the Netflix investor page for some reason. One thing to understand about these 10-K forms is that these are …. pretty basic. Imagine being transported back in time from the current beautifully designed web interfaces back to a text-based interface. This is what I was dealing with, and all the reports looked like these fine specimens from Facebook and Amazon.</p>

<p><strong>Then 2002 happened!</strong></p>

<p>I landed on an Annual Report unlike any I had seen before. And it was not just the 2002 Annual Report - <em>the reports from 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 were similar</em>! <strong>Somebody had actually put a lot of time into designing these</strong> ‼️</p>
<p>Here are my favorite examples.</p>

<p>What I love about this report is the play on introducing the report as an opening sequence of a movie.</p>

<p>2003 report begins with a <em>Netflix-DVD-in-the-mail</em> envelope design - very on-brand! It then plays on movie titles like Edward Scissorhands to explain benefits and features. Then, it ends with an infographic that makes it very easy to digest the annual numbers.</p>

<p>The 2004 report continues the tradition of a grand opening. It then uses direct integrations with famous movie characters like Spiderman, Austin Powers, and Frankenstein. This is my favorite report!</p>

<p>For the 2005 report, the focus seems to have been on the subscribers. I’m not sure if the profile pics are of the subscribers to Netflix at the time, but it’s very likely.
The now-defunct star-based rating system shows up as a way to represent horizontal bar charts. Somebody really put some serious thought into this design!</p>

<p>2006 is the first year when the design was toned down and only a couple of pages worth calling out. This report’s theme seems to be the mailbox and a mailbox bar chart that I can only describe as “atrocious.” What are they trying to do with the shadows? 🧐👀</p>

<p>2007, 2008, and 2009 are basically clones of each other. The design has been reduced to bare bones with only a couple of “designed” pages before the 10-K form. There are only a few pages worth calling out, but at least the bar charts are sensible and easily readable. 🎉</p>

<p>From 2010 onwards, we’re basically back to the SEC template without any “designed” pages. Not sure what happened to the design team in 2010. 🤷</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
The aim of the following piece is simply to share some interesting accounts of the tin-trade in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, particularly one written in Arabic and another in Persian. Taken together, these two accounts suggest that tin from southwestern England (<i>i.e.&nbsp;</i>Cornwall and Devon) was exported via southern France to both Egypt and ultimately Iran in this period, with it being used by potters in the latter area to make tin-opacified ceramic glazes.</p><div><div><p>The first account to be considered here is a short but intriguing section from the early fourteenth-century&nbsp;<i>Taqwīm al-buldān</i>, 'Survey of the countries' (1321), of Abū l-Fidāʾ, a Syrian prince of the Ayyūbid family, which offers both a general description of England and a short but intriguing section detailing the export of tin from England to Alexandria, Egypt, via southern France. The section that deals generally with England is explicitly derived from the earlier work of&nbsp;Ibn Saʿīd al-Maghribī, who was born born near Granada in 1213, lived for a time in Egypt, and died in 1286, and runs as follows:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>And the islands of Britain are eleven islands. Of the famous islands is the island of England (<i>Inkiltarah</i>). Ibn Saʿīd said: And the ruler of this island is called <i>al-Inkitār</i> in the <i>History of Salāḥ&nbsp;ad-Dīn (Saladin) in the wars of ʿAkkā (Acre)</i>. His capital in this island is the city of <i>Lundras </i>(London). He continued: And the length of this island from south to north, with a slight inclination, is 430 miles. Its width in the middle is about 200 miles. He continued: <b>And in this island are mines of gold, silver, copper, and tin</b>. There are no vines because of the sharpness of the frost. <b>Its inhabitants bring the precious metals of these mines to the land of France, and exchange them for wine.</b> The ruler of France has plentiful gold and silver from that source. In their country (sc. England) is made the fine scarlet wool of their sheep, which is fine like silk. They place coverings over the animals, to protect them from rain, sun, and dust. In spite of the wealth of <i>al-Inkitār</i> and the extent of his kingdom, he admits the sovereignty of <i>al-Farans</i><i>īs</i>&nbsp;(the French king), and when there is an assembly, he performs his service by presenting before (the ruler of France) a vessel of food, by ancient custom.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn1">1</a>)</p></blockquote><p>The mention here of mines that produce tin is noteworthy. The tenth-century Persian <i>Ḥudūd al-ʿĀlam</i>, written for a prince of Gūzgan in northern Afghanistan in <i>c.&nbsp;</i>982, intriguingly describes Britain as an 'emporium' (<i>bārgāh</i>) of Spain (<i>Andalus</i>) and also makes mention of 'numerous mountains, rivers, villages, and different mines' in Britain, but doesn't specify the nature of these mines, unlike Ibn Saʿīd and Abū l-Fidāʾ.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn2">2</a>) Interestingly, the above description of the specific characteristics of the mines of England seems to have been picked up fairly rapidly by other authors aside from Abū l-Fidāʾ. For example, its influence can be seen in the&nbsp;<i>Jāmiʿ al-tawārīkh</i> of Rashīd al-Dīn (completed in&nbsp;Īlkhānate-era Iran,&nbsp;<i>c.</i>&nbsp;1307–16), and in Banākatī's derivative&nbsp;<i>Rawżat ūli’l-albāb</i>,&nbsp;written in 1317 at Banākaṯ, Transoxiana (in present-day Tajikistan, Central Asia), although their description is expanded slightly to say that in <i>Anglater</i>—England—there are 'many remarkable mountains, innumerable mines of gold, silver, copper, tin, and iron, and different kinds of fruit.'(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn3">3</a>)&nbsp;</p><p>After the above general description of England, Abū l-Fidāʾ offers brief discussions of Ireland and of another Atlantic island where gyrfalcons and polar bears are said to be found (the former reportedly being popular with the Sultan of Egypt and the latter being said to have skin that is soft to the touch). Later on, however, he returns to the question of the export of metals from England when discussing Toulouse, France, in another section that is explicitly derived from the work of Ibn Saʿīd al-Maghribī:</p><blockquote><p>Ibn Said said: And to the east of Bordeaux is the city of Toulouse... The river (sc. Garonne) is south of it, and ships from the Encircling Ocean ascend it, with tin and copper, which they bring from the island of England and the island of Ireland. It is carried on pack-animals to Narbonne, and taken from there on the ships of the Franks to Alexandria.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn4">4</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Needless to say, this statement is undoubtedly interesting, offering, as it does, good evidence for the long-distance export of tin from southwestern England during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The first half of the route described here is certainly an ancient one, bearing a striking similarity to the tin route described by Diodorus Siculus in the first century BC (probably drawing on the lost account of Pytheas, a fourth-century BC traveller from Marseille). He says that those who dwell in southwestern Britain 'work the tin into pieces' and sell it to merchants who 'carry it from there across the Straits of Galatia or Gaul; and finally, making their way on foot through Gaul for some thirty days, they bring their wares on horseback to the mouth of the river Rhone'. Although the route described by the above Arabic account is slightly more detailed than that recorded by Diodorus, and obviously has an additional stage from France to Egypt, the coincidence is notable, and a find of a sixth-century cruciform brooch from eastern England in south-eastern France near to Castelnaudary, Aude (about midway along the route from Toulouse to the Mediterranean), arguably offers some confirmation that the same overland route from England to the Mediterranean was indeed in use in the intervening period too.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn5">5</a>)</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LA9ShHsnFc8/X8AbV7cybxI/AAAAAAADMBg/VR4mW-G9pEA_OTBQhJZpo5bDgwkm8meAgCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/14thC-Persian-tin-Jug-large.jpg"><img data-original-height="597" data-original-width="500" height="478" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jSQfeF5o0L8/X8AbVPJ2gwI/AAAAAAADMBc/jB-Be7EM_08qt5oLNuogahanX57kC3IYwCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/14thC-Persian-tin-Jug-500.jpg" width="400"></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>A fourteenth-century, tin-glazed jug decorated with lustre and cobalt, made at Ray, Iran, and now in the Royal Cornwall Museum, Truro; click the image for a larger view (image: Caitlin Green).<br></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The second, Persian account of the medieval tin trade is less specific about the source of the tin than this, but is nonetheless important. In particular, it offers us some idea of where a portion, at least, of the tin from southwestern England was transported to after it reached thirteenth-/fourteenth-century Egypt, as well as the purposes to which it might be put. The account itself is from a treatise on ceramics by Abū l-Qāsim Qāshānī of Kashan, Iran, that was written in <i>c.</i>&nbsp;1300–01, based on the date of the earliest, autograph manuscript. This treatise mentions the importation of tin to Iran from Western Europe or <i>Farangistān</i>, a name strictly meaning the land of the Franks (the French) that was applied generally to Western Europe north of the Iberian Peninsula:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The vessels, ingredients and materials which serve as raw materials for these people [manufacturers of tiles and other ceramic objects] are many... One of these is the form of tin called <i>raṣāṣ</i>. <u>Its mines are known in many places. The first is that from Farangistān.</u> In Farangistān it is cast in the form of pieces and stamped with a Farangī stamp <u>as prevention against adulteration</u>...(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn6">6</a>)</p></blockquote><p>The account then goes on to list two other sources of tin, one to the north of Iran (in the middle Volga area of modern Russia) and another to the east in 'China' (possibly Malaysia), before including details on how such tin could be used in the making of white and turquoise ceramic glazes.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn7">7</a>) Suffice to say, in the present context this account is of considerable interest. The tin from&nbsp;<i>Farangistān</i>&nbsp;mentioned here must have almost certainly originated in southwestern England, based on both what we know of tin production in this era and the above Arabic account of Abū l-Fidāʾ/Ibn Saʿīd al-Maghribī, with its reference to French merchants transporting English tin to Alexandria. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the tin from the middle Volga in Russia may also have ultimately come from England too, as there were no medieval native sources of tin in that region and tin does, in fact, seem to have been imported into Russia from England via Germany earlier in the medieval period.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn8">8</a>)&nbsp;</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9KT_vElMz1k/X8AcRscMyAI/AAAAAAADMB0/-tSBWeTbGMYi-3SWIDhx77h9oy7OzBvJQCLcBGAsYHQ/s2159/Two13thCBowlFrags-large.jpg"><img data-original-height="209" data-original-width="500" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UFD0U70naiA/X8AcRBf2k_I/AAAAAAADMBw/bE_2YVlhlkQTiUbO68Q_Jjw22whtXN5QgCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/Two13thCBowlFrags-500.jpg"></a></td></tr><tr><td><i>Two fragments of mina'i bowls probably made in the city of Kashan in the early thirteenth century, both featuring a tin-opacified glaze, now in the Royal Cornwall Museum, Truro; click the image for a larger view. The left bowl, TRURI 900.479, seems to show a young prince sitting cross-legged, whilst the right bowl, TRURI 900.478, shows a male equestrian figure (image: Caitlin Green).<br></i></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In consequence, it can be said that the two main accounts under consideration here seem, when taken together, to suggest that tin from Cornwall and Devon was very probably making its way across to Iran in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, where it was used to create tin-opacified white and turquoise ceramic glazes by manufacturers of pottery and tiles. In this context, it is worth observing that Cornish or Devonshire tin was definitely used for a similar purpose in sixteenth-century Italy, and&nbsp;Anna McSweeney has recently argued that it was probably used for making opaque ceramic glazes in medieval Iberia too.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn9">9</a>) So, for example, in 1417 a potter named Hacen Muça was paid by a French merchant from Montpellier, Joan Lorenç, in lead, tin and cobalt to undertake work that he was to deliver to the port of Valencia in two months, presumably using tin obtained by this French merchant from southwestern England, and in 1325 another contract specifies that the potter Mahomet Bensuleyman and another <i>saracen&nbsp;</i>from Manises, eastern Spain, would be paid in advance with lead and tin for the kiln loads that they were to supply.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn10">10</a>)&nbsp;</p><p>Whether earlier Islamic ceramics using tin-opacified glazes similarly depended on tin from southwestern England is a matter of speculation, but it is interesting to observe that the earliest such glazes seem to have their origins in Egypt in the eighth century AD, which is perhaps suggestive, given that tin seems to have been known as 'the Brittanic metal' in Egypt only a century earlier.(<a href="https://www.caitlingreen.org/2020/11/arabic-and-persian-accounts-of-cornish-tin-trade.html#fn11">11</a>) Finally, it should be noted that the tin imported into Iran from medieval England was almost certainly used for purposes other than the creation of ceramic …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div> <div> <div>  <p>Paul Graham has an <em>idée fixe</em> somewhere in the area of the Hacker as <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">solitary artist</a>, visionary, creative. I disbelieve anything PG says as a matter of principle. <a href="https://idlewords.com/2005/04/dabblers_and_blowhards.htm">Maciej</a> is a more reliable source when it comes to painting.</p> <p>And yet. Surely there is a fundamental creativity when it comes to <a href="https://blog.zdsmith.com/notes/programming.html">programming</a>.</p> <p>I experience inspiration, certainly, and the lack of it.</p> <p>I experience a degree of creative fulfillment comparable to what I get when I compose music or poetry.</p> <p>I experience aesthetic pleasure when I write good code, and use an aesthetic, intuitive sense to guide me in the code I write.</p> <p>So, it’s not a dead, mechanistic art.</p> <p>So let’s start with something that’s hard to dispute from Maciej:</p> <blockquote> <p>So just like mechanical engineers and architects, computer programmers create artifacts that have to stand up to an objective reality. No one cares how pretty the code is if the program won’t work.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thinking of mechanical engineers—or civil, really: did Isambard Kingdom Brunel design bridges for fun? That is, can we reasonably assume that Brunel ever designed a bridge because he felt like it, because he wanted to feel the pleasure of creation?</p> <p>Almost certainly, yes. If I were Isambard I can only assume I’d be sketching bridges all day.</p> <p>So then: did Brunel ever <em>build</em> bridges for fun?</p> <p>Almost certainly not. A bridge is an expensive, rather large undertaking, that requires a lot of other people to make things or maneuver those things into place. And once they’re their they tend to be relatively difficult to unmake.</p> <p>Maybe this points us in a smarter direction. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was, I must simply assume, an inherently, maybe even brilliantly, creative individual. The difference between <a href="https://blog.zdsmith.com/notes/programming.html">programming</a> and bridge-building—<em>one</em> difference between <a href="https://blog.zdsmith.com/notes/programming.html">programming</a> and bridge-building—is that the economics of <a href="https://blog.zdsmith.com/notes/programming.html">programming</a> allow for a practice of engineering as <em>pure</em> recreation and <em>pure</em> creation. The use of the artifact—how it exists in the world and the function it performs and maybe even the utility it grants others—is still fundamental. But this too can be realized from a purely creative perspective. When it comes to bridges, on the other hand, their nature is <em>also</em> inherently creative; it’s just that the economics of them and the rather ineluctable nature of constructed things to take up space and impede the presence of <em>other</em> things prevents them in all but the most extreme conditions from being purely so.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div></div>]]>

            <p>I was asked to give a toast in celebration of the 50th Anniversary of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">The Mother of All Demos</a> so I spent some time reflecting on Engelbart's work. </p>
<p>Most of the commentary on his work is focused on the technical achievements and the impressive feats of engineering that's genuinely 50 years ahead of its time. Just this week we, at Repl.it, we introduced Multiplayer -- the ability to code together with anyone in the world -- and although we have the benefits of modern tooling and infrastructure it was still hard work</p>
<p>A more interesting question to ask would be: "What's Douglas Englebart's generation function?" In other words, what ideas, themes, and philosophies that have inspired his groundbreaking work?</p>
<p>I didn't have much time to work with, so I had to go mostly of off memory -- this question requires a more in-depth examination. However, I've identified three themes that are worth studying. </p>
<h2 id="computers-as-mind-extenders">Computers as mind extenders</h2>
<p>Engelbart and his contemporaries saw computers as first and foremost tools for mind extension. Something we can use to augment our intellect to take on more and do more. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By augmenting human intellect we mean increasing the capability of man to approach complex problem situation to gain comprehension to suit his particular needs and to derive solutions to problems. Increased capability in this respect is taken to mean mixture of the following: more rapid comprehension, better comprehension, the possibility of gaining useful degree of comprehension in situation that previously was too complex, speedier solutions, better solutions and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble." -- <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/scanned/Doug_Engelbart-AugmentingHumanIntellect.pdf">Augmenting Human Intellect</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sits in stark contrast to today's computers as the driver for the attention economy. Where computers as seen as entertainment devices at best. A more cynical reading of the way governments and ad-based businesses use computers would lead you to believe they're devices of control.</p>
<h2 id="evolutionary-design">Evolutionary design</h2>
<p>To understand Engelbart it's important to not view him as a lone inventor genius a la Tesla that predicted what computers could do 50 years ahead of his time. In his own words you can see that they took a much more exciting approach to discovery:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're pursuing this monstrous goal by building and trying <em>empirically</em> -- we approach evolutionary-wise because we feel it's a whole system problem [...] it's much more than these computer tools"</p>
</blockquote>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/agdPQuFr0yg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h2 id="bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</h2>
<p>"Bootstrapping" is another recurring theme in Engelbart's work. I think of it as "increasing returns":</p>
<ul>
<li>You build tools, and then the tools you built helps you create better tools. </li>
<li>Tools make you smarter, and you make better tools that make you smarter... ad nauseam. </li>
<li>Tools increase productivity which makes us wealthier which in turn allows us to invest in more and better tools.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It's worth noting that what seemed to drive Engelbart was his concern for the unique challenges an exponentially changing world brings. He believed that <a href="https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/papers/scanned-original/2004-augment-133319-augmenting-society's-collective-iqs.pdf">"boosting Collective IQ"</a> is imperative for the flourishing of humanity.</p>
<p>In Silicon Valley, at least in my circles, there's a general feeling that we need to return to the thinking of computers as "bicycles for the mind." And I hope we do.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Figma and Dylan Field for inviting me to <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Figma-SF/events/cwsnhqyxqbmb/">reflect</a> on this awesome day.</em></p>
