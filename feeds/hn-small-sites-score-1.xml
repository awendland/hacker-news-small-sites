  <img src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2019-04-21-flute.jpg" alt="Pytest Flute" title="Pytest Flute">

  <p>I occasionally enjoy solving algorithmic problems, for example <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> or <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">The Advent of Code</a>.
I’ve been doing them since I was a pimply PHP-slinging teenager, competing with my peers across the UK in the British Informatics Olympiad.
It was terribly nerdy and terribly fun.</p>

<p>Algorithmic problems are often used in technical interviews, which I find less fun.
Strict deadlines stress me out.</p>

<p>In either case, using automated tests makes these problems way easier.
I wish I knew this earlier!</p>

<p>Online algorithmic platforms, such as <a href="https://codility.com/">Codility</a>, provide their own automated tests.
You use these for basic validation on some examples, but edge cases are sneakily reserved for final marking.
To ensure your solution covers all the bases, you need to write your own tests.</p>

<p>In Python, there’s no better test framework than <a href="https://pytest.org/">Pytest</a> - I use it on all my open source projects.
It makes it easy for you to add tests for any Python code.
And it’s much better than Python’s built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html"><code>unittest</code></a>.</p>

<p><code>unittest</code> is an old horse and cart, while <code>pytest</code> is the batmobile.</p>

<p><img src="https://adamj.eu/tech/assets/2019-04-21-pytest.png" alt="Pytest homepage"></p>

<h2 id="an-example">An Example</h2>

<p>Let’s look at a small problem together using Pytest.
Here’s the problem statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write a function <code>solve(items)</code> that takes <code>items</code>, a list of integers, and returns the smallest integer greater than 0 that appears in the list, or 0 if there is none.</p>

  <p>For example <code>solution([1, 2])</code> should return 1, and <code>solution([-1])</code> should return 0.</p>

  <p>The list <code>items</code> will contain up to 1,000,000 integers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, let’s write the most basic sketch of a <code>solve</code> function.
Since 0 is a default value to return, if we always return that we can score some easy points.
Create a file called <code>example.py</code> with the contents:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Let’s test the function manually by running it in the Python 3 interpreter. Open the command line and run the examples:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ python
Python 3.7.3 (default, Apr 14 2019, 21:08:36)
[Clang 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.3)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from example import solve
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve([1, 2])
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve([-1])
0</code></pre></figure>

<p>So we failed on the first example, but succeeded with the second.</p>

<p>Doing this each time we modify the code would get tiresome quickly.
We have to restart the interpreter, rerun the import and tests, and manually compare the outputs.
Writing automated tests now, before we’ve tried to solve the problem properly, makes the whole loop faster.
It also makes us think about all the cases up front.</p>

<p>Let’s write the tests and solve the problem with the <strong>Red, Green, Refactor</strong> pattern.</p>

<h3 id="red">Red</h3>

<p>First, let’s add tests that fail.</p>

<p>Pytest can work with tests in the same file as our code, as simple functions with names starting <code>test_</code>.
We use Python’s <code>assert</code> statement to compare the results of our code with our expectations.</p>

<p>Add tests for the two examples:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_example_1</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_example_2</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then install Pytest and run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ python -m pip install pytest

E        +  where 0 = solve([1, 2])

example.py:5: AssertionError
====================== 1 failed, 1 passed in 0.03 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>In the middle of the output, we see the tests in <code>example.py</code> running.
Pytest outputs an <code>F</code> for the failing test, and a dot <code>.</code> for the passing one.</p>

<p>The <code>FAILURES</code> section expands on the failure with the line that failed.
It then shows that <code>solve([1, 2])</code> returned <code>0</code> which doesn’t compare equal to the expected value <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>The tests we have are a start but they don’t cover all the cases.
We don’t have any lists that contain <code>0</code>.
Also two extremes are missing: the empty list and a list of 1,000,000 items.
Long lists could also contain lots of negative or positive integers, so we should try both of these.</p>

<p>Let’s add more tests.
We can make a list of 1,000,000 items in Python by multiplying a short list.
Add these tests at the end of the file:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>test_empty_list</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([])</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_list_with_zero</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>])</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_long_positive_list</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>250_000</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>1</span>


<span>def</span> <span>test_long_negative_list</span><span>():</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>solve</span><span>([</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>4</span><span>]</span> <span>*</span> <span>250_000</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Run them again:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">============================= test session starts ==============================

example.py:22: AssertionError
====================== 3 failed, 3 passed in 0.08 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>There are more failures - which is good!</p>

<h3 id="green">Green</h3>

<p>Now we can work to a solution that makes all the tests pass.
Replace <code>solve</code> with this first attempt:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>items</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>minimum</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>or</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>minimum</span><span>:</span>
            <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>minimum</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Re-run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">============================= test session starts ==============================
platform darwin -- Python 3.7.3, pytest-4.4.1, py-1.8.0, pluggy-0.9.0

=================================== FAILURES ===================================
________________________________ test_example_2 ________________________________

    def test_example_2():
&gt;       assert solve([-1]) == 0
E       assert -1 == 0
E        +  where -1 = solve([-1])

example.py:14: AssertionError
___________________________ test_long_negative_list ____________________________

    def test_long_negative_list():
&gt;       assert solve([-1, -2, -3, -4] * 250_000) == 0
E       assert -4 == 0
E        +  where -4 = solve(([-1, -2, -3, -4] * 250000))

example.py:30: AssertionError
====================== 2 failed, 4 passed in 0.17 seconds ======================</code></pre></figure>

<p>We have two different failures now.
It seems we have yet to ignore negative numbers, woops!</p>

<p>Modify the solution to do so, by adding the <code>i &gt; 0</code> condition:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>solve</span><span>(</span><span>items</span><span>):</span>
    <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>items</span><span>:</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>minimum</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>or</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>minimum</span><span>):</span>
            <span>minimum</span> <span>=</span> <span>i</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>minimum</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now re-run the tests:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="collected">def solve(items):
    return min((i for i in items if i &gt; 0), default=0)</code></pre></figure>

<p>Re-running the tests produces the same, all-passing output as above.
Yay, we got the code down to one line!</p>

As a teen, I often ate my feelings away, when I was bored or just generally snacking in front of the TV very late in the evening and ate way too big portions of food.</p><p>The reason why I started my weight loss journey was that I no longer felt happy for the reflection in the mirror and overall the way I looked. My weight started to have a negative effect on my life and my physique, I was tired of hating myself and my body and wanted to be able to love myself. I remembered I got tagged in a video on Instagram and I was surprised to see myself and I thought to myself " is that really how I look, is that the way people see me" and it made me sad.</p><p>Due to covid-19 I got fired from my job and at that time I thought to myself now is my chance to change the way I see myself and the way I look, so I contacted a personal trainer one of my friends had recommended and I started my Weight Loss Journey.<br></p><h3 id="how-was-it-in-the-beginning-and-what-were-the-biggest-obstacles-you-overcame">How was it in the beginning and what were the biggest obstacles you overcame?</h3><p>The first 2 weeks was the hardest, I had to get used to not eating as much as I used to and focusing on getting the right nutritions protein, and veggies, it's hard to break old habits and make new ones but as soon as I got over the two weeks mark, then for me, it started to feel natural and it was easier to incorporate in my daily life/ routine</p><h3 id="what-were-your-worst-mistakes">What were your worst mistakes?</h3><p>My worst mistake was thinking that I didn't do enough, that I didn't eat healthy enough, and that I didn't exercise enough at the beginning of my weight-loss journey. I pushed myself really hard and didn't get fast enough results in my opinion! because of that mentality and because of those thoughts I almost didn't go through with my weight-loss program, I lost my motivation real quick and quickly found out I had to change my mentality to be able to keep moving forward.</p><p>The biggest milestone for me was when my clothing started to feel loose around my body and when I could see the physical change. A good motivation boost was also when I could do more with the weights at my gym and when I could perform more and I didn't get out of breath within 5-minutes. It is often small things that motivate me the most, for example being able to squat a bit more than last time or being able to run a bit longer.</p><h3 id="what-area-of-life-has-changed-after-becoming-more-healthy">What area of life has changed after becoming more healthy?</h3><p>Because I'm being more active and healthy I feel like I have gotten more opportunities in life. I am no longer bound by my physique and I'm happier for my body, I like where I am and it has an effect on the people surrounding me. They can feel that I have gotten a lot more energy and it makes them happy on my behalf.<br></p><h3 id="what-is-your-weekly-training-protocol-how-many-days-per-week-do-you-train-how-are-your-workouts-structured">What is your weekly training protocol?

		<div>

			
<p>Two very significant developments happened in Crypto this week: Coinbase <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-files-for-ipo">filed</a> in preparation for an IPO, and the US FinCEN released a new <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-28437.pdf">proposal</a> effectively mandating KYC for unhosted wallets. Together, we believe these developments would have profound implications for the crypto space. </p>



<p>While Coinbase has always had high standards to list coins on its platform, as a public company, such a key revenue-generating activity for the company could see meaningful changes. The “Coinbase pump” could get a totally new meaning in the Crypto space – the extreme scenario could be that the “pure crypto” world – coins and teams that uphold privacy and censorship resistance as the key values that blockchains stand for – could move away from the Coinbase world altogether. The scenario at the other extreme, where most coins do what it takes to move over to the “official” side – also accelerated by Wall Street’s expectations on a newly public Coinbase – forcing the other coins fade into irrelevance – is also possible. </p>



<p>The other significant development is FinCEN’s proposal – that transactions from regulated exchanges to individual wallets not subject to regulation (as well as unregulated foreign exchanges) should be subject to an existing automatic reporting requirement – Currency Transaction Reports (CTR) for cash transactions (<a href="https://www.coincenter.org/a-midnight-rule-for-cryptocurrency-transaction-reports/">Source</a>), </p>



<p>In summary, the proposed rules would</p>



<ol><li>“Require banks and money service businesses (‘MSBs’) to submit reports, keep records, and verify the identity of customers” who make crypto transactions into unhosted (read: private) wallets.</li><li>Require that “convertible virtual currency” and “legal tender digital assets” be classified as “monetary instruments” and are therefore subject to the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).</li><li>Require that any transaction(s) totaling more than $10,000 in a 24-hour period  be reported to FinCEN, a bureau of the US Treasury Department, and that customer’s identity must be verified; many transactions would require a lower threshold of $3,000. Know-your-customer (KYC) rules, then, apply to even private crypto wallets.</li></ol>



<p><a href="https://decrypt.co/52021/us-treasury-apply-bank-secrecy-act-rules-crypto-wallets">Source</a></p>



<p>These two developments, along with Facebook’s Diem could very well end up defining a “new Crypto” – at least for the US –  a new asset class that is completely regulated, that <em>looks</em> like the “old Crypto” – but does not <em>feel</em> like it. But the new Crypto could be a fun new world  – enabling a new generation that would clearly see digital assets as a category of things to own, along with physical and financial assets, and decentralized in the sense that it is not owned or operated by one party – and censorship resistance and privacy could become concepts that might just need to wait a lot longer. </p>



<p>As we enter this new era in Crypto, it would be helpful to remember this: A list of wallets with names and addresses, with Bitcoin balances that add up to 21 million, is probably not what Satoshi had in mind when he/she/they hit publish on that white paper in 2008. That said, a promising new era beckons the space, and crypto being crypto, it will be exciting!</p>

		<p>12 <strong>African</strong> nations have come together pledging to build a 9 mile wide band of trees that will stretch all the way across Africa, 4750 miles, in order to stop the progressive advancement of the Sahara.</p><!-- START-WP-ADS-ID: 2 --><!-- END-WP-ADS-PRIO -->
<p>Senegal is leading a 12 African nations to build a living defense system appropriately named the Great Green Wall of Africa.</p>
<p>The Sahara is currently the 2nd largest desert in size, only smaller than Antarctica. However, unlike its frozen relative, the Sahara is actually expanding.</p>
<p>The United Nations estimates that, by 2025, 60 % of Africa’s arable land will be covered in Saharan sand, significantly expanding the current 9 million square km’s. Even if these estimations prove aggressive, the effects of farmland exploitation on a region already hard-pressed for food would be devastating on any level.<br>
With this danger in sight, the leaders of Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Djibouti have banded together on an remarkable effort to prevent approaching disaster.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alearned.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/great-green-wall-full-300x239.jpg"><img src="http://www.alearned.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/great-green-wall-full-300x239.jpg" alt="Africa" width="300" height="239"></a></p>
<p>Once complete, Africa’s Green Wall will be a manmade forest of drought-resistant trees (principally acacia) extending across the entire region.<br>
9 miles wide and 4,750 miles long, the vision for the project is as committed as it is necessary. Thus far, only 330 miles of greenery stands guard in Northern Senegal, and has cost the Sengalese government over $6 million since the start of digging in 2008. International organizations have pledged over $3 billion to the enormous defense system.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jI_nRHg-0l4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Leaders point out that the Great Green Wall is about more than just defense from windblown sand. The project will bring thousands of jobs to poor communities, and has already transformed usually useless land into gardens scattered with tree nurseries.</p>
<p>The increase of tourists, scientists, and medical professionals has also brought attention and resources to a neglected region in which aid is scarce and doctors are not readily available to needy people.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The principle of maximum entropy states that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy, in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a proposition that expresses testable information). These prior data serves as the constrains to the probability distribution.</p>



<p>Given the second law of thermodynamics (principle of increase of entropy), isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy, maximum entropy distributions become the most natural distributions under certain constrains. In this blog post, I would like to discuss entropy maximization and a couple of maximum entropy distributions.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="gaussian-integral">Gaussian Integral</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>I will skip the proof here, since the proof from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral">Wikipedia</a> is not that difficult to understand.</p>

<h4 id="useful-integrals">Useful Integrals</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} d(-x^2) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty}\\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x d (e^{-x^2}) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( x e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \Big) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( 0 - \sqrt{\pi} \Big) \\
&amp;= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Notice that here we used integral by parts.</p>

<h3 id="entropy-maximization">Entropy Maximization</h3>

<h4 id="discrete-probability-distribution">Discrete Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Suppose $P$ is a discrete probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We further have some constrains on $P$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two constrains are trivial given $P$ is a probability distribution. The third constrain is optional and it indicates a constrain on the entire system. Notice that there could be more than one constrain if $m &gt; 1$.</p>



<p>We would like to maximize the entropy.</p><p>

\[\max_{P} H(P) = \max_{P} \Big( - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \Big)\]

</p><p>Letâ€™s try to solve this optimization problem. We would use Lagrange multiplier for the constrains.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) + \lambda_0 \Big(\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \sum_{x \in X}^{} \Big(P(x) r_i(x) - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) &amp;= \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)}\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="continuous-probability-distribution">Continuous Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Similarly, suppose $P$ is a continuous probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>With the following constrains</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) dx = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, to maximize the entropy, we maximize the Lagrangian for the continuous case.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx + \lambda_0 \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$. We will also use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations">calculus of variations</a> to compute the derivative, which is slightly more complicated. Without going into all the details, we have the following derivatives.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \int_{X}^{} \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \big( P(x) \log P(x) \big)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } dx \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h3 id="maximum-entropy-distribution-examples">Maximum Entropy Distribution Examples</h3>

<h4 id="roll-dice">Roll Dice</h4>

<p>A conventional dice has 6 faces. $X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So, the maximum entropy probability distribution of getting each face of the dice is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{0} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ 6 } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="uniform-distribution">Uniform Distribution</h4>

<p>The only constrain we put on a distribution is $X = [a, b]$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So the maximum entropy probability distribution is actually uniform distribution.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \int_{a}^{b} e^{0} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ b - a } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="gaussian-distribution">Gaussian Distribution</h4>

<p>We could also derive Gaussian Distribution using entropy maximization. The constrains for the maximum entropy distribution are</p>

<ul>
  <li>$X = (-\infty, \infty)$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x P(x) dx = \mu$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mathbb{E}[X]^2 = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mu^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 P(x) dx - \mu^2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul>

<p>which translates to</p>

<ul>
  <li>$m = 2$</li>
  <li>$r_1(x) = x$, $\alpha_1 = \mu$</li>
  <li>$r_2(x) = x^2$, $\alpha_2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\

&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \Big[ \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2^2} \Big] \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2} \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\

</p><p>Here we assume $\lambda_2 &lt; 0$, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\

&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }} \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)^2 \bigg) d \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)  \\

</p><p>To make it more clear, we set</p><p>

\[y = \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)\]

<h2><strong><a href="https://discord.gg/dvtRS3Zvy3"><img alt="chat on Discord" src="https://img.shields.io/discord/657211973435392011?style=for-the-badge"></a></strong></h2>

<h2 id="🔦-overview">🔦 Overview</h2>

<p>In this challenge, you will act as an insurance company, where you build a pricing model and compete against other players (other insurance companies) for profit. In other words, the player that maximises competitive profit is the winner.</p>

<p>The market in this challenge will be a <code>cheapest-wins market</code>. That means every insurance company offers every customer an annual premium price, and the customer will always pick the company that offers the cheapest price to them (e.g., using&nbsp;a price comparison website).</p>

<p>In order to create your pricing model, you are given historical insurance data: 60K real historical car insurance policies for 4 consecutive years. Each policy concerns 1 vehicle, its drivers and an accident history over 4 years. This data has been provided by a large car insurance provider in a European country and is a uniform sample for their entire portfolio.</p>

<p>You are asked to produce a model to price contracts for incoming policies for the 5th year.</p>

<p>The company that makes the most profit in this market, wins the challenge.</p>

<h2 id="💵-cheapest-wins-market">💵 Cheapest-wins market</h2>

<p>As a player or team you represent one insurance company. You will have to provide a premium quote for every policy (or customer) you encounter. So does every other company. But the customer will pick the cheapest price offered to them. This is illustrated bellow:</p>

<p><img alt="" height="323" src="https://d3000t1r8yrm6n.cloudfront.net/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/123/content_Screenshot_from_2020-09-16_18-15-01.png" width="650"></p>

<p>Now that companies 1 and 2 each have a set amount of revenue, they have to pay out the cost of the claims accociated with policies 1-4. So it will look like:</p>

<p><img alt="" height="431" src="https://d3000t1r8yrm6n.cloudfront.net/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/124/content_Screenshot_from_2020-09-16_18-26-11.png" width="650"></p>

<p>So, once the claims are taken into account in the cheapest-wins market, we can see that Company 1 wins as it has the most competitive profit.</p>

<ol>
</ol>

<h2 id="🏇-leaderboards">🏇 Leaderboards</h2>

<p>As an insurance company in this market, you will be responsible for a portfolio of policies that pay you annual premiums. In exchange, you cover their risk. If they make a claim, you will have to pay.</p>

<p>Therefore, to make money, you must:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Estimate&nbsp;the expected loss for your portfolio, so your contracts are profitable</li>
	<li>Come up with a pricing strategy that allows you to compete with others, so that you win contracts</li>
</ol>

<p>To reach these goals we provide you with two leaderboards.</p>

<h3 id="mean-squared-error-mse-leaderboard">Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) leaderboard</h3>

<p>This leaderboard uses your&nbsp;<code>predict_expected_claim</code> function and measures how well you can estimate the risk of policy IDs. It functions by measuring the root mean squared error (RMSE) of your premiums compared to the cost of the claim.</p>

<p>The optimal way to minimise RMSE is done by a model that predicts the expected claim for each contract most accurately.</p>

<p>This allows you to compare the quality of your loss prediction model with your competitors however, there is no explicit reward for performing well on this leaderboard.</p>

<p>This leaderboard is refreshed instantaneously upon submissions, and will always use the same data, disjoint from the other leaderboard.</p>

<h3 id="competitive-profit-leaderboard">Competitive profit leaderboard (Updated every <u>Saturday</u> at 10pm CET)</h3>

<p>This leaderboard uses your <code>predict_premium</code> function. It measures your average competitive profit in a market of size 10 when playing against other players.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Each week uses a new set of data to ensure that you don't price the same policy many times, like a real market.</li>
	<li>This measures <code>competitive profit</code>. That means your profit is averaged over many markets that you play in.</li>
	<li>To make sure that results are stable, we keep putting you in markets until your leaderboard rank no longer changes from market to market.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This leaderboard is updated every <u><em><strong>Saturday at 10PM CET</strong></em></u> with your most recent submission</p>

<p><strong>If you do consistently well on this leaderboard, you will likely do well in the final evaluation.</strong></p>

<ol>
</ol>

<h2 id="⚖-evaluation-metric">⚖ Evaluation metric</h2>

<p>The final evaluation metric for this challenge is <code>competitive profit</code>: how much money does your company make in a <em><u>realistic market</u></em>. However we also provide a leaderboard using root mean squared error.</p>

<h3>Root mean squared error (RMSE)</h3>

<p>Given a set of list of claims&nbsp;<span>\(y\)</span> and a set of expected claims <span>\(\hat{y}\)</span> predicted by your model, the RMSE is computed as:</p>

<p><span>\(RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{N}}\)</span></p>

<h3>Competitive profit (<u>the final metric</u>)</h3>

<p>The evaluation process is as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Compute average profit rank. </strong>First the average competitive profit that your model makes in a market of size 10 (i.e. with 9 other random players) is computed. This gives your model a profit rank.</li>
	<li><strong>Compute realistic <code>competitive profit</code>. </strong>In a <em><u>realistic market</u></em> models that don't perform well don't exist (i.e. go bankrupt). So to compute the realistic <code>competitive profit</code>, we place your model in a market of size 10 with 9 other models picked from the <strong>top 10%</strong> of the the ranking obtained in step 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Two important notes</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The profit rank in step 1 is not used in the leaderboard. Only the ranking in step 2 is used in the leaderboard.</li>
	<li>Rankings from both steps are generated as a result of many many runs of different random markets. On average you can expect your model to have competed against every other model present at least once.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="🚓nbspmarket-rules">🚓&nbsp;Market rules</h2>

<p>There are two rules that your submissions to the profit leaderboard, and final submissions must follow:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Non-negative training profit. </strong>Your models must be profitable on the training data. That is, the sum of your premiums must not be less than the sum of the claims.</li>
	<li><strong>Participation rule.</strong> Your model must participate (i.e. win at least 1 policy) in <em>5% or more</em> of the markets it is placed in.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="💾-dataset">💾 Dataset</h2>

<p>You can download the dataset from the <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/insurance-pricing-game/dataset_files">resources tab</a>.</p>

<p>The dataset contains a total of 100K real historical car insurance policies over 5 years in the recent past.</p>

<p>This has been provided by a large car insurance provider in a European country and is a uniform sample from their entire portfolio.</p>

<p>You can find the data dictionary under the <a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/insurance-pricing-game/dataset_files">resources tab</a>.</p>

<p>The majority of the data concerns third-party liability but there are also other types of car insurance (e.g. theft) present.</p>

<p>For this challenge, the data is split in the following way:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Training data: 60K contracts with 4 years of history (what you are given)</li>
	<li>RMSE leaderboard: 5K contracts with 4 years of history</li>
	<li>9 weekly profit leaderboards: 15K contracts with 4 years of history</li>
	<li>Test data: 100K contracts for the 5th year (what the final competition runs on)</li>
</ol>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Virtual Machine (VM) detection is nothing new. Malware has been doing it for over a decade now. Over time the techniques have advanced as defenders learned new ways of avoiding VM detection.</p>
<p>A while back a friend and I were working on a project related to exploit delivery via a web application for redteaming purposes. I wanted a way to fingerprint visitors of the site and hash the fingerprint data so I could look for potential repeat visitors. While investigating fingerprinting I stumbled upon something pretty interesting. I was looking at some code that collected information about WebGL capabilities. I quickly realized that some of the fingerprinting information could be useful for VM detection because vendor names were exposed. In this particular instance the string "VMWare" was contained within the WebGL information. After some more testing I also discovered that VirtualBox reported the same kind of information. </p>
<p>Once I realized it was potentially possible to detect VMs from the browser I started to dig deeper and began searching for other research related to this discovery. I found a pretty well researched academic paper <a href="http://yinzhicao.org/TrackingFree/crossbrowsertracking_NDSS17.pdf">[1]</a> related to tracking users across multiple browsers. This gave me some other potential techniques that could be applied to VM detection.</p>
<p>The end goal of this research is to have multiple techniques for VM detection. Multiple techniques lead to much more accurate detection. Since some techniques are more false-positive prone than others, a weighting system can be applied to the detection capabilities. This allows us to generate detection confidence scoring. This can help account for inaccuracies of certain detection methods. Given enough testing and data it would then be possible to come up with a reasonable threshold value. If a browser scores above the threshold then it would most likely be within a VM. Alternatively, if the browser scored below the threshold value it could be considered to be running on physical hardware.</p>
<h3>Techniques</h3>
<p>Now that I have covered some of the background information and history leading up to this blog post we can start to dig into the actual techniques.</p>
<p>As mentioned prior in the introduction, WebGL can provide a lot of information about the OpenGL implementation including vendor information. The WEBGL_debug_renderer_info extension <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WEBGL_debug_renderer_info">[2]</a> can be used to query for debug information such as the WebGL vendor and rendered.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>canvas</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>'canvas'</span><span>);</span>

<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>renderer</span><span>);</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Additionally, extension availability can be queried using the <strong><em>getExtension</em></strong> method on a WebGL context. I have not fully explored this avenue but it might be possible to detect certain WebGL implementations provided by VMs based on the extensions available. Though this idea is likely very false-positive prone.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot from <a href="https://webglreport.com/">[3]</a> WebGLReport a website dedicated to fingerprinting WebGL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="alt-text" src="https://bannedit.github.io/resources/VirtualBox-VM-Win10-Chrome.png" title="VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Visiting webglreport.com">
<strong><em>VirtualBox Windows 10 x64 VM Google Chrome Visiting webglreport.com</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, it is important to note that this depends on how the VM is configured. In Virtual Box for example, setting the graphics controller setting under Display to VMSVGA will report cause WebGL to use CPU based implementations of OpenGL which is browser dependent. However, this could still be a useful indicator that the client machine is running in a VM because most modern hardware has integrated GPUs and can provide access to OpenGL natively. Just keep in mind that CPU based OpenGL implementations do not necessarily mean it is a VM outright.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This screenshot depicts Google Chrome utilizing the CPU based OpenGL implementation renderer Google SwiftShader <a href="https://github.com/google/swiftshader">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>Another technique seen in normal malware is to determine the screen width and height. This can be achieved in Javascript as well. Additionally, color depth and bits per pixel are other potentially good indicators related to the display.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>width</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>width</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>height</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>height</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>color_depth</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>colorDepth</span><span>;</span>
<span>var</span> <span>bitspp</span> <span>=</span> <span>screen</span><span>.</span><span>pixelDepth</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>More details on the screen object can be found at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_screen.asp">[5]</a>.</p>
<p>Can we detect the amount of RAM on the client? You bet. Again using Javascript we can determine roughly the amount of RAM available on the browser. One quirk to note here is that the browser will only report RAM values in gigabytes (gb). It also has a quirk where it will only report up to 8gb and as low as 256mb (0.25gb). These ranges of values however, are still enough to use as a VM detection method. Most physical workstations these days come with at least 8gb of RAM. Detecting smaller amounts of RAM such as 2gb or less would be a good indicator the client browser is in a VM. The specification for the Device Memory can be found at <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/device-memory/">[6]</a></p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>var</span> <span>ram</span> <span>=</span> <span>navigator</span><span>.</span><span>deviceMemory</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Finally, the last technique I will be covering detects the number of CPU cores. This is done by performing timing attacks using multiple web workers running simultaneously. During my testing of this technique I found it to be very accurate. I tested this concept out using the <a href="https://oswg.oftn.org/projects/core-estimator/demo/">[7]</a> Core Estimator Demo site. A small number of CPU cores can be a decent VM indicator and has been used by malware in the past.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This blog post covered four unique VM detection capabilities that can be performed from Javascript. When I first discovered these techniques my initial thought was to apply the concepts toward VM detection. Hopefully, both defenders and offensive security professions can find something useful to apply these techniques toward.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see that academics and various other researchers have applied some of the same concepts toward fingerprinting and privacy issues. </p>

<p>I mean, is this even up for argument?</p>

<p>One of the whitest-ass things in the world is our people’s obsession with songs at sporting events, and indeed, in large crowds. If you’re reading this and you’re from Europe, feel free to replace my references to Sweet Caroline with Seven Nation Army, same diff. That said, you can fairly reliably trigger this behavior in most cultures in most parts of the world by finding a sufficiently rowdy bar around midnight and playing <em>something</em> on the jukebox that gets folks going. Humans, we’re social creatures, yeah? A few bars of Neil Diamond, a couple people singing along, and by the time you’re at ‘Hands, touching hands’ you’ll have a swelling crescendo that culminates in a ear-shattering and atonal screech of ‘SWEEEEEEEEEEEEET CAR-O-LINE (WOAH OH OH)’ making the bartenders silently plot the murder of everyone in their line of sight.</p>
<p>People like being around people, and most people don’t treat everyone around them as some sort of incredibly delicate faberge egg. There’s a lot of “wow look at all these accomodations people are making that disabled people have asked for now that nobody is supposed to leave their house! hypocrisy, much??” and I’m like, yeah, duh? Pointing out hypocrisy is the lowest form of engagement in 2020. This is why virtual events suck – because nobody is actually planning on doing them any longer than they need to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the benefits of in-person conferences is that they temporarily remove you from your day-to-day work and immerse you in a community of like-minded individuals. It’s not just about getting to hear new ideas, but also about the break from your daily routine. This is one of the things that is hardest to replicate in a virtual event. DIDevOps was perhaps the most successful virtual conference I’ve seen in making their event feel like An Event. This event was clever and whimsical, the community was engaged, and it definitely didn’t feel like just another video call.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://redmonk.com/rstephens/2020/04/30/deserted-island-devops/">Rachel Stephens, RedMonk</a></p>
<p>I wrote earlier this year about the idea of a <a href="https://aparker.io/posts/deserted-island-devops/">decisive moment</a> and how that influenced the thinking behind Deserted Island DevOps. To elaborate a bit, Cartier-Bresson was a street photographer who coined this phrase in the introduction to his 1947 book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organisation of forms which give that event its proper expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is, then, the ‘decisive moment’ of a tech conference? My original criteria was that an event was <em>etherial</em> or placeless; From the smallest DevOpsDays to the largest re:Invent, an event is defined less by the where than by the who. As an attendee, you are swept away from the status quo for a time (even as it inorexably pulls you back in, given the amount of people I see working on laptops during events) into a convention center or hotel or theater or whatever, specifically to focus on something other than what you normally would. Quite literally, you are being moved out of your comfort zone. This can prime you to accept ideas that normally you wouldn’t, can rejigger your brain chemistry for a few hours to make you see things from a different perspective. That’s valuable! As a speaker, you’re transported to a new stage, with a new audience, a new set of eyes and ears to reflect off of. It’s almost like being a comedian and testing out material – you try some new lines, some new jokes, add an anecdote here, shave one off there. Repetition builds mastery. Next week, or next month, you’re going to do it all again. Our traversal through the liminal spaces between these potemkin stages lends itself to inward focus where we must Do The Work to shut out the world around us. To be less floral about it, the demands of the road make us better speakers because the only way we don’t go fuckin’ mad is to focus on the work.</p>
<p>Virtual events offer none of this, unfortunately. As attendees, another Slack, another Zoom call, another wave of talking heads and PowerPoint. As speakers, our audience disappears behind a chat window. We lose our reflection. It’s sad and terrible and great for some people, but on the balance I think we dislike it more than we like it.</p>
<p>The bad is part of the fun! You can’t replicate the feeling of gnawing on an underripe banana while chugging overly-hot-but-not-terribly-flavorful coffee watching someone who’s company paid way too much for a keynote while mentally ticking off the people you need to talk to that day while working out the soreness in your back from the bed that isn’t yours that you got maybe four productive sleeping hours in due to jet lag while figuring out who you’re going to catch up with after the show wraps that day as you muse about how it looks like your competitors have a much nicer booth than yours, and you wonder if they’re hiring except that one asshole still works there and so on and so forth. “That sounds terrible!” you may be musing, <em>and you’d be right</em>, but I love the terrible. I thrive in the terrible. I’m drinking single origin fair trade coffee beans that were roasted in small batches locally brewed in a fancy coffee maker and I can tell you that when this is all over and I can have a cuppa brewed in the backroom of a Hilton it is going to be the sweetest thing I can possibly imagine for five seconds right before I start hating everything about it again and <em>that’s fine</em>.</p>
<p>The bad of an in-person event is terrible, but it’s a terrible I can work with. I go outside like once or twice a week now to get groceries and that’s all I’ve done for the past nine months. <em>I want the workable terrible, not this horrific stasis</em>.</p>

<p>The reason that virtual events suck is that we’re trying to replicate in-person events. We’re doing old-school iOS skeumorphism but for primarily social gatherings. No wonder they suck! There’s a few broad reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bad UX</em>: Sometimes I like to style on babies by displaying object permanance, but you wouldn’t know that given the utter contempt event platforms seem to have for their audiences by doing dumb skeumorphic “conference halls” with badly ‘shopped people standing around.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://aparker.io/images/kubeconlobby.png" alt="KubeCon EU ‘Lobby’"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Pervasive Surveillence</em>: I use ad blockers but a bunch of people don’t, on principle though it’s really fuckin’ creepy that every click you make on one of these event platforms is tracked. Simply navigating to a sponsor booth counts as a ‘lead’ to the sponsor. Yikes!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor AV Quality</em>: I get that people have to record from their homes but maybe recording someone’s Zoom isn’t the best way to do this? I’m sympathetic, this is legit a hard problem to solve, but many large conferences are still charging an arm and a leg to sponsors (and less for attendees but that’s a different point) so how about you do local recording then edit things later? If you’re going to charge me at <em>all</em> then I expect the production values to at least beat out a random Twitch streamer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor Viewing Experience</em>: A tiny pop-out 720p video that artifacts when I change the size is… not great. Integrate chat and Q&amp;A better. Do <em>something</em> unique with the format. I sit on enough Zoom calls. Like, why would I <em>pay money</em> to <em>watch videos</em> with a <em>worse player than YouTube</em>? There’s millions of hours of shit out there for free!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Yet Another Slack</em>: I just don’t want to join more Slack channels where people are randomly @here’ing and I never know if it’s an event organizer with an announcement or some salesperson trying to coax people into their virtual booth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Did I Mention Virtual Booths Yet</em>: I have never interacted with anyone in a Virtual Booth and I never will. This appears to be a common sentiment.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright, let’s flip the script. I’m wearing my business hat now.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Bad UX</em>: You think the <em>attendee</em> experience is bad, the admin/sponsor controls and views on these platforms is worse. Arbitrary requirements, poor control over look and feel, nah fam miss me with this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poor Interactivity</em>: You know what’s great about a real booth? People wander by and they get interested. Why do they wander by? Because they’re not at home, they need to kill time, and the snacks are on the trade floor. Maybe they just want a t-shirt or whatever, fine, but we do actually get a lot of really valuable feedback and eyes on the product by doing demos. This is extremely useful, and it simply doesn’t happen at virtual events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Attendee Impedence Mismatch</em>: This is more of a theory but I suspect that the attendee mix for virtual events in terms of titles is significantly out-of-balance compared to in-person events. One popular (<em>n</em> = ~1300) virtual event this year had self-reported attendance of only 4% for management roles, but over 40% IC (developer/devops/ops) roles. My hypothesis is that “decision makers” are less likely to attend virtual events because they’re intensely overbooked during the in-person -&gt; distributed team transition period and are oversubscribed on other things, which translates into less useful direct sales conversations, but I could be off-base here. If nothing else, my anecdata from talking about this seems to indicate that attendees just don’t really go to virtual booths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Success Looks Different</em>: This is one of those ‘two-way street’ problems, but I don’t think organizers did a great job in general making sponsors successful, and I don’t think sponsors had the muscle to make themselves successful in a lot of ways. Trying to be too different caused a lot of friction, however, and during a time of reinvention this friction reduced experimentation in my opinion.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Last part - the speaker experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>My Home Is Not Your Home</em>: One of the low key worst things about the pandemic has been the idea of us ‘opening up our homes’ and letting people see how we live. Could we fuckin’ not? Like I don’t believe that I even have to discuss this but we should probably put the Room Rater person on trial for crimes against humanity. I don’t <em>want</em> to have to be super concious about my webcam or audio or whatever, I don’t <em>want</em> to …</p></li></ul></div></div></div>

<p>We will <strong>not</strong> be covering Fibre, <em>reconciliation</em> or the change detection mechanisms.</p>

<hr>

<p>We should start with a basic bare-bones version of React. To do that we need to touch on some of the core design concepts which React follows, such as:</p>
<h2 id="jsx"><a href="#jsx" aria-label="jsx permalink"></a>JSX</h2>
<ul>
<li>Elements are POJO’s (plain-old-javascript-objects)</li>
<li>Components are functions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pure-rendering"><a href="#pure-rendering" aria-label="pure rendering permalink"></a>Pure rendering</h2>
<ul>
<li>A instance of a render follows: Render = Component(Data)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="state-machine"><a href="#state-machine" aria-label="state machine permalink"></a>State machine</h2>
<ul>
<li>One-directional data flow</li>
<li>Data change detection forces updates for all children who need it</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to build our own (super simple) version of React and then add Hooks, to do that we need a basic version of the React engine which should render (log) a component with some props and return the component (for interacting with later).</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> React <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>render</span><span>:</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> exampleProps <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      unit<span>:</span> <span>"likes"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>const</span> compo <span>=</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span>exampleProps<span>)</span>
    console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Render: "</span><span>,</span> compo<span>.</span>inner<span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> compo
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we have a basic engine we need an accompanying component which returns the React element (object) during the render:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    type<span>:</span> <span>"div"</span><span>,</span>
    inner<span>:</span> props<span>.</span>unit<span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can now use our React and Component together and see its output (below each line of code):</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 

App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div>
<p>So we now have a basic Component which is rendered by our React engine.</p>
<hr>

<p>A brief reminder about Hooks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hooks let you use state and other React features inside a pure component, without writing a class"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Classes would often confuse people and add bloat to your code, however there are other strengths to using Hooks some of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easier to build and re-use stateful logic</li>
<li>Easier to split components into relatable pieces
-Removes confusion over the many lifecycle methods (i.e. what correlates to what event)</li>
<li>No fundamental changes to your React knowledge, just a more direct way to use features you already know</li>
<li>Easy to add types, as Hooks are just functions (unlike high-order components and most of the render props pattern)</li>
<li>Easy to test with <em>"react-dom/test-utils"</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So it is easy to see why Hooks are such a powerful mechanism. So let’s examine how they work and build our own.</p>
<hr>

<p>There are a couple of core concepts with useState:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use state in pure component.</li>
<li>Use any primitive (string/array/object etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the docs they always return:</p>
<ol>
<li>a reducer state</li>
<li>an action dispatcher</li>
</ol>
<p>However this can be simplified into a basic property value and a setter.
There is a simple rule which is very important to Hooks. That is that <strong>the Hooks are called at the top</strong>. That means outside of any conditionals or nesting blocks. This is crucial to the Hooks mechanism and we will examine why.</p>
<p>So let us expand out React engine to include the useState Hook. We will need a "state index" counter, as well as "state store" for values.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> React <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  index<span>:</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> 
  state<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> 
  <span>useState</span><span>:</span> <span>defaultProp</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> cachedIndex <span>=</span> React<span>.</span>index
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span>React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span> <span>=</span> defaultProp
    <span>}</span>

    <span>const</span> currentState <span>=</span> React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>currentSetter</span> <span>=</span> <span>newValue</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
      React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span> <span>=</span> newValue
    <span>}</span>
    React<span>.</span>index<span>++</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>[</span>currentState<span>,</span> currentSetter<span>]</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>render</span><span>:</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> exampleProps <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      unit<span>:</span> <span>"likes"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>const</span> compo <span>=</span> <span>Component</span><span>(</span>exampleProps<span>)</span>
    console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Render: "</span><span>,</span> compo<span>.</span>inner<span>)</span>
    React<span>.</span>index <span>=</span> <span>0</span> 
    <span>return</span> compo
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have also added a <em>useState</em> method. It works by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checking if the current index has a value in the state, if not set the default</li>
<li>Then build the setter for the current state index value</li>
<li>Finally increment the index (for the next Hook) and return the setter and current value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we will make use of our <em>useState</em> in our Component.</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>name<span>,</span> setName<span>]</span> <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>"Steve"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    type<span>:</span> <span>"div"</span><span>,</span>
    inner<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>count<span>}</span></span><span> </span><span><span>${</span>props<span>.</span>unit<span>}</span></span><span> for </span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
    <span>click</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setCount</span><span>(</span>count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>personArrived</span><span>:</span> <span>person</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setName</span><span>(</span>person<span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>See the "count" and "name" usage above. Also we have utilised both inside the "inner" property so that we can spy on it in the terminal. Additionally we have added some manual methods to update the state values. They are manual as we are not worrying about the change detection or reconciliation in this post. We will be manually triggering the returned functions as well as the render method (following how we used it in our React engine section earlier).</p>
<p>So on running the below, we log the rendered output. We can see with each "click() "we are updating the count, and with "personArrived()" we are updating person (terminal output below line of code).</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 

App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 

App<span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 

App<span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
App<span>.</span><span>personArrived</span><span>(</span><span>"Peter"</span><span>)</span>
App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 
</code></pre></div>
<p>There is 1 main issue in our usage. That is that this would NOT work for many components at the same time. It is very tightly coupled to our single component. The state should be held in module scope or a single store namespaced to the component.</p>
<hr>

<p>A short quote from the docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A function which runs after the initial render and after every update"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly to <em>useState</em>, the rule about calling at the top-level applies. It is required for our implementation as well.</p>
<p>Couple of concepts for effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Created during render</li>
<li>Run in definition order (like <em>useState</em>)</li>
<li>Run after a given lifecycle event (first render and/or when a dependency has changed. i.e. mount and update)</li>
<li>Returns a function (some effects require cleaning e.g. unsubscribing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <em>useEffect</em> Hook mechanism is below:</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>useEffect</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>callback<span>,</span> dependencies</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> cachedIndex <span>=</span> React<span>.</span>index<span>;</span>
  <span>const</span> hasChanged <span>=</span> dependencies <span>!==</span> React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span><span>;</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>dependencies <span>===</span> <span>undefined</span> <span>||</span> hasChanged<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>callback</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    React<span>.</span>state<span>[</span>cachedIndex<span>]</span> <span>=</span> dependencies<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  React<span>.</span>index<span>++</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"unsubscribed effect"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>,</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A run-through of the code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache the store index</li>
<li>Check if the dependency has changed in state (this is our variable tracking mechanism)</li>
<li>If there is no dependency given or its changed, run our effect and update store index value with our dependency value</li>
<li>Then increment the store index for future Hooks to use their own index</li>
<li>Finally return a function</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the way that our effect Hooks also depend on the "state index". Similarly to <em>useState</em>, it relies on the deterministic order of values in the state array.</p>
<p>All state and effect Hooks must be called in the same order, so their state index can always be found in the same location in the state array.</p>
<p>Now lets update our component to use the effect Hook</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Component</span> <span>=</span> <span>props</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>name<span>,</span> setName<span>]</span> <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>"Steve"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>const</span> exitThis <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Effect ran"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span> name<span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
    type<span>:</span> <span>"div"</span><span>,</span>
    inner<span>:</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>count<span>}</span></span><span> </span><span><span>${</span>props<span>.</span>unit<span>}</span></span><span> for </span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span>`</span></span><span>,</span>
    <span>click</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setCount</span><span>(</span>count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>personArrived</span><span>:</span> <span>person</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setName</span><span>(</span>person<span>)</span><span>,</span>
    <span>unsubscribe</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>exitThis</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above Hook will look for changes on the "name" property, also we have exposed an "unsubscribe" function for our effect Hook.</p>
<p>So now onto the running order during rendering, I have logged the state array with each render to help us follow (see below screenshot for the detailed explanation).</p>
<div data-language="javascript"><pre><code><span>let</span> App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 


App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 


App<span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 


App<span>.</span><span>click</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
App<span>.</span><span>personArrived</span><span>(</span><span>"Peter"</span><span>)</span>
App <span>=</span> React<span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(</span>Component<span>)</span> 



App<span>.</span><span>unsubscribe</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The below details what is happening above for our effect.</p>
<h2 id="first-render"><a href="#first-render" aria-label="first render permalink"></a>First render</h2>
<p>After 2 state runs the "cachedIndex" is now 2 inside of <em>useEffect</em>. The state value is "undefined" as it does not exist for that index (yet). So we will run our callback and write a new entity into state (under index 2), which is our dependency value (i.e. currently "Steve").</p>
<p>SO: state now has local state values and effect values. It is in a deterministic order based on the “state index” (i.e. where it is called in the component). This means it is reliable as this order should not change. Remember <strong>Rule #1</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="re-renders"><a href="#re-renders" aria-label="re renders permalink"></a>Re-renders</h2>
<p>We will check the 3rd value in our state array and the effect will run only if it changes. See above our Hook runs again when we change the name to "Peter". Lastly we unsubscribe from our Hook.</p>
<p>There are 2 main issues with the above (among others):</p>
<h3 id="1-only-works-with-1-dependency-not-an-array"><a href="#1-only-works-with-1-dependency-not-an-array" aria-label="1 only works with 1 dependency not an array permalink"></a>1. Only works with 1 dependency, not an array.</h3>
<p>It is easy to expand our code so we could use an array. By using the same store index and storing an array of dependencies on the state, not just single value. Then iterate over that dependency array to check for changes.</p>

<p>This is a more complex issue to fix and would require fundamental changes to our React engine. As this is a small POC example it is not worth fixing.</p>

<p>I hope this was useful or at the very least a little interesting. I very much enjoyed learning about Hooks and have a deeper appreciation for them as a feature which has helped move the front-end developer experience forward.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>I get a couple emails every week asking how I manage to “do it all” or “balance my schedule”, or how I find the time and motivation to work on so many projects, which makes me think people have a really weird picture of how I spend my 24 hours. My calendar is actually <a href="https://free.linus.zone/">pretty empty</a> most of the time, though I’m pretty protective of my free time. I like having free time because it lets me make sure I read and consume more than I create, which I think is <a href="https://linus.coffee/note/having-ideas/">critical to creativity</a>.</p>
<p>I also leave space on my calendar because I don’t like feeling <strong>busy</strong>. “Busy” is what you are when you’re hopping from meeting to meeting, sprinting through a filled calendar or running up against a deadline. None of that is conducive to following spontaneous creative ideas or working on large interesting projects. When I feel at my productive best, what I feel is <strong>momentum</strong>. I like feeling like I’m on a roll, hopping from one interesting project or idea to the next, not wanting to put down the interest or inspiration. When I feel momentum, everything else – motivation, focus, efficient use of my time – comes naturally. Conversely, when I lose momentum, it takes me a few days of kicking against the ground to get back up to speed.</p>
<p>Having momentum is different than simply working a lot. Busy-ness, what some people think of as “productivity”, comes from <strong>volume</strong> of work. A day spent answering 100 emails and a day spent publishing one great blog post could feel equally productive. Momentum isn’t really about volume of work, but about <strong>rhythm of work</strong>. When I feel creative momentum, it means there’s something interesting or meaningful getting done every day, even if it’s something small. A day spent answering emails is monotonous. It has no rhythm. Even if I only work for two hours in a day, if those two hours produced something meaningful and kept the rhythm of my work going, I feel the momentum continue to the next day.</p>
<p>A busy schedule is like a cacophonous garage band. There’s a lot of volume, but it doesn’t really keep you in the music.</p>
<p>Working with momentum is more like Jazz. There is sound, but mostly in service of forward movement. There’s a groove you can ride, something that keeps you stepping forward. You don’t have to make yourself follow the beats, because it comes naturally. That rhythm and leisure also lets you improvise on top over the music.</p>
<h2 id="building-creative-momentum">Building creative momentum</h2>
<p>How do you find a sense of momentum in your work?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Try to get at least one meaningful or significant thing done every day</strong>, even if that’s the only thing you do. You want to wake up with a clear idea of what that task might be for that day, and go to sleep knowing that you haven’t fallen off your rhythm.</p>
<p>When I have a day not hampered by school schedules or meetings I usually try to publish a blog post, solve a major problem for a side project, or create and share some small unit of work, whether that’s a piece of music or writing or something else. Occasionally, I’ll just spend a day catching up on email and errands, and that’ll be my “project” for the day, but I’m conscious of when I risk going too many days (4-6 days) without “shipping” anything, because that’s how I lose momentum, and it’s hard to regain that lost forward motion.</p>
<p>This might be challenging when working as a solo founder or writer or maker, but especially when you work alone, I think it’s important to draw yourself clear boundaries and say it’s okay to respond late to things if it means you get to protect your creative momentum, because that forward inertia is the heartbeat that keeps you moving forward day after day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leave something unfinished when you stop working</strong>, so when you come back you can pick up right where you left off and get in the same mental state again. When I’m deep in the middle of an interesting project, I’m usually dead focused on that task until I finish. I’ll take pauses to take care of myself, but I usually stay off email and messages, and any spare cycles I have goes towards that task. This means I lose less momentum and “working state” of my mind to context-switching.</p>
<p>Authors sometimes talk about how they begin a writing session by reading the last 1000 words they wrote. When you must switch off of a task, leave some trail you can follow when you return to pick up right where your mind left off.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither of these habits are about working more or working any harder. Instead, they both try to help you stay in the rhythm of work that your mind can ride. They help you build momentum towards a consistent habit of forward motion, which is what really fuels prolific people. These pieces of advice are also about protecting your momentum as a priority. If you value the momentum behind your work, you should prioritize staying in the rhythm, and make few excuses to miss beats. A song that slips every other note falls apart quickly, but if you hit all the right beats, you rarely need strict discipline to stay in time.</p>
<p><strong>You don’t have to be busy to be prolific.</strong> In fact, having a full calendar gets in the way, because it robs you of the free time and mental space you need to follow interesting ideas and help you replenish your creative taste. To create consistently, don’t work constantly. Instead, find a rhythm on which you can build a momentum that fuels you to keep going right where you left off every time you return to your creative zone. Building on momentum – staying in-rhythm – is the easiest, most enjoyable way to keep creating.</p>

The SARS-CoV-2 virus, like many viruses before it, is bad news for the brain. In a study published Dec.16 in <a href="https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41593-020-00771-8&amp;t=OTk2MDE1NmMzNDM2ZWQyOTVhZDZhYzhkZTU4YzM3NDc3YjkzMjliOCxQZUREczM0NA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3AeWj9QNbkB8x7_Y2XTyPu8A&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fnuadox.com%2Fpost%2F637885674994974720%2Fcovid19-brain&amp;m=0&amp;ts=1608554755"><i>Nature Neuroscience</i></a>, researchers found that the spike protein, often depicted as the red arms of the virus, can cross the blood-brain barrier in mice.</p><p>This strongly suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, can enter the brain.</p><p>The spike protein, often called the S1 protein, dictates which cells the virus can enter. Usually, the virus does the same thing as its binding protein, said lead author William A. Banks, a professor &nbsp;of medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine and a &nbsp;Puget Sound Veterans Affairs Healthcare System physician and researcher. Banks said binding proteins like S1 usually by themselves cause damage as they detach from the virus and cause inflammation.</p><p>“The S1 protein likely causes the brain to release cytokines and inflammatory products,” he said.</p><p>In science circles, the intense inflammation caused by the COVID-19 infection is called a cytokine storm. The immune system, upon seeing the virus and its proteins, overreacts in its attempt to kill the invading virus. The infected person is left with brain fog, fatigue and other cognitive issues.</p><p>Banks and his team saw this reaction with the HIV virus and wanted to see if the same was happening with SARS CoV-2.</p><p>Banks said the S1 protein in SARS-CoV2 and the gp 120 protein in HIV-1 function similarly. They are glycoproteins – proteins that have a lot of sugars on them, hallmarks of proteins that bind to other receptors. Both these proteins function as the arms and hand for their viruses by grabbing onto other receptors. &nbsp;Both cross the blood-brain barrier and S1, like gp120, is likely toxic to brain tissues.</p><p> “It was like déjà vu,” said Banks, who has done extensive work on HIV-1, gp120, and the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>The Banks’ lab studies the blood-brain barrier in Alzheimer’s, obesity, diabetes, and HIV. But they put their work on hold and all 15 people in the lab started their experiments on the S1 protein in April. They enlisted long-time collaborator Jacob Raber, a professor in the departments of Behavioral Neuroscience, Neurology, and Radiation Medicine, and his teams at Oregon Health &amp; Science University.</p><p>The study could explain many of the complications from COVID-19.</p><p>“We know that when you have the COVID infection you have trouble breathing and that’s because there’s infection in your lung, but an additional explanation is that the virus enters the respiratory centers of the brain and causes problems there as well,” said Banks.</p><p>Raber said in their experiments transport of S1 was faster in the olfactory bulb and kidney of males than females. This observation might relate to the increased susceptibility of men to more severe COVID-19 outcomes.</p><p>As for people taking the virus lightly, Banks has a message:</p><p>“You do not want to mess with this virus,” he said. “Many of the effects that the COVID virus has could be accentuated or perpetuated or even caused by virus getting in the brain and those effects could last for a very long time.”</p><p>This study was partially supported by a National Institute on Aging-funded COVID-19 supplement to a shared RF1 grant of Banks and Raber.​</p><p>–</p><p><i>Header image:&nbsp;The S1 protein likely causes the brain to release inflammatory products causing a storm in the brain, researchers said.

<p>This is the third part of a four part (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/11/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-ii-subsistence-on-the-hoof/">II</a>, IV) look at the Dothraki from George R.R. Martin’s <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and HBO’s <em>Game of Thrones</em>.  We’re looking at, in particular, the degree to which George R.R. Martin’s claim that the Dothraki are “an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures” holds up in the face of research.  <a href="https://acoup.blog/2020/12/11/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-ii-subsistence-on-the-hoof/">Last week</a>, we looked at the subsistence systems of historical Steppe nomads and Great Plains Native Americans and found that the Dothraki subsistence system was less than a pale imitation of them, having stripped out nearly every activity from the daily routine of survival which wasn’t brutal or violent.</p>



<p>This week, we’re going to keep looking at the elements of culture beyond simple subsistence (with the caveat, noted last time, that subsistence systems often dictate over elements of culture).  Necessarily, this is going to make this post a bit more of an <em>omnium gatherum</em> catch-all, with a bunch of discrete topics.  In each case, it is going to make more sense to introduce the Dothraki practice and then contrast it the practices of the Great Plains and the Eurasian Steppe.</p>



<p>I want to note up front, <strong>we’re going to be talking here about slavery, sex, sexual violence, and regular violence</strong>, both as they occur in <em>ASoIaF</em>/<em>GoT</em> and how they occurred in the real world.  I try to keep this blog mostly G-rated, but history itself wasn’t always G-rated and <em>ASoIaF</em> certainly isn’t; reader discretion is advised.  In the interest of keeping clear which section is which, I have dropped my <em>hilarious</em> ‘An X of Ys’ joke section-title format and instead tried to give very descriptive section titles so you can decide if there is one or two you just want to skip.</p>



<p>Also, I want to note before we start that this post is going to be a bit more book-heavy than show-heavy, just because it is generally easier to pin down things which are explicitly said in the book rather than things implied by the visual language of the show.  <strong>That said, I think the show, if anything, magnifies the characterization the book presents on each of today’s topics</strong>, either dialing them up to 11 or (in the cases where the books have oddly excluded things) making that exclusion more intentional and explicit given the different nature of film (since in a book, if an object is not described in a scene, we may assume it is still there and just undescribed; in a visual medium, if it is not seen, it is not there).</p>

<p>Finally, as a reminder that we are not merely unfairly picking on some fantasy author who just wanted to create fictional societies without any tether to, or comment on, real societies which existed in the past or exist today, <strong>the key statement we are really assessing here is <a href="https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6040/">this one by George R.R. Martin</a>:</strong></p>



<blockquote><p>The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of steppe and plains cultures… Mongols and Huns, certainly, but also Alans, Sioux, Cheyenne, and various other Amerindian tribes… seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy.</p></blockquote>



<p>A statement which claims, quite directly, that the Dothraki are modeled primarily off of both Eurasian Steppe nomads and Great Plains Native Americans (with a ‘dash’ of fantasy).</p>



<h2>A Collection of Cultures</h2>



<p>(Ok, I had <em>one</em> more too-cute-by-half section title left)</p>



<p>The first thing to touch on here is not a cultural element but rather a fact about Dothraki culture, which is simply that:<strong> there is <em><span>a</span></em> ‘Dothraki culture.’  </strong>The Dothraki have a single language, a single holy city (Vaes Dothrak), a single system of social organization (Khals, etc), apparently a single set of dietary customs, a single religion with a well-understood prophecy of a future leader, and so on.  <strong>In short, there is a <em>single</em> Dothraki culture</strong> which is shared by all of the various <em>khalasars</em> of the Dothraki Sea.  Crucially this is not merely an observation made by characters <em>outside</em> of the Dothraki culture (that would be understandable – significant cultural divides are often invisible to outsiders who cannot mark the significance of ‘small’ differences), but is also a fact observed by the Dothraki themselves, explicit in things like the collective housing of all windowed <em>khaleesi</em> and even in the language the Dothraki use to talk about each other, especially in contrast to the Lhazareen and other non-Dothraki.  <strong>This is a single culture without any real ethnic divisions and is regarded as such by its members</strong>, not just outsiders.</p>



<p>And that is <em>nonsense</em>.</p>



<p>Even if we only take the Eastern <em>third </em>of the Eurasian Steppe (the Eurasian steppe actually divides quite neatly in thirds, broken up by the Ural mountains (dividing the western and central steppe), and the Fergana Valley (dividing the central and eastern steppe)), we have not <em>just</em> the Mongols, but Tatars, Keraites, Naimans, Merkits, Uyghurs, Kyrgyz, Khitans, and (sort of) Jurchen.  <strong>Those are meaningful differences!</strong>  There are, for instance, two entire distinct language <em>families</em> on the Steppe (I should note that there is some dispute here about the lines between language families, but my impression is that the consensus now is that the Mongolic and Turkic languages are not directly related as they were once believed to be), each containing a number of often non-mutually intelligible languages within them (the Turkic language family has some 35 documented languages).  <strong>These groups were often not only linguistically distinct, but culturally and religiously distinct.</strong></p>



<p><strong>The Great Plains were no less varied!</strong>  Isenberg’s chart (<em>op. cit.</em>, 59) – mentioned last week and based on US Government data – lists Assiniboine, Atsina, Comanche, Blackfeet, Koiwa (and Kiowa-Apache), Crow, Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho as the nomadic peoples of the Great Plains (it also lists 11 more sedentary Native peoples).  And that understates the variety because – remember – this is a survey from the <em>outside</em> which is going to miss significant variety (like not breaking out the Lakota from the Dakota, etc.)!</p>



<p>This brings us to two crucial points.  <strong>The <em>first</em> problem is that the lack of cultural and lingustic variety is itself an error on Martin’s part</strong>.  This isn’t quite a unique problem for the Dothraki – <a href="https://acoup.blog/2019/06/12/new-acquisitions-how-it-wasnt-game-of-thrones-and-the-middle-ages-part-iii/">as I’ve noted, particularly with The North, many of the regions of Westeros are a lot less varied than they ought to be given their size</a> – but it is more pronounced here.  <strong>The Dothraki Sea is about as large on the map as <em>all six</em> of the Southern parts of the Seven Kingdoms, but has nowhere near the cultural diversity</strong> despite lacking a unifying government or hegemonic religion (as a rule, large nation-states are the <em>product</em> of state-building, not a prerequisite.  To put it bluntly, France is full of French people because the government in Paris saw fit to make it that way.  There is no such homogenizing institution in the Dothraki Sea).  Again, I don’t expect Martin to bring the story to a screeching halt to discuss this, but think about how much the feeling of a real culture could have been enhanced even a little by having Khal Drogo’s army involve multiple ethnicities of Dothraki nomads, or to have him refer to equivalents of the Merkits or Tartars (we may call these non-existent cultures the Nopethraki) occupying other parts of the Dothraki Sea and possibly trading at Vaes Dothrak.  Something just as simple as meeting other nomads either at the wedding or in Vaes Dothrak who spoke a different language (or given the size of Khal Drogo’s <em>khalasaar</em>, have him brag – as many historical rulers were want to do – about all of the many different Nopethraki peoples who also followed him).</p>



<p><strong>The second problem this creates is for this post</strong>.  While we have one fictional culture to compare, we have to compare it with <em>dozens</em> of real historical peoples – an obviously impossible task in this format (or probably any format).  For the sake of keeping this manageable, I am going to reduce my points of comparison specifically to the Mongols (c. 1150-1250) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sioux_Nation">Sioux </a>(also known as the ‘Seven Council Fires’ though note that this is <em>also</em> a diverse grouping, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakota_language">Lakota</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_language">Western and Eastern Dakota</a>).  Fortunately for me, these two sets are peoples <em>specifically</em> cited by Martin as inspirations for the Dothraki.  Where relevant, I will jump to other groups, but we’ll mostly focus on these two.  <strong>We are going to move topically to see how much the Dothraki are rooted in anything we can identify from these real historical cultures that supposedly inspired them.</strong></p>



<h2>Music and Art</h2>



<p><strong>Try as I might, I could not find any clear reference to Dothraki artwork. </strong> Vests are described repeatedly as painted (AGoT, 83, 193), but apart from the exceptional one made for Viserys (AGoT, 329), how they are painted doesn’t seem to ever be mentioned.  One might fairly call Dothraki hair braiding and belling an art (AGoT, 30), but while the number of braids matters, it doesn’t seem like the quality or artistry is ever commented on.  The statues that line the way to Vaes Dothrak are all captured, the “ancient monuments from all the lands the Dothraki have sacked” (AGoT, 324) and Vaes Dothrak itself lacks its own building style, instead being a mix of styles of peoples the Dothraki have enslaved (AGoT, 326-7).  Drogo’s palace has just “rough-hewn timbered walls” and Daenerys smiles to herself at the contrast between the expected grandeur and the actual building (AGoT, 327), apparently devoid of decoration.  It’s possible that the bride-gift weapons (<em>AGoT</em>, 86) were decorated – the materials in question were clearly lavish – but we are not told.  Later, Daario Naharis has a decorated <em>arakh</em> (in the shape of a naked woman, because <em>of course</em>, <em>ASoS</em>, 482), but he is …</p></div></div>

You might asks why I don’t suggest av1 for Emacs Conf. I’m actively
experimenting with that, and using <b>-cpu-used 1</b> with all tricks can
almost halve the bitrate compared to the vp9 call below and still get
better quality, but at the cost of taking 3 days to encode a mere 3
minutes. That’s on a not too low-specced system (almost 10 CPU-days at
4 Ghz). To re-compress the whole conference, this is currently far too
expensive. Values for cpu-used above one actually give worse results
than the vp9 call. With av1 I see speeds below 0.0008x — every second
takes 20 minutes to encode, one minute takes roughly one day to
encode.
</p>

<p>
That said, this is an ffmpeg-call with optimized AV1-parameters for
minimum filesize (no guarantees for perfection: most of these
parameters are experimental — following the descriptions in the docs —
and I could not yet test the changes due to each parameter):

This requires around 40h of encoding time for the 2.5 minutes of

The quality 60 version is down to 1MiB per minute — 128kbit/s for HD
video, and if you don’t know where to look there is almost no visible
breakage. If you don’t see how awesome that is, you did not grow up
with a computer in the filesharing age <code>:-)</code>
</p>

<p>
The quality 63 version even gets down to 87.5kbits/s. Watch the video
to judge the quality yourself.
</p>

<p>
With these codecs we could do swarming HD-video streaming on an
ancient double-ISDN line. A private DSL connection with 40Mbit/s
upstream would suffice to stream pre-converted low-movement HD-video
to 400 fans. This is the silent revolution of media compression
algorithms whose potential has mostly gone un-noticed by the public.
</p>

<p>
At 40MiB per hour, all the recordings from the main track of a three
day conference would fit on a simple DVD or an old 4GB USB stick (the
cheapest you get). A plain CD could hold 20 hours of standup comedy,
and the typical 32GB USB stick would hold 800 hours of low-movement
video — that’s more than a full month non-stop video.
</p>

<p>
From a few tests I did, high-movement video is about 5x as big, but
that still leaves us with almost one week of video on a plain 32GiB
USB stick — which is cheaper to buy than a typical monthly streaming
subscription.
</p>

<p>
Despite being purely digital, the encoding time vs. bandwidth clearly
makes this an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale">economy of scale</a>. Do you still wonder why streaming
platforms are currently shooting up like mushrooms? However this would
also scale perfectly with decentralization: One gaming-PC would
suffice to encode the creative output of a professional youtuber with
high production-quality like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/greymatter">CGP Grey</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/maiLab">maiLab</a> (10-30 minutes per
week). Looking only at electricity, that’s around 50€ per month.
Investing that would allow to self-compress the video enough that it
could be sent by email, avoiding the need for centralized
infrastructure.

		<p>Like in everything else, the more information you have about what to expect during the various stages of your company’s evolution, the higher your chances for success. Deciding to pursue and navigate through a potential acquisition or funding is a huge time commitment and isn’t recommended if you’re on the fence.</p>
<p>You may be asking yourself, ‘How do I tell if I’m on the fence?’ ‘What kind of time commitment are we really talking about here?’</p>
<p>If you can get through this blog post, that is at least a good sign.</p>

<h3>First things first</h3>
<p>Here are some questions to ask yourself and your C-team before getting started:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we go through the [acquisition, funding] process and don’t accept any offers, how will that affect our commitment to continuing to grow the business?</li>
<li>How long do we want to commit to this after the acquisition?</li>
<li>How much control do I want after we sell?</li>
<li>Will I be able to work under someone else?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you should have a good baseline on whether or not to proceed.</p>
<h3>A quick story</h3>
<p>A few years back, one of our founders came to us stating he was ready to go out and raise the next round of funding. Knowing their product was at a 25% net growth rate with a high churn rate, it was obvious that the sales velocity wasn’t there. The product took too long to consume and implement – let alone explain. Raising more funds would only propel them into the precarious and frustrating position of slinging a product that was far from product market fit while burning potential strategic customers. Simply put, they weren’t ready to scale.</p>
<p>We asked the C-team to go back to the drawing board and reanalyze the customer data in order to find their true viable market. They came back to us with their newly identified blue ocean strategy.</p>
<p>Did we prompt them to go out and raise funding then? No. Over the next 18 months, we made small investments in the company and worked alongside them as they proved out the new strategy. And it worked. They were finally sailing in a big ocean instead of a small pond. The big market participants recognized and validated the product and the technology, we reduced churn and gained further traction. Then, before we even got the chance to raise more funds, we received a potential opportunity to exit. The point is the numbers say everything and will tell your story.</p>

<h3>So you determined it’s a go….</h3>
<h4><b>What you’ll need:</b><span> A secure data room is advisable (i.e. <a href="https://try.docsend.com/access-venture-partners">DocSend</a>), legal counsel, financial/tax advisors &amp; patience.</span></h4>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h4><span>If you’re fundraising:</span></h4>
<h4>Timeline: 80-120 days, <a href="https://medium.com/entrepreneurship-in-world-3-0/realistic-startup-fundraising-timeline-b76b0359b933" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here is a day-by-day breakdown of the process</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to begin the process at least 6 months before. Identify ideal investors by researching who has <em>recently</em> invested in the space and their target stage.</li>
<li>Use Crunchbase to identify potential investors. Signal is nice but not the most comprehensive set of data and the filtering schematic is janky / you’ll have to dig past the popular kids.</li>
<li>Don’t reach out to investors that haven’t had any investment activity in more than 2 years.</li>
<li>Start mapping introduction routes, and if possible, start communicating ahead of time.</li>

<p><strong><em>Ian Harris explains that more than half of commonly performed surgical operations may be placebos. Adequate studies using a blinded control group are essential.</em></strong></p>



<div><figure><img src="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/surgery-surgeon-ongoing-operate.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p><br>Ian Harris, a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, wrote a book titled&nbsp;Surgery, The Ultimate Placebo. I haven’t read the book, but I watched his excellent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzueFu1cq5U">YouTube video lecture</a>&nbsp;on the subject. It is an eye-opening evaluation of commonly performed surgical operations that have been tested and shown to be no more effective (and arguably worse) than placebo, or that have never even been tested. He covers the history of sham surgery studies, talks about placebo effects, and explains why so many surgeons ignore the evidence and continue to do ineffective operations. In the process, he provides a valuable education in critical thinking.</p>



<p>His introduction to skepticism at age 18 was a documentary on television where dowsers were subjected to an elegant controlled test by James Randi and Dick Smith. They buried ten pipes and challenged dowsers to determine which pipe the water was flowing through. When they knew which pipe was active, the dowsers all identified it correctly; but when they didn’t know, they were only right 12% of the time. He was impressed by how a simple test could easily refute a claim.</p>



<p>When he watched the same documentary again recently, he was impressed by the reaction of dowsers when shown that dowsing didn’t work. He recognized it as the same reaction he was seeing in surgeons when their operations were tested and shown not to work. They made up excuses, hypotheses about why the experiment might not have given the results they expected, and said they wouldn’t give up doing the operation, “because it works”.</p>



<p>In the early 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, a common operation for heart disease was internal mammary artery ligation. It seemed obvious that it worked: patients felt better. In 1939, a sham surgery experiment showed that an equal number of patients got better if the surgeon just made an incision but didn’t ligate the arteries. Surgeons heeded the evidence and stopped doing that operation.</p>



<p>He takes us on a historical tour of surgical operations that have been tested and shown not to work. Surgeons often reject the evidence and make up rationalizations as to why it might not have worked in those studies, but they remain convinced that it does work&nbsp;<em>in their hands</em>. When they refuse to stop doing that operation, their excuses sound just like those of the dowsers. They insist on continuing to do the operation “because it works” (in their experience). Billions of dollars are being wasted on hundreds of thousands of operations that have been shown not to work or that have never even been tested to see if they work better than doing nothing.</p>



<h2>False analogies and faulty reasoning</h2>



<p>Theory often says an operation&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;work, but&nbsp;<strong>biological plausibility means absolutely nothing</strong>&nbsp;unless tests can show that it&nbsp;<em>really does work</em>. Dr. Harris says “You can make up a biologically plausible mechanism for&nbsp;<em>anything you want</em>.”</p>



<p><strong>The parachute analogy</strong>&nbsp;says you don’t need a randomized controlled study of parachutes to find out if they work. Dr. Harris says he has seen it frequently invoked, usually for procedures that are later shown to be rubbish.</p>



<p><strong>Comparative effectiveness studies</strong>&nbsp;are done comparing two different methods of something like steroid injections for back pain, but they don’t tell us whether either of them work. They would be better called comparative ineffectiveness studies. The first step should have been to use a control group and compare steroid injections to no injections.</p>



<h2>Perceived effectiveness</h2>



<p>Perceived effectiveness is a combination of two things: the treatment’s specific effects plus its placebo effects.</p>



<p>There are&nbsp;<strong>shortcuts in thinking</strong>&nbsp;that all humans are hard-wired to take. They assume correlation means causation, and they fall for the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Post_hoc,_ergo_propter_hoc">post hoc ergo propter hoc</a></em>&nbsp;fallacy (assuming that if B follows A that must mean that A caused B). These shortcuts in thinking often lead to errors. Improvement might be due to something other than the surgery, like the natural history of the disease, regression to the mean, or concomitant treatments.</p>



<p>Improvement can be perceived by the patient (sometimes it is a false perception due to placebo factors or misinterpretations) and/or by the doctor, due to factors like measurement error, reporting bias, confirmation bias, etc. Doctors rate the effectiveness of their treatments higher than their patients do. The perception of the doctors is&nbsp;<em>wrong</em>; they consistently overestimate the benefits and underestimate the harms of their treatments.</p>



<h2>Treatment is not always needed</h2>



<p>He tells the story of Archie Cochrane, for whom the Cochrane Collaboration of systematic analyses was named. As the only doctor in a POW camp in World War II, he was responsible for 10,000 prisoners, many suffering from open wounds, dysentery, typhoid, and other serious diseases. His requests for doctors and medicines were denied by his German captors, who said doctors were superfluous. In six months, only 4 prisoners died, each of them shot while trying to escape. The rest all got better, without treatment.</p>



<p>Harris’ story&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1444794/?page=1">distorts the truth</a>, but it serves as a vivid illustration of an important fact: recovery often occurs without any treatment. Cochrane’s experience led him to question much of what was being done in the name of medicine. Patients were kept in bed for a week after a heart attack not because of any evidence, but just “because it makes sense”. Cochrane did a controlled study and found that bedrest was actually harming people.</p>



<h2><em>Surgery often acts as a placebo</em></h2>



<p>Harris covers the many factors that affect a patient’s response to a placebo. A systematic review found that placebo was just as effective as surgery in over half of the cases studied, and&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;of the recent trials comparing surgery to placebo have found that surgery was no better than placebo.</p>



<p>He demolishes all the arguments surgeons give for continuing to do these operations that have been tested and shown not to work. The real reason is that they continue to&nbsp;<em>believe the procedure is effective</em>, just as the dowsers continued to believe they could find water with a forked stick. Tradition and personal experience triumph over science and reason.</p>



<p>Science is just a systematic way to reduce error. Imperfect, but better than any other way. Blinded trials are the least biased way to determine effectiveness.</p>



<h2>Ethical concerns</h2>



<p>Some people object that doing sham surgeries is unethical. Placebos are unethical in clinical practice for treating an individual, but not in research where they are essential to finding the truth and balancing harms and benefits for large groups of people and for preventing future harms. Surely, it’s unethical to perform ineffective surgeries. On Science-Based Medicine, we are constantly questioning the ethics of selling dietary supplements with claims that have never been properly tested. Some herbal medicines might be harmless, but surgery always carries a risk of infection, tissue damage, and adverse effects. And it is expensive: millions of dollars are being wasted worldwide on procedures that expose patients to risk for no possible benefit.</p>



<h2>Conclusion: Evidence is essential</h2>



<p>He concludes by saying we should treat new surgical procedures like new drugs, and only pay for those that are part of a trial to find out if they work. Most surgical procedures being done today have not been subjected to blinded trials.</p>



<p>Advice to patients: it’s OK to ask for a second opinion, and you should always ask your surgeon for the evidence showing the benefits and risks of the procedure, and what you can expect to happen if surgery is not done.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>GraphQL has been seeing a rapid uptick in adoption.  It enables a more expressive interface between frontend and backend code by allowing developers to specify exactly what data is required to render a given page.  While there are numerous wins for frontend engineers, the backend team needs a different mindset.  Instead of writing route handlers that return a fixed set of data (or maybe a few variations), the backend team must write <strong>resolver functions</strong> which return portions of the dataset individually. </p>
<p>We've seen that many developers will apply route-level checks as a starting point for authorization in their applications.  A common pattern is using decorators or other route level guards that ensure a user meets certain requirements (the user is an admin, the user has a certain role, etc.) before the route code is run.</p>
<p>This approach is easy to get started with, but is typically not feasible in GraphQL.  There is one route in a GraphQL application, and the potential set of data returned is highly variable.  There are many more combinations of fields in a GraphQL query than the number of routes in a typical REST application.</p>
<p>Since GraphQL is oriented around access to individual data elements, a natural place to enforce authorization is during data access.  GraphQL's official documentation acknowledges as much:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where should you perform validation and authorization checks? The answer: inside a dedicated business logic layer. Your business logic layer should act as the single source of truth for enforcing <em>business domain rules</em> [emphasis added].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/thinking-in-graphs/#business-logic-layer">https://graphql.org/learn/thinking-in-graphs/#business-logic-layer</a></p>
<p>Great. Easy.  But how does that actually work?  How do we enforce a business domain rule? Is there a simple abstraction for specifying them?</p>
<p>In this post, we'll look at using oso—an open source authorization library—for enforcing authorization rules.  We'll see how to declaratively specify authorization rules in Polar, oso's policy language, and how to integrate oso into a GraphQL application in only a few lines of code.</p>
<p>We'll use SQLAlchemy as our ORM, and Graphene — a popular Python GraphQL library.  The <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/using/frameworks/sqlalchemy.html#installation">library</a> will provide the glue between oso, GraphQL and SQLAlchemy, allowing us to enforce authorization consistency.</p>

<p>We'll start with a basic Flask app representing an expense management application.  To follow along, <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app">clone the project on GitHub</a>.  We'll walk through the parts of this app relevant to authorization, but the full code is available in the project. We'll assume some familiarity with Flask, SQLAlchemy and GraphQL.  Each section of this post is based on a commit in the repository, and we'll link to the relevant commit at the beginning of the section.</p>
<p>If you plan on following along and trying out the examples as you read, make sure to follow the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/blob/main/README.md">README</a> to install the dependencies so you can run the code. This section covers the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/tree/922af81fc265efc82f9572e174833689f051ae9a">initial commit</a>.</p>
<p>Our app has a few models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expense:</strong> An expense created by a user.</li>
<li><strong>User:</strong> A user accessing the application.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll start with these, and add some more later.  Here are our initial models from <code>models.py</code>. These are regular SQLAlchemy models.  We used the <a href="https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/">flask_sqlalchemy</a> library to integrate with Flask and make our setup a bit easier.</p>
<pre><code>from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Expense(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'expenses'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    amount = db.Column(db.Integer)

    created_by_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('users.id'))
    created_by = relationship("User")

    description = db.Column(db.Text)

class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'users'

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(256))
</code></pre>

<p>An Expense is created by a user, available at the <code>Expense.created_by</code> property.</p>
<p>We also have a GraphQL schema defined using Graphene over these models in <code>app/schema.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import graphene
from graphene import relay
from graphene_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemyConnectionField, SQLAlchemyObjectType

from flask import g

from . import models

class Expense(SQLAlchemyObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = models.Expense
        interfaces = (relay.Node,)

class User(SQLAlchemyObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = models.User
        interfaces = (relay.Node,)

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    expenses = SQLAlchemyConnectionField(Expense.connection)
    user = graphene.Field(User)
    node = graphene.relay.Node.Field()

    def resolve_user(parent, info):
        return (g.current_user
                if isinstance(g.current_user, models.User)
                else None)

# ... snip ...

schema = graphene.Schema(query=Query)
</code></pre>

<p>This schema uses the <a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/sqlalchemy/en/latest/">Graphene-SQLAlchemy library</a> to create Graphene schema objects for our SQLAlchemy models.  This is a <a href="https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/sqlalchemy/en/latest/tutorial/#defining-our-models">standard approach</a> for using SQLAlchemy with Graphene.</p>
<p>We can make a simple query (I'm using the awesome <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphiql">GraphiQL</a> tool for this, but you can also just go to <a href="http://localhost:5000/graphql">http://localhost:5000/graphql</a> in your browser) and see that our app is working:</p>
<p><img alt="Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-08_at_6.14.44_PM.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso/Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-08_at_6.14.44_PM.png"></p>
<h2>Adding authorization</h2>
<p>At this point, we have a basic GraphQL app, without authorization.  Let's set that up. Here's the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-graphene-sqlalchemy-app/commit/8bf8c4a411f83e640fdd3537ddcc3d59049edecf">commit on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Our initial authorization rule will be based on the concept of data owners: <em>users can view their own expenses.</em></p>
<p>To implement this rule, we would need to perform filtering at the SQLAlchemy level. Which means:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding a custom resolver for Expense</li>
<li>Checking all other places the GraphQL schema might access expenses</li>
<li>Implementing the custom SQLAlchemy query</li>
<li>Repeating for every other model and authorization check.</li>
</ol>
<p>This authorization rule is based on each database record—sometimes referred to as object-level permissions.  It can be challenging to abstract as middleware, and is certainly more complex than just adding the simple decorator we discussed earlier. </p>
<p>Instead, we'll use the <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library.  We need to make two changes to set this up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add an instance of <code>Oso</code> to our application.</li>
<li>Write a policy containing our authorization rules.</li>
</ol>
<p>To add oso, we'll modify the <code>create_app</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>from oso import Oso
from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models

def create_app():
    # snip ...

    # Create oso instance which will hold our policy.
    oso = Oso()  
    # Make SQLAlchemy models available in the policy.
    register_models(oso, db.Model)  
    # Load policy file into oso.
    oso.load_file(Path(__file__).parent / "policy.polar")   

    # ...
</code></pre>

<p>Then, we swap out the <code>SQLAlchemy</code> object in our app with <code>AuthorizedSQLAlchemy</code>. In <code>models.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from sqlalchemy_oso.flask import AuthorizedSQLAlchemy

db = AuthorizedSQLAlchemy(
    get_oso=lambda: current_app.oso,
    get_user=lambda: getattr(g, "current_user", None),
    get_action=lambda: "read"
)
</code></pre>

<p>We use this object instead of <code>flask_sqlalchemy.SQLAlchemy</code>.  It provides a <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/session.html">SQLAlchemy Session object</a> that filters queries to only return objects that are authorized for the current user and action.</p>
<p>Our policy file, <code>app/policy.polar</code> is empty for now.</p>
<p>Now, let's check our query results:</p>
<p><img alt="Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-09_at_6.42.46_PM.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/graphql-authorization-graphene-sqlalchemy-oso/Final%20d38ce8f758064d59a83b0e0d6ff6aa74/Screen_Shot_2020-12-09_at_6.42.46_PM.png"></p>
<p>Nothing's returned anymore.  Why? The policy file is empty.  Polar is deny by default, so we'll need to add some rules.  Before we do that, let's take a look at how this is working.  Our app has an endpoint that will log the SQL used to execute our last query.  If you're following along, run the app with:</p>
<pre><code>$ FLASK_RUN_EXTRA_FILES=app/policy.polar FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
</code></pre>

<p>Run a query in GraphiQL.  Below is a good starting point.</p>
<pre><code>{
  expenses {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        description
        createdBy {
          email
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now visit, <a href="http://localhost:5000/sql">http://localhost:5000/sql</a>.</p>
<p>Here, we see:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT count(*) AS count_1
  FROM (
        SELECT expenses.id AS expenses_id,
               expenses.amount AS expenses_amount,
               expenses.created_by_id AS expenses_created_by_id,
               expenses.description AS expenses_description
          FROM expenses
         WHERE 0 = 1
         ORDER BY expenses.id ASC
       ) AS anon_1
</code></pre>

<p>Notice our WHERE clause: <code>0 = 1</code>.  Where's that coming from? <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> enforces our Polar policy by translating rules from the policy into SQL filters.  <code>0 = 1</code> is always false, which causes no records to be returned from the database.</p>
<h2>Adding some rules</h2>
<p>Now that we have oso integrated, let's finish implementing our authorization rule.  Keep the app running, the <code>FLASK_RUN_EXTRA_FILES</code> environment variable we set will ensure that Flask reloads the app when you change the policy.</p>
<p>Let's try the following (in <code>app/policy.polar</code>):</p>
<pre><code>allow(_actor, _action, _resource);
</code></pre>

<p>This policy allows the user to access any object.  In Polar, each statement in the policy is called a rule.  The <code>allow</code> rule is a special rule that is used as the entrypoint to policies.  It has three arguments, the <strong>actor</strong> (who's making the request), the <strong>action</strong> (what the request will do), and the <strong>resource</strong> (what the request is operating over).  Our policy has one rule.  Each parameter starts with <code>_</code> which indicates an anonymous variable (one that matches anything because there are no constraints on it).</p>
<p>Rerun the query, and check out the SQL (Just refresh <a href="http://localhost:5000/sql">http://localhost:5000/sql</a>. You'll see a few statements there, I've picked out the primary SQL query used to resolve the GraphQL query):</p>
<pre><code>SELECT expenses.id AS expenses_id,
       expenses.amount AS expenses_amount,
       expenses.created_by_id AS expenses_created_by_id,
       expenses.description AS expenses_description
  FROM expenses
 WHERE 1 = 1
 ORDER BY expenses.id ASC
 LIMIT 4
OFFSET 0
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we see <code>WHERE 1 = 1</code>.  This is always true! As a result, everything's been returned.  </p>
<p>Let's go a little further:</p>
<pre><code>allow(_: User, "read", _: Expense);
</code></pre>

<p>This policy is saying all users can read all expenses. Again, the <code>_</code> denotes an anonymous or ignored variable, but the <code>: User</code> syntax is checking that the input data matches a specific type. In this case, the User and Expense models from our <a href="http://models.py/">models.py</a> file.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-bought-new-computer">Why I bought new computer<small><a href="#why-i-bought-new-computer" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h2>
<p>My computer's display started slowly dying this year, suffering from gradually more and more serious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbR2VhHLuW0">ghosting</a>. By November it was so bad that I could barely read any letters after an hour or two of using the machine. It's MacBook 12" early 2015, which I bought a few years ago, second hand, refurbished.</p>
<p>As far as I know, <em>refurbished</em> should mean that the computer was used as a sample machine somewhere, e.g. in an Apple Store. When they didn't need it anymore, it got checked for defects and sold for a cheaper price as a second hand product in a very good shape. My theory is that the computer was almost unused by the time I've bought it, but perhaps it was open with the display shining all the time in the shop, so durability of the pixels suffered a lot.</p>
<p>Anyway, in addition to that, the machine's performance is a total potato these days. I have always appreciated its portability (size and weight of a magazine) and silence (has no fan), but I've spent most of this year at home, so I didn't care about portability, and the world got more bloated, so the minimum requirements for a smooth user experience are higher than in 2015. So by the summer 2020 I found myself wishing a new machine, and it just happened that Apple was about to release something with the new processors. I decided to wait, because I thought that (at the time) the latest machines would get cheaper if Apple releases something new.</p>

<p>When the first reviews were out, I waited for some more, but then it was just obvious this is a big change, a revolutionary machine, which is going to destroy the consumer market. I've enjoyed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://singhkays.com/blog/apple-silicon-m1-black-magic/">Apple Silicon M1: Black. Magic. Fuckery.</a> - compilation of various first impressions</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away/">Yeah, Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro is powerful, but it’s the battery life that will blow you away</a> - general review</li>
<li><a href="https://debugger.medium.com/why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2">Why Is Apple’s M1 Chip So Fast?</a> - how they made it and why competition won't be able to compete</li>

</ul>
<p>After that, I decided I'll buy the new Apple Silicon M1 MacBook Air, because it doesn't make sense to go for anything older if I plan to have the new computer for as many years as possible going forward. It's not <em>cheap</em> cheap, but it's still huge performance for a reasonable price. Honestly, I'm surprised I happen to be buying a freshly released Mac announced just a few weeks ago, when so far I've been buying only second-hand Apple hardware, but it just felt like it makes sense to do this, all things considered.</p>
<p>I decided I don't need more RAM than 8 GB, because nobody from the first reviewers managed to give the RAM a hard time. It seemed to me it's a different beast altogether and it doesn't make sense to just compare numbers and say that more is better. Apple allows you to buy a computer with more than 8 GB RAM, but I think it's just a trap how to satisfy and charge those who don't believe the reviews and just want more RAM whatever it takes.</p>
<p>I also decided I want 512 GB drive, as I'm used to that size and I didn't want to downgrade. Also, I had serious capacity problems with my 16 GB iPhone SE and my wife still has serious capacity problems with her 128 GB old Air, so I really wanted to avoid that in the future.</p>
<p>I decided I don't mind that Docker or any kind of virtualization isn't supported (yet), because I don't use it. I'm self-employed solo enterpreneur now and Docker or Kubernetes play no role in my dev stack, also I use no virtual machines, nothing like that. If I was about to get a regular job somewhere, I assume they'd provide me a dedicated work computer. Also, I think <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/download-and-try-the-tech-preview-of-docker-desktop-for-m1/">it's gonna be resolved soon</a>.</p>
<h2 id="first-impressions">First impressions<small><a href="#first-impressions" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h2>
<p>The new Air arrived this Tuesday, so as of writing this article, I work on it for 4 days. To be honest, upgrading from a years old machine with a dying display and a potato performance, to this shiny new beast, is… It's unbelievable.</p>
<p>The change in responsivity is really significant and I totally love it. I don't think I've ever used anything faster. With my potato machine I got used to going to bloated websites from my phone, as it felt that iPhone X can deal with them much better, but now the phone feels slow. <a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com/">The optimized apps</a> are super snappy. Safari runs smooth and fast like crazy. Firefox the same. Spotify, Slack, Discord, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, all the annoying bloated websites, which I used to hate so much for the past months, now run like if they were the most optimized websites on the internet. Honestly, I have problems to grasp the speed by my brain. It's just too much of a difference compared to my previous experience. It's like riding on a sloth and then suddenly switching to a super sonic rocket. I feel like I click on a tab in my browser and it happens instantly, and then it takes billion milliseconds until my brain realizes the action has been already performed and I can proceed to whatever else I wanted to do. I can now actually say when something needs network, because everything else is super fast. Whenever there's the slightiest lag, it's because network is involved, and because my network is slow.</p>
<p>I wanted to go with clean installation, so I didn't do any kind of smart restore from backup or anything like that. Just setting up the new system and moving my files, installing a few programs, like in the old days. Thanks to fast USBs and SSDs on both the computers and my external drive, moving the data was very fast, took just a few minutes.</p>
<p>I didn't upgrade to Catalina with my old laptop, because I wanted to play my 32bit Steam games, so macOS Big Sur is a quite a change for me now. A lot of setting up in the beginning, but all quite straightforward. A few surprises, such as zsh being the default shell in macOS now (change by <code>chsh -s /bin/bash</code>). Finally I can set Finder to sort by name AND have folders at the top, at the same time. For me as a person who switched to macOS from other systems, it has always felt so silly that this wasn't possible.</p>
<h3 id="touchid">TouchID<small><a href="#touchid" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h3>
<p>Having TouchID as part of the computer is a nice surprise. As a person who has sweaty hands all the time, I didn't believe it's gonna work. But it's actually able to read my fingers without any problems. The iPhone SE couldn't deal with my fingers. It was a source of a lot of frustrations and one of a few major reasons why I switched to iPhone X in Feb 2020, which has FaceID (only if the pandemics didn't bring face masks right after that).</p>
<p>It's very comfortable to use TouchID to login to the operating system, to 1Password, or to confirm a purchase in App Store (although that had to be first set up somewhere deep in the System Preferences, bah). Opening 1Password with a single finger touch is definitely a major productivity win for me.</p>
<h3 id="battery">Battery<small><a href="#battery" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h3>
<p>On Wednesday I tested the battery. 9am I unplugged the computer from electricity with 100% battery, and it started complaning about power only around 10pm. That's 13 hours. That said, during that day, I did mostly internet stuff, perhaps played some music, had 1 hour long call over MS Teams, 1 hour long call over Google Meet, and from 7pm to 10pm I attended an online meetup over Zoom. Before I connected to the meetup at 7pm, it still had almost 30 % battery left. Of course, no fan sound, as the machine has no fan, and it was only lukewarm between the keyboard and the display, cold everywhere else. Amazing!</p>
<h3 id="games">Games<small><a href="#games" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h3>
<p>On Black Friday I bought <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435150/Divinity_Original_Sin_2__Definitive_Edition/">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, but it would crash on my machine. On the Apple Silicon Air, even though I run the game through Rosetta 2, I've put all the sliders in the performance settings to the highest positions, and it runs so smooth that when moving the game camera I actually experience problems to get my head around so many details happening on my screen. It's beautiful. Of course, the machine makes no sound, as it has no fan.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="https://applesilicongames.com/">list of games which are optimized</a>, but I just installed Steam using Rosetta 2, downloaded the games I wanted through it, and didn't bother further.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup<small><a href="#setup" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h2>
<h3 id="homebrew">Homebrew<small><a href="#homebrew" title="Permanent link to this heading">#</a></small></h3>
<p>Setting up and figuring up Homebrew was a major drag, especially because my connection isn't very fast and initializing Homebrew downloads a lot of stuff over git, so it's endless. Before I found out the ideal configuration, I had to do it several times. I don't like Apple Store very much, so I only use it for installing apps which are not available as Homebrew casks, e.g. <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/lungo">Lungo</a>. I install everything else using Homebrew.</p>
<p>Homebrew suggests using it through Rosetta 2 (translation layer), which is fine, but I wanted to be able to also install apps which are already native to Apple Silicon. People post <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv2ylxro7rM">tutorials on how to have two Homebrew installations side by side</a>, but it still took me some time to figure everyhting out. My setup after some trial and error:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't bother installing CLI apps natively. <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857">It's a mess now</a> and you'll only run into issues. Unless you want to help the Homebrew team with debugging, of course.</li>
<li>I ended up having the default Homebrew installed through Rosetta 2, and I install everything with it, both CLI and GUI apps,</li>
<li>except GUI <a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com/">apps which are already optimized for the new Macs</a>, such as Firefox, Spotify, VS Code, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I follow the common advice on how to install Rosetta 2 Homebrew and how to install the native one. I won't repeat the many already existing tutorials:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nv2ylxro7rM">Install Homebrew Natively on an Apple Silicon M1 Mac</a> (see also comments)</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Three years ago, Jo and his wife Robin shared their story: he had early-onset Alzheimer's. Now, as it continues its swift, relentless assault on Jo, Robin navigates the unthinkable</p><div>
																		<p>Robin Giles is waiting at the entrance of her London, Ont., apartment building when the little white bus pulls up at the curb. The door to the lift swings open to reveal her husband, Joël Aubin, sitting in his wheelchair, grinning broadly at her. His arms undulate through what looks like a slow-motion drumming routine, and he snaps his ﬁngers continuously.</p>
<p>The wheelchair lift has jammed, and after the bus driver makes several attempts to get it working, she asks Robin if she can get Jo—as he’s known to most everyone in his life—off the bus without his chair. “We can <em>try</em>,” Robin says.</p>
<p>She climbs aboard, takes Jo’s hands in hers and coaches him to stand and follow her down the aisle. As is nearly always the case when Robin is within range, Jo’s gaze rarely strays from her. She backs down the bus steps and talks him down them one at a time. It takes Jo a couple of tries to climb the high curb, then he settles into the wheelchair the driver has extracted through the rear door.</p>
<p>Jo turns to Robin. “Holy s–t!” he exclaims. Robin and the bus driver roar with laughter.</p>
<p>This is the routine—minus the glitch with the lift and Jo’s perfect comedic expletive—every weekday around 3 p.m. During the school year, when Robin is teaching, her dad meets the bus every day when Jo returns from a day program, and Robin comes home soon after.</p>
<p>Four years ago, Jo was diagnosed with dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease, an extremely rare form caused by a genetic mutation slithering through his family tree. Jo watched his mother die of the same illness when he was a teenager. Even in this early-onset form of Alzheimer’s, Jo is a terrible rarity: <a href="http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/index.html">he was 37 years old when he was diagnosed.</a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>READ THE FIRST STORY ABOUT JO: <a href="http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/index.html">Jo Aubin has Alzheimer’s. He’s 38.</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Now, Jo is 41 and Robin is 40, and they are navigating unthinkable territory. The “bastard monster,” as Robin sometimes calls Alzheimer’s, has been swift and relentless, but the assault has been particularly vicious in the last six months. Jo’s ability to speak has all but disappeared, his mobility is reduced to a slow, assisted shuffle around their apartment, and he requires hands-on help with every task of daily life, from dressing and brushing his teeth to eating and safely sitting down in a chair.</p>
<p>So far, with the help of her family, the day program and the sheer force of her own will and devotion to Jo, Robin has managed to provide all his caregiving at home. Families of people with dementia land in different places on this issue, but to her, it’s beyond question that Jo is not here anymore; most everything that made him Jo has been stolen. “But it’s almost like an echo that’s left,” she says. “It’s like I want to take care of <em>this</em> Jo because it’s honouring the real Jo.”</p>
<p>When she’s forced to move Jo into a nursing home and Robin loses her ability to care every day for the echo of the man she married, that will mean he’s really gone. “Sometimes people very kindly say, ‘Oh, it will be better when Jo is living somewhere else.’ No, it won’t. That’s the part that people don’t understand. It won’t be better. It will be the worst part,” she says through sobs. “Because I don’t consider what I’m doing a negative thing.”</p>
<p>But Robin knows a reckoning is imminent. And she also knows, because they talked about it many times before Jo lost the ability to have those conversations, that he despised the idea of going into a nursing home. In recent months, Robin felt compelled to put Jo on two waiting lists, but what haunts her is that he still seems so aware, she can’t imagine wrenching him from the peaceful, comfortable world they’ve built around him at home. There are still those fleeting moments—like his response to the ordeal of navigating the bus steps—when the old Jo resurfaces and announces himself with surprising clarity.</p>
<p>After saying goodbye to the bus driver, Robin guides Jo’s wheelchair onto the elevator and pushes the button for their floor.</p>
<p>“He’s not ready to go anywhere yet,” she says. She looks at Jo, then reaches over and ruffles his hair.</p>

<p>More than two years before Jo was diagnosed, bizarre little glitches began to suggest something was terribly wrong. There were Christmas gifts that made no sense, problems with software he’d used for years or basic household tasks that went ignored. He saw his family doctor repeatedly, but medication and counselling—based on the assumption that the problem was depression or anxiety—went nowhere. Eventually, Jo was less able to teach high school—he was working at the same school as Robin—and their marriage frayed.</p>
<p>Finally, Jo’s doctor referred him to a specialist, and in June 2014 he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. A year after his diagnosis, <a href="http://site.macleans.ca/longform/alzheimers/index.html"><em>Maclean’s</em> chronicled his story to that point.</a> Jo—so articulate that it had always been a running joke among his friends—struggled slightly to make words do his bidding, but he explained what it was like to live with dementia. “It’s kind of like you’re going through a forest,” he said. “And the more you walk into the forest, the leaves get bigger and bigger and bigger, and you just become overwhelmed.”</p>
<p>Jo was adamant that he didn’t want to end up in a long-term care facility like the one in which he’d visited his mother—sometimes with Robin along for the ride when they began dating as teenagers in Kapuskasing, Ont.—and he hoped that Canada’s legalization of assisted death would allow him to avoid that. But when medical assistance in dying became law in 2016, excluded were “advance requests” that would have permitted people with dementia to set out terms for their death while they still had capacity to consent.</p>
<p>Now, that dark forest Jo described is closing in. “In a lot of ways, it’s good that you don’t know what was coming, because if you knew, you would probably run away screaming,” Robin says. “But like everything else, it’s a progression where you look back and think, ‘I don’t know how we got here.’ ”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>READ MORE: <a href="https://www.macleans.ca/politics/assisted-death-the-the-difficulties-around-demnetia/">The case for advance directives in assisted dying</a></strong></p></blockquote>
<p>She thinks of life in chapters divided by school years. Last fall, Jo’s mobility was fine, and they could still go to the movies or grocery shopping, though she had to ensure he stayed with the cart. He could no longer speak in full sentences then, but he could tell her his preference if she gave him options.</p>
<p>Now, Jo’s communication is mostly reduced to quiet, monosyllabic responses to yes-or-no questions, along with the occasional full phrase, often in humorous contexts. This spring, he began to use a wheelchair at the day program and on the bus, because he was having trouble navigating steps and had fallen occasionally when he misjudged the location of a chair.</p>
<p>Mostly, Jo looks like any guy in his early 40s and just like he always has, because even as he’s had to switch to comfortable clothing with no buttons or zippers, Robin has stuck close to his personal style; his wardrobe is still heavy on band T-shirts. But there’s a sort of veil in his gaze now and a relaxed softness in his facial features. When Instagram or Timehop present Robin with old photos, she can see some important source of light in Jo that’s gone now. A trip to the beach two years ago seemed ordinary, but when the photo appears, she can remember the day vividly: a postcard from another world where such things were possible. “It’s pretty devastating,” she says. “But also it’s nice to remember those times.”</p>
<div id="attachment_1145941"><p><img data-sizes="auto" src="https://www.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MAC09_JO_HAS_ALZHEIMERS03.jpg" alt="" width="810" height="810"></p><p>Jo is fed lunch at McCormick Home. (Photograph by Chris Donovan )</p></div>
<p>Doctors often use the term “insight” to discuss whether a person with dementia is aware of their condition; some people come in for an appointment furious at a spouse who keeps insisting they’re losing track of things when they’re sure they’re not. Jo was acutely aware of his illness early on, and he and Robin talked about it often. “He was just frustrated by the hand he was dealt, and he was always, always worried about being a burden,” Robin says. “We would tell him, ‘You’re not.’ ” Jo stopped having those conversations about a year ago.</p>
<p>Robin has continued to work full-time out of financial necessity and to maintain a little island of normalcy with a job she loves. There are two big reasons she’s been able to do that and still care for Jo at home: the McCormick Dementia Services day program, and her father, Kip Giles. “I literally don’t know what I would do without him,” Robin says.</p>
<p>Three years ago, she called him in Kapuskasing and asked if he would consider moving in with them for the school year. “I immediately responded within a second or two, ‘Sure, of course,’” Kip says. Robin’s mother, Kathy, had died of complications from heart problems and pneumonia in January 2015, so Kip was on his own, and his reasoning for immediately saying yes matches Robin’s explanation for her devotion to Jo: when your family is in trouble, you’re there—that’s it. “Why sit up here, 1,100 km away and be by myself, when I know my daughter needs my help?” Kip says. “Realizing that I was going to be able to help in any way that I could made me feel like a parent.”</p>
<p>One of the first times Kip met Jo was shortly after he and Robin started dating in high school, when there was a party going on next door. “I wouldn’t say he was completely inebriated, but he stumbled in the front door,” Kip says, chuckling. “My wife and I both turned and said, ‘Oh yeah?’” Jo’s home life was rough, so he more or less moved in with Robin’s family.</p>
<p>Now, each fall when Kip returns to London after spending the summer at home, it’s jarring to see the changes. His first reaction is always anger at what’s happening to Jo, though he keeps it to himself. One of Robin’s frequent refrains is, “It is what it is.” And Kip thinks …</p></div></div>

<p>I was reading an amazing Twitter thread about Bill Grundfest, founder of The Comedy Cellar and the guy who discovered some of the most famous comedians.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Had a call yesterday with the guy who discovered and advised Jon Stewart, Bill Maher, and just about every other famous comedian.</p><p>He utterly blew my mind with how he guided them early on in their careers to find their “signature move.”</p><p>Here’s everything he shared 👇</p></div>— Stew Fortier (@stewfortier) <a href="https://twitter.com/stewfortier/status/1316431056430657536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>In the thread, which includes stories of Jon Stewart, Bill Maher, and Ray Romano, the pattern is essentially:</p>



<ol><li>Bill is able to detect talent, even early on in people’s careers when they haven’t had success yet.</li><li>He’s able to zoom-in on what’s holding them back, and giving them one key piece of advice.</li><li>He <em>believed</em> in them.</li></ol>



<p>The thread focuses on the first two pieces: detecting talent and giving advice. The third piece is a little hidden, but in my mind, it’s probably the most impactful.</p>



<p>I’ve seen over and over in my career how having someone believe in you can be life-changing. I’ve sometimes been the recipient of that, sometimes a spectator, and most recently, I’ve tried to be a provider of that.</p>



<p>People can tell when you don’t believe in them, and they can tell when you do. It has an effect on their behavior, and can be self-fulfilling. This is sometimes known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect">Pygmalion effect</a>. Having someone believe in you is tremendously powerful. If someone believes in you, they will give you more support and more opportunity. They will boost your confidence—and I’ve seen lack of confidence hold back way too many brilliant people. And they will help create the type of <strong>psychological safety</strong> necessary for you to do your best work.</p>



<p><em>So here’s my rule as a manager. I only hire people I believe in, and I do my best to let them know I believe in them.</em></p>



<p>Just because someone has been successful, or has a lot of experience, that doesn’t necessarily mean that I believe in them. Believing in someone means that <strong>I believe their best is yet to come.</strong></p>



<p>On the other hand, believing in someone doesn’t always mean believing that they will be successful right away, or that they will be successful in the exact way or role I’ve intended for them. Believing in someone isn’t relaxing my standards or expectations of them either. That’s the <em>opposite </em>of believing in someone. In order to believe in someone, you need to maintain high standards for them, and have faith that they will meet those standards.</p>



<p>This applies beyond just managers hiring their teams. If you have the luxury of choosing where you work, you are essentially “hiring” a person as your manager, a team as your colleagues, or a company as your employer. So if you can, always choose to work with people you believe in, and people who believe in you. Work with people for whom you believe their best is yet to come. And if you lose faith in them, or you feel like they lose faith in you, do them and yourself the favor of moving on.</p>

        <p>Humans are culture creation machines. We stumble on some idea or thought, share it with other humans, and if the idea sticks and spreads faster than we forget about it, it becomes embedded in the way we do things together in the future. These are your inside jokes, your traditions and your cults. Many such ideas disappear as soon as they come, like fashion trends and popular culture. Some great ones stick around for a while and influence history, like Jazz or the Enlightenment. The few most powerful ones, like religion and democracy, embed themselves into the DNA of civilization, and they become <em>institutions</em>, inseparable from the species that conceived of it in the first place. Institutions are much harder to replace than other kinds of culture, because they go beyond simply being a part of life, and take root as an <em>infrastructural</em> piece of the way we navigate the world. They are fabric, more than threads. These institutions are pieces of culture immortalized. There’s nothing inherently inevitable about them – they are immortalized into humanity by virtue of their staying power in the way we live, and by how effectively they spread themselves amongst our communities.</p>
<p>One important invention of civilization is the university – a place with cultural and economic implications so complex I couldn’t possibly do it justice in one blog post. The university is an invention – there’s nothing fundamentally inevitable about it. The university is also an object of culture – universities play different roles in society and economy and life in different parts of the world, and at different points in history. The university is arbitrary in this way, but it’s also fundamental to the way the world works. The four-year research university has weaved itself deep into the fabric of society, from immigration and visa policies to the way science gets done to the coming-of-age culture in most developed countries. If it’s not an <em>institution</em> of civilization today, it’s rapidly becoming one.</p>
<p>But fundamental as it is, the university is still a human invention, and I still think it can be replaced. We can invent other ideas that compete in the same gene pool of culture and the same market for value, that might out-compete it to become a more dominant way we learn and build careers and find relationships. What would that new idea look like?</p>
<p>What would it take to <em>kill the university</em>?</p>
<p>Many smarter minds that I have tried to tackle this question from a problem of pure economic value proposition. When we study the university as a product – something that students pay to reap benefits of education, network, career development, and personal growth – it makes sense to try to invent ideas that compete in providing those values. So we invented better ways to learn, in the modern trade schools and bootcamps. We are inventing better ways to find a network, in cohort-based education products and professional communities. I think we’re still early in the rise of companies offering many other services in the university “package”, but it’s a matter of time.</p>
<p>No matter how competitive the newcomers to the scene, though, I think approaching the university as a bundled package of value propositions like this is only a part of the innovation. The best feature of the four-year research university isn’t career or education or personal development <em>per se</em>, but the <em>ultimate community</em>: a lifelong identity tied to a physical place, with thousands of other people, harboring hundreds of distinct self-sustaining tribes mired in decades and centuries of tradition and stories and identities. The university survives as a core <em>community infrastructure</em> of society, not just a company offering a product.</p>
<p>To kill the university, someone new must beat them at this game. Someone needs to invent a better way to build and grow this super-community of communities.</p>

<p>Universities are some of the richest, most complex communities I’ve studied, due to their place in most people’s lives. Universities claim four years, nearly full-time, of the most formative and socially instrumental period of most of our lives, and generations overlap each other going back decades, often centuries. This makes it something akin to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_soup">primordial soup</a> of communities and identities that will last the lifetime of students. All of the best ingredients for forming lasting, powerful communities are present in university campuses: a physical place, people willing to build new relationships, a shared common goal, sufficient diversity, an influx of new community members every year, and numerous activities for people to do together and build a collective identity. I could hardly imagine a more promising hotbed from which communities can spontaneously arise.</p>
<p>But a good university isn’t just one deep and lasting community. It’s a <strong>super-community</strong>, hosting the births of many more infinitely diverse communities every year interlinked by a higher level common identity of the university campus. This aspect of the university community, the <strong>ability to birth and grow new independent communities over time</strong>, is the best feature of universities.</p>
<p>I’ve written before about how <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/cellular-communities/">communities can scale by growing a hierarchy of smaller “cells” of sub-communities</a>. Many large communities are structured this way to become sustainable (imagine any regional chapter-based organization, as an easy example). The university, though, is one step above this. Because the kinds of communities created within universities are so culturally and topically diverse, many sub-communities brewed within universities grow to become great communities in their own right, creating impact in the world independently of the larger university community.</p>
<p>Included in this category of sub-communities are labs and academic groups, but also less formal kinds of communities like clubs, and the smaller networks of people that might exist within them. These sub-communities can be centered around any number of topics and purpose, from fraternities to career-oriented student organizations. The best of these sub-communities sustain themselves through generations of members who help each other navigate the life outside of the university, building each other’s careers and providing the community with a sense of direction and purpose. Because universities often claim the prime years of students' lives, these communities tend to have outsized impact to their members compared to other communities they’ll join in the future. The communities you join and build during the university years will carry for years and decades.</p>
<p>Even for those students less involved in communities and clubs in college, university communities end up shaping where they go next for work and life, and often determine the way they make sense of the world politically, philosophically, academically, and financially.</p>
<p>Good universities are factories for such communities. Beyond a career prospect or a well-rounded education or even a personal network, universities nurture these communities and provide them with fresh classes of potential new members every year, in a nearly guaranteed, self-sustaining cycle. No other piece of our culture meets the same challenge at the same scale. In this way, universities are a critical piece of the <em>community infrastructure</em> of the modern world.</p>

<p>Many years ago, at the start of my career, at a panel on entrepreneurship, I asked one of the investors gathered on stage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the productive innovation ecosystems I’ve encountered are built around universities. Do you think this is inevitable?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To my surprise, they answered, “yes.” They told me it was obvious that great startup ecosystems only form with universities at the hub of the flywheel of capital and network. I took their answer with reluctance at the time, but asking myself the same question now, it’s startlingly obvious. Universities don’t just produce research and new knowledge. Universities also produce communities and networks of optimistic and ambitious people that fuel entrepreneurial communities. These people, pulled up by their predecessors and their alumni, found new ventures. And when the best of them succeed, they’ll pull the successors in their communities to fill their shoes. And the flywheel keeps turning. Universities are <strong>community engines</strong>, attracting students from around the state or the world and producing networks and communities of people vectored towards similar purpose.</p>
<p>Productive engines as they are, universities are flawed. They’re expensive, inefficient bureaucracies that are often inequitable. I have confidence universities can be disrupted, and new, stronger ideas will take their place in society in due time – the imperfections are too fatal in the long term to brush away. There is no shortage of interesting companies and experimental policies trying to find alternatives to universities as a <em>product</em>. But whatever takes the place of universities will also have to fill the role they currently play to the communities that grow around and beyond it, into the rest of the world. And fortunately to those who manage to reinvent this community engine, with a strong and growing community by your side, building great products become much less risky.</p>
<p>Of the many ways universities tie into the fabric of our modern life, I think the most complex, and the most under-appreciated today, is that universities are astonishingly prolific, self-sustaining community factories. The reinvention of the university is inevitable, but a long road stretches ahead, and the job will not be complete until we build ourselves a better community engine.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, December 15th, 2020, Twitch officially announced that the term “simp” (along with “incel” and “virgin”) are now against the platform’s terms of services. The news spread quickly across the live streaming community which led to plenty of discussions and, of course, memes. However, the banning didn’t seem to stop Twitch users from testing the limits of the new ToS additions. Adversely, the banning led to an increase of “simp” mentions in chat to almost double the previous 15 day average. Gaming slang is often hard to control but only time will tell if Twitch can phase the term out of its users’ vocabulary. </p>



<ul><li>Prior to the banning, “simp” mentions averaged 71K mentions per day before skyrocketing to 140K on December 16th.</li><li>Streamers with emotes containing the word “simp” will now need to remove and replace them to follow ToS guidelines.</li><li>“Simp” now joins a list of words, terms, and phrases that are banned on Twitch for being derogatory, racist, sexist, or harmful. </li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            

                            <p>
                                Friday December 18, 2020 by <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/author/cristian-adam">Cristian Adam</a> | <a href="#commento">Comments</a>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>On 18th of November Kitware, has released CMake version 3.19. The <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/release/3.19.html">release notes</a> contain the list of changes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Below you have some changes that caught my attention:</p>

<p>Configuring a Qt CMake project from command line requires the presence of a few mandatory arguments. For example:</p>
<pre><code>cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=c:/Qt/6.0.0/mingw81_64 -S . -B build
</code></pre>
<p>And usually some more <code>-D</code> arguments with specific options like <code>-DQT_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON</code> or <code>-DFEATURE_system_zlib=OFF</code> and the command line becomes very long.</p>
<p>Scripts end up being used, which differ from developer to developer, and they might or not be cross-platform.</p>
<p>CMake 3.19 comes with support for <code>CMakePresets.json</code> and <code>CMakeUserPresets.json</code> files which help in this regard.</p>
<p>Here is an preset example that will build using the MinGW 8.1 compiler:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "version": 1,
  "cmakeMinimumRequired": {
    "major": 3,
    "minor": 19,
    "patch": 0
  },
  "configurePresets": [
    {
      "name": "mingw",
      "displayName": "Ninja with MinGW 8.1",
      "generator": "Ninja",
      "binaryDir": "${sourceDir}/build",
      "cacheVariables": {
        "CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE": "Release",
        "CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH": "c:/Qt/6.0.0/mingw81_64"
      },
      "environment": {
        "PATH": "c:/Qt/Tools/Ninja;c:/Qt/Tools/mingw810_64/bin;$penv{PATH}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, building a project resorts to just: <code>
cmake -S . --preset=mingw
</code></p>
<p>This has been tracked as <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21164">issue #21164</a>, and documented at <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/manual/cmake-presets.7.html">cmake-presets(7)</a></p>

<p>The Xcode generator now uses the Xcode “new build system” when generating for Xcode 12.0 or higher. See <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/variable/CMAKE_XCODE_BUILD_SYSTEM.html">CMAKE_XCODE_BUILD_SYSTEM</a> variable for Xcode build system selection.</p>
<p>Issue tracked at <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/18088">#18088</a></p>
<p>Apple Silicon is now supported (since CMake 3.19.2). See <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/variable/CMAKE_APPLE_SILICON_PROCESSOR.html">CMAKE_APPLE_SILICON_PROCESSOR</a> for selecting an architecture different than <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/variable/CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR.html">CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR</a> detected by CMake.</p>
<p>Issue tracked at <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21554">#21554</a></p>

<p>For those using Clang 11 and onwards, the <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/prop_tgt/PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES.html">PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES</a> target property was added to enable template instantiation in the precompiled header.</p>
<p>This is enabled by default and may significantly improve compilation times.</p>
<p>For example, building Qt6Base with no examples / tests on my Lenovo A485 Ryzen 7 laptop running Windows 10 with <a href="https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw">Clang-MinGW</a> 11, CMake 3.19.2. The values below are the median from four times.</p>
<p><code>-DCMAKE_PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES=OFF</code></p>
<pre><code>* build time: 919.5 s
* pch size: 397 MB
</code></pre>
<p><code>-DCMAKE_PCH_INSTANTIATE_TEMPLATES=ON</code> (default)</p>
<pre><code>* build time: 792.75 s
* pch size: 455 MB
</code></pre>
<p>That is a 13.78% speed increase, while having a 14.61% pch size increase.</p>
<p>Issue tracked at <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/21133">#21133</a></p>

<p>The <code>string()</code> command gained a set of new <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/command/string.html#json">JSON sub commands</a> that provide JSON parsing capabilities.</p>
<p>For example, parsing the <code>CMakePresets.json</code> above to get the <code>CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH</code> variable:</p>
<pre><code>file(READ CMakePresets.json cmakePresetsJson)
string(JSON prefixPath GET "${cmakePresetsJson}" configurePresets 0 cacheVariables CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH)
message("prefixPath: ${prefixPath}")
</code></pre>
<p>Issue tracked at <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/19501">#19501</a></p>

<p>The <code>cmake_language()</code> command gained a <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.19/command/cmake_language.html#defer">DEFER</a> mode to schedule command calls to occur at the end of processing a directory.</p>
<p>This way, we can call a function at the end of configuration of a <code>CMakeList.txt</code> file, for example printing a summary of <code>find_package</code> calls:</p>
<pre><code>function(at_exit)
  include(FeatureSummary)
  feature_summary(INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES WHAT
    PACKAGES_FOUND PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
    ENABLED_FEATURES DISABLED_FEATURES
  )
endfunction()
cmake_language(DEFER CALL at_exit)
</code></pre>
<p>This feature has been tracked at <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/19575">issue #19575</a> and allowed implementing some of Qt6’s functionality.</p></span></p>

Sanity UI is a component library built with React for use in composing useful, beautiful, and accessible user interfaces. We're excited to announce early access to Sanity UI. For developers and designers, this means it has now become easier to craft custom inputs and tools that are consistent with Sanity Studio.</p><p>You can start with Sanity UI with the latest version of the studio. <a href="https://www.sanity.io/ui">Go to the documentation site</a> to learn more about its components and usage.</p><p>Sanity UI can be used outside of the Studio too. We used it ourselves to accelerate <a href="https://www.sanity.io/blog/early-access-manage">the full rewrite of the project and team dashboards</a> (out in beta). </p><figure><div role="button"><div data-has-aspect="true"></div></div></figure><div data-block-key="04e01fd58869"><h2><a id="why-we-built-our-own-component-library-04e01fd58869"></a><a href="#why-we-built-our-own-component-library-04e01fd58869"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>Why we built our own component library</h2></div><p>Design systems enable teams of designers and developers to move quickly from prototyping in design tools to creating interactive interfaces for validation, testing, and use. They allow a team to encode UI choices into code and stay on the same page. Design systems also help keep things consistent and create great efficiencies when working on new features.</p><p>Thatâ€™s the case for all design systems and component libraries. Why did we decide to build our own?</p><p>Every design system comes with the opinions of its creators. Making a system like this requires making choices as to what is most important. So, instead of relying on a third-party system to power our products and sites, we struck out to write one that codified our design thoughts.</p><div data-block-key="9749062d92d4"><h3><a id="sanity-ui-is-structured-and-composable-9749062d92d4"></a><a href="#sanity-ui-is-structured-and-composable-9749062d92d4"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>Sanity UI is structured and composable</h3></div><p>Like with content, the more you think through how your system is structured, the more flexible it becomes. With constraints come freedom. Structured content is at the heart of Sanity, so it only makes sense that the heart of our design system should be of highly composable, structured components.</p><p>These UI primitives allow for a high level of composition. Each primitive only brings exactly the props it needs to function and do its job. When you combine them, you can find unexpected and powerful patterns.</p><figure><div role="button"><div data-has-aspect="true"></div></div></figure><div data-block-key="07fbde971ddd"><h3><a id="sanity-ui-is-accessibility-focused-07fbde971ddd"></a><a href="#sanity-ui-is-accessibility-focused-07fbde971ddd"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>Sanity UI is accessibility-focused</h3></div><p>In our research, it felt like many design systems were focused on making things look their best and then focusing on accessibility. For Sanity UI, we wanted to make sure we treated accessibility as a key feature and constraint for our designs. From default color schemes to carefully designed focus rings and states, accessibility is baked in.</p><p>Not every interaction comes with browser-defined accessibility. For interactive components, like dialogs, buttons, and autocomplete, we worked directly from the WAI-ARIA guidelines and patterns and tested each one using screen readers.</p><figure><div role="button"><div data-has-aspect="true"></div></div></figure><p>Creating custom interfaces makes Sanity Studio powerful for teams to define out new workflows or ways of managing data. Borrowing from the JavaScript approach to content modeling in the Studio, the theming Sanity UI will work the same way. The interface is completely defined in JavaScript, including theming and CSS.</p><p>Design and development teams can often feel like theyâ€™re speaking different languages. When language differs, miscommunication can often be the outcome. At Sanity, we believe the best products and sites are created by the intersection of disciplines. </p><p>Sanity UI is built by both designers-who-code, as well as engineers that take great pride in a solid user experience. The UI primitives, components, and properties have all been named extremely carefully. The goal is to create a system where components are named to evoke terms designers understand at use, while giving logical aspects that are familiar to developers.</p><p>With a common language, common components, and a common goal, we think all things are possible.</p><div data-block-key="edb30761f246"><h2><a id="get-started-with-early-access-edb30761f246"></a><a href="#get-started-with-early-access-edb30761f246"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 24"><path d="M0 0h24v24H0z" fill="none"></path><path fill="currentColor" d="M3.9 12c0-1.71 1.39-3.1 3.1-3.1h4V7H7c-2.76 0-5 2.24-5 5s2.24 5 5 5h4v-1.9H7c-1.71 0-3.1-1.39-3.1-3.1zM8 13h8v-2H8v2zm9-6h-4v1.9h4c1.71 0 3.1 1.39 3.1 3.1s-1.39 3.1-3.1 3.1h-4V17h4c2.76 0 5-2.24 5-5s-2.24-5-5-5z"></path></svg></a>Get started with early access</h2></div><p>Sanity UI is a work in progress, but is already making feature development easier at Sanity.

We've built <a href="https://sanity.io/ui">a full documentation site</a>, complete with interactive code playground, reference docs, and guides for getting started.

We'd love to get any and all feedback. <a href="https://slack.sanity.io/">Join the Slack community</a> and post in our #beta channel if you need help or want to provide insight into how you're using Sanity UI.</p><p>The next few months will be exciting times as we release new features around Sanity UI, including many new data bindings, components, patterns, and more.</p><figure><div role="button"><div data-has-aspect="true"></div></div></figure></div></div></div>]]>

<p>I’ve published a blog post every one of the past 100 weekdays. That’s 20 weeks of daily blogging. I wrote <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/28/2-months-of-daily-blogging/">a post about it after 8 weeks</a>, so here’s another one.</p>



<p>It’s fair to say this habit has changed my life.</p>



<ul><li>I realized I needed to look for a new job <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/10/what-the-heck-do-i-even-want/">while writing a blog post</a>. 3 months later (2 weeks ago), I started my new job.</li><li>I realized I am an extrovert, not an introvert <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/27/am-i-an-extrovert-or-an-introvert/">while writing a blog post</a>, which fundamentally <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/23/death-to-small-talk/">changed my interactions with people</a>.</li><li>That led me to understand that <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/19/avoid-avoiding/">I have mild social anxiety</a>. Since then, I’ve gotten much better at making <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/17/values-pick-2/">value-based</a> choices rather than avoidance-based.</li><li>Just 2 days ago, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/16/if-everyone-else-on-earth-disappeared-how-would-you-spend-your-time/">a post of mine</a> led to some fascinating and hilarious discussions, including <a href="https://anchor.fm/jace-and-critter/">the first episode of a podcast</a> I’m putting together with a friend.</li><li>I’ve crystallized <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/17/stop-trying-to-be-impressive-start-trying-to-be-warm/">dozens</a> of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/12/stop-changing-start-experimenting/">random</a> <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/23/parenting-doesnt-do-what-i-thought/">thoughts</a> and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/01/never-underestimate-peoples-ability-to-not-hear-you/">ideas</a>, because writing is thinking. And I’ve made connections that I never would have made otherwise. I’m not sure if I would have gotten my new job if I hadn’t already thought through answers to lots of the interview questions while writing blog posts.</li><li>I’ve made new friends with people who found a post and contacted me about it.</li></ul>



<p>It’s life changing, and it’s fun. I look forward to it every time. </p>



<p>In terms of stats, these 100 posts have gotten about 96,000 views so far. 67,000 of those views came from the top 5 posts:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/11/that-coworker-who-never-stops-refactoring/">That coworker who never stops&nbsp;refactoring</a>: 23,722 views</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/10/wiki-bankruptcy/">Wiki bankruptcy</a>: 17,998 views</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/26/5-second-feedback/">5 second feedback</a>: 12,731 views</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">Plan the sprint, not the&nbsp;project</a>: 7,571</li><li><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/03/your-calendar-should-be-an-allowlist-not-a-blocklist/">Your calendar should be an allowlist, not a&nbsp;blocklist</a>: 4,969</li></ul>



<p>The 80/20 rule at work, as always.</p>



<p>When I try to convince people to try it, they say they don’t have time or they will run out of topics. Well, prove it! <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/21/experimenting-on-myself/">Try it as an experiment</a>! </p>



<p>Here’s what I do:</p>



<ol><li>Whenever I have an interesting thought or come across an idea in a book that resonates, I make it the title of an empty blog draft. (Bonus: this helps to remember what I read!)</li><li>Every morning, when I sit down at the computer, I pick one of those drafts and write about it. Just ramble, who cares! If it’s crap, I’ll write another one tomorrow anyway.</li><li>Publish, then get started with my work day.</li></ol>



<p>That’s it. Simple, as the <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">best processes always are</a>. Anyone can do it.</p>



<p>Try it for a week and see if you want to keep it going. <a href="https://seths.blog/2018/10/the-first-1000-are-the-most-difficult/">It only gets easier as you go</a>.</p>

						<p>At the University of Copenhagen, researchers have discovered two fungal species that infect adult flies and create a hole in the abdomen of their hosts' bodies. The fungi actually live inside the flies eating them from within as they move around.The species of fly targeted by the fungi happen to be fly eaters themselves.</p><p>The two species, <em>Strongwellsea acerosa </em>and<em> </em><em>Strongwellsea tigrinae, </em>have been discovered in the Capital Area of Denmark with "S. tigrinae" in Jægerspris and "S. acerosa" in Amager.</p><p>"This is an exciting and bizarre aspect of biodiversity that we have discovered in Denmark", says Prof. Jørgen Eilenberg of the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-12/fos--ttf121520.php">according to EurekAlert</a>. "In and of itself, this mapping of new and unknown biodiversity is valuable. But at the same time, this is basic new knowledge that can serve as a basis for experimental studies of infection pathways and the bioactive substances involved."</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510523473646-eb1a45ef3409?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGZseXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Fly" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510523473646-eb1a45ef3409?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGZseXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510523473646-eb1a45ef3409?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGZseXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510523473646-eb1a45ef3409?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGZseXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1510523473646-eb1a45ef3409?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fGZseXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@osomax?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Gabriel Manlake</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Two Danish species of fly infect the fungi (Coenosia tigrina and Coenosia testacea). They create a hole in their infected hosts' abdomen. For several days, flying moves are released from the hole as fungal spores are released and are drifting towards new victims. For instance, if a fly is going by, it risks getting infected. The fungi are fed from the back of the fly's body to their very ends. The fly lies behind it after a few days and spasms its final hours.</p><p>These fungi's ability to keep flies fresh as long as they are eaten from within for days has led researchers to speculate that these fungi can create substances that "dope" their hosts. Analysis of other fungi infecting cicadas indicates that drugs similar to amphetamines are involved.</p>

<p>This is the mixing desk used by George Martin for the Beatles’ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Sergeant Pepper album (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krnPj-jjpWY" target="_blank">Sergeant Pepper album</a>. You’ll notice the mixing desk has just 4 channels. Compare this to modern-day studios, where producers have access to unlimited channels of audio thanks to computers and digital audio workstations. It took just 4 tracks and creative tape manipulation to produce this masterpiece of an album. Modern-day producers: Take a screenshot of this image for inspiration and as a reminder of what’s possible with less in a world of overproduction. </p>

<p>Daphne Oram was co-founder of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.soundonsound.com/people/story-bbc-radiophonic-workshop" target="_blank">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a> and a pioneer of musique concrète in the UK. In 1948, intrigued by the possibilities of manipulating magnetic tape, Oram began building special equipment for experiments. Those experiments led Oram to create a unique technique dubbed “Oramics.” In Oram’s words: “Oramics consisted of drawing onto a set of ten sprocketed synchronized strips of 35mm film which covered a series of photo-electric cells that in turn generated an electrical charge to control the sound frequency, timbre, amplitude and duration.” Incredible music experimentalist.

<p>Transforming black-and-white images from the past to show music creators and studios in color is interesting. What would be even more interesting? Resurrecting audio from the past that’s currently unplayable and locked inside encrypted objects like disks, cylinders, and other audio relics from the past.

    <section>
      <div id="preamble">
<div>

<p>Before we start, think about this question: do we really need the inverse of a general matrix?</p>
<p>I came to this problem when writing a math library for my game engine. If you are making a game or 3D application, we use 4x4 matrix for object transform, which is a combination of 3D translation, rotation and scale. If most of your matrices are used as transform matrices, because of their special property, we have a fast route for calculating their inverse. In fact transform matrix inverse is only 50% of the cost compared to the optimized general matrix inverse. In the first half of this post we will talk about transform matrix.  In the second half we will dive in and explain the SIMD version of general 4x4 matrix inverse, and we compare the performance of our method with commonly used math libraries from UE4, Eigen and DirectX Math.</p>
<p>The matrices used in this post are row major. This is mainly for (1) easier to demonstrate and visualize with matrix data layout; (2) easier to compare with other math library. The same matrix inverse function works for both row major and column major, because \(A^{-1}=((A^{T})^{-1})^{T}\) (inverse is the same as transpose, inverse then transpose again). However if you are a column major guy like myself, I have a full-on column major version for you in <a href="#Appendix">[Appendix]</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_transform_matrix_inverse">Transform Matrix Inverse</h3>
<p>The transform matrix we are talking about here is defined as following:</p>
<div>
<p>
\[M=\left( \begin{matrix} a\vec{X} &amp; 0 \\ b\vec{Y} &amp; 0 \\ c\vec{Z} &amp; 0 \\ \vec{T} &amp; 1 \\ \end{matrix} \right) = \left( \begin{matrix} aX_0 &amp; aX_1 &amp; aX_2 &amp; 0 \\ bY_0 &amp; bY_1 &amp; bY_2 &amp; 0 \\ cZ_0 &amp; cZ_1 &amp; cZ_2 &amp; 0 \\ T_0 &amp; T_1 &amp; T_2 &amp; 1 \\ \end{matrix} \right)\]
</p>
</div>
<p>The first 3 component of the last row is the translation \(\vec{T}\). The top left 3x3 sub-matrix is the scaled rotation matrix, with each row as a scaled axis. We have \(\vec{X}\cdot\vec{Y}=\vec{X}\cdot\vec{Z}=\vec{Y}\cdot\vec{Z}=0\), and \(\left|\vec{X}\right|=\left|\vec{Y}\right|=\left|\vec{Z}\right|=1\). And the scale is \((a,b,c)\).</p>
<p>Most matrices in the game are of this form. For example, \(M\) represents a local to world transform, \(\vec{X}\), \(\vec{Y}\), \(\vec{Z}\) are your local space axes. If you have a point \(\vec{P}(P_0,P_1,P_2)\), and you want to transform it from local space to world space, you do this:</p>
<div>
<p>
\[\vec{P'}=P_0a\vec{X}+P_1b\vec{Y}+P_2c\vec{Z}+\vec{T}\]
</p>
</div>
<p>This is the same as extend \(\vec{P}\) to a 4 component vector \(\vec{P}(P_0,P_1,P_2,1)\) and multiply by matrix \(M\). Now what does inverse matrix \(M^{-1}\) mean? In this case it represents a world to local transform, so if we multiply \(\vec{P'}\) by \(M^{-1}\), we should get \(\vec{P}\) back. How do we transform the point \(\vec{P'}\) from world space back in local space? We subtract the local space origin (aka the translation \(\vec{T}\)), then dot each axes to get its local space coordinate and rescale it:</p>
<div>
<p>
\[\begin{align*}
\vec{P}&amp;=(\frac{1}{a}(\vec{P'}-\vec{T})\cdot\vec{X},\frac{1}{b}(\vec{P'}-\vec{T})\cdot\vec{Y},\frac{1}{c}(\vec{P'}-\vec{T})\cdot\vec{Z})\\
&amp;=(\frac{1}{a}\vec{P'}\cdot\vec{X},\frac{1}{b}\vec{P'}\cdot\vec{Y},\frac{1}{c}\vec{P'}\cdot\vec{Z})-(\frac{1}{a}\vec{T}\cdot\vec{X},\frac{1}{b}\vec{T}\cdot\vec{Y},\frac{1}{c}\vec{T}\cdot\vec{Z})
\end{align*}\]
</p>
</div>
<p>With this, we can actually directly write the form of the inverse of our matrix.</p>
<div>
<p>
\[M^{-1}=\left( \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{a}\vec{X} &amp; \frac{1}{b}\vec{Y} &amp; \frac{1}{c}\vec{Z} &amp; \vec{0} \\ -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{a}\vec{X} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{b}\vec{Y} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{c}\vec{Z} &amp; 1 \\ \end{matrix} \right) = \left( \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{a}X_0 &amp; \frac{1}{b}Y_0 &amp; \frac{1}{c}Z_0 &amp; 0 \\ \frac{1}{a}X_1 &amp; \frac{1}{b}Y_1 &amp; \frac{1}{c}Z_1 &amp; 0 \\ \frac{1}{a}X_2 &amp; \frac{1}{b}Y_2 &amp; \frac{1}{c}Z_2 &amp; 0 \\ -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{a}\vec{X} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{b}\vec{Y} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{c}\vec{Z} &amp; 1 \\ \end{matrix} \right)\]
</p>
</div>
<p>The nice thing about transform matrix \(M\) is its first 3 rows are perpendicular to each other. Its inverse form is basically transpose the 3x3 rotation matrix, and rescale it, and change translation part by doing dot product with 3 rescaled axes. It should be easy to confirm \(MM^{-1}=I\).</p>
<p>Now let’s bake in the scale (so \(\left|\vec{X}\right|=a\),\(\left|\vec{Y}\right|=b\),\(\left|\vec{Z}\right|=c\)) and get a more generic form.</p>
<div>
<p>
\[M=\left( \begin{matrix} \vec{X} &amp; 0 \\ \vec{Y} &amp; 0 \\ \vec{Z} &amp; 0 \\ \vec{T} &amp; 1 \\ \end{matrix} \right), M^{-1}=\left( \begin{matrix} \frac{1}{{\left|\vec{X}\right|}^{2}}\vec{X} &amp; \frac{1}{{\left|\vec{Y}\right|}^{2}}\vec{Y} &amp; \frac{1}{{\left|\vec{Z}\right|}^{2}}\vec{Z} &amp; \vec{0} \\ -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{{\left|\vec{X}\right|}^{2}}\vec{X} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{{\left|\vec{Y}\right|}^{2}}\vec{Y} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\frac{1}{{\left|\vec{Z}\right|}^{2}}\vec{Z} &amp; 1 \\ \end{matrix} \right)\]
</p>
</div>
<p>Notice that for rescaling, we divide by squared size of scaled axis, instead of size, which is good news for implementation. And if our transform is of unit scale, which is also common in games, our target becomes even simpler.</p>
<div>
<p>
\[M^{-1}=\left( \begin{matrix} \vec{X} &amp; \vec{Y} &amp; \vec{Z} &amp; \vec{0} \\ -\vec{T}\cdot\vec{X} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\vec{Y} &amp; -\vec{T}\cdot\vec{Z} &amp; 1 \\ \end{matrix} \right)\]
</p>

<p>Alright, enough theory, let’s see some code. This is our matrix definition.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="cpp">__declspec(align(16)) struct Matrix4

	union
	{
		float m[4][4];
		__m128 mVec[4];
	};
};</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Before we jump in intrinsics, I would like to define a bunch of shuffle/swizzle macros. Hopefully they will make it easier to read. We also make use of faster instructions for special shuffles.</p>
<p>(Thank you <strong>Stefan Kaps</strong> for pointing out single register shuffle instruction _mm_shuffle_epi32!)</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="cpp">#define MakeShuffleMask(x,y,z,w)           (x | (y&lt;&lt;2) | (z&lt;&lt;4) | (w&lt;&lt;6))

// vec(0, 1, 2, 3) -&gt; (vec[x], vec[y], vec[z], vec[w])
#define VecSwizzleMask(vec, mask)          _mm_castsi128_ps(_mm_shuffle_epi32(_mm_castps_si128(vec), mask))
#define VecSwizzle(vec, x, y, z, w)        VecSwizzleMask(vec, MakeShuffleMask(x,y,z,w))
#define VecSwizzle1(vec, x)                VecSwizzleMask(vec, MakeShuffleMask(x,x,x,x))
// special swizzle
#define VecSwizzle_0022(vec)               _mm_moveldup_ps(vec)
#define VecSwizzle_1133(vec)               _mm_movehdup_ps(vec)

// return (vec1[x], vec1[y], vec2[z], vec2[w])
#define VecShuffle(vec1, vec2, x,y,z,w)    _mm_shuffle_ps(vec1, vec2, MakeShuffleMask(x,y,z,w))

#define VecShuffle_2323(vec1, vec2)        _mm_movehl_ps(vec2, vec1)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here is our first function to inverse transform matrix without scaling (always unit scale).</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="cpp">// Requires this matrix to be transform matrix, NoScale version requires this matrix be of scale 1
inline Matrix4 GetTransformInverseNoScale(const Matrix4&amp; inM)
{
	Matrix4 r;

	// transpose 3x3, we know m03 = m13 = m23 = 0
	__m128 t0 = VecShuffle_0101(inM.mVec[0], inM.mVec[1]); // 00, 01, 10, 11
	__m128 t1 = VecShuffle_2323(inM.mVec[0], inM.mVec[1]); // 02, 03, 12, 13
	r.mVec[0] = VecShuffle(t0, inM.mVec[2], 0,2,0,3); // 00, 10, 20, 23(=0)
	r.mVec[1] = VecShuffle(t0, inM.mVec[2], 1,3,1,3); // 01, 11, 21, 23(=0)
	r.mVec[2] = VecShuffle(t1, inM.mVec[2], 0,2,2,3); // 02, 12, 22, 23(=0)

	// last line
	r.mVec[3] =                       _mm_mul_ps(r.mVec[0], VecSwizzle1(inM.mVec[3], 0));
	r.mVec[3] = _mm_add_ps(r.mVec[3], _mm_mul_ps(r.mVec[1], VecSwizzle1(inM.mVec[3], 1)));
	r.mVec[3] = _mm_add_ps(r.mVec[3], _mm_mul_ps(r.mVec[2], VecSwizzle1(inM.mVec[3], 2)));
	r.mVec[3] = _mm_sub_ps(_mm_setr_ps(0.f, 0.f, 0.f, 1.f), r.mVec[3]);

	return r;
}</code></pre>

<p>Very straight forward. This is the fastest function you can have, it only does a transpose and some dot products. If we add in scales, it takes a little more time to do rescaling, but still pretty fast. There is a little trick for calculating squared size, we can make use of the fact that we need to transpose 3x3 rotation part anyway, do squared size after and calculate 3 axes in one go.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="cpp">#define SMALL_NUMBER		(1.e-8f)

                <div>
                    <p>Choosing Hibernate when your Java code interacts with SQL databases is widely considered the default choice. We however use the JOOQ code generator instead. Here are some of the reasons why we think it's a better choice.</p><p><strong>Schema Definition</strong></p><p>In an ideal case, you write the schema for your database in native SQL dialect, using all of your database's special features. The language-specific code is then generated off of that schema. This is what JOOQ does.</p><p>With an ORM, you end up defining your schema in Java-specific 'entity' classes using a whole bunch of annotations. &nbsp;Not only do you give up on any special features of your database's DDL, but you also now have to learn this Hibernate specific Annotation-based DSL to define your schema. It's the worst of all worlds.</p><p><strong>Transparent SQL</strong></p><p>You want the SQL statement being sent to your database as explicit and transparent as possible. ORMs turn this dial the opposite way. Many times one has to turn on debug level logging just to see what SQL statements are being generated by Hibernate code. Things like when a foreign key reference in an entity is causing data to be loaded lazily or not can be very opaque.</p><p>Not to mention, advanced database-specific functionality, like Common Table Expressions, can be tough to use with Hibernate and will probably require you to fallback to hardcoded SQL strings anyway.</p><p>JOOQ generated classes allow you to write code that looks exactly like the SQL being generated while still being type-safe. This gives you the type safety of Java while providing transparency into the query and not needing you to learn a whole new annotation-based DSL.</p><p><strong>CRUD classes</strong></p><p>The one place where ORMs shine is doing simple CRUD operations. In this case, just assigning some fields to an object and calling <code>.save()</code> on it is far simpler than manually generating <code>INSERT</code> statements. Similarly for doing simple <code>SELECT</code>s. JOOQ acknowledges this and also generates basic entity classes for each table that allow you to do the simple CRUD operations easily.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>The object-relational impedance mismatch has been a subject of much debate with ORMs like Hibernate. We think JOOQ takes the right approach to solving this problem. We wish JOOQ also generated code for languages other than Java.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><main id="genesis-content"><article aria-label="DuckTools: AWS Cost Optimization"><div>
<p>Starting from the day The Duckbill Group opened its doors, we’ve been pretty down on SaaS tools that purport to save money on the AWS bill. We’ve had several reasons that were responsible for our distaste:</p>



<ul><li>They all charge a staggering amount of money but don’t actually solve anything for you. “Yup, here’s a graph of the money you’re spending split on a new and exciting axis. Please pay me 2% of your bill in perpetuity!”</li><li>They all give the same unhelpful advice. If you’re using one of them, ask yourself sincerely: what has your AWS bill done since you rolled it out? We both know the answer.</li><li>They all are building something massive and all-encompassing, 80% of which you’ll never use.</li></ul>



<p>We’ve long believed that the most impactful place for lowering and managing AWS costs is deep into the architecture–where software can’t help–and thus Duckbill has focused on a consulting services model rather than building yet another SaaS tool. </p>



<p>As we went about helping our customers on consulting engagements, our Cloud Economists were simultaneously writing a bunch of Python scripts to address specific challenges of AWS cost management for use with specific problems we kept encountering on our client projects.</p>



<p>The tools that we built became more and more fleshed out, and now it seems that this can help people who aren’t quite ready for our deep-dive consulting services yet.</p>







<p>DuckTools is a suite of tools aimed to solve specific problems. We’re launching with two DuckTools Apps with many more planned. These apps are simple, because you shouldn’t need multiple days of training to understand what they do. They’re highly focused and easier to use. They’re not a panacea; they’re what we use internally on our consulting engagements. And we’re making them available to you.</p>



<p>Oh, and the best part: Unlike pretty much every other option out there, we charge a fixed monthly fee for these apps, regardless of how big or small your AWS bill is. We don’t feel we need to charge you a couple of million bucks a year just because you spun up more EC2 instances than someone else did.</p>



<h2>Savings Plan Calculator</h2>



<p>One of the biggest frustrations our clients have with Savings Plans is determining and modeling the right commitment level for a Savings Plan purchase. The AWS Savings Plan Recommendation system provides options to bootstrap a recommendation on the basis of the past 7 days, past 30 days, or past 60 days, and then provides an hourly commit to cover the compute for that time.</p>



<p>This leaves some very important questions unanswered:</p>



<ul><li>What do the savings and total spend look like if the customer purchases half the recommended commit? No idea–the console can’t tell you. You’ll save “some money,” but how much is anyone’s guess.</li><li>What if the best bootstrap period was a specific seven day window last month? Sucks for you, because the console can’t handle arbitrary date ranges.</li></ul>



<p>We thought those limitations were silly, so we completely reverse-engineered Savings Plans and built a proper calculator. Our calculator handles arbitrary data ranges, offers a full visualization, and features sliders to help customers do scenario modeling and find the commit they’re most comfortable with. And in case you’d rather just have the answer without any fiddling, we also calculate the best hourly commit based on your usage and appetite for spend. With this in front of you, suddenly answering “well what if we bought $X instead” takes seconds to answer instead of “let me get back to you after I rerun a bunch of reports.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SP Calc Demo" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/490992216?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="399" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2>RI Migrator</h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.duckbillgroup.com/blog/aws-begins-sunsetting-ris-replaces-them-with-something-much-much-better/" target="_blank">As we wrote</a> when the announcement came out, Savings Plans are a total game changer for AWS customers, but the migration story from Reserved Instances to Savings Plans leaves a lot to be desired. The official (and horrible) recommendation from AWS is to let your RIs expire, wait a week for the Savings Plan Recommendation to populate, and then buy the recommended commit.</p>



<p>That’s pretty silly for a number of reasons. First off, that’s seven days of running compute at full on-demand price–for some of our customers, that could be hundreds of thousands of dollars in wasted money. Second, the necessary information to recommend a comparable Savings Plan replacement is already available to AWS, which just makes this laziness on their part.</p>



<p>Our RI Migrator solves this by looking at all of the RIs set to expire in the near future and calculates the exact Savings Plan hourly commit needed to replace it, allowing customers to purchase the correct Savings Plan the same day the RI expires. That way you’re not “double paying” and wasting discounts, but you’re also not paying on-demand prices. Take a look:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="RI Migrator Demo" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/490992219?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="399" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>We’re currently seeking beta customers to provide feedback on the existing DuckTools Apps and help us design the future ones. If that’s you, just enter your information on the form below and we’ll reach out with more details.</p>

While I was living there, I took over 10,000 photos, hours of video footage, and published an article about life in Antarctica on my blog every single day. &nbsp;Here’s a brief wrapup of my time in Antarctica, with links to all of the content I produced.</p>

      Conventional wisdom says that startup equity is worthless. While most startups fail, there’s a chance your equity will become a life-changing pot of money. This guide explains how to make the most of your equity. 
    </p>
   
</section></div><h3>Let’s start with an example.</h3><div><section>    <p>
Suppose you join a Series A startup as the fifteenth employee. A few months in, and you’re feeling incredibly optimistic. Customer demand is skyrocketing; you can’t seem to build quickly enough to meet their needs. The startup has added six new employees since you joined and is frantically recruiting more—you’re already a “senior employee!” </p>
   
    <p>
You’ve been offered the opportunity to “early exercise” all of the stock options you’ve been granted. This will cost you $40,000. 
</p>
    <p>
It sounds expensive (and it is!) but say that, two years from now, your company reaches a billion dollar valuation—it’ll then cost you upwards of $400,000 to exercise this same tranche of stock options and cover all of the tax obligations. 
</p>
    <p>
Silicon Valley is full of stories where startup employees miss out on material tax savings, on the order of hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of dollars, because they ignored their equity compensation until it was too late. This guide helps you strategically maximize your upside as an early startup employee at a fast-growing company.
</p>
   
</section></div></div><div><h3>Deciding to exercise</h3><div><section>


    <p>
      Exercising your stock options represents a high-risk, potentially high-reward investment in your company. At a high level, here are the pros and cons of making such an investment: 
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Pros</b>    </p>

      
      <p>With the 409A rising, you’re incentivized to exercise 
        <span>sooner rather than later.<label for="sn-srtl"></label></span>
        
        <span>Furthermore, your options do expire eventually, so you can’t put off exercising them indefinitely.</span>
        This will kickstart the long-term capital gains clock and break your 
        <span>golden handcuffs.<label for="sn-goldenh"></label></span>
        
        <span>The term golden handcuffs refers to compensation incentives that discourage you from leaving your company. While your equity may pose a large reward, if you cannot afford to exercise it, you’re monetarily encouraged to stay at your company until at least the IPO.</span>
        </p>

    <p>
      <b>Cons</b>    </p>

      <p>Investing capital into stock directly tied to your single source of income greatly increases your overall concentration in a risky, illiquid asset.</p>
     
      <p><b>To answer the question of whether or not you should exercise, consider the following: </b></p>
      
</section></div><h4>1. Your liquidity constraints<br></h4><div><section>
       <p>Your liquidity constraints will limit the number of options that you are able to exercise. To determine these constraints, audit your personal finances. Consider metrics such as your current liquidity, movable assets, near-term liabilities, and financial goals.</p>
       <p>Cash flow timing plays an important role, as startups often take 5-10 years to exit (if ever). Investing in your startup therefore comes with a significant opportunity cost: you could deploy this same capital into other opportunities (e.g., public stocks or real estate) that could generate steady, dependable returns over the course of those 5-10 years. You’re really looking to come up with a projected, probabilistic return on investment for exercising your stock options (and compare that to your broader financial picture).</p>

Your view of the company<br></h4><div><section>
        <p>In deciding how much of stock to purchase, you are essentially quantifying your level of optimism in your company. While you’re unlikely to have access to every line-item on your company’s income statement, you do likely have access to key figures (e.g., revenue trends) to inform your analysis. In the end, you need to form your personal investment thesis—Why will your company win? What will prevent you from succeeding? What’s the best case scenario?</p>
        <p>At the same time, keep in mind that even startups with the most seemingly promising trajectories can stumble. WeWork is an obvious example: in early 2019, it was valued at $47 billion and was filing for an IPO. By the end of the year, its valuation had dropped to $8 billion. Pebble went from a $740 million valuation in 2015 to $40 million by 2016. Juul went from $38 billion in 2018 to $12 billion in 2020. Employees who exercised their options at the higher valuations fell out of the money (and overpaid in taxes).</p>

</section></div><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val.png" loading="lazy" width="720" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 92vw, (max-width: 991px) 88vw, 53vw" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val-p-800.png 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val-p-1080.png 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f89a88f5a23982843f8d21f/5fdbdb1f7ac0d8852e9380a8_illustration-val.png 1440w" alt=""></p><h3>Deciding</h3><div><section> 
<p>
     To quantify this decision, let’s explore another example. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You have 100,000 options, with a strike price of $1
      </li>
      <li>
        The current 409A valuation is $1.20
      </li>
      <li>
        The 409A in 3 years will be $20
      </li>
      <li>
        In 5 years, your company will IPO, and each share will be worth $100
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Here are the various strategies you can try: 
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      
      <li>
       Early exercise everything now
      </li>
      <li>
       Exercise all options in 3 years
      </li>
      <li>
        Wait until the IPO to exercise
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The table below estimates the hypothetical costs of exercising now, in 3 years, and in 5 years.
    </p>
</section></div><p>You can scroll right on the table above →</p><div><section>    
<p>
Importantly, these projections assume a successful outcome for your company and don’t account for relevant factors such as dilution, timing, and liquidation preferences. Early exercising performs worse than doing nothing in the event your startup fails. Exercising your stock options is making an investment in your company. You are betting on its future performance and if it fails, you will lose your principal investment. Consults your financial and tax advisors to make the right decision.
</p>
   
</section></div><h3>Liquidity</h3><div><section>    <p>
Deciding when to exercise is also a matter of timing. How soon do you need liquidity? It’s often possible to sell some of your equity before your company goes public (or gets acquired).    </p>
   
</section></div><h4>Tender offers<br></h4><div><section>
    <p>
From time to time, your company may hold what’s called a tender offer. In a tender offer, some  cohort of shareholders are given the opportunity to sell their shares for a set price per share. Most companies irregularly hold tender offers (once every couple of years), and generally restrict them to current employees who’ve reached some level of tenure. Deciding whether or not to opt-in the tender offer has trade-offs—every share you sell is potentially worth more (or less) in the future.     </p>
</section></div><h4>Secondary markets<br></h4><div><section>
    <p>
A number of secondary markets make it possible to sell shares to independent investors. There are also funds and brokerages designed to help you get financing to exercise your options. It’s not guaranteed that you’ll be able to participate in either of these vehicles; it depends on factors such as transfer restrictions, timing, and demand from investors.
</p></section></div><h3>Conclusion</h3><div><section>
    <p>
No matter what, early-stage startups are inherently risky. You could end up with a life-changing pot of money in five years, or your equity could end up being worthless. Furthermore, along the way, funding rounds and 409A re-evaluations can occur and change your financial situation at any time without warning. In light of this risk and uncertainty, it’s crucial that you take an active role in managing your equity strategically from the start.</p></section></div><div><p>This material presented on Compound’s Resources blog is for informational purposes only and<br>should not be construed as legal, tax, accounting or investment advice.

<p>Two very significant developments happened in Crypto this week: Coinbase <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-files-for-ipo">filed</a> in preparation for an IPO, and the US FinCEN released a new <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-28437.pdf">proposal</a> effectively mandating KYC for unhosted wallets. Together, we believe these developments would have profound implications for the crypto space. </p>



<p>While Coinbase has always had high standards to list coins on its platform, as a public company, such a key revenue-generating activity for the company could see meaningful changes. The “Coinbase pump” could get a totally new meaning in the Crypto space – the extreme scenario could be that the “pure crypto” world – coins and teams that uphold privacy and censorship resistance as the key values that blockchains stand for – could move away from the Coinbase world altogether. The scenario at the other extreme, where most coins do what it takes to move over to the “official” side – also accelerated by Wall Street’s expectations on a newly public Coinbase – forcing the other coins fade into irrelevance – is also possible. </p>



<p>The other significant development is FinCEN’s proposal – that transactions from regulated exchanges to individual wallets not subject to regulation (as well as unregulated foreign exchanges) should be subject to an existing automatic reporting requirement – Currency Transaction Reports (CTR) for cash transactions (<a href="https://www.coincenter.org/a-midnight-rule-for-cryptocurrency-transaction-reports/">Source</a>), </p>



<p>In summary, the proposed rules would</p>



<ol><li>“Require banks and money service businesses (‘MSBs’) to submit reports, keep records, and verify the identity of customers” who make crypto transactions into unhosted (read: private) wallets.</li><li>Require that “convertible virtual currency” and “legal tender digital assets” be classified as “monetary instruments” and are therefore subject to the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).</li><li>Require that any transaction(s) totaling more than $10,000 in a 24-hour period  be reported to FinCEN, a bureau of the US Treasury Department, and that customer’s identity must be verified; many transactions would require a lower threshold of $3,000. Know-your-customer (KYC) rules, then, apply to even private crypto wallets.</li></ol>



<p><a href="https://decrypt.co/52021/us-treasury-apply-bank-secrecy-act-rules-crypto-wallets">Source</a></p>



<p>These two developments, along with Facebook’s Diem could very well end up defining a “new Crypto” – at least for the US –  a new asset class that is completely regulated, that <em>looks</em> like the “old Crypto” – but does not <em>feel</em> like it. But the new Crypto could be a fun new world  – enabling a new generation that would clearly see digital assets as a category of things to own, along with physical and financial assets, and decentralized in the sense that it is not owned or operated by one party – and censorship resistance and privacy could become concepts that might just need to wait a lot longer. </p>



<p>As we enter this new era in Crypto, it would be helpful to remember this: A list of wallets with names and addresses, with Bitcoin balances that add up to 21 million, is probably not what Satoshi had in mind when he/she/they hit publish on that white paper in 2008. That said, a promising new era beckons the space, and crypto being crypto, it will be exciting!</p>

<p>“In crypto, the price is the news” said a smart person on Twitter.  Today, it most definitely is. With Bitcoin blowing past 20K USD and folks in technology and finance struggling to fit narratives to price changes, it is important that in the midst of all the noise around price we don’t lose sight of a very significant and impactful paradigm shift that Bitcoin is an instance of: Decentralization.</p>



<p>The ‘Digital Gold’ narrative has given a very effective model for most of us to understand Bitcoin. But the simplicity of this model is also its curse – it mostly hides the actual promise that Bitcoin represents – that trust can indeed be decentralized, and a ‘hubless’ world is very much possible. In fact, in a digital world where we all increasingly understand that “we are the product” – a move towards such a hubless economy might be inevitable.</p>



<p>It will help to remember that Decentralization is not a discrete point in the space of how economies work, but a continuous spectrum. The most recent changes in economic models that we have witnessed (Hotel chains to AirBnB, Taxi companies to Uber) tell us that directionally, we are definitely moving towards a peer-to-peer (P2P) model for many economic functions – and while there might be attempts to decentralize most functions (very comparable to the Internet), the ones where a P2P model would be the best fit, the model will stick. Crypto (and the token model representing ownership/utility/governance) just happens to be the current transactional framework that enables such economies to function. There will be more. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, Bitcoin – the first instance of this shift – happens to address a very tricky concept: Money. The fact that many of the early cryptocurrencies that came after Bitcoin chose to just refine the concept – improving what Bitcoin did, on parameters like scalability, privacy and programmability, but still focusing on the concept of Money – brought a lot of skepticism and negative commentary to the space. Obviously, if you put anonymity and Money in the same sentence, the interpretations cannot be very positive. The 2017 ICO boom, where many players chose to ignore the regulations set by governments and organizations that oversee fundraising, added strength to the perception that decentralizing trust is not a good idea – and made many smart people both in technology and finance just stay away from Crypto.</p>



<p>So here is the one good thing that the price of Bitcoin does to the space: it brings the attention back. And while we have the attention, it is important for us to ask: If the Internet – with its promise of disintermediation – deserved a chance, if the sharing economy – with its promise of providing more economic opportunities to individuals – deserved a chance, then, with its promise of a P2P world with no hubs that might misuse our trust for profit – Decentralization Deserves a Chance?   </p>

	<p>
		<em>How do you design good abstractions? By using abstractions that already exist.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		When I was a boy, I had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassette_deck">cassette tape player</a>. It came with playback controls like these:
	</p>
	<p>
		<img src="https://blog.ploeh.dk/content/binary/playback-controls.png" alt="Rewind, play/pause, and fast forward symbols.">
	</p>
	<p>
		Soon after cassette players had become widely adopted, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videocassette_recorder">VCR</a> manufacturers figured out that they could reuse those symbols to make their machines easier to use. Everyone could play a video tape, but 'no one' could 'program' them, because, while playback controls were already universally understood by consumers, each VCR came with its own proprietary interface for 'programming'.
	</p>
	<p>
		Then came <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_player">CD players</a>. Same controls.
	</p>
	<p>
		MP3 players. Same controls.
	</p>
	<p>
		Streaming audio and video players. Same controls.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you download an app that plays music, odds are that you'll find it easy to get started playing music. One reason is that all playback apps seem to have the same common set of controls. It's an abstraction that you already know.
	</p>

		Understanding source code <a href="#b07a5341dd654a529ea45517c4e80aff" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		As I explain in my <a href="https://cleancoders.com/episode/humane-code-real-episode-1/show">Humane Code</a> video, you can't program without abstractions. To summarise, in <a href="http://amzn.to/19W4JHk">the words of Robert C. Martin</a>
		</p><blockquote>
			"Abstraction is the elimination of the irrelevant and the amplification of the essential"
		</blockquote><p>
		With such abstractions, source code becomes easier to understand. Like everything else, there's no silver bullet, but good coding abstractions can save you much grief, and make it easier to understand big and complex code bases.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not only can a good abstraction shield you from having to understand all the details in a big system, but if you're familiar with the abstraction, you may be able to quickly get up to speed.
	</p>
	<p>
		While the above definition is great for identifying a good abstraction, it doesn't tell you how to create one.
	</p>
	<h3 id="d0a8ec8fa11e4455bbed098d9a61c24c">
		Design patterns <a href="#d0a8ec8fa11e4455bbed098d9a61c24c" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="http://amzn.to/XBYukB">Design Patterns</a> explains that a design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. As I interpret the original intent of the Gang of Four, the book was an attempt to collect and abstract solutions that were repeatedly observed 'in the wild'. The design patterns in the book are <em>descriptive</em>, not prescriptive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Design patterns are useful in two ways:
		</p><ul>
			<li>They offer solutions</li>
			<li>They form a vocabulary</li>
		</ul><p>
		In my opinion, however, people often overlook the second advantage. Programmers are often eager to find <em>solutions</em>. "I have a problem; what's the solution? Oh, here's a design pattern that fits!"
	</p>
	<p>
		I have no problems with ready-made solutions, but I think that the other advantage may be even bigger. When you're looking at unfamiliar source code, you struggle to understand how it's structured, and what it does. If, hypothetically, you discover that pieces of that unfamiliar source code follows a design pattern that you know, then understanding the code becomes much easier.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are two criteria for this to happen:
		</p><ul>
			<li>The reader (you) must already know the pattern</li>
			<li>The original author (also you?) must have implemented the pattern without any surprising deviations</li>
		</ul><p>
		As a programmer (code author), you can help readers (users) of your code. Don't use every design pattern in the book, but when you use one, make it as obvious to the reader as you can: Use the terminology, class names, and so on from the book. Add comments where your naming deviates. Add links that the novice user can follow to learn more.
	</p>
	<h3 id="3f4cb22e7a8642cd9938c89b22c098bf">
		Ambiguous specification <a href="#3f4cb22e7a8642cd9938c89b22c098bf" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		Programming to a well-known abstraction is a force multiplier, but it does require that those two conditions are satisfied: prior knowledge, and correct implementation.
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't know how to solve the <em>prior knowledge</em> requirement, other than to tell you to study. I do, however, think that it's possible to formalise some of the known design patterns.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most design patterns are described in some depth. They come with sections on motivation, when to use and not to use, diagrams, and example code. Furthermore, they also come with an overview of <em>variations</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Picture this: as a reader, you've just identified that the code you're looking at is an implementation of a design pattern. Then you realise that it isn't structured like you'd expect, or that its behaviour surprises you. Was the author incompetent, after all?
	</p>
	<p>
		While you're inclined to believe the worst about your fellow (wo)man, you look up the original pattern, and there it is: the author is using a variation of the pattern.
	</p>
	<p>
		Design patterns are ambiguous.
	</p>
	<h3 id="a90284d241c4463583401504395a4a8a">
		Universal abstractions <a href="#a90284d241c4463583401504395a4a8a" title="permalink">#</a>
	</h3>
	<p>
		<em>Design Patterns</em> was a great effort in 1994, and I've personally benefited from it. The catalogue was an attempt to discover good abstractions.
	</p>
	<p>
		What's a good abstraction? As already quoted, it's a model that amplifies the essentials, etcetera. I think a good abstraction should also be <em>intuitive</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		What's the most intuitive abstractions ever?
	</p>
	<p>
		Mathematics.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stay with me, please. If you're a normal reader of my blog, you're most likely an 'industry programmer' or <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2012/12/18/RangersandZookeepers">enterprise developer</a>. You're not interested in mathematics. Perhaps mathematics even turns you off, and at the very least, you never had use for mathematics in programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may not find <em>n</em>-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_topology">differential topology</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_calculus">stochastic calculus</a>, intuitive, but that's not the kind of mathematics I have in mind.
	</p>
	<p>
		Basic arithmetic is intuitive. You know: <em>1 + 3 = 4</em>, or <em>3 * 4 = 12</em>. In fact, it's <em>so intuitive</em> that you can't formally prove it -without <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom">axioms</a>, that is. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">These axioms</a> are unprovable; you must take them at face value, but you'll readily do that because they're <em>so intuitive</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mathematics is a big structure, but it's all based on intuitive axioms. Mathematics is intuitive.
	</p>
	<p>
		Writers before me have celebrated the power of mathematical abstraction in programming. For instance, in <a href="http://amzn.to/WBCwx7">Domain-Driven Design</a> Eric Evans discusses how <em>Closure of Operations</em> leads to object models reminiscent of arithmetic. If you can design <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ValueObject.html">Value Objects</a> in such a way that you can somehow 'add' them together, you have an intuitive and powerful abstraction.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that there's more than one way to combine numbers. You can add them together, but you can also multiply them. Could there be a common abstraction for that? What about objects that can somehow be combined, even if they aren't 'number-like'? The generalisation of such operations is a branch of mathematics called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">category theory</a>, and it has turned out to be productive when applied to functional programming. <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> is the most prominent example.
	</p>
	<p>
		By an interesting coincidence, the 'things' in category theory are called <em>objects</em>, and while they aren't objects in the sense that we think of in object-oriented design, there <em>is</em> some equivalence. Category theory concerns itself with how objects map to other objects. A functional programmer would interpret such <em>morphisms</em> as functions, but in a sense, you can also think of them as well-defined behaviour that's associated with data.
	</p>
	<p>
		The objects of category theory are universal abstractions. Some of them, it turns out, coincide with known design patterns. The difference is, however, that category theory concepts are governed by specific laws. In order to be a functor, for example, an object must obey certain simple and intuitive laws. This makes the category theory concepts more specific, and less ambiguous, than design patterns.

		I believe that learning about these universal abstractions is the next step in software design. If you know design patterns, you have a vocabulary, but the details are still open to interpretation. If you know category theory, you have a better vocabulary. Just like design patterns, you have to learn these things, but once you've learned them, you've learned something that transcends a particular software library, a particular framework, a particular programming language. Learning about functors, monoids, and so on, is a good investment, because these concepts are rooted in mathematics, not any particular technology.

<p><span>When you run into a problem, a bug in your code, how do you try to fix it?</span></p>



<p><span>Do you try to debug the problem, in order to figure out what the root cause is? Do you use tools like debuggers, loggers or code inspections, in order to better understand where and what is causing the problem, and then carefully analyze the best way to fix it?</span></p>



<p><span>Or do you make random changes to random parts of your code, see if that fixes anything, and repeat the above loop over and over again until things start working?</span></p>



<p><span>I like to call the latter approach </span><i>“</i><i><span>Evolutionary Programming</span></i><span>“. Comparing this style of programming to evolution is probably giving it too much credit, but it’s actually a pretty apt analogy. Evolution, through random mutation and natural selection, is the polar opposite of </span><a rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design" target="_blank">Intelligent Design</a><span>. Evolution has no sense of analysis, design or intelligence. It simply mutates random portions of your code (DNA), keeps the changes that “made things better,” discards the rest, and keeps looping through this forever until it gets to something successful.</span></p>



<p><span>Such an evolutionary approach is already being used in specific subdomains, such as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Machine Learning</a><span> and AI development. Maybe one day, someone will figure out how to make the evolutionary approach work in mainstream Java programming as well. However, that day is certainly not today. If you’re a programmer and your personal approach to fixing bugs is to rely on the Evolutionary Method, don’t. You’re doing something very very wrong.</span></p>



<p><i><span>“But evolution works”</span></i><span> you may argue. </span><i><span>“If it can produce something as complex as human beings, why not use that same method in my daily programming?”</span></i><span> Well, consider this:</span></p>



<ul><li>It took evolution a billion years to accomplish what software developers were able to accomplish in decades. That’s a 10000000x difference in development velocity.</li><li><span>The end-product of evolution is something so complex, that no human mind can understand it. Consider the </span>millennia<span> that men have spent studying biology &amp; medicine, and we’ve only just started to scratch the surface in the past century.</span></li><li><span>The systems produced by evolution are so interconnected and tightly coupled, that it’s impossible to fix one problem with introducing 100 others. If you need proof of this, look at the list of side-effects that accompany any medical drug.</span></li></ul>



<p><span>I bring up this topic, because I just witnessed it first hand during an interview with an undoubtedly bright candidate. After 40 minutes of building a complex data-structure, it came time to test his creation. He knocked a few easy bugs out of the way in the first few iterations, but hit a brick wall on a more complicated bug. </span></p>



<p><span>Instead of digging deeper into the code in order to understand what it was doing, or using the debug tools in order to narrow down the specific code-block which was showing buggy behavior, he decided to fork off an evolutionary branch. He started mutating random parts of his code, and rerunning, just to see if that somehow fixed things. After 15 minutes without any progress whatsoever, he gave up and was even more confused than when he started.</span></p>



<p><span>A short while later, when trying to debug his code myself, I realized that he actually had a typo in his test-input. Turns out his code was right all along. But by focusing all his efforts on fixing a non-existent bug, instead of trying to understand the real cause of the error, he ended up getting further and further away from the solution with each step.</span></p>



<p><span>If you’re somebody with no aptitude whatsoever for analyzing systems, the evolutionary approach might be your best remaining option. But if your intellectual capacity is indeed lacking so significantly, you really should reconsider your career choice. A different profession, such as politics, might be more up your alley. Maybe one day, someone will build an AI that is capable of developing software using an evolutionary approach. Such a system may actually be successful, because computers can be massively scaled out and parallelized. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of your labor.</span></p>



<p><span>The next time you hit a problem, don’t just make random changes until something somehow starts working. Such an approach may work in the ultra-short-term, but it’s only going to produce spaghetti code that no one else will be able to understand, reuse or improve upon. You’re not a force of nature, nor are you a robot. Leave evolution to the science textbooks and start practicing some intelligent design.</span></p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Hi! I'm Marcel, web developer at <a href="https://www.q42.com/">Q42</a> and creator of the <a href="https://micr.io/">Micrio storytelling platform</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015, I started developing a JavaScript viewer for ultra high resolution 2D and 360° images with added markers, tours, audio, and more. Since then, I've been pushing to find the best balance between hardware performance, minimal CPU and bandwidth use, and compatibility for older browsers to deliver a sharp and high quality viewing experience.</p>
<p>For Micrio, it is vital that the performance on the client's browser is as good as possible. The reason for this is very simple: when you are being told a story, or watching a movie, even <em>a single frameskip</em> immediately takes you out of your experience.</p>
<p>Since Micrio is being used for an <a href="https://micr.io/showcases">ever growing list</a> of awesome projects, the most important thing is that for whoever visits a Micrio project, it must work, and <em>work well</em>: delivering fast load times, and a butter smooth interactive experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm) is the ability for your browser to run <em>compiled</em> code at (near-) native speeds. It is now recognised by the W3C as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/12/pressrelease-wasm-rec.html.en">4th official web programming language</a>, after HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>With it, you can run compiled code written in a variety of programming languages (C/C++, Rust, Go, AssemblyScript, <a href="https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-wasm-langs">and many more</a>) in your browser, without any need for plugins.</p>
<p>Finding out about Wasm in late 2019 really made me want to try it out. Could I use this tech to make the Micrio client run smoother than the current version does? Would I need to rewrite everything in C++, and if so, how would that work? Would the effort be worth the gains it would give me? And not in the least.. <em>how does it work!?</em></p>
<p>This article describes my journey from upgrading the Micrio <strong>JavaScript-only client to use WebAssembly</strong>, with the hopes of improving performance, and taking my code to the next level.</p>
<h3 id="thecurrentversion">The current version</h3>
<p>To give a rough idea about the tech stack of the current latest JS-only revision of Micrio (<a href="https://b.micr.io/micrio-2.9.min.js">version 2.9</a>): This library as a single JS file works on all semi-modern browsers, including even Internet Explorer 10 for 2D, and IE 11 for 360° images.</p>
<p>It uses Canvas2D for the rendering of 2D images, and <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a>/WebGL rendering for 360° images. Written in <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=es6">ES6 JavaScript</a> (or ECMAScript 6, the latest version of JavaScript), it still <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler">compiles</a> to ES5 to support Internet Explorer 11.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, displaying a <a href="https://micr.io/i/xCSYV/">231.250 x 193.750 pixel image</a> in your browser in a matter of milliseconds, allowing the user to freely zoom in and navigate, requires a little bit of processing power.</p>
<p>Now, Micrio 2.9 <em>isn't bad</em>. It runs pretty smoothly on all devices. But with WebAssembly around the corner, allowing all calculations to be done at native CPU speeds, this could potentially make a big difference in making Micrio's performance even better, and could improve the code architecture a lot.</p>
<p>And, perhaps, this could also mark the setup for a new major version, where I will draw a clear line and drop all compatibility and polyfills for older browsers: <strong>Micrio 3.0</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="firstrewritecandemscripten">First Rewrite: C++ and emscripten</h2>
<p>As a first step into the world of WebAssembly, getting to know the ecosystem, I started to play around with <a href="https://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a>. With it, you can take almost any project made in C or C++, and compile it to a binary <code>.wasm</code> file that your browser can natively run.</p>
<p>At this point, I didn't really have a clear image of where WebAssembly starts and ends, and how autonomously it could run inside your browser. So I started a new project from scratch to see if I could make a C++-implementation of the basic Micrio logic: a virtual <em>zoomable</em> and <em>pannable</em> image consisting of a lot of separate tiles, using a virtual camera for displaying only the tiles necessary for what the user is viewing inside your screen.</p>
<p>It turns out, emscripten already had great compatibility for <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">libsdl</a>: a low-level audio, keyboard/mouse input, and OpenGL library. Which is awesome, because I could write my code using this very well documented library, even including mouse and key inputs and WebGL rendering. Since I was also working with downloading images, I also used the <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">stb_image.h</a> image library.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/cpp.png" alt="Setting up SDL and OpenGL" title="C++ in the 21st century"></p>
<p>The largest struggle of this was picking up C++ again, never having used it outside of hobby scope many years ago. But after a few days of cursing and second guessing myself, I had a working first version with all of the most important features written with help of the SDL library:</p>
<ul>
<li>A virtual camera and all necessary viewing logic;</li>
<li>Image tiles downloading;</li>
<li>Rendering using WebGL(/OpenGL) using a simple shader;</li>
<li>Mouse event handling for panning and zooming the image;</li>
<li>Resize event handling to fit Micrio to the desired <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> HTML element</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see this version running here: <a href="https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html">https://b.micr.io/_test/wasm/index.html</a> :</p>

<h3 id="firstresults">First Results</h3>
<p>As incredibly awesome it was to see Micrio in C++ running smoothly in my browser, and even handing all the user's input, there were a few reservations, which left me with an unsatisfied feeling.</p>
<h4 id="1codingcfeltoldfashioned">1. Coding C++ felt old-fashioned</h4>
<p>Writing C++ felt like going back in time. Incredibly powerful and fully proven, but also archaic, especially for me as a web developer. I spent more time fiddling with making an optimized <code>Makefile</code> than I care to admit.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/makefile.png" alt="The emscripten C++ Makefile" title="( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"></p>
<h4 id="2thecompiledwasmbinarywasverylarge">2. The compiled <code>.wasm</code> binary was very large</h4>
<p>As great as the help of <code>libsdl</code> and <code>stb_image.h</code> were to let me use OpenGL and JPG image functions, as much did they add to the final compiled binary file. Even with all <code>emcc</code> compiler optimizations (which can even use the awesome <code>closure</code> JS compiler), the resulting WebAssembly binary file was 760KB. Compared to the JavaScript version of Micrio being around 240KB, this was a major setback. These libraries packed a lot of functionalities that were not necessary for Micrio, but were still included in the compiled version.</p>
<h4 id="3tilagluefile">3. TIL: A <em>glue</em> file</h4>
<p>This is the part where I learnt where the limits of WebAssembly start and finish. <strong>WebAssembly is not a magical self-contained binary that lets you run full applications out of the box</strong>. It actually needs to be <em>bound</em> to the browser using JavaScript.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/glued.png" alt="glue clipart"><br>
<small><a href="http://www.clker.com/clipart-13445.html">Image source</a></small></p>
<p>Where I thought that all the SDL OpenGL code in C++ would automagically be recognised by the browser: <em>wrong</em>. What <code>emscripten</code> does, is to take all OpenGL operations from C++, and <em>convert them</em> to WebGL operations your browser can understand.</p>
<p>Same with the <code>libsdl</code> mouse and keyboard-inputs: these were <strong>glued</strong> to the browser using an extra JavaScript file that would set event listeners for the specific cases, and send them to the WebAssembly binary. This separate JavaScript file was generated by the emscripten compiler, and had to be included in the HTML alongside the compiled binary <code>.wasm</code> file.</p>
<p>Everything added together, the new total of the <em>base engine</em> of Micrio was a whopping <strong>791KB</strong>; a bit too much for my liking.</p>
<h2 id="secondrewriteassemblyscript">Second Rewrite: AssemblyScript</h2>
<p>Fast forward a few months, to just after having attended the awesome <a href="https://webassembly-summit.org/">WebAssembly Summit</a> in Mountain View in February 2020. With a bundle of fresh energy and inspiration, I decided to see if I could use WebAssembly to improve the Micrio JavaScript client a second time.</p>
<p>During the WebAssembly conference, I was very impressed by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8j_ieOm4vE">synth demo</a> written in <strong><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/">AssemblyScript</a></strong>, a language created specifically for WebAssembly, using the TypeScript syntax. Basically you can write (near) TypeScript, which compiles to a <code>.wasm</code>-binary. So anyone familiar with either TypeScript or JavaScript ES6 will not have a lot of difficulties using it.</p>
<p>And the great thing-- it's all installed using <code>npm</code>, so <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/quick-start.html">getting it up and running</a> and compiling your program is super easy!</p>
<p>There are a few basic <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/types.html"><code>types</code> added in AssemblyScript</a>, which are required for compile-time optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>f64</code> / <code>f32</code> : For 64 or 32-bit floats;</li>
<li><code>i8</code> / <code>i16</code> / <code>i32</code> / <code>i64</code> : For signed <code>int</code>s, ranging in precision</li>
<li><code>u8</code> .. <code>u64</code> : For unsigned <code>int</code>s</li>

<p>This time, I wanted to see if it was possible to only let a small part of Micrio run inside WebAssembly, and still use most of the JavaScript that was already inside the client. <em>How small can we get it?</em> I decided to focus on a subset of camera functions, such as translating screen coordinates to image coordinates and vice versa. So this time no rendering, event handling, or writing shaders.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/assemblyscript.png" alt="Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript" title="My First AssemblyScript"><br>
<small><em>Simple camera functions in AssemblyScript</em></small></p>
<p>The result: a 3KB binary containing some basic math functions, that take an input and return an output. AssemblyScript offers some <em>glue-tooling</em> by providing its own <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/loader.html">Loader</a>, which will deal with importing the binary file and being able to call these functions.</p>
<p>However, this is optional and I ended up using the JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Using_the_JavaScript_API">WebAssembly API</a>, <em>neat</em>. And it turns out, this is super easy: simply use the <code>fetch</code> API to load your compiled <code>.wasm</code> file, cast it as an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>, and use the <code>WebAssembly.instantiate()</code> function to get it up and running.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelduin/Micrio.Blogpost.wasm-v3/master/img/instantiate.png" alt="Loading a wasm file" title="Gluing it yourself"></p>
<p>The compiled binary will then offer an <code>exports</code> object, containing the functions that you have exported in the AssemblyScript file, which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions.</p>
<p>Wait.. "<em>which you can immediately call from JavaScript as if they were normal functions</em>"...</p>
<p><strong>WebAssembly is running synchronously to JavaScript!</strong> 🤯</p>
<p>Having worked with WebWorkers before, I honestly thought that WebAssembly would run inside its own CPU thread, and that any function calls would be <code>async</code>. Nope, the Wasm-functions you call will return immediately!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/exports-and-imports.html#exports"><em>This is, like, powerful stuff</em>!</a></p>
<h3 id="bundlingthecompiledwasminsidethejsfile">Bundling the compiled Wasm inside the JS file</h3>
<p>Since I now had some extra performing hands on deck for Micrio that was very easy to integrate, I decided to include this minimal WebAssembly binary in the then-stable release of Micrio (2.9).</p>
<p>However, I didn't want an extra HTTP request for the Wasm binary every time someone loaded the Micrio JS. So I included a <code>base64</code> encoded version of the Wasm-file <em>inside</em> the Micrio JS, and for browsers that support it, auto-loaded that.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>In this post, we’ll see how we can flatten a list in 5 different ways. Each method has pros and cons, and varied performance. By the end of this tutorial, I hope you’ll be able to identify the most appropriate solution for your problem. The Python version used in this tutorial was 3.8 and for the tests I used <code>pytest</code>.</p>
<h2 id="flattening-a-list-with-lists-or-generators-comprehension">Flattening a List With Lists or Generators Comprehension</h2>
<p>Let’s imagine that we have a simple list of lists like this <code>[[1, 3], [2, 5], [1]]</code> and we want to flatten it. In other words, we want to make it like this <code>[1, 3, 2, 5, 1]</code>. The first way of doing that is through list/generator comprehensions. For those already familiar with them, this may sound very straightforward. What we need to do is iterate through each sub-list, then iterate over each one of them producing a single element each time. </p>
<p>The following function accepts a list as an argument and returns a generator. The reason for that is to avoid building a whole list in memory. With generators we can produce the elements on demand. </p>
<p>To make sure everything works as expected, we can assert the behavior with the <code>test_flatten</code> unit test.</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> List, Any, Iterable


<span><span>def</span> <span>flatten_gen_comp</span>(<span>lst: List[Any]</span>) -&gt; Iterable[Any]:</span>
    <span>"""Flatten a list using generators comprehensions."""</span>
    <span>return</span> (item
            <span>for</span> sublist <span>in</span> lst
            <span>for</span> item <span>in</span> sublist)


<span><span>def</span> <span>test_flatten</span>():</span>
    l = [[<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>], [<span>2</span>, <span>5</span>], [<span>1</span>]]

    <span>assert</span> list(flatten_gen_comp(l)) == [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>1</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>When we run the test we can see it passing...</p>
<pre><code>============================= test session starts ==============================

flatten.py::test_flatten PASSED                                          [100%]

============================== 1 passed in 0.01s ===============================

Process finished with exit code 0
</code></pre>
<h2 id="flattening-a-list-with-sum">Flattening a List With <code>sum</code></h2>
<p>The second strategy is a bit unconventional and, truth to be told, very "magical". It turns out, we can use the function <code>sum</code> to flatten a list. Doing that is quite simple and concise, we pass the list as an argument along an empty list. The following function illustrates that.</p>
<p>If you’re curious about this approach, I discuss it in more detail in the <a target="_blank" href="https://miguendes.me/5-hidden-python-features-you-probably-never-heard-of#can-you-flat-this-list">5 Hidden Python Features You Probably Never Heard Of</a> post.</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> List, Any, Iterable


<span><span>def</span> <span>flatten_sum</span>(<span>lst: List[Any]</span>) -&gt; Iterable[Any]:</span>
    <span>"""Flatten a list using sum."""</span>
    <span>return</span> sum(lst, [])


<span><span>def</span> <span>test_flatten</span>():</span>
    l = [[<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>], [<span>2</span>, <span>5</span>], [<span>1</span>]]

    <span>assert</span> list(flatten_sum(l)) == [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>1</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>And the tests pass too...</p>
<pre><code>flatten.py::test_flatten PASSED
</code></pre>
<p>Even though it seems clever, it's not a good idea to use it in production IMHO. As we'll see later, this is the worst way to flatten a list in terms of performance.</p>

<p>The third alternative is to use the <code>chain</code> function from the <code>itertools</code> module. In a nutshell, <code>chain</code> creates a single iterator from a sequence of other iterables. This function is a perfect match for our use case.</p>
<p>Equivalent implementation of <code>chain</code> taken from the  <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain">official docs</a> looks like this.</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> itertools


<span><span>def</span> <span>chain</span>(<span>*iterables</span>):</span>
    
    <span>for</span> it <span>in</span> iterables:
        <span>for</span> element <span>in</span> it:
            <span>yield</span> element
</code></pre>
<p>We can then flatten the list like so:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>def</span> <span>flatten_chain</span>(<span>lst: List[Any]</span>) -&gt; Iterable[Any]:</span>
    <span>"""Flatten a list using chain."""</span>
    <span>return</span> itertools.chain(*lst)


<span><span>def</span> <span>test_flatten</span>():</span>
    l = [[<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>], [<span>2</span>, <span>5</span>], [<span>1</span>]]

    <span>assert</span> list(flatten_chain(l)) == [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>1</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>And the test pass...</p>
<pre><code>[OMITTED]
....
flatten.py::test_flatten PASSED   
...
[OMITTED]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="flattening-irregular-lists">Flattening Irregular Lists</h2>
<p>What happens if we have a list like this <code>[[1, 3], [2, 5], 1]</code> or this <code>[1, [2, 3], [[4]], [], [[[[[[[[[5]]]]]]]]]]</code>? Unfortunately, that ends up not so well if we try to apply any of those preceding approaches. In this section, we’ll see two unique solutions for that, one recursive and the other iterative.</p>
<h3 id="the-recursive-approach">The Recursive Approach</h3>
<p>Solving the flatting problem recursively means iterating over each item and deciding if the element is already flattened or not. If so, we return it, otherwise we can call <code>flatten_recursive</code> on it. But better than words is code, so let’s see some code.</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> List, Any, Iterable


<span><span>def</span> <span>flatten_recursive</span>(<span>lst: List[Any]</span>) -&gt; Iterable[Any]:</span>
    <span>"""Flatten a list using recursion."""</span>
    <span>for</span> item <span>in</span> lst:
        <span>if</span> isinstance(item, list):
            <span>yield</span> <span>from</span> flatten_recursive(item)
        <span>else</span>:
            <span>yield</span> item

<span><span>def</span> <span>test_flatten_recursive</span>():</span>
    l = [[<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>], [<span>2</span>, <span>5</span>], <span>1</span>]

    <span>assert</span> list(flatten_recursive(l)) == [<span>1</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>5</span>, <span>1</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Bare in mind that the if <code>isinstance(item, list)</code> means it only works with lists.</p>
<h3 id="the-iterative-approach">The Iterative Approach</h3>
<p>The iterative approach is no doubt the most complex of all of them. In this approach, we’ll use a <code>deque</code> to flatten the irregular list. Quoting the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque">official docs</a>, “Deques are a generalization of stacks and queues (the name is pronounced “deck” and is short for “double-ended queue”). Deques support thread-safe, memory efficient appends and pops from either side of the deque with approximately the same O(1) performance in either direction.” </p>
<p>In other words, we can use <code>deque</code> to simulate the stacking operation of the recursive solution.</p>
<p>To go that, we’ll start just like we did in the recursion case, we’ll iterate through each element and if the element is not a list, we’ll append to the left of the <code>deque</code>. The <code>appendleft</code> method append the element to the leftmost position of the <code>deque</code>, for example:</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span>from</span> collections <span>import</span> deque

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l = deque()

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l.appendleft(<span>2</span>)

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l
deque([<span>2</span>])

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l.appendleft(<span>7</span>)

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l
deque([<span>7</span>, <span>2</span>])
</code></pre>
<p>If the element <strong>is</strong> a list, though, then we need to reverse it first to pass it to “extendleft” method, like this <code>my_deque.extendleft(reversed(item))</code>. Again, similar to a <code>list</code>, <code>extendleft</code> adds each item to the leftmost position of the <code>deque</code> in series. As a result, <code>deque</code> will add the elements in a reverse order. That’s exactly why we need to reverse the sub-list before extending left. To make things clearer, let’s see an example.</p>
<pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l = deque()

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l.extendleft([<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>])

<span>&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l
deque([<span>3</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>1</span>])
</code></pre>
<p>The final step is to iterate over the <code>deque</code> removing the leftmost element and yielding it if it’s not a list. If the element is a list, then we need to extend it left. The full implement goes like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>from</span> typing <span>import</span> List, Any, Iterable


<span><span>def</span> <span>flatten_deque</span>(<span>lst: List[Any]</span>) -&gt; Iterable[Any]:</span>
    <span>"""Flatten a list using a deque."""</span>
    q = deque()
    <span>for</span> item <span>in</span> lst:
        <span>if</span> isinstance(item, list):
            q.extendleft(reversed(item))
        <span>else</span>:
            q.appendleft(item)
        <span>while</span> q:
            elem = q.popleft()
            <span>if</span> isinstance(elem, list):
                q.extendleft(reversed(elem))
            <span>else</span>:
                <span>yield</span> elem

<span><span>def</span> <span>test_flatten_super_irregular</span>():</span>
    l = [<span>1</span>, [<span>2</span>, <span>3</span>], [<span>4</span>], [], [[[[[[[[[<span>5</span>]]]]]]]]]]

    <span>assert</span> list(flatten_deque(l)) == [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>, <span>4</span>, <span>5</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>When we run the test, it happily pass...</p>
<pre><code>============================= test session starts ==============================
...

flatten.py::test_flatten_super_irregular PASSED                          [100%]

============================== 1 passed in 0.01s ===============================
</code></pre>
<h2 id="comparing-performance">Comparing Performance</h2>
<p>As we’ve seen in the previous section, if our list is irregular we have little choice. But assuming that this is not a frequent use case, how these approaches compare in terms of performance?</p>
<p>In this last part, we’ll run a benchmark and compare which solutions perform best.</p>
<p>To do that, we can use the <code>timeit</code> module, we can invoke it in <code>IPython</code> by doing <code>%timeit [code_to_measure]</code>. The following list is the timings for each one of them. As we can see, <code>flatten_chain</code> is the fastest implementation of all. It flatted our list <code>lst</code> in <code>217 µs</code> avg. The slowest implementation is <code>flatten_sum</code>, taking around <code>30 ms</code> to flatten the same list.</p>
<p>PS: A special thanks to <a href="https://hashnode.com/@hynekcer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@hynekcer</a> who pointed out a bug in this benchmark. Since most of the functions return a generator, we need to consume all elements in order to get a better assessment. We can either iterate over the generator or create a list out of it.</p>
<h4 id="flatten-generator-comprehension">Flatten Generator Comprehension</h4>
<pre><code>In [1]: lst = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7], [8, 9]] * 1_000

<br/>
December 18, 2020 | https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/12/15/how-my-twitter-hijacks-happened/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/12/15/how-my-twitter-hijacks-happened/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>You might recall that my Twitter account was <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/16/i-lost-my-twitter-account/" data-type="post" data-id="15196">hijacked</a> and then <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/12/03/twitter-lockout-again/" data-type="post" data-id="15287">again</a> just two weeks later.</p>



<h2>The first: brute-force</h2>



<p>The  first take-over was most likely a case of brute-forcing my weak password while not having 2FA enabled. I have no excuse for either of those lapses. I had convinced myself I had 2fa enabled which made me take a (too) lax attitude to my short 8-character password that was possible to remember. Clearly, 2fa was not enabled and then the only remaining wall against the evil world was that weak password.</p>



<h2>The second time</h2>



<p>After that first hijack, I immediately changed password to a strong many-character one and I made really sure I enabled 2fa with an authenticator app and I felt safe again. Yet it would only take seventeen days until I <em><strong>again</strong></em> was locked out from my account. This second time, I could see how <em>someone had managed to change the email address</em> associated with my account (displayed when I wanted to reset my password). With the password not working and the account not having the correct email address anymore, I could not reset the password, and my 2fa status had no effect. I was locked out. Again.</p>



<p>It felt related to the first case because I’ve had my Twitter account since May 2008. I had never lost it before and then suddenly after 12+ years, within a period of three weeks, it happens twice?</p>



<h2>Why and how</h2>



<p>How this happened was a complete mystery to me. The account was restored fairly swiftly but I learned nothing from that.</p>



<p>Then someone at Twitter contacted me. After they investigated what had happened and how, I had a chat with a responsible person there and he explained for me exactly how this went down.</p>



<p>Had Twitter been hacked? Is there a way to circumvent 2FA? Were my local computer or phone compromised? No, no and no.</p>



<p>Apparently, an agent at Twitter who were going through the backlog of issues, where my previous hijack issue was still present, accidentally changed the email on my account by mistake, probably confusing it with another account in another browser tab.</p>



<p><strong>There was no outside intruder, it was just a user error.</strong></p>



<p>Okay, the cynics will say, this is what he <em>told</em> me and there is no evidence to back it up. That’s right, I’m taking his words as truth here but I also think the description matches my observations. There’s just no way for me or any outsider to verify or fact-check this.</p>



<h2>A brighter future</h2>



<p>They seem to already have identified things to improve to reduce the risk of this happening again and Michael also mentioned a few other items on their agenda that should make hijacks harder to do and help them detect suspicious behavior earlier and faster going forward. I was also happy to provide my feedback on how I think they could’ve made my lost-account experience a little better.</p>



<p>I’m relieved that the second time at least wasn’t my fault and neither of my systems are breached  or hacked (as far as I know).</p>



<p>I’ve also now properly and thoroughly gone over all my accounts on practically all online services I use and made really sure that I have 2fa enabled on them. On some of them I’ve also changed my registered email address to one with 30 random letters to make it truly impossible for any outsider to guess what I use.</p>



<p>(I’m also positively surprised by this extra level of customer care Twitter showed for me and my case.)</p>



<h2>Am I a target?</h2>



<p>I don’t think I am. I think maybe my Twitter account could be interesting to scammers since I have almost 25K followers and I have a verified account. Me personally, I work primarily with open source and most of my works is already made public. I don’t deal in business secrets. I don’t think my personal stuff attracts attackers more than anyone else does.</p>

I’ve <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2017/09/12/the-backdoor-threat/">elaborated on that before</a>. Summary: I think it is terribly hard for someone to actually manage to do it. Not because of the security of my personal systems perhaps, but because of the entire setup and all processes, signings, reviews, testing and scanning that are involved.</p>



<p>So no. I don’t think my personal systems are a valued singled out target to attackers.</p>



<p>Now, back to work!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>We invest in products to be a better version of ourselves. The same goes for companies. If we compare today’s software design to those of the old days, there is a huge difference in UI and UX. Designers today are becoming more empathetic with designs that help users get things done more efficiently.</p>
<!--more--><p>New and better design approaches have arisen to fix challenges that designers or clients might be facing.</p>
<p>The term “design thinking” for example, isn’t just a buzzword. There’s a logical reason behind it. Design thinking is now known as a creative problem-solving approach designers use to create different new values and positive impact.</p>
<p>Now, how do we approach designing for B2B SaaS with design thinking? Here’s how.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Understanding Users: Boomers vs Millennials</h2>
<p>In comparison to startups and growing businesses, B2B companies, especially matured industrial and manufacturing companies, mostly consist of an ageing workforce. This is because older workers are much more likely to have a specific set of skills revolving around particular tools, plants and systems. Manufacturing companies hold on to them to avoid being faced with a skills gap dilemma. However, while having seniors in the game is important, as the world slowly submerges into new tech and advanced software, hiring the tech-savvy and digital natives is as important to survive and stay on top.</p>
<p>When designing an enterprise software, a firm needs to keep in mind the people who are going to be using their products. In this case, designers need to create experiences that feel familiar to older workers but are, at the same time, attractive to new users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the one hand, a software interface that is familiar to the older workforce will shorten their learning process and encourage them in their journey into new tech. On the other hand, old school tools can feel like a hindrance to the younger workforce. Millennials are accustomed to tools that can be accessed anywhere at any time, like mobile apps. Making software products that meet the needs of both sides can make working together an elevated and efficient process.</p>
<h2>Design Thinking for Productivity and Safety</h2>
<p>Unlike B2C products, B2B software is much more complex due to its multiple data states, visualization options, management operations, multiple-user collaborations and system integrations with existing softwares. All of these affect every design decision made to meet one another’s requirements.</p>
<p>When dealing with complexity, sometimes the best solution is simplicity.</p>
<p>Side by side with B2C apps, one may say that B2B apps look boring. The justification is that most industrial and manufacturing firms don't invest in design for the aesthetics — they invest in design to boost productivity while keeping safety as a priority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the best examples we have that focuses on productivity and safety is our project with Honeywell’s Building Management System (BMS) after they talked to us about exploring the possibilities of real time alerts on equipment downtime as well as tracking maintenance and team performance with a mobile app.</p>
<p>Industrial and manufacturing companies often come with mountains of data that they need to monitor, manage, maintain and use in managing equipment. When designing software for such purposes, cramming these large amounts of data on a single dashboard can cause distraction and overwhelm the user. The best approach is to build data visualizations that simplify and help users make quicker decisions with lighter cognitive load.</p>
<h2>Next Step for You</h2>

    <main id="main">
        <article>
            <!-- .post-header -->
            
            
            <p><img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/sunny-pic.jpeg" alt="How we use GitLive: A junior developer's perspective"></p>
            
            <div>
                <p>I’m Sunny, and I’m a junior developer at GitLive. Since we are making a tool by developers, for developers, I wanted to share how I use our own product on a day to day basis.</p>

<h4 id="visibility">Visibility</h4>
<p>As an annoying and (relatively) useless junior developer, I have a lot of questions. Since we work in a fully remote team, picking my moments is both important and hard to do. GitLive helps me a lot with this. It shows me when people are online and what they’re working on. So ideally, I wait till someone’s online, working on the same repository I’m working on and on a similar issue… and then I ask away.</p>

<table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <td>
                <img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/same-repo.jpeg">
            </td>
            <td>
                <img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/slack-msg.jpg">
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td> 
            <p>
              Both working on the firebase repository. Bingo!
            </p>
           </td>
          <td> 
            <p>
              Look at that quick response time from Michael. 
            </p>
           </td>
        </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that in the future, messaging will be available within the GitLive window, so the context switching between instant messaging apps and code IDEs will also be eliminated.</p>

<h4 id="cherry-picking">Cherry Picking</h4>
<p>Sometimes I need uncommitted code from a teammate. With GitLive, I don’t even have to ask or disturb anyone. I just use our cherry-picking feature to see the changes they’ve made and take whatever I need.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/cherry-pick.jpg"></p><p>
      Thanks for this big chunk of code Fred.
    </p>

<h4 id="pair-programming">Pair Programming</h4>
<p>GitLive’s most useful feature for me, personally, is the collaborate feature. I’m trying to learn more about TypeScript. Pair programming with someone more experienced is a great way to do this. But pair programming remotely is a challenge… or at least it used to be. With GitLive, I can collaborate with one click, and no one has to begin a slack call and start screen sharing.</p>

<p>The convenience means that others don’t mind starting a quick collaboration session. It’s often easier than a long explanation, for both parties. In future releases, audio calls will be added to GitLive, so everything can be done within the IDE if necessary. Fred and Michael will soon be able to hear my lovely voice without even having to leave VS Code.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/baby-pic.jpeg"></p><p>
      How pair programming feels for the less experienced person.
    </p>

<h4 id="privacy">Privacy</h4>
<p>Have you ever been so embarrassed by the code you’re writing to solve a problem that you don’t want your colleagues to see? Me too. Luckily GitLive has a setting for this, so I can hide my working copy changes just in case.</p>

<p>Also, if you’re working on something important and don’t want to be disturbed, you can appear offline, or hide your activity graph from view. I’m usually the one bothering people, not the one being bothered, so this is not a problem I have myself, but a useful feature for some of you nonetheless (maybe for you Michael).</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.git.live/assets/images/posts/2020/offline-mode.jpg"></p><p>
      I don't have a good caption for this one. Please enjoy this screenshot
    </p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>If you’re a tech lead reading this (ambitious I know – but one can dream) and you’re on the fence about whether to use GitLive, at least give it a try. From my experience, having a communication tool specific to developers makes the life of your team members (especially the juniors) much easier.</p>

December 18, 2020 | https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-design-studio-2.0-released | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-design-studio-2.0-released">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><strong>We are happy to announce the release of Qt Design Studio 2.0.</strong></p>
<!--more-->
<p>Qt Design Studio is a UI design and development tool that enables designers and developers to rapidly prototype and create beautiful experiences. Both designers and developers use Qt Design Studio and this makes collaboration between the two a lot simpler and more streamlined.</p>
<div data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true"><div><p data-mce-style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 0px;"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/za9KBWcFXEw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" xml="lang" data-mce-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/za9KBWcFXEw?feature=oembed" data-mce-style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></p></div></div>

<p><span>To get an impression, you should watch this new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za9KBWcFXEw&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noopener">video created for Qt Design Studio 2.0</a>. </span><span>For detailed information about Qt Design Studio, visit the&nbsp;</span><u><a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtdesignstudio-4.14/index.html" rel="noopener">online documentation page</a></u><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>For Qt Design Studio 2.0 we concentrated on improving the user experience. We made many improvements to the UI. Finally, it is possible to lock items to protect them against unintended changes. The navigator got many usability improvements, we added a rotation tool and many small issues got fixed. For more details please <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-design-studio-2.0-beta-released" rel="noopener">refer to the beta blog post.</a></span></p>
<h3>Telemetry and Crashpad Support</h3>
<p>Qt Design Studio 2.0 comes with a crash reporter based on<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad/+/master/doc/overview_design.md" rel="noopener"> Google Crashpad</a>.<br><span>Crashpad is a mechanism for capturing, storing, and transmitting postmortem crash reports from an application to an upstream collection server.&nbsp;</span> We use <a href="https://sentry.io/security/" rel="noopener">Sentry </a>as the backend service.&nbsp;<br>By default, <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad/+/master/doc/overview_design.md" rel="noopener">Crashpad </a>does not upload the generated crash reports, since it <span>captures arbitrary contents from the crashed Qt Design Studio process memory. Therefore the dump could contain confidential information like e.g. project names. Therefore we must ask for consent and Crashpad has to be explicitly enabled, to upload the generated crash reports. Users are also able to share the locally generated crash reports manually with the<a href="https://www.qt.io/qt-support/" rel="noopener"> Qt Support team</a>.<p>The rationale behind this is that it is an unfortunate truth that any large piece of complex software will contain bugs that will cause it to occasionally crash. &nbsp;Even in the absence of bugs, drivers and incompatibilities can cause Qt Design Studio to crash.</p></span></p>
<p><span>We think that collecting crashdumps automatically is the best solution to this problem.&nbsp; It relieves the burden of manual reporting from users while capturing the hardware and software state at the time of the crash.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-04-47-35-31-PM.png"></span></p>
<p>We kindly ask our users to enable Crashpad to help us to improve the quality and stability of Qt Design Studio.</p>
<p>With Qt Design Studio 2.0 we also ship the Telemetry Plugin that is already an optional part of Qt Creator installations. The Telemetry Plugin is disabled by default and has to be explicitly enabled by the user. The Telemetry Plugin will collect <span>pseudonymous information about your system and Qt Design Studio usage. No personal data, such as names, IP addresses, MAC addresses, or project and path names are collected. However, <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/quuid.html">QUuid</a>&nbsp;objects are used to identify data records that belong to a particular user.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-04-49-10-93-PM.png"></p>
<p><span>If you accept, all collected and transmitted data is fully transparent to you. You can change the settings for collecting and transmitting data at any time. By default, no data is collected and you have to select a telemetry mode for data collection to begin. For more details please refer to the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-telemetry.html" rel="noopener">documentation</a>.<br>The Telemetry Plugin is using the Open Source library <a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kuserfeedback/html/index.html" rel="noopener">KUserFeedback</a>.<br></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>The goal of the Telemetry Plugin is to learn more about how users use Qt Design Studio. We track the frequency and usage time of particular features within the application. By providing this data to us, the users help us to improve future versions of Qt Design Studio. We get a better understanding of how our users use the product and how important a particular feature is.<br>Therefore we kindly ask our users to also enable the Telemetry Plugin to help us to improve the quality of Qt Design Studio and to better understand our users.<br></span></p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-04-03-18-99-PM.png"></p>
<h3><span>Thumbnail Generation</span></h3>
<p><span>A really useful addition is the generation of thumbnails for custom components. This means that custom components have an icon that visually resembles the component and Qt Design Studio provides a tooltip with a full preview. This helps to find the correct component and makes it more convenient to get an overview of the project and its structure. This is especially useful for large projects.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Technical Preview of Qt Bridge for Figma</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-04-31-24-02-PM.png"></p>
<p><span>With Qt Design Studio 2.0 comes a technical preview of a Qt Bridge for <a href="https://www.figma.com/" rel="noopener">Figma</a>. Figma is an interface design application with an emphasis on team collaboration.</span><br><span>The Qt Bridge for Figma is delivered with Qt Design Studio as a developer plugin that you can install to the Desktop version of Figma.&nbsp; To install the plugin you have to open the Plugin Manager of Figma and press the plus button to "Create new Plugin". Then you have to choose the Manifest.json file that comes with Qt Design Studio. After installing the plugin it can be found under Plugin/Development/QtBridge for Figma. The Qt Bridge for Figma allows users to seamlessly import their designs to Qt Design Studio from Figma. The feature set of the Qt Bridge for Figma is very similar to the&nbsp; <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtdesignstudio/qtbridge-sketch-using.html" rel="noopener">Qt Bridge for Sketch</a> and components are already supported. Qt Design Studio also supports<a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtdesignstudio/qtbridge-overview.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> import/export from other 2D and 3D graphical design tools</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-41-23-18-PM.png"></span></p>
<p>As you can see in the screenshots importing reasonable complex files from Figma to Qt Design Studio does already work. The latest documentation for the Qt Bridge for Figma can be found <a href="https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qtdesignstudio/figmaqtbridge.html" rel="noopener">here</a>.<br>Please note that Qt Bridge for Figma exports everything to a single archive. Before importing the project into Qt Design Studio you have to manually extract the archive. Then the .metainfo file can be imported. Please refer to the <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qtdesignstudio/studio-importing-2d.html" rel="noopener">documentation </a>for details on how to import 2D designs into Qt Design Studio.</p>
<h3>2D Effects Redesign</h3>

<p>With Qt Design Studio 2.0 we also changed the way 2D effects work in Qt Design Studio. The new way of how effects work is more aligned with the Qt Quick framework and also more intuitive.<span><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png?width=300&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png" width="300" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png?width=150&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png 150w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png?width=300&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png 300w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png?width=450&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png 450w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png?width=600&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png 600w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png?width=750&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png 750w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png?width=900&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-09-33-16-93-PM.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"> </span></p>
<p><span><span>Effects are no longer Qt Quick Items and are not part of the item hierarchy. Instead, effects are children of the item they affect. This makes adding effects like blur, glow, or masks easier. Effects can now simply be dragged in from the Item Library and dropped on the target item.</span><br><span>Stacking effects in a single item is not supported. If a user wants to apply multiple effects it is required to stack multiple items with one effect applied to each item.</span><br></span></p>

<h3>Logic Helper</h3>
<div><p>To make it easier to perform certain operations without having to write code we added a few Logic Helpers to Qt Design Studio. Once you add the import you can see the elements in the Item Library. These items can only be dragged into the navigator because they are not visible items. The Logic Helpers make it easy to setup Bi-Directional Bindings, map numbers to strings with a defined precision.</p><p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png?width=450&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png" width="450" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png?width=225&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png 225w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png?width=450&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png 450w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png?width=675&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png 675w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png?width=900&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png 900w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png?width=1125&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png 1125w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png?width=1350&amp;name=image-png-Dec-10-2020-10-07-21-30-PM.png 1350w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></p></div>
<p>In practice, this means that Qt Design Studio 2.0 now provides convenient building blocks that replace the occasional usage of JavaScript expressions for conditions or to properly convert numbers to strings. Instead of having to write JavaScript code in the binding editor the user can now simply use these building blocks.<br>The Logic Helpers also allow to define conditions without having to write JavaScript code and make it possible to map the range of e.g. a Timeline to a custom range of a gauge.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MCU support</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hubfs/undefined.jpeg"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-for-mcus-1.6-released" rel="noopener">Qt for MCUs 1.6 is now available</a> and Qt Design Studio supports creating projects that are limited to the feature set of <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/develop-software-microcontrollers-mcu" rel="noopener">Qt for MCUs</a>. If the user creates a <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/develop-software-microcontrollers-mcu" rel="noopener">Qt for MCUs</a> project using the correct wizards, features that are not available for <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/develop-software-microcontrollers-mcu" rel="noopener">Qt for MCUs</a>, will be also disabled in the UI. This includes many imports, everything related to Qt Quick 3D, but also many properties in the property editor will be disabled.<br>This makes it possible to fully leverage Qt Design Studio when developing projects for <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/develop-software-microcontrollers-mcu" rel="noopener">Qt for MCUs</a>. We developed the UI for a washing machine that you can find <a href="https://git.qt.io/public-demos/qtdesign-studio/-/tree/master/playground/washingMachineUI" rel="noopener">here</a>. The purpose of this demo is to show how applications targeting <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/develop-software-microcontrollers-mcu" rel="noopener">Qt for MCUs </a>can be devloped using Qt Design Studio. Our washing machine demo is also an example of an application that runs on <a href="https://www.qt.io/product/develop-software-microcontrollers-mcu" rel="noopener">Qt for MCUs</a> but also works as expected with normat Qt. The demo is developed in the subset of QML and Qt Quick that is supported on all platforms.</p>
<h3>Experimental Qt 6 support</h3>
<p>Qt Design Studio 2.0 also comes with experimental support for <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-6.0-released" rel="noopener">Qt 6</a>. While Qt Quick based projects developed with Qt Design Studio also work with Qt 6, there are a few differences on the Qt Quick 3D side.<br>Since the actual rendering and instantiation of components is done in an external process (qml2puppet), this process can be build with <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-6.0-released" rel="noopener">Qt 6</a> for full compatibility.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) designates radio frequencies in the 30 to 300 MHz band as very high frequency (VHF), and those in the 300 MHz to 3 GHz band as ultra high frequency (UHF).</p>



<p>Early small satellite and CubeSat development often involved the use of amateur radio frequencies in the VHF and UHF bands due to the low costs and high accessibility <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1109/AERO.2001.931726" target="_blank">for end users</a>.</p>



<p>The UHF and VHF bands were also chosen as the primary frequencies for telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&amp;C) in CubeSats <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MAP.2009.5338683" target="_blank">for similar reasons</a>.</p>



<p>Now, many years after the launch of the first CubeSat, various antennas have been developed at different operational frequencies depending on the requirements and applications of the end users.</p>



<p>These include several models for satellites at various sizes <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijap/2017/4940656/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including picosats</a>.</p>



<p>Most currently active CubeSats communicate with ground stations on frequency bands that correspond to amateur (HAM radio) satellite frequencies or are specifically allocated for space communication.</p>



<p>HAM radio frequencies that are typically used fall in the ranges; 145.8 MHz – 146.0 MHz in the VHF band and 435.0 MHz – 438.0 MHz in the UHF band.</p>



<p>VHF and UHF bands are often duplexed in order to increase the overall bandwidth.</p>



<p>This functionality, along with the relative simplicity of obtaining a license, makes the low bitrate VHF and UHF <a href="https://www.fer.unizg.hr/_download/repository/2018_MIPRO_Link_budget_analysis_for_a_proposed_Cubesat.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a popular choice for Cubesats [PDF]</a>.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Satellite UHF and VHF equipment experiences from early CubeSat missions</h2>



<p>One of the main causes of unsuccessful Cubesat missions is an issue related to the communication system, typically due to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thinkmind.org/download.php?articleid=spacomm_2011_3_20_30059" target="_blank">the use of non space-qualified electronics [PDF]</a> in the transceiver.</p>



<p>These issues come in different forms. Here are three examples of early CubeSat missions (as described in this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/105639/963837070-MIT.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank">2016 Master’s thesis [PDF]</a> by Stephen Joseph Shea, Jr.) that were affected by such communication system faults:</p>



<p><strong>AAU-1</strong> – launched to LEO by Aalburg University (AAU) in Denmark in 2003, AAU-1 carried a demonstration optical payload. The ground segment used an amateur radio design and the satellite transmitted Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) at 9.6 kbps at 437 MHz.</p>



<p>Issues with the radio contractors led to a change in radio system late in the process, when there was little time for extensive ground testing.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAU_CubeSat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/60/Aau-sat.jpg" alt=""></a><figcaption>The AAU-1 satellite (image credit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAU_CubeSat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikipedia</a>).</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In-orbit it was very difficult to close the link with the satellite and it was not possible to establish a consistent enough connection to complete initial handshaking, which made the satellite appear unresponsive. The mission team was only able to achieve limited functionality.</p>



<p><strong>CAPE-1</strong> – The Cajun Advanced Picosatellite Experiment (CAPE-1) was a 1U CubeSat developed at the University of Louisiana and launched in 2007.</p>



<p>The system used Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) at a frequency of 437 MHz and the team spent a significant amount of time ensuring that their CC 1020 radio chip could operate effectively with a set of custom commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) amateur radio equipment for the ground station.</p>







<p>Unfortunately although the downlink functionality was thoroughly tested, issues with the ground segment receive capabilities were not solved prior to launch, and the satellite was not capable of receiving commands once in orbit.</p>



<p><strong>MicroMAS-1 </strong>– the Micro-Sized Microwave Atmospheric Satellite (MicroMAS-1) CubeSat was designed and built by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Space Systems Lab (SSL) and MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL).</p>



<p>The system was a 3U CubeSat using the L-3 Cadet-U Radio with a 9.6 kbps FSK at 450 MHz uplink, and a 3 Mbps Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (OQPSK) at 468 MHz downlink.</p>







<p>Once in orbit the operations team was only able to successfully communicate with the satellite for three passes; on March 4, 5, and 9 of 2015.</p>



<p>Telemetry testing identified a failure in the transmit chain which was likely caused by a solar panel that had only partially deployed.</p>



<p>These three examples demonstrate the vital importance of a secure and stable satellite UHF or VHF connection to mission success. But you also need to ensure that the system purchased is the right option for your particular application.</p>

<h2>Understanding your requirements</h2>



<p>We recommend a simple four-step approach for the preliminary selection of any new piece of hardware or software for a satellite or other space system.</p>



<p>Note that this is just a basic guide based on what we’ve learned helping hundreds of buyers select products within our marketplace and get rapid responses from suppliers.</p>



<p>It is just meant to help engineers make an initial assessment and shouldn’t replace formalised systems engineering approaches such as the <a href="https://www.incose.org/incose-member-resources/working-groups/Application/space-systems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">INCOSE Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) CubeSat frameworks</a>.</p>



<ol><li>Specify your currently known mission parameters,</li><li>Record all currently known overall design specifications of the system,</li><li>Consider the range of technology that will be used in the satellite and in ancillary sub-systems, and</li><li>Take into account the key performance criteria of the kind of product you wish to procure.</li></ol>



<p>These criteria are explained in more detail below.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Mission parameters</h3>



<p>The first step is to fully understand the currently known mission parameters, including both the critical applications and desirable, but not necessarily essential, objectives.</p>



<p>Typically the more precise mission parameters will only be established later in the process – usually iterated upon in a number of loops by considering the “system of systems.”</p>



<p>But having an idea of what functions your selected technology is likely to need to perform, and on what schedule and duration, will make selecting the most suitable model mch easier.</p>



<p>Also consider the launch stresses, testing processes and regulatory compliance that the product will need to go through in order to make it into orbit, as well as any obsolescence procedures once the mission is complete.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Overall design specifications</h3>



<p>Next, keep to hand all currently known design information about the entire unit.</p>



<p>This can include the volume, weight, primary structural material and more basic things such as the location, storage and transport arrangements of the major components.</p>



<p>You will need to make sure that the new piece of technology you choose will be suitable for these parameters.</p>

<p>Once you are clear on exactly what tasks the new product will need to perform and the design characteristics of the satellite or other unit that it will work within, the next consideration is the full range of technology that will sit alongside the product to make sure that everything is compatible.</p>



<p>You may not yet know the entire range of accompanying technology (and you might need to first choose the product model you are interested in in order to make decisions on other components), but make sure you have access to all available technical specifications of sub-systems and structural components that are most likely to be used, as per the current mission plans.</p>



<p>It is important to understand how different sub-systems and components will interface with each other to create a high-performing satellite.</p>



<p>Balancing the available mass, power and volume budgets is also important, which can only be done with a clear plan of which components will be used.</p>



<p>Also consider how the product will work with the planned or existing ground segment to ensure effective data transfer and communication stability.</p>



<p>Now that you have a clear idea of what sort of product is needed for your mission, system, and existing platform setup, the next step is to compare the commercially-available products that meet these criteria according to the most relevant performance metrics.</p>

<h3>Key performance criteria</h3>



<p>To select the best satellite UHF/VHF transmitter or transceiver for your specific mission or service, the following criteria can be used to assess commercially available products:</p>



<p><strong>Transmit and receiver frequency</strong> – note that many product manufacturers will provide at least one frequency range, possibly others if the system can be used in multiple bands. Typically measured in MegaHertz (MHz).</p>



<p><strong>Data rate</strong> – typically measured in bits per second (bps) or kilobits per second (kbps).</p>



<p><strong>Noise figure</strong> – measures of degradation of signal-to-noise ratio, defined as the difference in decibels (dB) between the noise output of the actual receiver to the noise output of an “ideal” receiver. Noise figure is usually given in dB.</p>



<p><strong>Power</strong> – available RF power, measured in Watts (W) or decibel-milliwatts (dBm).</p>



<p><strong>Orbit</strong> – range and duration of each contact satellite ground station.</p>



<p><strong>Ground Station and satellite performance</strong> – e.g. Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An old airport customer of mine (whilst I worked for another company) used to pop someone next to a busy runway with a stopwatch strapped round their neck. The unfortunate person had to manually log the time aircrafts spent on the runway to measure the runway occupancy.</p><p>All very archaic. Even in those days.</p><p>The problem was solved by using a <b>Point-in-Polygon (PIP)</b> algorithm, taking data from their <b>A-SMGCS</b> System (Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control System) - basically the radar in the control tower to see if the coordinates on a plane intercept a defined polygon (such as of the runways) represented an array of coordinates. This was then visualized in dashboards.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/Po43FRVmFf402WpFQ4Y9L/c97db53a2dd4f73c348fe4a2a2e7f107/geo-spatial-mapping-kafka.png" alt="geo-spatial-mapping-kafka"></p><p>Not only did that person not have to suffer in the British rain, but the same practice allowed us to answer thousands more questions than originally scoped. This included checking whether they were in compliance with the time gap between aircrafts as they landed, and detecting pilots-behaving-badly by missing the correct runway exit in order to get to the parking gate quicker.&nbsp;</p><p>I documented it at the time <a target="_blank" href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/it/airfield-analytics-spatial-mapping-made-plane-and-simple-with-splunk.html">here</a>.</p><p>The process wasn’t really scalable though. From a compute perspective (each report had to do huge computation on-the-fly with Splunk) as well as from an accessibility perspective (i.e. how could this data processing be made available to engineering teams and with a good developer experience?)</p><h2>Who doesn't need to do geospatial analysis?</h2><p>With the explosion in connected and IoT devices, there’s almost no organization today that doesn’t need to optimize business operating models or deliver real-time consumer applications with geospatial data.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/4HUCQLNNFdN14ezEQtfhXR/ee0d1ae511223a7f5f7e733c6f4c406a/spatial-analisys-illustration_geo-mapping__1_.jpg" alt="Spatial analysis of geo data"></p><p>Many are adopting <b>Apache Kafka</b> to connect their applications; often in which location-based data is sitting there waiting to be stream-processed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As with the airport use case, doing this sort of data analysis is easy on paper. But the challenge is how it can be applied at scale, without having to manage complex pipelines and where it can be brought to production with software governance and assurance.</p><h2>Where DataOps and Lenses SQL Engine comes in...</h2><p>The Lenses SQL Engine for Apache Kafka has helped data engineers do on-the-fly data analysis and data-processing on <b>Apache Kafka streams</b>.</p><p>It abstracts many of the complexities of stream processing. It will automatically run your workload on your existing infrastructure (such as Kubernetes) as well as integrating into your CI/CD practices. It then provides the monitoring, alerting and ability to troubleshoot the applications as they run in production.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, defining a PIP algorithm in SQL would be impossible you might assume.</p><h2>...Unless you use SQL User Defined Functions (UDFs)</h2><p>Implementing a Java interface, we can easily build a UDF to extend the Lenses SQL. This can apply the PIP algorithm to detect if the coordinates of a given event intersects with a polygon.</p><p>For this particular use case, I’ve built a UDF that takes three arguments. A latitude and longitude value as well as a JSON Array that defines the polygon that we wish to map to.</p><p>The JSON Array includes a key as a label and then an array of lat/long tuples. Such as this.</p><pre>{</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Runway_27L":&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51.465164,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-0.434132</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51.464743,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-0.434099</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51.464993,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-0.482352</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;51.464569,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-0.482352</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;]</pre><pre></pre><pre>}</pre><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/4kxnP3KXUpMSnOBzwi4OnZ/660fbb9de2662bf8bf15c97ad4ba65c2/image.png" alt="Airfield and plane at gate for geo-spatial analysis"></p><p>Overall, a query may look like this:</p><p><code>SELECT&nbsp;lat,&nbsp;lon,&nbsp;spatialmap(lat,lon,&nbsp;"{'runway':[[51.465164,-0.434132],[51.464743,-0.434099],[51.464993,-0.482352],[51.464569,-0.482352]]}")&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;coordinates&nbsp;LIMIT&nbsp;100;</code></p><p>The function works both in <i>Snapshot</i> mode and <i>Streaming SQ</i>L mode for continuous stream processing to be served into another Kafka topic.&nbsp;</p><h2>How it works</h2><p>The algorithm is based on a nice research piece “Determining if a point lies on the interior of a polygon” <a target="_blank" href="http://paulbourke.net/geometry/polygonmesh/#insidepoly">published here</a>.</p><p>You can read the full section if you’re that way inclined but if we had to summarize it in a tweet I would write:&nbsp;</p><p>"Imagine if our point (the lat/long) has a line drawn to its right across the polygon.

<p>The European Commission has said it cannot disclose the prices paid for each coronavirus vaccine, citing commercial confidentiality agreements.</p>

<p>Civil society groups, MEPs and health advocates <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-under-fire-for-lack-of-vaccine-transparency/">have been calling</a> for months for the Commission to reveal how much the EU is paying, arguing that deals involving taxpayer funds should have greater transparency. </p>
<p>The Commission signed deals with six producers and completed exploratory talks with a seventh on Thursday. Countries will place their orders individually for each vaccine.</p>
<p>According to the screenshot published by HLN, the EU is spending between €1.78 and $18 per coronavirus vaccine. The price per dose listed for each of the six vaccines was as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Oxford/AstraZeneca: €1.78</li>
<li>Johnson &amp; Johnson, $8.50 </li>
<li>Sanofi/GSK: €7.56</li>
<li>BioNTech/Pfizer: €12 </li>
<li>CureVac: €10 </li>
<li>Moderna: $18 </li>
</ul>
<p>Belgium will purchase more than 33 million vaccines for a total of €279 million. </p>
<p>De Bleeker said that publication of the price breakdown was “a mistake on the part of the communications team,” according to HLN. </p>
<p>In reaction to questions by opposition MPs about the potential consequences of the violation of confidentiality, De Bleeker <a href="https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/12/17/prijzen-vaccins/" target="_blank">said</a> the blunder would not “endanger anything” concerning Belgium’s access to vaccines.</p>

<p>According to HLN, the European Commission said: “We will not comment on what happened in Belgium, but the prices of the vaccines are confidential.”</p>

	<p><i>December 18th 2020</i></p>

	<p>Building tiny projects in my free time is something that I love to do.</p>

	<p>My main goal is to test out ideas that I note down in my phone. Sometimes they work and I make a bit of money, but usually they don’t. Either way, it's a fun hobby.</p>

	<p>Recently I was lucky enough to sell a tiny website I'd built. Although the sale was small, the experience was great.</p>

	<p>The process of selling a website had always been a mystery to me. Therefore, in this post I'll tell you what it was like to sell a tiny project, and how I think anyone can.</p>

	<h3>🛠️ 1. Building a Project</h3>

	<p>Back in June, I built <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/one_item_store" target="_blank">One Item Store</a>. It's a micro online store builder that lets you create a page to sell a single item on repeat.</p>

	<p>I hacked it together over two weeks, launched it, and wrote about the process. It was a basic MVP with nothing really fancy about it.</p>
	
	<p>To my surprise, a few hundred users created stores, and I even made a staggering £1.64 in revenue through the 1% cut I took on every sale.</p>

	<p>People were selling t-shirts, hats, poems; you name it. One guy even started a store to sell his soul. I saw some very interesting things.</p>

	<h3>👨‍💼 2. Meeting the Buyer</h3>

	<p>My online following is pretty small, but when I type up a blog post like this, people check out the projects I've built.</p>

	<p>One morning I received this email from such a person:</p>

	<div>
		<p>Hi Tiny Projects,</p>
		<p>.. Anyway, it got me thinking about your One Item Store, and actually, I'm wondering if you have any interest in selling it.</p>
		<p>No pressure, but if you are open to it please let me know and I can make you an offer.</p>
	</div>

	<p>Part of me wanted to keep working on this project, but deep down I knew that I didn't have the drive. Besides, I was really interested to know what the offer was:</p>

	<div>
		<p>Hi Buyer,</p>
		<p>I would definitely be open to offers if you were interested in taking it off my hands, especially as you've been following along Tiny Projects for a while.</p>
	</div>

	<p>A few hours later I got an offer.</p>

	<div>
		<p>Hi Tiny Projects,</p>
		<p>Glad to hear you're open to the idea.  Would you consider <b>$4000</b> for it?</p>
	</div>

	<h3>⚔️ 3. Negotiating a Price</h3>

	<p>Was this a good price for a tiny project? How do you even value something like this?</p>

	<p>After doing some back of the envelope math, I sent back a counter-offer:</p>

	<div>
		<p>Hi Buyer,</p>
		<p>.. With a bit of a polish up and some better store designs, One Item Store could have some potential. However, I'd personally be keen to sell and focus on other things. Would you consider <b>$7,500</b> for it?</p>
	</div>

	<p>We went back and forth with offers over the next few days:</p>

	<div>
		<p><b>Buyer:</b> As for the price, how about <b>$4800</b>?</p>
		<p><b>Me:</b> Would you be willing to meet me at <b>$6,500</b>?</p>
		<p><b>Buyer:</b> The upper limit of my budget for this is <b>$5,000</b>.</p>
		<p><b>Me:</b> If you met me at <b>$5,300</b> (£4,000), you have a deal.</p>
		<p><b>Buyer:</b> Ok, you got a deal at <b>$5,300</b> :D</p>
	</div>

	<p>My price dropped, but I was happy and ready to cash out of the e-commerce world.</p> 

	<p>The buyer was also a talented developer &amp; really nice guy, with a good idea of how he wanted to integrate One Item Store into his <a href="https://initialcommit.com/" target="_blank">own website.</a></p>

	<h3>💸 4. Money For Code</h3>

	<p>How do you securely exchange code for cash?</p>

	<p>Although it would've been hilarious to do this transaction through a store on One Item Store, we decided instead to use an escrow service.</p>

	<p>It worked like this:

	</p><ul>
		<li>Buyer transfers $5,300 to the escrow service.</li>
		<li>I transfer the domain name, users, and Github repository to the buyer.</li>
		<li>Brief video call explaining the code.</li>
		<li>Buyer has 7 days to try everything out.</li>
		<li>Escrow service transfers $5,300 to me.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>That was it, the deal was done.</p>

	<h3>🔮 Conclusions</h3>

	<p>I'm aware that I wouldn't have sold this project if I didn't have a small audience.</p>

	<p>It's made me realise there's this really fun strategy for any developer trying to make money on the internet:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Build things you enjoy</li>
		<li>Write about the process</li>
		<li>Attract a small audience</li>
		<li>Attract opportunities (buyers, customers, job offers)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>It's that simple. Code something for a few weeks, then type up how it went. Maybe publish it on your own blog like this.</p>

	<p>Five people will probably read it, and that's awesome. Next time it might be ten!</p>

	<p>Keep building lots of little things that pique your interest, talk about it, and great things will start happening.</p>

  <p><em>This is the story of how I prepared for a decade to graduate in 3 months.</em></p>
<p>In 2012, I dropped out of college, where I was studying computer science, after just one semester. I already knew how to program and I thought I’d never need a degree.</p>
<p>Over the years, I found myself complaining a lot about it. I saw many opportunities, especially abroad, that were out of reach because I didn’t have the required papers. I felt ready for graduate school but couldn’t get admitted. I had to work harder to prove myself to employers. Although I never noticed any serious gap in my knowledge, I felt that something was missing. I started to resent my decision.</p>
<p>In June 2020, I attended a virtual <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/">Slate Star Codex</a> meetup. As usual, I complained about not having a degree. This is when I first heard about <strong><a href="https://www.wgu.edu/">Western Governors University</a></strong> (WGU). Apparently, their online programs had <a href="https://sive.rs/kimo">no speed limit</a> and students could graduate as quickly as they could pass all the exams. I was skeptical, so I did some research.</p>
<p>Here’s what I found:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s accredited</strong>. Their programs are accredited by the <a href="https://www.nwccu.org/">Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU)</a>, the same accreditation body used by the University of Washington (#24) and the University of Oregon (#94).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s self-paced</strong>. Their competency-based approach allows students to complete courses as quickly as they can show mastery of the material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s affordable</strong>. Their flat-rate tuition of $3,200 per 6-month term means that the faster you complete the degree, the more money you save.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It seemed too good to be true. I immediately submitted my application.</p>
<p>The next day, I received a phone call from an enrollment counselor. They confirmed everything I had read and told me that although they didn’t officially accept foreign students (I’m Canadian), they would try to make an exception. After a dozen phone calls, transfer/translation/evaluation of transcripts, proof of English proficiency, and tuition payments, I was officially enrolled in their <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/computer-science.html">Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program</a>.</p>
<p>I now had the opportunity to apply everything I had learned from <a href="https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">Scott H. Young’s MIT Challenge</a>, in which he completed MIT’s 4-year CS curriculum in just 12 months. Of course, my achievement wouldn’t be as impressive, given WGU’s less rigorous program and my prior experience in the field. Indeed, I wrote my first program at 10, I had years of professional experience as a software developer, and I had even studied the subject in college. Still, I would get a real CS degree in just 3 months.</p>

<p>In this post, I will take you through my entire academic journey, describing when, where, and how I completed each of the 34 courses (120 credits) required for this degree. Note that credits awarded for the first 3 courses (9 credits), taken between 2009 and 2012, were excluded from the quoted 3 months and $5000 total. “How I Got a Computer Science Degree in 11 Years for More Than $5000” didn’t sound right.</p>
<p><em>When consulting the tables below, “CUs” stands for “Competency Units”, which is WGU’s time-agnostic equivalent to “Credit Hours”. “Effort” represents the total amount of time (in hours) invested in a given course, from initial research to final assessment.</em></p>
<h2 id="cégep-édouard-montpetit-2009-2012">Cégep Édouard-Montpetit (2009-2012)</h2>
<p>From 2009 to 2012, I studied IT at Cégep Édouard-Montpetit and graduated with a Diploma of College Studies, which is roughly equivalent to an Associate’s degree in the US. From there, a Bachelor’s degree typically requires an additional 3 years of study.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe with the program, other than mandatory class attendance, was its focus on Microsoft technologies: Visual Studio, C#, <span>ASP.NET</span>, SQL Server, IIS, etc. I was a die-hard Linux user who wrote essays about the evil of proprietary software in high school. Despite my initial resistance, I ended up learning quite a bit. Who knew I would later fall in love with Windows Phone, build a bunch of apps for it (including its first Bitcoin wallet), work as a Xamarin developer, and even spend 3 years porting <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/">WinUI</a> to Android and iOS (<a href="https://platform.uno/">Uno</a>).</p>
<p>Out of 39 courses, I only managed to transfer 2 courses' worth of credits (6 credits) to WGU. They wouldn’t transfer any IT course. They wouldn’t take my calculus course because it was over 5 years old. Unlike a US Associate’s degree, which would satisfy all of WGU’s general education requirements, my foreign degree wouldn’t. Also, the subject and level of some of the courses were lost in translation, after going through a translation agency (French → English) and an international credential evaluation service (Québec → USA). If I had a recent (less than 5 years old) Associate’s degree, I could have expected to receive 10 courses' worth of credits.</p>

<h2 id="concordia-university-2012">Concordia University (2012)</h2>
<p>In 2012, I studied computer science at Concordia University and dropped out after 1 semester.</p>
<p>On my first day, I attended 2 lectures. I quickly realized that a 2-hour commute to listen to someone slowly recite a PowerPoint wasn’t the best use of my time. Lectures might exist for good reasons, but I wasn’t sophisticated enough to appreciate them. Instead, I read the PowerPoints myself, at home, and used Wikipedia to fill in the gaps. I only set foot on campus 3 more times, to take the midterm and final exams. Although I passed all 4 courses, I felt very confused about this whole university thing, where you spend a lot of time learning very little. So, I dropped out and gave up my scholarship.</p>
<p>Out of 4 courses, I only managed to transfer 1 courses' worth of credits (3 credits) to WGU.</p>

<h2 id="spanstudycomspan-2020"><span>Study.com</span> (2020)</h2>
<p>In July 2020, as I was going through WGU’s admission process, I decided to get a head-start by taking some courses online for academic credits. At that point, I was still hoping to graduate in 12 months (2 terms of 6 months). I figured that the more credits I transferred, the more likely I would complete the program in 2 terms. I still had no idea that 1 term would be more than enough.</p>
<p>Thankfully, US students have access to a lot of affordable options when it comes to taking online courses for credits. These are just a few of the many websites that offer courses with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Council_on_Education">ACE</a> credits in the $25-$200 per course range:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://study.com/">Study.com</a> ($199/month + $70/course after 2 included courses)</li>
<li><a href="https://sophia.org/">Sophia Learning</a> ($79/month + $0/course)</li>
<li><a href="https://straighterline.com/">StraighterLine</a> ($99/month + $59/course)</li>
<li><a href="https://saylor.org/">Saylor Academy</a> ($0/month + $25/course)</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose <a href="https://study.com/">Study.com</a> because they had the largest course catalog (180+) and the most comprehensive transfer agreements with WGU. Their College Acceleration Edition plan costs $199/month and includes 2 exams, on top of which you can add up to 3 additional exams per month for $70 each.</p>
<p>Their courses are not the best I’ve taken, but they get the job done. They’re split into bite-size units, each with animated lectures and mandatory quizzes. The number of quizzes can be overwhelming, and I recommend looking elsewhere if you already know the material and just want to take the final exam. Some courses have projects, and most courses have a proctored final exam. Proctoring is done using your computer’s webcam, but the footage is only reviewed 7-10 days later, which can be a problem if you need to transfer credits quickly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they limit students to 5 courses per month, which is where I stopped.</p>

<p>On July 29<sup>th</sup>, after reaching <span>Study.com</span>’s monthly 5-course limit, I started looking for alternatives. Luckily, <a href="https://sophia.org/">Sophia Learning</a> had made all their courses free until the end of July due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The quality of their courses is better than average, and you can even choose from multiple lecturers. Courses are broken down into logical units, each with a set of challenges (quizzes) and a milestone (unit exam). Each course ends with a final milestone which is non-proctored (no webcam) and open-book, making them almost too easy.</p>
<p>I managed to complete 3 courses before the promotion ended.</p>

<p>On September 1<sup>st</sup>, I finally started my first and only term at WGU, with 23 courses (83 credits) left to go.</p>
<p>By then, I had already passed 9 pre-assessments (practice exams), which unlike course material were already available before the start of the term. On my first day, I completed 4 courses in the span of 4 hours. At a traditional school, it would have taken 4 months.</p>
<p>It made me realize a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I had underestimated how much knowledge I had gained from previous schools, jobs, projects, books, papers, and talks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was much more productive and motivated without an arbitrary speed limit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I could probably graduate in a single term of 6 months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each student at WGU gets assigned a program mentor, who supports them from their first day through graduation. I had a phone call with mine every week, in which we discussed my progress and planned the week ahead. She quickly adapted to my pace of study and made sure I never got stuck waiting for an answer or for the next set of courses to be approved. I never expected that this human point of contact would have such a positive impact on my experience at WGU. Course …</p></article></div>

<p>I feel blogging is making a comeback, why? Because people are starting to realize that they can carve their own brand and be content creators, rather than just sharing your thoughts among few Facebook friends.</p>
<p>And since not all of us are video creators, most people will be selecting blogging as their platform of choice.</p>
<p>I even started my own blog, this one, shifting from Medium, and I hope to have a new year resolution where I will post at least one blog post a week.</p>
<p>However, even if I feel blogging is about to have a come back, a place for bloggers to blog is limited more than ever.</p>
<h2>WordPress</h2>
<p>WordPress is currently the most popular blogging platform that you can self host or use their own free hosting solution.</p>
<p>WordPress is regularly updated, and the eco system is great, however there is limited number of quality themes that is free and focused on bloggers.</p>
<p>Even WordPress’s own free themes are more focused on business, photographers, restaurants etc.</p>
<p>I feel WordPress is more focused on running a CMS company, and blogging is a side niche that users can use their CMS to build a blog.</p>
<h2>Medium</h2>
<p>Medium was a great choice when it was initially released. It is still a great place to blog and you can find lot of eye balls on medium looking for your content. And not to mention Medium blogs have a better SEO if you want to please the Google bot.</p>
<p>However, medium has slowly become a walled garden and paywalls. Most of the content they promote on their homepage are from premium users or paywalled content.</p>
<p>Also medium has shifting priorities and directions, for example once issued domain names where you can have your own domain name for you medium blog for free.</p>
<p>Later they made you pay $80, to have a domain name. Now it seems that they have given up the ability to have your domain name, but medium has now started issuing subdomains instead.</p>
<p>This lack of direction makes it very unpredictable for a regular blogger, because you don’t know what will happen to your blog in another 6 months.</p>
<h2>Blogger</h2>
<p>Google has not made a meaningful update to its blogging platform for years.</p>
<p>It still has the same outdated editor, and the dashboard that blogger currently use has been there for several years without any update. </p>
<p>The third party theme eco system has been also dried up, and google doesn’t seem be to interested in releasing any new themes for the platform.</p>
<p>I believe if it’s not for the ad revenue they are getting from current blogger websites, they would have given up blogger long time ago.</p>
<h2><strong>Stati</strong>c site <strong>generators</strong> </h2>
<p>Static site generators have been there for several years, there are different static site generators using different technologies, some use markdown while some are using WordPress as a CMS but generate a static site that you can easily host.</p>
<p>However, static sites are extremely difficult for a regular blogger to host. You need to have a knowledge on some technology like ruby or node to setup your generator, and web designing to setup your site/blog.</p>
<p>Then you need to have knowledge on git or web hosting to host your static site.</p>
<p>That is too much for an average blogger, who just want to tell their ideas. It maybe cool to have a static site if you are a programmer or a web developer, but for an average blogger it’s just too much.</p>
<p>When are we going to have a free, modern easy to use platform focused only on blogging and nothing else, like the experience Blogger offered when it was initially released?</p>
<h2><strong>Upcoming</strong> platforms </h2>
<p>There are some several upcoming platforms that caught my eyes, including SubStack and Write.as</p>
<p>I’m bit confused about SubStack because they call the publications as newsletters instead of blogs. And is it going to focus on newsletters like MailChimp in the future? or focus on blogs like Medium?</p>
<p>And how are we going to know whether any of these platforms will follow what medium did to their uses or may lack a clear focus or direction?</p>
<h4>Updates</h4>
<p>I initially had a typo which said <strong>statistic site generator, </strong>which I now corrected to static site generators.</p>
<p>Since I’m typing these posts using my iPad I’m bound to make some mistakes. Even though I try to keep them as low as possible.</p>
<p>Also thank you very much for everyone who commented on HackerNews, I enjoyed reading every single comment.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Recently I replaced my home router with <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Raspberry Pi 4</a>. My main goal was to increase throughput through my VPN. While at it, I also migrated from <a href="https://openvpn.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenVPN</a> to <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">WireGuard</a>, and read their whole technical <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">paper</a>. This post sums up my insights with repurposing a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Raspberry Pi</a> into a network device.</p><h2 id="why-having-a-home-router-in-the-first-place">Why having a home router in the first place?</h2><p>When you sign a contract with your internet service provider, besides the Internet service, you usually lease a router too. It is certified for the ISP network and gives you wired and wireless connectivity for all devices in your home. In most cases, you can’t get rid of this router, and most people don’t bother. I think differently, and I believe it’s important to talk about its security risks.</p><p>Routers provided by your ISP have several drawbacks like:</p><ul><li>Their hardware is often very low-end, with insufficient RAM and flash storage</li><li>As a consequence, their software is limited in functionality</li><li>Sometimes, such routers have hardware modifications from variants made for the consumer market, and frequently they have custom firmware explicitly made for your ISP</li><li>You, as a customer, have limited access to these devices. On the other hand, ISP often has remote access and full control over the equipment</li><li>In the past, security experts found <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/40-asus-rt-router-models-are-vulnerable-to-simple-hacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">several backdoors</a> allowing remote access to anyone who is motivated enough</li><li>Such routers usually don’t get firmware updates, or they get it very rarely and only for a limited time</li><li>As a consequence, if security experts find bugs in software libraries used in such routers, these bugs are never fixed</li><li>You use such routers daily for years. Usually, until your ISP gives you an updated model, which is rare</li></ul><p>For me, having a custom router connected behind the ISP router is a no-brainer. I like having things under control, and I also use non-standard services like VPN, which spans through my home and flat so that I can access my stuff everywhere I go.</p><h2 id="from-mikrotik-to-raspberry">From Mikrotik to Raspberry</h2><p>I tried different brands of routers over the years, but one brand stuck with me for a long time — Mikrotik. A friend of mine recommended one to me, and since then, I passed that advice to others, having my own experience now.</p><div>

It was already a considerable upgrade from having a router from my ISP. At that time, a typical ISP router, or cheap home router, had about 32 MB of RAM and 4 MB of storage. You almost couldn’t fit any decent software there; there was just no space.</p><p>We were using ADSL for connectivity. To hook up this new router into my network, I connected it to the LAN port of the ADSL modem as the only client. Also, I turned off DHCP, set up static IP address, and turned off all “smart” functions, effectively making the modem just a bridge passing data from my router to the ISP, forth and back.</p><div>

    </span></p><figcaption>A home router connected behind an ISP router</figcaption></div><p>Each ISP router is different, but you should be able to set it up similarly. Also, try to look up for the DMZ option and set it to your home router IP address. That way, all data traffic is forwarded to your home router, and no special rules are applied. One last thing, if your ISP router has a WiFi, turn it off. You need to set up a WiFi on your home router, or a device behind it. Otherwise, all wireless traffic bypasses your home router, and that’s probably not what you want.</p><h3 id="openwrt">OpenWrt</h3><p>Mikrotik devices use <a href="https://mikrotik.com/software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RouterOS</a> as their system. It gives users features found in much pricier network products. I especially love their WinBox app, which helps to manage my equipment through a simple-to-use UI. However, as I used it, I found several bugs, and some features I needed were missing. For example, RouterOS supports OpenVPN only through TCP, which adds overhead. Also, when my provider configured a DS-Lite IPv6 stack, RouterOS support was limited, and I had trouble accessing a native IPv6 network. Therefore, I decided to migrate to <a href="https://openwrt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OpenWrt</a>, which is an open-source Linux distribution aimed at routers. Due to this, many features were just there, including OpenVPN on UDP, and proper DSLite support.</p><p>OpenWrt had many software packages available out of the box. If I missed a feature, I could (and did) prepare a package, and if I found a bug, I could (and did) report an issue and provide a patch. One day, however, Linux kernel dropped support for my flash storage. Suddenly, the latest OpenWrt versions didn’t work correctly with my router, and I was stuck with an old version of the system. It was a problem from a security standpoint, as well as from a usability standpoint; I couldn’t use the latest software anymore. Because this was my main router, I couldn’t experiment with it and prepare patches. Testing my changes was not possible. I kept running this old OpenWrt distribution on my router for over a year. During that time, I was looking for an alternative solution, which is powerful enough to increase my VPN performance, and which can run customizable firmware.</p><h3 id="finding-alternative-hardware">Finding alternative hardware</h3><p>In my other site, I use <a href="https://www.turris.cz/en/omnia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Turris Omnia</a>, which uses a forked OpenWrt code. I thought about replacing my Omnia with a network developer board like <a href="http://macchiatobin.net/product/macchiatobin-double-shot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MACCHIATObin Double Shot</a> and replacing my Mikrotik with Omnia. Still, ultimately I abandoned the idea due to the higher price and lower availability of the MACCHIATObin board. From the practical point, I don’t need hardware capable of routing 10 Gbit/second if my ISP gives me only one Gigabit, but I must admit it would be cool. Later I shifted my focus to a hardware running <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">pfSense</a> or <a href="https://opnsense.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OPNSense</a>. These distributions have minimal support for ARM-based boards, and finding x86 hardware with low power consumption, reasonable price, and decent performance is not that easy.</p><p>Then I remembered on my <a href="https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-c2/odroid-c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Odroid C2</a>. It’s a developer board with a single Ethernet port and a bunch of USB2 ports. What’s important is that it can handle Ethernet through its RJ45 port at full speed of one Gigabit. If you’d like to use such a device as a router, you need to have at least two interfaces — one facing your ISP router (WAN) and one facing your devices (LAN). I was thinking of using this internal Ethernet port for LAN because the maximum speed on the local network is essential. However, for WAN, I needed much lower throughput because my Internet speed was only around 100 Mbit/second. I found some decent USB3 to Ethernet adapters for that purpose. Odroid C2 supports several Linux distributions, including Ubuntu and <a href="https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/amlogic/odroid-c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ArchLinux ARM</a>. Therefore, transforming it into a router is possible, and I would certainly do that if there weren’t a new revision of Raspberry Pi. The main problem with Odroid C2 is that its kernel is not mainline, and it’s rather old. Also, ArchLinux ARM, which I planned to use, is not explicitly designed for routers. This solution could work, but it would most likely take a significant time to set up.</p><p>Last weekend I was determined to go with the Odroid C2 path. But then I looked at my shiny Raspberry Pi 4, and I changed my mind. I own almost all revisions of Raspberry Pi, and I use them in my work IoT projects. That was also the reason why I bought the Raspberry Pi 4. Previous generations of RPi were not that useful for use as a router because their Ethernet interface was internally routed through a USB2 hub, effectively limiting the throughput to <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/getting-gigabit-networking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">around 200 Mbit/second</a>. However, RPi4 can finally saturate a full Gigabit link because of its new I/O architecture. Also, it finally provides USB3 ports, which work great with my external USB-to-Ethernet adapter. The main advantage of RPi4 over Odroid C2 is the mainline kernel support. Therefore it’s easy to use close-to-latest Linux kernel. Due to its popularity, community support is also better. And, as a bonus, OpenWrt added support for it in their developer builds. Therefore, migration from my existing router to Raspberry Pi should be relatively painless. Let’s take a look at this process.</p><h2 id="turning-raspberry-pi-into-a-router">Turning Raspberry Pi into a router</h2><p>As I mentioned, I needed to have two Ethernet interfaces, and Raspberry gives me only one. I decided to use the internal Ethernet port for my local LAN and a USB-to-Ethernet adapter for WAN. Of course, this assignment is not mandatory, and if you use a USB adapter for LAN instead, your setup should work too. In my case, the LAN port on RPi is connected to a 24-port Gigabit Ethernet switch to provide connectivity for more than one device. You can buy any cheap Gigabit Ethernet switch.</p><div>

    </span></p><figcaption>Raspberry Pi 4 with a USB-to-Ethernet adapter</figcaption></div><p>Without going into much detail about how an Ethernet works, a router serves two purposes — it resolves an IP address into device MAC using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ARP</a> protocol, and it routes traffic into outside networks, like the Internet. When two of your devices want to communicate inside the same LAN network, their traffic won’t get through your router at all, only through the switch. Hence, if you buy a cheap Gigabit switch, you’ll get a decent network performance, and it doesn’t matter what kind of router you use.</p><p>Therefore, if you have some spare Raspberry Pi 3, it can still serve you well as a router, just hook up some switch behind it, and make sure your Internet link is slower than 200 Mbit/second. Otherwise, your speed is limited. Raspberry Pi 3 won’t handle more traffic because of the internal USB2 hub mentioned earlier. RPi4 is a better choice in that case. I don’t have exact stats, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">USB 3.0 throughput is 5 Gbit/s</a>, so I believe the latest RPi should have no problem saturating an outgoing link.</p><h3 id="openwrt-installation">OpenWrt installation</h3><p>The installation of the system was pretty straight-forward. I followed the <a href="https://openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi_foundation/raspberry_pi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">official instructions</a>. Note that if you have Raspberry Pi 4, its support is not yet in stable OpenWrt builds, and you need to download the <a href="https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/targets/bcm27xx/bcm2711/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">latest development build</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>This time of the year is about wishes, so here are the things that would make life easier for developers working on systems running in AWS. I’m sure I’m not the first one to think about these and they cover only a small subset of all AWS services.</p> <h2 id="general">General</h2> <h3 id="tags-resource-based-policies-and-cloudformation-support-for-all-services">Tags, resource-based policies, and CloudFormation support for all services</h3> <p>Some things are supposed to work across all services in AWS. For example, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">using tags to define permissions</a> (also called Attribute-Based Access Control) is based on tagging resources and identities and defining policies to grant access based on matching values. If you read the documentation, it seems to be a great way for scalable permission management.</p> <p>It seems to be a feature of the AWS cloud that you can use tags. But it’s not, it’s a feature of <em>individual services</em>. The <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html">reference documentation</a> shows the services and which ones support “Authorization based on tags” and which ones do not. The result is that you can only used tags for permissions in some cases but not in others.</p> <p>A similar problem is with the lack of universal support for resource-based policies. Again, some services support it, some don’t so you can’t depend on being able to define permissions on the resource-side without first checking that the services you plan to use support it.</p> <div> <p> Related </p> <div> <p><a href="https://advancedweb.hu/aws-iam-deep-dive-identity-based-and-resource-based-policies/"> <img integrity="sha256-rui8GWEmKXio0umiMwra9DUflY2yH40NgdpAh9dfChM=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/4c64ce-dc53af48910f62ebfd684a1cbdb05782628d5280cfb2e83ddd9b9d20e7ea43ad.jpg"> </a> </p> <div>  <p> How to grant and deny access in an AWS account </p> </div> </div> </div> <p>Then there is CloudFormation. You can use it to automatically configure services in AWS. Except that it does not support all services, and it’s a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/11/aws-iot-sitewise-now-supports-aws-cloudformation/">constant</a> <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/10/aws-code-artifact-supports-aws-cloudformation/">stream</a> of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/09/amazon-appflow-now-supports-aws-cloudformation/">announcements</a> that a new service or change becomes supported.</p> <p>All these things are supposed to be “AWS-wide” but in reality they are “service-specific” making it hard to reason about how to configure them and it’s a contant source of confusion. <strong>They should be supported in all services, from the start, with all updates immediately reflected on them</strong>.</p> <p> Learn the services needed to build a serverless HTTP-based API on AWS from our <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#aws_serverless-promo-popup">free email course</a>. </p> <h3 id="remove-discrepancies-between-services">Remove discrepancies between services</h3> <p>Many things work differently in different services that should be universal concepts in AWS. S3 bucket policies and KMS key policies both control who can do management operations on the resources, such as they can prevent deleting an S3 bucket or a KMS key. But root users are exempt from bucket policies, while if you lock yourself out with a key policy <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam">you need to contact support</a>. Why is there a difference?</p> <p>And this is not an isolated thing. Most resource-based policies are effective for management operations. But a policy attached to an IAM role can only influence who can assume it and not, for example, who can delete it. Is it because it’s called “trust policy”? But it’s a policy attached to a resource, which is pretty much what resource-based policies are. Still, it’s different. Is the policy attached to a Lambda function can control <code>lambda:DeleteFunction</code> or only <code>lambda:InvokeFunction</code>? I don’t know and I don’t see any other way of knowing this than trying it out.</p> <p>When the same thing works differently in different parts of AWS it makes it hard to know what is possible without extensive experimentation with every single service you intent to use. And that’s a frustrating experience. <strong>Concepts that seem AWS-wide should be supported the same way in all services.</strong></p> <h2 id="iam">IAM</h2> <h3 id="debug-requests">Debug requests</h3> <p>AWS provides a bunch of managed policies that allow an easy way assign permissions to users. If you want to allow only reading s3 buckets, you can add the <code>AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess</code>, and if you want to allow managing Lambda functions then the <code>AWSLambdaFullAccess</code>. This allows service-level access control without writing any kind of policies yourself.</p> <p>But if want anything more granular, it becomes exponentially more difficult.</p> <div> <p> Related </p> <div> <p><a href="https://advancedweb.hu/granularity-levels-in-aws-iam-policies/"> <img integrity="sha256-pJCFyfAixqM98Py1wcMAvWAy7iCHVJhJ37n35koqetc=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/f1d3d2-93a26a29e79ebe197a8c93d463b436e91301ec9cc8911cea4f51a7a4ee333cc7.jpg"> </a> </p> <div>  <p> What are the controls available to fine-tune policies </p> </div> </div> </div> <p>IAM policies protect AWS APIs. When a request reaches an API, it first assembles a <em>request context</em> with all the data that is available at this moment. This includes the <em>Principal</em> (who is doing the request), the <em>Action</em> (what is being done) and the <em>Resource</em> (on what). Apart from these, IAM also collects a lot of <em>metadata</em>, such as the IP address of the connection, whether the keys used in the request are authenticated with an MFA device, the tags that are attached to the Principal and the Resource, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html">a lot more</a>.</p> <p>In an IAM policy, you add Conditions that check the values in the request context. For example, you can deny S3 bucket deletes without MFA authentication, restrict the IP address range to the company IP block, or only allow access to S3 objects that have a specific tag attached to them.</p> <p>This sounds great, but in practice it’s mostly reading the AWS documentations, trying out something, seeing it not working, then trying to fix it by reading the documentations again. It’s a frustrating experience.</p> <p>For example, the <code>aws:ResourceTag/&lt;key&gt;</code> is a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html#condition-keys-resourcetag">global condition key</a> that is present in all requests.</p> <blockquote> <p>Use this key to compare the tag key-value pair that you specify in the policy with the key-value pair that is attached to the resource.</p> </blockquote> <p>Since S3 objects can be tagged, it means that this contains the object tags? Nope, there is a separate key for that, the <code>s3:ExistingObjectTag/&lt;key&gt;</code>.</p> <p>Or when API Gateway calls a Lambda function, you can use the <code>aws:SourceArn</code> to give access to a <em>specific</em> API Gateway. Similarly, an SQS queue can allow a specific CloudWatch Event Rule via the same condition. Does that mean that an IAM role’s trust policy can limit the Lambda function that can use it? Nope.</p> <p>And when you encounter something that <em>should work</em> but isn’t, the only resource is the documentation AWS provides. There is zero visibility what is wrong with the policies that are misbehaving.</p> <p><strong>There should be a service to debug IAM requests</strong>. I’d love a “request recorder” that I could use to selectively record live requests and see all the metadata in the request context exactly how IAM sees them. This would remove the quesswork of what condition keys are available in the exact scenario I’m interested in.</p> <p>As an added benefit, it could also show the steps in the <a href="https://advancedweb.hu/aws-iam-deep-dive-how-the-policy-evaluation-logic-works/">policy evaluation logic</a>.</p><div> <p> Related </p> <div> <p><a href="https://advancedweb.hu/aws-iam-deep-dive-how-the-policy-evaluation-logic-works/"> <img integrity="sha256-uQoGgjNo8O/v2CtWAqTL748s/gi9ypxG9rrpnQN1o5U=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/aaebca-70bccf043c1eaaca15a722f4d65148c09ca368a6e1ba534f62e9b137896cd882.jpg"> </a> </p> <div>  <p> How IAM decides whether or not to allow a request based on policies </p> </div> </div> </div> <h3 id="allow-session-policies-for-assumed-sessions">Allow session policies for assumed sessions</h3> <p>The session policy is an additional security mechanism to control access. It’s a drop-capabilities style control, as the principal willingly put additional restrictions on itself.</p> <p>It is an optional parameter of the <code>assume-role</code> call:</p> <div><div><pre><code>aws sts assume-role <span>\</span>
	<span>--role-arn</span> &lt;arn&gt; <span>\</span>
	<span>--role-session-name</span> <span>"test"</span> <span>\</span>
	<span>--policy</span> file://policy.json
</code></pre></div></div> <p>When the resulting role session makes a call, the session policy must also allow the operation, in addition to its identity policies.</p> <p>When is this useful? Let’s say you have a multi-tenant application, storing data for multiple customers in separate S3 buckets. The application handles all customers, so it needs access to all buckets. But when the program determines which customer is making the request, it can put a session policy to limit itself to a single customer bucket. If there is a bug later in the code, this session policy prevents compromising the other buckets.</p> <p>The problem is that it’s only supported for <code>assume-role</code> calls, so you can only use it when you assume a role. And this complicates its usage in common use-cases.</p> <p><strong>A session policy should be able to be applied to already assumed sessions</strong>, such as when a Lambda function is running. This way, it would be easy to put these additional safeguards without needing to reassume the execution role.</p> <p>Similarly, it would be great if IAM access keys could support session policies via the <code>get-session-token</code> call.</p> <h2 id="lambda">Lambda</h2> <h3 id="allow-restricting-an-iam-role-to-a-single-function">Allow restricting an IAM role to a single function</h3> <p>Currently, an IAM role’s trust policy can only define the <code>lambda.amazonaws.com</code> service but not the specific function. Since most execution roles are for a single function, <strong>it would be great if this could be enforced in the role itself</strong>.</p> <h3 id="separate-warmup-requests">Separate warmup requests</h3> <p>Cold starts, also called first requests, happen when the Lambda service needs to start a new instance of the function. When it happens, the request needs to wait the setup process when the service deploys the code to a new machine. Worse still, the request also needs to wait while the execution environment is set up and for any application-specific setup process. This makes it noticably longer than other requests.</p> <p>This cold start can easily be orders of magnitude slower than other requests. At one point I worked on an app that precompiled a bunch of JSON schemas during the first request. It took ~10 seconds, then all the later requests were between 50 - 100 ms. This code demonstrates this behavior:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>wait</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>time</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>new</span> <span>Promise</span><span>((</span><span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>res</span><span>,</span> <span>time</span><span>));</span>
<span>const</span> <span>startup</span> <span>=</span> <span>wait</span><span>(</span><span>10000</span><span>);</span>

<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>handler</span> <span>=</span> <span>async</span> <span>(</span><span>event</span><span>,</span> <span>context</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

	<span>return</span> <span>"</span><span>Hello world</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>How the Lambda service works today is that the request waits until the cold start is finished. If there is 1 instance running and 2 requests comes at the same time one will take 50 ms and the other 10 seconds! If the second request is simply queued, it would be finished in 100 ms. As a result, there will always be some requests that take 10 seconds and that forces me to bring this down to an acceptable level even when I don’t expect spikes in traffic.</p> <p><strong>Lambda should do a warmup request when it needs to start a new instance and queue the requests to the already running instances and only start using the new environment when it’s properly warmed up.</strong></p> <h2 id="organizations">Organizations</h2> <h3 id="programmatically-delete-a-member-account">Programmatically delete a member account</h3> <p>Creating accounts via Organizations is easy to automate. It is just an API call and it also creates a role with Administrator access so that you can also script how to setup resources inside. Since separate accounts provide limits to the <em>blast radius</em> (the damage a security breach can do) it’s a good practice to use many of them.</p> <div> <p> Related </p> <div> <p><a href="https://advancedweb.hu/why-a-multi-account-setup-is-essential-for-secure-systems/"> <img integrity="sha256-rziPMS92alOgcxbBMcTPLzCJI5o9jlsTy68QzOPUEio=" crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://advancedweb.hu/assets/9787c4-b05c9fc78c1eb47f4f5760b365b8a05cf25ada7799d820857c12edfc1eb053e5.jpg"> </a> </p> <div>  <p> Development and …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>NumPy <i>ndarray</i> objects can be indexed using Python <span>x[selection_obj]</span> syntax, where <i>x</i> is the array. There are three kinds of indexing available in numpy: <b>field access, basic slicing, advanced indexing</b>.</p>

<p>The Basic slicing in numpy extends Python's basic concept of slicing to N dimensions. It occurs when <i>selection_obj</i> is a slice object (constructed by <span>start:stop:step</span> notation), an integer, or a tuple of slice objects and integers. Ellipsis and newaxis objects can also be used.</p>

<h3>Example:using slice object</h3>
<p>In the below example, basic slice syntax <i>start:stop:step</i> is used to slice the given array <i>Arr</i>. Please note that in Python, all indices are <b>zero-based</b>.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.arange(10)
print("Arr contains:", Arr)

#slicing Arr starting from index=1,
#stopping at index=7 with step=2
SArr = Arr[1:7:2]
print("SArr contains:", SArr)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
SArr contains: [1 3 5]
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Example: slicing object without start, stop and step</h3>
<p>The slice object can be constructed without specifying <i>start</i>, <i>end</i> or <i>step</i>. In such cases starting index of the array is considered as <i>start</i>, last index is considered as <i>stop</i>, and 1 is considered as <i>step</i>. Consider the below example.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.arange(10)
print("Arr contains:", Arr)

#slicing Arr starting from start to index=7
SArr1 = Arr[:7]
print("SArr1 contains:", SArr1)

#slicing Arr starting from index=2 to last
SArr2 = Arr[2:]
print("SArr2 contains:", SArr2)

#slicing Arr starting from index=2 to last
#with step=2
SArr3 = Arr[2::2]
print("SArr3 contains:", SArr3)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
SArr1 contains: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6]
SArr2 contains: [2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
SArr3 contains: [2 4 6 8]
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Example: slicing object with negative index</h3>
<p>Python supports negative indexing and it starts with -1 in backward direction. Therefore, Negative value of <i>start</i> and <i>stop</i> can be interpreted as <i>n+start</i> and <i>n+stop</i> respectively, where <i>n</i> is the number of elements in the corresponding dimension. Consider the below example.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.arange(10)
print("Arr contains:", Arr)

#slicing Arr starting from index=-5 to index=-1
SArr = Arr[-5:-1]
print("SArr contains:", SArr)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
SArr contains: [5 6 7 8]
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Example: slicing array using slice function</h3>
<p>A slice object can also be constructed using Python in-built - <a href="https://www.alphacodingskills.com/python/notes/python-function-slice.php">slice function</a>. Consider the below example.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.arange(10)
print("Arr contains:", Arr)

#slicing Arr starting from index=1 to 
#index=7 with step=2
s = slice(1,7,2)
SArr = Arr[s]
print("SArr contains:", SArr)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
SArr contains: [1 3 5]
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Example: selecting a single element</h3>
<p>A single element can be selected from the array by specifying its index number.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.arange(10)
print("Arr contains:", Arr)

print("Arr[2]:", Arr[2])
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains: [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
Arr[2]: 2
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Example: slicing a 2-D array</h3>
<p>In the below example, a 2-D array is sliced.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
print("Arr contains:\n", Arr)

#slice the array from index Arr[1:]
SArr1 = Arr[1:]
print("\nSArr1 contains:\n", SArr1)

#slice the array from index Arr[1:,1:]
SArr2 = Arr[1:,1:]
print("\nSArr2 contains:\n", SArr2)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains:
 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

SArr1 contains:
 [[4 5 6]
  [7 8 9]]

SArr2 contains:
 [[5 6]
  [8 9]]
</pre>
</div>

<br>
<h3>Example: slicing a 2-D array using Ellipsis</h3>
<p>Slicing can also be done using ellipsis (…). Ellipsis expands to the number of <span>:</span> objects needed for the selection tuple to index all dimensions. In most cases, this means that length of the expanded selection tuple is x.ndim. Consider the following example.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
print("Arr contains:\n", Arr)

#slice using :
SArr1 = Arr[:,1]
print("\nSArr1 contains:\n", SArr1)

#slice using ellipsis
SArr2 = Arr[...,1]
print("\nSArr2 contains:\n", SArr2)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains:
 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

SArr1 contains:
 [2 5 8]

SArr2 contains:
 [2 5 8]
</pre>
</div>


<br>
<h3>Example: slicing a 2-D array using numpy.newaxis</h3>
<p>numpy.newaxis can also be used while slicing an array which expand the dimensions of the resulting selection by one unit-length dimension. numpy.newaxis is convenient alias for None. Consider the following example.</p>
<div>
<pre>import numpy as np

Arr = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]])
print("Arr contains:\n", Arr)

#slice using :
SArr1 = Arr[:,1]
print("\nSArr1 contains:\n", SArr1)

#slice using np.newaxis
SArr2 = Arr[np.newaxis,:,1]
print("\nSArr2 contains:\n", SArr2)

#slice using np.newaxis
SArr3 = Arr[:,np.newaxis,1]
print("\nSArr3 contains:\n", SArr3)

#slice using np.newaxis
SArr4 = Arr[:,1,np.newaxis]
print("\nSArr4 contains:\n", SArr4)
</pre>
</div>
<p>The output of the above code will be:</p>
<div>	
<pre>Arr contains:
[[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]

SArr1 contains:
 [2 5 8]

SArr2 contains:
 [[2 5 8]]

SArr3 contains:
 [[2]
  [5]
  [8]]

SArr4 contains:
 [[2]
  [5]
  [8]]
</pre>
</div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>What two people know is a secret. What ten people know is information.</em><br>(unknown)</p><p>I’ll go straight to the point: <strong>The Symfony app secret is critical for security.</strong> If it leaks, is cracked, or guessed, your application is compromised. If you have any suspicion it may have already leaked or be in danger of leaking, <a href="https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/getting_started/install_ez_platform/#change-installation-parameters" title="">replace it with a new secret</a>, and check your installation for possible intrusion. Now.</p>
</div><div><p>Here’s a quick summary of our advice, before we dive into the details:</p><ul><li>Replace any default secrets (see below)</li><li>Replace any short (less than 32 characters) secrets</li><li>Replace any old (several years) secrets</li><li>Replace any secrets that may have been exposed (config file on GitHub, site in dev-mode without access controls, etc)</li></ul><p>The Symfony  <code>FragmentListener</code> is made for handling edge-side includes (ESI), and is designed to execute PHP code in response to certain requests. This of course makes it a target of interest for attackers, which is why we only accept requests that are cryptographically signed with a valid keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC). To make a valid HMAC you need a key: The Symfony app secret.</p><p>This makes it crucial that this secret is indeed kept secret, to avoid any possibility of such code execution attacks. To illustrate how we can keep it secret, let’s look at how attackers can get hold of the secret.</p><p>The first, and easiest way is if the web site uses a default value. Ideally, software should not include any default secrets or passwords. Please note that while the current release of Ibexa DXP (v3.2) comes with a default secret, this is expected to end with v3.3 in December 2020. Until then, the solution is obviously to replace the default with your own secret. Here’s a list of current and older <strong>defaults you should never use:</strong></p><ul><li> <code>ff6dc61a329dc96652bb092ec58981f7</code></li><li> <code>ThisTokenIsNotSoSecretChangeIt</code></li><li> <code>ThisEzPlatformTokenIsNotSoSecret_PleaseChangeIt</code></li></ul><p>The second way is brute forcing the secret. To do that, the attacker must have access to a valid hash, knowledge of how the hash is generated, and enough computing power. For the hash, any valid fragment request URL will do, and those are by necessity included in ordinary responses from the web server. CSRF tokens and remember-me-cookies can also be based on the app secret. The open-source nature of the kernel of Ibexa DXP/ eZ Platform means the <em>how</em> of hash generation is also given.</p><p>How much computing power you need depends on how long and how random the secret is, and this is why the whole matter of the app secret is not in itself a security vulnerability. A strong, well-kept secret is impossible to crack within a time useful to the attacker. If it takes 1000 years to crack, no-one will bother. But if your secret is the word “secret”, it won’t last long. In other words, the rules for a strong app secret are the same as for a strong password. And fortunately, you don’t have to memorize your secret, you save it as you set up your site. This means you can make it very long and very random. <a href="https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/getting_started/install_ez_platform/#change-installation-parameters" title="">Our documentation now suggests a 64 characters-long secret</a> based on PHP’s cryptographically secure <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.random-bytes.php" title="">pseudo-random generator  <code>random_bytes()</code></a>. <strong>Change your secret if it is shorter than 32 characters.</strong></p><p>Be aware that old versions of eZ Publish Platform would auto-generate a random secret that wasn’t secure enough. It depended on the current time when the secret was generated, which can be leaked by checking the creation dates of the oldest content in an installation. This can limit the time to crack the secret to mere hours. <strong>If your app secret is years old, we strongly recommend replacing it with a new one.</strong> It’s a good idea to do this regularly in any case, for instance at one- or two-year intervals.</p><p>The third way for an attacker to get hold of the secret is through vulnerabilities. If the secret is stored in your config files, make sure your web server blocks all external access to those, as it should in any case. If your code is hosted on a public code repository on e.g. GitHub, make sure you don’t store this critical configuration there. Even if your repository isn’t public, it’s risky to put secrets into it. Repositories are duplicated onto developer’s private machines, where they can be leaked in many ways. If your secret is stored in an environment variable as is common in Platform.sh, it can be leaked for instance by <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.phpinfo.php" title="">phpinfo()</a>, which is exposed by the Symfony web debug toolbar when the site is running in dev mode. <strong>If your site is reachable on the public internet, either don’t use dev mode, or protect all access with a strong password.</strong></p><p>I hope this is all clear. Don’t hesitate to contact us in the comments, or <a href="https://doc.ibexa.co/en/latest/guide/reporting_issues/" title="">through secure channels</a> if that is needed. Thanks for reading, and stay secure!</p>

                        <p>Yes, you can create unlimited free surveys, unlimited questions and full access to small talk and conditional logic functionalities. The limitations for free surveys are: up to 100 responses per survey, no option to add your logo, social media links, create Call to Actions, or export the responses.</p>

                        <p>You can pretty much create surveys in any language. We support RTL (right to left) formats and Karen has been translated to six languages so far. But even if your language is not available yet, the content of your survey is entirely created by you, so for your users, they'll see it fully in your language. In that case, only the dashboard that you would access to see the responses would be in English.</p>

                        <p>They are ways to make your survey more interactive and smart. Small talks are responses to your user's responses before the next question. For example, if the question is "Do you like icecream?" After the user says "Yes," you could want to say "Of course, who doesn't?" or if the user says "No," you could say "What??? I don't believe it." Before displaying the next question.</p>
                        <p>Conditional Logic will direct the user to a completely different set of questions based on their responses.</p>

Nearly half of all new applications built inside Amazon this year are <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/11/30/exclusive-aws-chief-andy-jassy-wakeup-call-cloud-adoption/">running on Lambda</a>. Andy Jassy took time in his re:Invent keynote to call out the thousands of enterprises who now run Lambda workloads in production, but perhaps most interesting was that this year the new serverless feature announcements graduated to Jassy’s keynote — a spot usually reserved for the flashiest, most strategic reveals of the year. AWS, at least, clearly believes that serverless is now one of the primary selling points for its cloud.</p><p>(On the other hand, there’s <a href="https://thenewstack.io/adoption-of-aws-lambda-serverless-stalls/">this odd article</a>, which spends most of its length demonstrating FaaS growth, but ran under the headline “Serverless Adoption Stalls” because … Kubernetes teams say they aren’t using as much Lambda? In other news, cats report eating fewer vegetables.)</p><p>What’s not in debate is that Lambda, still the 900-pound gorilla of FaaS, looks a lot different today than when it went GA in 2015. The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/forrestbrazeal/">loud, weird niche of engineers</a> who bought into serverless early have always had <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulDJohnston/status/1336765475615879181">very specific ideas</a> about what good serverless systems look like … and lately, Lambda’s been rattling their assumptions.</p><h2 id="h-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-serverless-manifesto">The Decline and Fall of The Serverless Manifesto</h2><p>Those original ideals of FaaS purity didn’t just materialize out of thin air. As recently as 2016, AWS serverless leadership was talking up something they called the Serverless Compute Manifesto. This was a radical vision for how Functions-as-a-Service should, uh, function. The manifesto showed up at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCOgc3MRUrs">all sorts of talks</a>, including <a href="https://twitter.com/Serverlessconf/status/735839492431548418">at ACG’s ServerlessConf</a>. Here are its key tenets:</p><p><em><strong>The Serverless Compute Manifesto (circa 2016)</strong></em></p><ul><li><em>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling</em></li><li><em>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model</em></li><li><em>Permanent storage lives elsewhere</em></li><li><em>Scales per request; Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity</em></li><li><em>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)</em></li><li><em>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere</em></li></ul><p>This manifesto formed a shocking and highly countercultural blueprint for how to build and deploy software. It attracted a small but vibrant community of true believers and a somewhat larger and much louder set of skeptics.&nbsp;</p><p>But in retrospect, the serverless compute manifesto had trouble penetrating beyond that small, engaged nucleus. The bold vision just left out too many existing, legacy workloads and teams.</p><p>So, gradually, like the commandments in Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm, </em>AWS’s non-negotiables of serverless compute began to change. Let’s run through each point of the manifesto and see if Lambda still adheres to it.</p><p><strong>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling?</strong></p><p><em>Sorta, but not strictly. </em>You can deploy multi-function Lambda Layers to manage large binaries, or (now in preview) Lambda Extensions to plug in third-party agents that I’ve been told should definitely not be thought of as “sidecars for Lambda”.</p><p><strong>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true. </em>As of re:Invent 2020, Lambda <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/packaging-aws-lambda-functions-as-container-images">now allows you to bring your own containers</a> instead of just shipping a ZIP file of code.</p><p><strong>Permanent storage lives elsewhere?</strong></p><p><em>Not necessarily. </em>Lambda now integrates with EFS, which I guess is technically “elsewhere”, but no more so than any other NFS share attached to a server is “elsewhere”. It’s a persistent filesystem mounted to your compute.</p><p><strong>Scales per request?</strong></p><p><em>Yes!</em> Now that Lambda can run containers, I believe the request model is now the biggest remaining conceptual difference between Lambda and a managed container service like AWS Fargate. Lambda gives you a new execution environment per concurrent request, whereas a Fargate-like service will still process multiple concurrent requests on the same (long-lived) container.</p><p><strong>Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true. </em>Meet Provisioned Capacity, which trades your cold start problem for a hot cost problem. (I snark, but Provisioned Capacity is way better than running your own Lambda pre-warming job, which a LOT of people used to do.)</p><p><strong>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true – </em>not if you use Provisioned Capacity or EFS, anyway.</p><p><strong>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere?</strong></p><p><em>Ehhhh. </em>This one is about abstracting away availability zones, which a lot of higher-level AWS services besides Lambda (including Fargate!) now do. That said, we’re starting to hear more guidance from AWS that really, the fault domain you need to be thinking about is regions. That’s right: regions are the new availability zones, and savvy Lambda developers are rolling their own (very un-managed) multi-region architectures as we speak.&nbsp;</p><p>To reinforce the trend, let’s check in with two other defining early features of Lambda:</p><p><strong>Intentional time and space constraints?</strong></p><p><em>Less and less true</em>. Function disk sizes, runtime limits, and CPU and memory sizes have steadily increased over the last 5 years. Today you can run a Lambda function for 15 minutes with 10 GB of memory and 6 vCPUs – a hefty enough blob of compute to make you think seriously about multi-threading, multi-purpose functions, and other things that are against the old ideals of FaaS.</p><p><strong>Zero-trust networking?</strong></p><p><em>Only if you want it. </em>In the old days, Lambda architectures biased heavily toward IAM security rather than using VPCs, partly for ideological reasons but also because attaching functions to custom ENIs added tremendous cold start overhead. Today, innovation from AWS has made customer-managed VPCs much more compatible with Lambda.</p><p>So what we have now is an updated manifesto that looks like this:</p><p><em><strong>The Serverless Compute Manifesto (circa 2020)</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><s>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling</s></em></li><li><em><s>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model</s></em></li><li><em><s>Permanent storage lives elsewhere</s></em></li><li><em>Scales per request; </em><em><s>Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity</s></em></li><li><em><s>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)</s></em></li><li><em><s>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere</s></em></li><li><em><s>Intentional time and space constraints</s></em></li><li><em><s>Zero-trust networking</s></em></li></ul><p>I feel like Willy Wonka at the end of the chocolate factory tour, looking around to see where all the children went. Of all those ideological principles, those lines in the sand, <em>per-request scaling is the only thing left.&nbsp;</em></p><p>You can still build according to the original serverless manifesto, of course. But the service doesn’t <em>require </em>you to.</p><p>If you had to distill the revised value prop of Lambda down into a single maxim, <em>Animal Farm-</em>style, what would you even say at this point? “<em>All workloads are managed, but some are more managed than others?</em>“</p><h2 id="h-the-rise-of-serverless-for-everyone">The rise of serverless for everyone</h2><p>This seems like the right time to clarify that I mostly like the additions to Lambda. I think they are necessary and in many cases, an unmixed good.</p><p>I wouldn’t have said that four years ago. I was much more of a FaaS purist at that time. What changed my mind was years of hearing a very particular type of statement from engineering teams, repeated over and over in different variations:</p><p><strong><em>I would love to use Lambda, if only it …</em></strong><em> </em>[connected back to my on-prem VPC, was big enough to run my workload, let me use the same language or developer tooling as my other systems, was always warm, supported some form of shared storage, etc, etc]</p><p>My first reaction to these statements was: Why would you want to use Lambda if you can’t or won’t embrace stateless, containerless, scale-to-zero functions? That’s the whole <em>point </em>of Lambda. It sounded to me like those Kubernetes cats from the New Stack survey, saying they’d really like to eat vegetables if they only contained more meat.</p><p>But I’ve since come to understand that the really powerful part of that statement is the beginning part. It’s a statement of longing.</p><p><em>I’d love to use Lambda, if only …</em></p><p>What is it about Lambda, and serverless compute in general, that inspires this reaction in so many people? Why does a brand-new baby computing paradigm spark such compulsive interest everywhere from tiny startups to big ol’ legacy enterprises?</p><p>Because more than any specific technical detail, serverless computing is an idea. An idea expressed in a simple phrase: <em>Own less, build more. </em>All the serverless doctrine, all the technical guidance boils down to this goal.

<p>Not everyone understands how open source is made. I received the following email from NASA a while ago.</p>



<h2>Subject: Curl Country of Origin and NDAA Compliance</h2>



<blockquote><p>Hello, my name is [deleted] and I am a Supply Chain Risk Management Analyst at NASA. As such, I ensure that all NASA acquisitions of Covered Articles comply with Section 208 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, Public Law 116-94, enacted December 20, 2019. To do so, the Country of Origin (CoO) information must be obtained from the company that develops, produces, manufactures, or assembles the product(s). To do so, please provide an email response or a formal document (a PDF on company letterhead is preferred, but a simple statement is sufficient) specifically identifying the country, or countries, in which Curl <strong>is developed and maintained</strong></p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>If the country of origin is outside the United States, please provide any information you may have stating that testing is performed in the United States prior to supplying products to customers. Additionally, if available, please identify all authorized resellers of the product in question.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Lastly, please confirm that Curl <strong>is not developed by, contain components developed by</strong>, or receive substantial influence from entities prohibited by Section 889 of the 2019 NDAA. These entities include the following companies and any of their subsidiaries or affiliates:</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Hytera Communications Corporation<br>Huawei Technologies Company<br>ZTE Corporation<br>Dahua Technology Company<br>Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Company</p><p>Finally, we have a time frame of 5 days for a response.<br>Thank you,</p></blockquote>



<h2>My answer</h2>



<p>Okay, I first considered going with strong sarcasm in my reply due to the complete lack of understanding, and the implied threat in that last line. What would happen if I wouldn’t respond in time?</p>



<p>Then it struck me that this could be my chance to once and for all get a confirmation if curl is already actually used in space or not. So I went with informative and a friendly tone.</p>



<blockquote><p>Hi [name],</p><p>I will answer to these questions below to the best of my ability, and maybe you can answer something for me?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>curl (https://curl.se) is an open source project that creates two products, curl the command line tool and libcurl the library. I am the founder, lead developer and core maintainer of the project. To this date, I have done about 57% of the 26,000 changes in the source code repository. The remaining 43% have been done by 841 different volunteers and contributors from all over the world. Their names can be extracted from our git repository: https://github.com/curl/curl</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>You can also see that I own most, but not all, copyrights in the project.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>I am a citizen of Sweden and I’ve been a citizen of Sweden during the entire time I’ve done all and any work on curl. The remaining 841 co-authors are from all over the world, but primarily from western European countries and the US. You could probably say that we live primarily “on the Internet” and not in any particular country.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We don’t have resellers. I work for an American company (wolfSSL) where we do curl support for customers world-wide.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Our testing is done universally and is not bound to any specific country or region. We test our code substantially before release.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Me knowingly, we do not have any components or code authored by people at any of the mentioned companies.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>So finally my question: can you tell me anything about where or for what you use curl? Is it used in anything in space?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Regards,<br>Daniel</p></blockquote>



<h2>Used in space?</h2>



<p>Of course my attempt was completely in vain and the answer back was very brief and it just said…</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NASA_logo.png" alt="" width="399" height="334"></figure></div>

                <p>Noah Kagan is a pretty busy dude. At age 24 he was employee #30 at Facebook. After leaving Facebook he served as Marketing Director at <a href="https://mint.intuit.com/">Mint.com</a> helping grow the company to over 1 million users. He then founded <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2009/03/11/gambit-helps-game-developers-make-more-real-money-from-virtual-goods/">Gambit</a> which helped game companies add in-app purchases and then after being sued launched AppSumo.</p><h2 id="coming-up-with-app-sumo">Coming up with App Sumo</h2><p>While running Gambit, <strong>Noah ran into customers complaining that they needed less monetisation tools and more customers,</strong> and after two years living on his mother's couch he realised exactly how to do that.</p><p>He had the idea to create a weekly deal platform to help people grow their business. <strong>To get the MVP done fast, he outsourced building a small sales page to a freelancer for $50.</strong></p><p>Next Noah researched AppSumo's competitor <a href="http://macheist.com/">Macheist</a>, a website that bundled and resold Mac OS X software, luckily for Noah they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacHeist">shared their sales revenue publicly</a>.</p><p>From these revenue numbers, he was able to quickly figure out what profit Macheist was making per bundle. This gave him a major insight into how App Sumo should charge and operate.</p><figure><img src="https://validationguide.com/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://validationguide.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image.png 600w, https://validationguide.com/content/images/2020/12/image.png 838w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l7F-n0ZmXaUEvzXtLu6GVyx6taaeQpkhZYRAgsIeReA/edit?usp=sharing">Link to spreadsheet</a></p><h2 id="validating-appsumo">Validating AppSumo</h2><p>Noah knew the AppSumo model would work from the above calculations but he didn't know whether people would buy digital goods on a time-limited basis. So in order to validate this hypothesis he needed to find a product with an audience that he could test it on.</p><p>He decided to use Imgur.com and Reddit Ads as his initial testing product. Imgur.com was the most popular image hosting tool on Reddit and offered a paid pro account option for $25 per year which made it ideal for a time-limited offer. </p><p>In order to set this up, he cold emailed the founder of Imgur, Alan Schaaf. Promising to bring him paying customers, and would even pay Imgur for each one he converted (not a tough sell).</p><figure><img src="https://validationguide.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://validationguide.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-1.png 600w, https://validationguide.com/content/images/2020/12/image-1.png 823w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/</figcaption></figure><p>In order to determine success with the ad campaign. Noah set a goal of 100 sales which would be an indicator as to whether or not the model was working. </p><p>Why 100? </p><blockquote>I decided on “100” after looking at my time value of money. If I could arrange a deal in two hours (find, secure, and launch), I wanted to have a return of at least $300 for those two hours of work. 100 sales ($3 commission per sale) was that amount. - <a href="https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/">Source</a></blockquote><p>Luckily for AppSumo by the end of the ad campaign, they had sold more than 200 Imgur pro accounts.</p><h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2><ul><li><strong>Research your competitor's business models.</strong> How are they reaching customers?

Would this model work for my idea?</li><li><strong>Do stuff that doesn't scale.</strong> Cold emailing the first deal was the key to being able to test AppSumo and get early revenue.</li><li><strong>Build only whats necessary.</strong> AppSumo was a simple sales page built by a freelancer for $50. No heavy development work needed.</li><li><strong>Set a goal for your test.</strong> If AppSumo didn't hit 100 sales then Noah would have validated that the time limited deal model didn't work well.</li></ul><h2 id="sources">Sources</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-story-behind-AppSumo">https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-story-behind-AppSumo</a></li><li><a href="https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/">https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/</a></li><li><a href="https://theunconventionalists.com/tv-show/noah-kagan">https://theunconventionalists.com/tv-show/noah-kagan</a></li><li><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2009/03/11/gambit-helps-game-developers-make-more-real-money-from-virtual-goods/">https://venturebeat.com/2009/03/11/gambit-helps-game-developers-make-more-real-money-from-virtual-goods/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.macheist.com/">https://www.macheist.com/</a></li></ul>

December 18, 2020 | https://thesephist.com/posts/focus/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thesephist.com/posts/focus/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>I’ve had an easy time being <em>focused</em> lately. I say no to obligations or opportunities that I would have easily accepted before. I have fewer things on my todo list, which means I get to spend more time on the few things that I’ve said yes to when I sit down to be creative. I also have a stronger sense of my values – what’s important to me, and what’s less important – and that’s helped me leave more room in my schedule for myself. I’ve been thinking about why it’s easier for me to focus now, and what might have changed.</p>
<p>The most significant change in my thinking has been that <strong>I have a lot of conviction now that the few things I’m spending my time on – university, writing, side projects – are right for me.</strong> If a stranger had come up to me last year, told me I was doing it all wrong, and suggested I make different choices in my education or my work, I would have been easily swayed. Today, I feel myself standing on much firmer ground. Because I’m sure that I’m spending my time on the right things, it’s easy for me to say no to things that’ll take that time away from me for something else.</p>
<p>There wasn’t a moment in time when I suddenly decided that I was going to become focused, and started <em>having confidence</em> in what I do. Confidence doesn’t work that way – it’s <em>earned</em>, not <em>found</em>. To earn confidence (and the focus that comes with it), we need to explore our options, try things out, open all the different doors in front of us, and then say, “this is the best option for me, so I’m going to do this.” Only that kind of conviction, coming from true belief and not just blunt willpower, can give you the certainty you need to be focused on the few <em>right</em> things. I suspect this is the reason many students who take gap years or gap semesters return with more confidence and perspective. They’ve explored more of their options, and find themselves more focused.</p>
<p>All this has me convinced that <strong>focus isn’t just stubbornly saying “I’m going to say no to more things,” it’s studying all the options you have until you can say with conviction, “this is the right one for me."</strong> Paradoxically, this means attaining focus requires us to become <em>less focused</em> for a little bit, exploring our options enough to develop some conviction around what’s important or what feels right.</p>
<p>At any moment, we are either in a <em>divergent</em> phase of life, or in a <em>convergent</em> phase. During a divergent period, we’re usually focused on broadening our inputs. We go to school, take on internships, travel, try a career switch, and so on, exploring new paths. During a convergent time, we take what we’ve learned thus far to double down on just a handful of goals on which we can spend our energy – we become more focused. We grow fastest not by converging constantly onto some single point set from the start, but over cycles of divergence and convergence that come and go like seasons.</p>
<p>These cycles of divergence and convergence come from the heart, not from circumstance. You can’t force yourself to become focused by picking an option when you aren’t sure that it’s right. If your choice isn’t based on the confidence you have in that decision, your focus ends up pulled apart by the worry that you’ve missed out on the roads not taken.</p>
<p>Focus is a destination, not a path. And the only way to get there is to earn the confidence to feel that what you’re working on is the right one for you, so you can say no to everything else. And the only way to feel right in what you do is to try your chances with the paths that might be wrong, too. That isn’t wasted effort – it’s what’s required of us to earn our focus.</p>
<p>So if you feel lost or directionless, instead of making yourself pick a direction while lost at sea, consider drifting for a bit. Try things out. Open the unopened doors. Say yes to a few more things. And then when you feel the winds turning, set your sail to what feels right, indisputably and confidently right. It might take more time, and you might feel behind sometimes, but when you finally set off, you won’t need to look back.</p>

<p>All around us, we are surrounded by crappy software. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://software.rajivprab.com/2020/04/25/preventing-software-rot/" target="_blank">Pension funds that are stumbling along using decades old batch scripts with faulty assumptions</a>. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach" target="_blank">Credit agencies leaking over a hundred million social security numbers and other confidential data</a>. And not to even mention the tons of buggy and frustrating software that we see all around us, from smaller vendors and older enterprise software.</p>



<p>Such incompetence would never fly in other engineering disciplines. We would never put up with bridges that are as buggy as your average software system. So why is software engineering so bad? Why is there so much crap software out there?</p>

<p>To understand the reason, we need to first understand how developer skill is related to the usefulness of the software they produce for a given task.</p>

<p>In the first bucket, you have the “developers” who are effectively incompetent. You might see a wide range of skill levels within this bucket… but they are all similar in that their end-product is functionally useless. Computers are ruthless in that regard – if you can’t figure out how to make your app compile, you might as well have not written it at all. If you can’t figure out how to build the core functionality of your app, absolutely no one will use it. Below a certain skill threshold, you will not produce any usable software. Most “developers” in this bucket may dabble with coding in their free time, but you will rarely find them producing professional software.</p>



<p>Once you go past this threshold however, things change. At the lower end, the developers are now good enough to produce minimally viable software systems. And as these developers get better and better, the usefulness of their software improves rapidly as well. An app that “worked” but was slow, buggy, insecure, and incomprehensible… slowly starts to become less buggy, more performant, more secure, and easier to understand. Unlike the other two buckets, as the developers in this bucket grow their skills, the software they produce becomes significantly better.</p>



<p>And finally, when developers reach a certain threshold of skill, they cross over into the third bucket. A bucket where everyone has reached such a high level of competency (relative to the problem they are solving), that further personal-growth will make minimal difference to the end product. Ie, any random staff engineer at Google can build a CRUD app that is just as good as Jeff Dean’s.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>In an ideal world</strong>, the only developers in the first and second buckets would be students or entry-level hires. And all professional software systems would be primarily built by developers in the third bucket. Developers who have mastered all the skills needed to solve the assigned problem, and produce solutions that are pretty darn close to the platonic ideal. In such a heavenly world, all the software that we see around us, would be at a similarly high level of quality … performing exactly as expected, at optimal performance, with no security holes. A world where the general public reacts to all software with joy, not frustration.</p>



<p>However, there are two problems standing between us and this utopia.</p>



<p>First, the number of developers in the 3rd bucket is exceedingly small, relative to the second bucket. Programming is a “easy to learn, hard to master” activity. Millions of people can write a functional script, but very few have mastered the art of software engineering. Further, there is no gatekeeping for the software industry whatsoever – no software equivalent to the American Medical Association, or the Bar Association for lawyers. Not surprisingly, you have far more people who are of novice and intermediate competency, as opposed to expert competency.</p>



<p>Second, the demand for developers is immense. There are opportunities for software developers to make huge improvements, in almost every single industry. Compared to more niche professions such as astronomy, where opportunities are severely limited, software development is a talent-constrained field. Ie, the main bottleneck is finding talented software developers, not finding useful work for them to do.</p>



<p>Combine both of these problems, and most companies that want to hire expert developers are locked out from doing so. There aren’t enough expert developers available for them to hire, and the ones that do often have unmatchably high offers from FANG companies or hot startups.</p>



<p>And so, every other company does the next best thing. They hire developers from the second bucket. Developers who can broadly be categorized as “good enough”. Their apps have bugs, security vulnerabilities, and they fail to handle high loads. But at least they are able to build something that “works”. Something that is more useful than the status-quo. Something that can be rolled out into production with minimal regulatory scrutiny.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>You might be tempted</strong> to think that the above is a natural state of the world, across all professions. But that is actually not the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are tons of jobs that fall into the “easy to master” category. Jobs like being a taxi driver, or a construction worker, or a bartender. Jobs where a large fraction of  workers have reached the master-competency bucket, and there are severely diminishing returns to further improvements in skill.</p>



<p>And there are also tons of professions where opportunities are so limited, that employers can choose to hire only those with expert competency. For example, pianists. Amateur pianists abound in every family gathering, but you will never find them playing in a concert hall, given that the number of talented pianists far outstrips the number of scheduled concerts.</p>



<p>And finally, you have the jobs that are hard to master, with plentiful opportunities, but regulatory barriers to entry. For example, medical doctors. In a pre-Obamacare world, there were plenty of people who couldn’t afford health insurance, who would have chosen “some” healthcare over no healthcare at all <em>(whether or not that is advisable, is a whole other can of worms)</em>. And yet, because of strict regulations, only those showing great competency are allowed to offer medical services. Similarly for many other engineering disciplines that face tremendous regulatory oversight, such as building bridges or skyscrapers or medical devices.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Software development is a curious cross-section</strong> of all the above. It is easy to learn, so legions of “good enough” developers exist all around the world. Developers who build software solutions that are somewhat useful, but littered with bugs and security vulnerabilities. And at the same time, it is hard to master, so developers who can avoid the above pitfalls, are much harder to find.</p>



<p>Software development is so opportunity-rich, that most employers find it almost impossible to recruit expert-developers. It is so opportunity-rich, that despite the veritable legions of novice developers worldwide, jobs exist for each and every one of them.</p>



<p>And lastly, software engineering has no gatekeeping whatsoever. Anyone can attend a coding bootcamp, take a few online coding classes, and start selling their services on Upwork the next day. And their work product can be rolled out into production immediately, with no regulatory oversight.</p>



<p>Combine all three, and it is easy to see why there’s so much crappy software out there. Software is eating the world, and so too are its bugs and security holes.</p>

<p><em><strong>Addendum</strong>: As critical as this article may sound, I am not recommending that we gatekeep the software profession, or subject all software systems to regulatory approval. This is meant to be a descriptive essay, not prescriptive. </em></p>



<p><em>This essay also focuses solely on the developer side of the equation.

    <p>I was explaining about docker to my colleagues and I was struck by an epiphany: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)">Docker</a> is essentially object oriented programming (OOP) for systems programming. For the uninitiated Docker is OS-level virtualization that allow you to package softwares and make the installations easy and reproducible across systems. No more <em>but it worked on my computer</em> problems. Follow this <a href="https://kevalnagda.github.io/getting-started-with-docker">tutorial from Keval</a> to get a good idea of how it works. In this post, I’ll quickly review the docker concepts so that we can make the connection to OOP.</p>

<p>In docker, you build an <em>image</em> by specifying instructions in <code>Dockerfile</code> on how to install your application. You can think of an image as packaged file system containing your programs. For example, here’s how you build an image.</p>

<pre><code># Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:18.04
RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
RUN pip3 install numpy
CMD python3 -m http.server
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>Dockerfile</code> starts with <code>FROM ubuntu:18.04</code> which means you’re using ubuntu 18.04 as base image and <code>RUN</code>s the next two commands in this image. <code>CMD</code> specifies the default command when you run this image. You build the image by running:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>docker build <span>-t</span> numpy <span>.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once built, you can use this image to spin up an <em>container</em> in which you can run whatever you want. Let’s spin up a container and run python.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ docker run -it numpy python3
Python 3.6.9 (default, Oct  8 2020, 12:12:24) 
[GCC 8.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Obviously numpy is already installed in this container. How do we get input and output to this container? We can use file system and/or networking to interact with the container. Here’s an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span><span>mkdir </span>input_dir
<span>$ </span><span>touch </span>input_dir/hi
<span>$ </span><span>echo</span> <span>"hello sasank"</span> <span>&gt;</span> input_dir/hi
<span>$ </span>docker run <span>-p</span> 8001:8000 <span>-v</span> <span>`</span><span>pwd</span><span>`</span>/input_dir:/root/input numpy 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>-p</code> publishes port 8001 from docker and maps it to port number 8000 (the default python server port) inside docker. <code>-v</code> mounts input_dir in the present directory to <code>/root/input</code> of the container. In a different terminal, you can verify that the filesystem and network I/O worked with curl.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>curl localhost:8001/root/input/hi
hello sasank
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now why am I calling this object oriented programming? Let’s start with clarifying what OOP is. In OOP, we have a <em>class</em> which encapsulates the <em>data</em> and <em>methods</em> of a particular functionality. For example, <code>Human</code> can be class whose data is the name and method is <code>what_is_your_name()</code>. You’ll have to create an <em>instance</em> of the <code>Human</code> class (say <code>sasank</code>) to interact with it. Once instantiated, the only way to interact with this instance is through the method (e.g., <code>sasank.what_is_your_name()</code>). What the class does internally is treated like a black box. A class can <em>inherit</em> data and methods from another class (say <code>Animal</code>)</p>

<p>Docker image is exactly like a class in which you define instructions to install your app. Data of this class is the code to run your app. Methods are what your app does. <code>FROM</code> is inheritance where you can inherit data and methods from a previously built image. You instantiate an image by spinning up a container. You interact with your container through filesystem and networking. What the container does internally is not your problem. I summarized the argument below:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Docker</th>
      <th>Object Oriented Programming</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Image</td>
      <td>Class</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Installed packages and code</td>
      <td>Data</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>CMD</code> and what your code does</td>
      <td>Methods</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>FROM</code></td>
      <td>Inheritance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Container</td>
      <td>Instance</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You usually make different classes interact with each other by <em>composition</em> where each interact with other through methods. This is exactly the use case of <code>docker-compose</code> where you can make different container interact with each other. For example your backend and front end can be two containers which can be composed in the following way:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>version: "3"
services:
  backend:
    image: jodogne/orthanc-plugins
    ports:
      - 8042:8042

  frontend:
    image: ohif/viewer
    ports:
      - 3000:80

volumes: 
  orthanc_db:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All in all, docker is just OOP for systems programming. No wonder we all love docker and its abstractions.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><section><p><em>This article was also published on <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/chrome-extension-tutorial-replace-images-in-any-website-with-pikachu-de2a6e3548bb">Level Up Coding's gitconnected</a></em></p><p>What’s a better way to learn how to make a Chrome extension than making the web cuter with Pikachu images?</p><p>In this tutorial, I will show you how you can create a simple Chrome extension that replaces images on websites with Pikachu images. We will discuss topics like content scripts, background scripts, and messages between scripts in Chrome extensions.</p><p>The code for this tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/shahednasser/pikachu-everywhere" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>First thing you need to do when creating any chrome extension is start with creating a <strong><strong>manifest.json </strong></strong>file in the root of the extension’s directory. For now, this file will hold only the following basic information about your extension:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Here is what everything in this file means:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>name:</strong></strong> The name of the extension. I named the extension “Pikachu Everywhere”</li><li><strong><strong>version</strong></strong>: This is the version of the extension. When you publish the extension in the Chrome Web Store and you need to update it, you will have to increase the version number so it’s good to start with a low number.</li><li><strong><strong>description: (Optional) </strong></strong>Description of your extension</li><li><strong><strong>manifest_version</strong></strong>: As of Chrome 18, developers are required to use manifest version 2, since manifest version 1 is now deprecated.</li><li><strong><strong>icons: (Optional) </strong></strong>Here we specify the extension’s icon. This icon will show up in your browser’s toolbar, the Chrome Web Store, and any other place that requires to show it. For that reason, it’s good to include different sizes of the icon. I have used an icon from <a href="https://www.freeiconspng.com/img/17360" rel="noopener">Free Icons PNG</a> and resized the icons using <a href="https://resizeimage.net/" rel="noopener">https://resizeimage.net/</a> (You can find the images in the <a href="https://github.com/shahednasser/pikachu-everywhere" rel="noopener">GitHub repository</a>). The paths specified for these images is relative to the root of the extension.</li></ol><p>With this, we have the core of any Chrome extension. Next, we’ll add the extension to the browser.</p><p>Go to chrome://extensions. There, you can toggle developer mode at the top right corner. Once you do that, a new toolbar will show up with three buttons: “Load unpacked,” “Pack extension,” and “Update.” Click on “Load unpacked” and choose your extension’s directory.</p><p>Once you do that, you will see that your new chrome extension is now working. Yes, it does nothing, but it’s working.</p><p>In Chrome extensions, there are two types of scripts you can use. There are Background scripts and Content scripts. Background scripts run (obviously) in the background. They are loaded when needed and unloaded when idle. They are used to listen to certain events in your Chrome extension.</p><p>Content scripts are scripts loaded once you open a website and injected it into it. Once you open a website, they will start running just like any other script on that website. After you close the website, the content scripts on that website will stop running as well.</p><p>For our extension, we want to replace every image on every website with Pikachu images. In order to do that we need to specify a content script that works every time you open a web page.</p><p>Let’s create our content script in <code>assets/js/contentScript.js</code> and include the following script to test whether our extension is working or not:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>One other thing we need to do is tell Chrome which script do we need to run as a content script. Add the following lines to <strong><strong>manifest.json</strong></strong></p><figure></figure><p>Here we are using <code>content_scripts</code> as key with the value as an array. Here’s what everything in the array means:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>matches</strong></strong>: here you can specify which URLs the content script should run on. In our case we want our content script to run on all pages. So, we use the placeholder “&lt;all_urls&gt;” to specify that.</li><li><strong><strong>all_frames</strong></strong>: this key is used to allow the extension to specify if JavaScript and CSS files should be injected into all frames matching the specified URL requirements or only into the topmost frame in a tab.</li><li><strong><strong>js: </strong></strong>here we specify the script we want to run as a content script. You can specify more than one script, so the value has to be an array</li></ol><p>Now we’re ready to test our content script.</p><p>But before we do that we need to do one small step. In order to inform chrome that we updated our chrome extension, we need to go back to chrome://extensions, go to our extension, and press the reload icon.</p><p>To test if our content script is working, go to any web page you want, reload the page if it was opened before, then right-click and press Inspect. In DevTools, open the Console tab. You will see in your console as expected:</p><figure><img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hbqmf3mbz/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/chrome-extension-screenshot-1.png"><figcaption>Console of a web page</figcaption></figure><p>So, we can verify that our content script is working. Try reloading the page, and the content script will execute again. Try opening another web page, and the content script will execute on that page independently.</p><p>Now, we know how to inject a script on any web page, and through that script we can do our work.</p><p>In our case, we need to replace every image in any website with random Pikachu images. To do that, we will use <a href="https://some-random-api.ml/img/pikachu" rel="noopener">this API</a> which will provide us with a JSON object containing the link of a Pikachu image. Each request to that API will look something like this:</p><figure><img src="https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hbqmf3mbz/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/chrome-extension-screenshot-2.png"><figcaption>Result of API call</figcaption></figure><p>With the help of this API, the steps to achieve what we need will be as follows:</p><ol><li>Get all image elements on the web page.</li><li>Perform a GET request to the API to retrieve a random Pikachu image link.</li><li>Replace the image elements’ <code>src</code> attributes with the links we retrieve.</li></ol><p>This all sounds good and easy, but there is one complication: content scripts in Chrome extensions cannot perform Cross-Origin requests.</p><p>So how can we fetch the image URLs from the API? We will need to use a Background script.</p><p>As we specified earlier, Background scripts run in the background in Chrome. They are not dependent on any web page.</p><p>Scripts in Chrome extensions are isolated from each other. However, they share a mean of communication through the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_index" rel="noopener">Chrome API</a>.</p><p>What we will do is that we will listen for a message in the <strong><strong>background</strong></strong> script sent from <strong><strong>content</strong></strong> scripts. Every time a web page opens, our content script will run, send a message to the background script requesting an image URL. The background script will then perform the asynchronous call to the Pikachu API, retrieve the link and send it back to the content script.</p><p>This may sound complicated at first, but it’s actually done in a very simple manner.</p><p>Let us first start by creating the background script and see it in action. Create <code>assets/js/background.js</code> with the following content:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now, we need to tell Chrome that the file we just created will be our background script. In order to do that, we need to go back to our <strong><strong>manifest.json</strong></strong> and add the following:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Here is what everything means:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>scripts: </strong></strong>An array that holds the paths of the scripts we will use as background scripts. In our case, it’s just one.</li><li><strong><strong>persistent</strong></strong>: should always be false unless the extension uses Chrome’s Web Request API to block or modify network requests.</li></ol><p>Now, Chrome will know about our background script. It will load it when it’s needed, and unload it when it becomes idle.</p><p>To test our background script, we need to reload our extension as we did earlier.</p><p>Once you do that, you will see a new link appear in your extension’s info box with the text “inspect views background page”:</p><figure><img src="https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hbqmf3mbz/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/chrome-extension-screenshot-3.png"></figure><p>If you click on it, a new DevTool will open and in the console you will see:</p><figure><img src="https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hbqmf3mbz/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/chrome-extension-screenshot-4.png"></figure><p>We can now confirm that our background script is working. Even if you close any other web page or reload any web page, nothing will change in the background script.</p><p>Let’s go back to our objective again. We now need to listen to messages in our background script, and on receiving a new message fetch the URL from the Pikachu API.</p><p>In order to listen to messages, we will use the following method in Chrome’s API:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>We need to pass a function to <code>addListener</code>. This function will be executed on receiving any new message. The function takes three parameters:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>message: </strong></strong>the message sent of type any.</li><li><strong><strong>sender: </strong></strong>of type <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#type-MessageSender" rel="noopener">MessageSender</a></li><li><strong><strong>senderResponse: </strong></strong>Callback function to call (at most once) when you have a response. This function is sent by the sender on sending the message.</li></ol><p>So this is what our <strong><strong>background.js </strong></strong>file should look like now:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Now our background script is ready to receive messages, but there are no messages being sent.</p><p>As we said earlier, each time a page opens, our content script will loop through image elements in the web page, and send a message to the background script to fetch the Pikachu image link.</p><p>In order to send messages, we will need to use the following method from Chrome’s API:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The parameter’s being sent are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>extensionId: (Optional) </strong></strong>the ID of the extension we are sending the message to.

This is the <strong><strong>senderResponse</strong></strong> parameter in the previous method we saw.</li></ol><p>So, we will use this method in our content script to send a message to the background script to fetch the Pikachu URL from the API. Our content script should now look like this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Here’s what we’re doing in the above code:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Line 1: </strong></strong>get all image elements on the web page.</li><li><strong><strong>Line 2–6: </strong></strong>Loop through the image elements. On each element, we send a message to the background script. As you can tell, we are omitting the optional <strong><strong>extensionId </strong></strong>and <strong><strong>options</strong></strong> parameters. The first parameter is the <strong><strong>message </strong></strong>we are sending, and the second parameter is the callback function we want the background to execute after it fetches the image’s link.</li></ol><p>We are sending the object <strong><strong>{msg: ‘image’, index: i}</strong></strong> to our extension. This object has two properties. The first one is to specify what our message is about. In our extension, it might not be very helpful, but when you have an extension that uses different types of messages, it’s a good idea to differentiate what each message is for. The second property is to specify the index of the image the link is for in the <strong><strong>images</strong></strong> array. The reason behind this is that the callback function replacing the image will be called asynchronously, so <strong><strong>i </strong></strong>might point at another index at the time it’s being executed.</p><p>The callback function receives an object that has two properties. <strong><strong>data</strong></strong> will be the data received from the API call, and <strong><strong>index</strong></strong> will be the index …</p></section></section></div>

<p>2020 was actually a first-class year for technological innovation, but it will probably also go down in history as the year of the ultimate frustration of discouraged consumers, when the target group will end up not being able to buy what has been on their wish list for a long time: graphics cards and processors, power supplies and last but not least the ready-made solution in the form of the current consoles such as a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. Why is such a shortage arising in the first place? The big brands that are ultimately at stake (Sony, Microsoft, NVIDIA, AMD) all talk about “demand exceeding supply”. Oh, really?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-1024x491.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="491" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-1024x491.jpg 1024w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-300x144.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-768x368.jpg 768w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-1536x737.jpg 1536w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-990x475.jpg 990w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU-1320x633.jpg 1320w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CPU.jpg 1766w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>It is a rather evasive explanation, without any communication about the actual state of their supply and production lines. Every company, regardless of its size, also employs highly experienced specialists who plan production and procurement for the long term and create a so-called forecast, which is nothing more than a complex foresight that takes all factors into account. It is certainly possible for a company to miss the mark, as the example of AMD and Vega shows, where in the end they forgot to plan the packaging in advance with sufficient resources. But that suddenly everyone is supposed to be equally wrong is then rather unlikely.</p>
<p>Of course, one can go in search of causes and traces, exchange ideas with colleagues, tap and evaluate various own sources and also include the findings of other specialized media, which often have incomparably better access to the makers behind the scenes. The first conclusion that could be drawn fairly quickly is the common statement of almost everyone that the situation is really serious at the moment and will continue at least until spring 2021, because its causes are manifold and more complex than many company representatives would like to communicate publicly. In the end it is a causal chain, where all the imponderables and shortcomings also impressively show the negative side of globalisation.</p>
<h3><span><strong>The explosion of demand exists, but is not the only reason</strong></span></h3>
<p>The explosive growth in demand for various IT products is undeniable. First of all because of teleworking in the home office: printers and laptops are sold well and one of the leading providers of webcams even reported a historic sales record. On the gaming side, 2020 will see the most attractive market launch in a long time, driving new customers and upgraders into the shops in equal measure. Consoles like the PS5 or Xbox Series X, graphics cards like NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3000 or AMD’s RX 6000, new CPUs like the Ryzen 5000 series and finally, of course, box office hits like Apple’s M1 are fuelling a hype that is leading to a shortage of supply, as many interested parties would like to take the performance leaps (which have not been seen for several years) with them.</p>
<p>One of the largest suppliers of graphics cards explains that orders for the GeForce RTX 3000 from resellers are much higher than last year. Although the cards go out like hot cakes when they arrive, it is also explained that there are no more availability problems in relation to the number of pieces requested than in previous years. The same is also true for manufacturers of stationary gaming PCs and system integrators, who would have RTX 3000 graphics cards at their disposal, for example, but the demand is indeed greater than estimated and more and more mass retailers are entering this market, skimming off large quantities. As a result, even graphics cards of earlier generations are now affected by lack of availability. At AMD, Ryzen 4000 as a notebook CPU is becoming scarce, as is Ryzen 5000, so many manufacturers are now even switching back to Ryzen 3000. And as for AMD’s new RX-6000 series, AMD itself is talking about a transition period of up to eight weeks before it expects to meet the demand for board partner cards.</p>

<h3><span><strong>Transport problems as a historical crisis that causes additional damage</strong></span></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the COVID 19 pandemic, traffic has been out of control and panic has been rampant. But now, at the end of 2020, the situation is even worse than in spring. For example, an industry expert working for one of the leading providers of international transport services describes this unprecedented situation as “the biggest crisis ever” in transport between Asia and the rest of the world. Prices for container transport are also skyrocketing through the United States of America, which is attempting to monopolise most sea and air transport in order to import massive amounts of personal protective equipment (PPE) in addition to conventional goods.</p>
<p>Europe must therefore pay an ever higher price for its share in order to recover the lost transport capacity: the price has risen from around 2,000 to over 6,000 dollars for a single container, and only for pure port-to-port delivery. The same applies to air transport. A Chinese exporter explains that chartering a Boeing 747 today costs a whopping million dollars, compared to about 400,000 dollars as used to be the case. This is simply because you have to pay for the return flight of the plane, which is very likely to be empty, since there is currently a very large imbalance in the import-export market between China and Europe.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the price per kilo for air transport has doubled worldwide and Europe is increasingly resorting to the new Silk Road, which China has pushed very hard: conventional road and rail transport, the prices of which have even tripled in the meantime! Especially bulky peripherals, such as PC screens, are also suffering greatly: according to a well-known brand, prices rose by 15 or 25% in France, for example. According to the information, some computer components, sometimes even graphics cards, are now sent to Europe without their packaging as so-called “bulk goods” in order to save volume: they are packed into cartons on arrival later, if at all. Dead on Arrival? Not to be ruled out, which then causes even more frustration.</p>
<figure id="attachment_155103" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155103"><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-1024x581.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="581" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-768x436.jpg 768w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-1536x872.jpg 1536w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-2048x1163.jpg 2048w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-130x73.jpg 130w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-187x105.jpg 187w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-990x562.jpg 990w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DOA-1320x749.jpg 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-155103">Delivery from the online retailer without any cardboard box (igor’sLAB Forum)</figcaption></figure>
<p>
But on the transport side, even the deadline for technological products, which are often small, light and of high quality, remains a constant issue. Because the real problem at the moment is the lead time: it takes about 4 to 5 weeks to get transport space at all, which is four times longer than normal. By road and rail, crossing certain borders between China and Europe now takes an average of 10 days, whereas it used to take 3 days. This is pretty bad timing in the middle of the Christmas season and this delay will continue until at least next March according to sources.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Production as a taboo subject with serious consequences</strong></span></h3>
<p>The manufacturing industry is also currently in a historically difficult situation. The manufacturers of various products such as processors, motherboards or graphics cards officially do not appear to be overly concerned about this, but unfortunately the reality often looks completely different, as the entire production chain is, for various reasons, sometimes extremely disrupted (broken chain). First of all, the Taiwanese foundry TSMC is completely overwhelmed by the demand. The reason is actually quite simple: With the exception of the current RTX 3000 (Samsung), all market launches of the year 2020 rely on the 7-nm chips from TSMC. ARM-SoC manufacturers such as Qualcomm also use 7 nm and have only recently moved capacity from Samsung to TSMC. TSMC is currently pretty much alone in the market with this technology and the production lines are therefore working at full capacity. A sudden increase in production is therefore not possible.</p>
<p>A special insulating film, the so-called ABF substrate (Ajinomoto Build-up Film), which is indispensable for etching chips in 7 and 5 nm, has also become increasingly scarce and scarce in recent months. The prices for this film are said to have risen by 40% and the waiting time is said to have increased to up to 4 months. If manufacturers are now declaring that the shortage is likely to continue for a long time to come, it is also because the few suppliers of ABF substrate, such as Unimicron, Kinsus or Na Ya, are declaring that they will not be able to increase their production for another three quarters.</p>
<p>Other components make things even more complicated: The small additional chips (controller, supervisor, etc.) from ST Micro, NXP or Infineon are also missing due to another deficiency: silicon wafers with 8 inch diameter. Many products then suffer from this, such as PC power supplies, but also consoles of the PS5 and Xbox series X and the graphics cards. Flash memory and DRAMs, on the other hand, do not seem to be in real short supply, and the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are not as drastic as is often claimed, as the unaffected production capacities are now back to full capacity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-1024x572.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="572" srcset="https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-1024x572.jpg 1024w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-768x429.jpg 768w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-1536x858.jpg 1536w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-470x264.jpg 470w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-414x232.jpg 414w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-215x120.jpg 215w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-130x73.jpg 130w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-187x105.jpg 187w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-990x553.jpg 990w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID-1320x737.jpg 1320w, https://www.igorslab.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COVID.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>The political situation between China and the USA makes the situation even worse. Many Chinese productions are blocked by American trade restrictions, which makes the logistics of component assembly very difficult. Trade between China and Taiwan, which used to be very fluid and easy, is now becoming increasingly delicate and difficult. If some manufacturers are talking about a better situation in February, it is also because they expect a change of the American president and a relaxation of sanctions.</p>
<h3><span>Shortage? Not for all</span></h3>
<p>Not all manufacturers are equally affected. It seems that NVIDIA and Apple have each secured a large amount of ABF substrate thanks to their market position. Apple is on the 5 nm TSMC lines alone with a small chip (119 mm²), which is easier to produce in large quantities. NVIDIA, for its part, avoids bottlenecks at TSMC by producing in 8 nm at Samsung, whose performance remains competitive despite much larger GPUs (392 and 628 mm²). The two giants are doing quite well in this respect. According to our information, the next GeForce RTX 3060 (Ti) …</p></div></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>At first glance this appears to be a typical cheap microATX motherboard. Four DIMM slots arranged weird, a form-factor close to FlexATX but not quite, an expansion slot missing in one position and replaced with an M.2 slot in another, and a BGA processor that’s not a true SoC since it needs a separate chipset. The single video output and basic stereo audio suggest that this is meant to be used in a rather barebones system, perhaps an embedded system, but those tend to be green rather than this ugly brown. A set of dull, rectangular finstacks cool the chipset and VRMs. The only colorful part of the motherboard is the header for front-panel lights and buttons; every other slot, socket, and port is black. This is the sort of motherboard you’d find in a $300 Walmart special, not a shiny new gaming PC.</p>

<p>But I’m willing to overlook the spartan options and drab aesthetic for the novelty of a PC that uses an Xbox One APU.</p>

<p>I’ve wanted AMD to offer the Xbox One APU in a PC motherboard since 2013, and I never expected it to actually be made. It’s ironic that it’s only available now that the Xbox Series X is out. As soon as I learned it was available, I spent one-hundred and thirty-two United States dollars to ship a completely obsolete computer compoment with little hope of support from anybody in the supply chain from the other side of the planet, plus thirty-two dollarydoos for a kit of DDR3 because it isn’t even polite enough to boot with the RAM I had on hand.</p>

<p>But damn am I glad that this wasn’t available in 2013 because it would have cost a few hundred dollars mininum and, as a naive teenager and recent convert to PC, I actually would have had high hopes for it. My hopes today for anything approaching good performance have been thoroughly crushed. Waiting for benchmark runs to finish on an Athlon 5350 even with subambient cooling and a solid overclock will do that. This motherboard is only exciting now because it’s novel, but frankly it would’ve been mediocre in 2013 even if it had all the bells and whistles. It is completely obsolete now that Raven Ridge APUs exist. Actually I think my Crimson Canyon NUC would outperform this in nearly every metric, and the CPU in that thing is literally broken and was only ever sold because Intel needed to make shareholders happy.</p>

<p>Worst of all, even if you’re willing to accept that ok sure the seven-year-old APU based on a tablet architecture is kinda crap, you’re in for a rough time actually using it. The BIOS is half broken and AMD doesn’t officially distribute drivers, so you’re SOL if you want to <em>use the GPU</em>, which is <em>kinda the point of a game console.</em> Drivers are available, but the only public link is thanks to one guy in the Anglosphere who used a VPN to download them from a Japanese server that forbids foreign IP addresses and then hosted them on One Drive and dropped the link on the Linus Tech Tips forums.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> If you’re buying it new, then you can contact the seller, but I’m not sure how long they’ll be in business or how well they archive things.</p>

<p>Anyway, who wants to go down a rabbit hole?</p>



<h2 id="a-very-brief-history">A Very Brief History</h2>

<p>In short, AMD rebranded the Xbox One APU as a chip codenamed Cato and Chinese OEMs are now selling it for use in desktop PCs, but it actually seems that it was originally intended for embedded systems. Cato only emerged in 2019 in a screenshot of three SKUs’ specifications, but dates on my motherboard indicate that the APU was produced starting in 2014 and the chipset itself was produced in the end of 2015. The only available GPU drivers are based on version 17.12, which was released at the end of 2017. The GPU is reported as a 300-series part, which suggests a launch date around 2015. It’s hard to pin anything down for sure.</p>

<p>I can’t actually verify when or to whom this was released. AMD has kept quiet and sifting through their website has yielded nothing. A 2014 launch to enterprise customers makes more sense than a 2019 launch for mainstream PCs, but AMD refuses to let their old 28 nm cores die. Just last year in 2019 they released a new 1st-generation GCN GPU and two new Excavator APUs using years-old silicon.</p>

<p>I think the most likely possibility is a mix of these dates. AMD released an off-roadmap part around 2014 for embedded and industrial computers, but these computers are now being decommissioned and ending up in the hands of Chinese recyclers. Manufacturers in Shenzen are repurposing rather than destroying these embedded parts, and as of 2019 they are available in desktop PC motherboards.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-know">What We Know</h2>

<p>Cato is definitely the original 28 nm version of the Xbox One APU, itself codenamed Durango. Eyeballing the die next to my naked R9 280 (Tahiti-based, so 352 mm<sup>2</sup>) and making a couple sloppy measurments with my calipers indicates that the die is well over 300 mm<sup>2</sup>, which is consistent with Durango’s 363 mm<sup>2</sup> area. The package also features a shim that looks identical to the 28 nm APU, because it is the 28 nm APU.</p>

<p>There are at least three motherboards in the wild using this APU, and it’s very likely that there are at least two more. The motherboard that I have was manufactured by Biostar according to the AliExpress listing, though this seems inaccurate.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> I believe that it was manufactured by Onda, a Chinese company infamous for some frankly bizarre cryptocurrency mining-oriented motherboards. Onda sells normal components for the most part, but the ones that make it to the West are a bit more… unique.</p>

<p>Model information for the motherboard is difficult to find, to say the least. Text silkscreened onto the board reading “AMD_BL2 V2.3” is below a QR code that returns the text “PG-00-11.A77.EAMDBL20V23010100/20GB2122/0803/0060.” The AliExpress listing names Biostar as the manufacturer, but this is probably incorrect.</p>

<p>The QR code mentions the embedded A77E chipset, suggesting that this motherboard may have been designed as an embedded product first. However, the A77E die on this particular motherboard was produced in the 46th week of 2015, and my gut feeling is that it’s more likely that these chips are sourced from recyclers than from AMD’s mothballed warehouses. Seeing an NVMe-capable M.2 slot on an embedded motherboard from this period would also be unusual.</p>

<p>My motherboard is not the first version. According to silkscreening on it, it is version 2.3. Version 2.0 is shown below.</p>

<p>There are tons of common design elements, from choice of passive components to layout and I/O variety. The expansion slots are different, though. Rather than one PCIe x1 slot and an M-keyed M.2 slot, this motherboard has two PCIe x1 slots, an mSATA slot, and a half-length Mini PCIe slot. Sadly, thermal paste on the APU obscures any markings. An additional VRM phase is present, but I don’t know for which bit of the APU.</p>

<p>If there exists a version 2.0 and a version 2.3, then it stands to reason that there are also versions 2.1 and 2.2, but I have not found any.</p>

<p>The third motherboard using this APU is found in a desktop PC released by Chinese OEM Chuwi. This PC, the AeroBox, uses a different motherboard.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> There is enough in common with mine and some other Onda motherboards that it’s highly likely to be another Onda design, perhaps a verion 3.0 of the two boards discussed already. It’s the same brown, and a lot of the layout and passives are similar, but it’s the least similar of the three.</p>

<p>Like the others, there are two DIMM slots on each side of the APU and a Socket H mounting pattern for a cooler. The CMOS battery and buzzer are in the same locations, but the buzzer is actually populated on this motherboard. Only two SATA ports are present rather than four. An M-keyed M.2 slot is present, but rather than a PCIe x1 slot there is a short M.2 slot that appears to be E-keyed. This key is commonly used in wireless adapters like the present WiFi modem. Power delivery is somewhat different. An 8-pin EPS12V socket is present rather than a 4-pin ATX12V socket, and, like the earlier version of my motherboard, there are seven VRM phases. I honestly don’t know why since the APU can’t be overclocked.</p>

<p>The use of a BGA package soldered to the motherboard actually introduces a small problem for use in a PC. Standard Intel Socket H mounting holes (i.e., LGA-115X and its 75 mm square pattern) are used, but Cato’s package is much shorter than Intel’s sockets. I tried to use a Corsair H55, but I could not get the waterblock tightened onto the die properly. The included cooler is a solid block of aluminium, but it’s chunky enough to handle Cato, albeit loudly.</p>

<h2 id="the-cpu">The CPU</h2>

<p>The APU is codenamed Cato and the integrated GPU specifically appears to be codenamed Kryptos. There are several PCI IDs shared by components codenamed Cato, Kryptos, Anubis, Garfield, Garfield+, Arlene, and Pooky. I suspect that the other names, of which several are characters in the comic strip about the orange cat, are related to an implementation in the Xbox One and Xbox One S, but I cannot confirm this. Notably, there are no references to Durango, which is generally held to be the name of the Xbox One’s APU.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Cato has, or perhaps this motherboard lets it use, two different names. The AliExpress listing marketed it …</p></span></p></div></article></div>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pixel_badge_back.png" alt="Full colour art on the Pixel Badge"></p>

<p>Beautiful PCB design has thrived in the past few years. With personal projects and event badges alike, hackers have been pushing the limits of the artistic beauty they can put in their circuit boards.</p>

<p>The community of PCB enthusiasts has experimented with combining colours of silkscreen, copper or ENIG, and solder mask to <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/03/22/making-more-of-me-money/" target="_blank">make sweet graphics</a>. They’ve convinced PCB houses to <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/18508-mr-robot-badge/log/64526-how-i-created-the-mr-robot-badge" target="_blank">use multiple layers of silkscreen</a>, have <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/05/30/hackaday-superconference-pushing-the-boundaries-of-pcb-artwork-with-brian-benchoff/" target="_blank">stamped colours of their own</a>, and have even <a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/01/13/the-way-of-the-pcb-artist-how-to-make-truly-beautiful-circuit-boards/" target="_blank">gone multidimensional</a>.</p>

<p>I got hooked on event badges after falling in love with <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/08/14/hands-on-with-the-shacamp-2017-badge/" target="_blank">SHA2017</a>, and have been involved in making badges for a bunch of events ever since. For every new badge we make, we have some innate drive to push the boundary a bit further to what was already done before, both in hardware and what experience it gives its users, and in the aesthetics of the badge.</p>

<p>So naturally, when people asked for the re-production of the ESP32 WiFi LED panel badge a bunch of us had made for CampZone 2019 <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/07/25/campzone-2019-badge-is-begging-to-become-a-huge-billboard/" target="_blank">that had inkjet printed dithered single-colour graphics</a>, I started thinking about what’s next. Stumbling upon a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20464215" target="_blank">hacker news post</a> that showed full-colour UV inkjet printed PCBs by an Australian company called <a href="https://www.littlebird.com.au/" target="_blank">Little Bird</a>, I was amazed. Even though the limitations of PCB design had previously resulted in super creative art, having full-colour graphics in your toolbox could open up so many more possibilities.</p>

<p>The comments section of the hacker news article showed that apparently UV printing had already been done on PCBs over a decade ago, but I hadn’t seen anyone in the badge scene use it before. So I got cracking with our (amazing!) production partner Norbert of <a href="https://shop.allnetchina.cn/" target="_blank">ALLNET China</a>, and together we started experimenting with printing on our PCBs. Boy, were we in for a ride! In the remainder of this post, I’ll try to summarise all of the things we learned along the way.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="first-attempts">First attempts</h2>
<p>We first started thinking about getting to full colour prints by using the same dithering technique we had used for CampZone 2019, but now with many colours, because I had no idea how normal UV printing worked. Luckily, my friend Hans (aka “the maker maker”, whom I got to know via Ian of <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/" target="_blank">Dangerous Prototypes</a>) mentioned that industrial UV printers can print on many materials out of the box, including PCBs.</p>

<p>Indeed, after getting some weird looks from a company that normally makes physical store signs with their UV printers, they were happy to put some of our old unpopulated CampZone 2019 PCBs in their printer and turn them into retrowave heaven:</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/1st_try.jpeg" alt="Full colour art printed over scrap CZ19 badges"></p>

<p>This initial print used standard CMYK UV ink, plus a separate white UV ink for the whites.</p>

<p>The result looked great, but we hit the same problem others before us had hit: putting printed PCBs in a reflow oven messes with the colours a lot. You might remark that it makes more sense to print on the PCBs after they have been pick&amp;placed and soldered. However, the print accuracy of inkjet printers is a function of the distance between the print jet and the object. Our printer could only move 3mm above the PCB (which was not enough for our components), and even if it could move higher the print quality would be quite bad. So instead we worked on getting the UV ink handle reflowing better.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-1-making-white-stay-white">Lesson 1: making white stay white</h2>

<p>After reflowing, the boards looked like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/1st_try_baked.png" alt="UV printed boards with white ink after reflowing"></p>

<p>You’ll notice that all colours become a bit more dim. Red seems to lose more of its edge than green and blue. Most importantly though, the white ink is turned into a nasty aged yellow. Most of the colour changes we could live with, so we didn’t correct for them in our designs (you’ll see later that our final art worked nicely with the reflow process). In general one can try to correct for the changes in their source design, of course.</p>

<p>The whites were totally unacceptable though. It made the badge look old and yucky. We considered diving into the world of different UV inks, and finding a white ink that was more heat tolerant. Then we had a simple realisation: the perfect heat resistant white ink we all know already was simply white soldermask or silkscreen. Because we want to keep the front of the badge black to keep nice contrast, we opted for keeping the mask black and experimented with white silkscreen on the back.</p>

<p>So we modified our art such that the white parts were cut out of the design, which meant no ink would be placed there, and made PCBs that were completely covered with white silk outside of the component pads. The result was awesome, even after reflowing:</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/2nd_try_white.jpg" alt="UV ink on white silkscreen after reflowing"></p>

<h2 id="lesson-2-getting-decent-alignment">Lesson 2: getting decent alignment</h2>

<p>At this point we had PCBs that looked nice, but were in no way usable to solder on: many pads were partially printed over.</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/alignment_pads.jpg" alt="Pads were being partially printed over"></p>

<p>We were printing entire panels at a time, and observed that even when we got perfect alignment on one panel, the next would be wildly out of spec again.</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/alignment_panel.jpg" alt="Printing whole panels at a time"></p>

<p>It turned out that even though the <em>contents</em> of a panel are extremely dimensionally accurate, the <em>edge rails</em> width was not. PCB houses use alignment holes and markers on the edge rails to align their processes, and don’t need to care if there was ~0.2mm extra width on the rails after such a mark or not.</p>

<p><img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pcbart/alignment_rails.jpg" alt="PCB edge rails are not necessarily uniformly cut"></p>

<p>Aside from this, it is in general hard to get sub-mm accuracy on big industrial UV inkjet printers. For future projects, we will at least try to get better repeatability between panels by making a (very thin) jig that is a bit wider and taller than a panel, that has pins on which we slide the alignment holes of the panel. This allows you to fasten the jig to the printbed, and assure that <em>once you have tediously aligned the jig</em> the future panels will print reasonably well.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-3-more-pin-margin--more-better">Lesson 3: more pin margin == more better</h2>

<p>The alignment issue of the previous section was enlarged because we were stubborn. We felt that having close to no whitespace around pads (0.1mm) would look so much better, so literally any misalignment would immediately cause pads to be partially overprinted. It does look incredible in our opinion, but was the cause for a lot of blood, sweat, and tears. We struggled to get our failure rates below 50% (which is ridiculously high; normally we would want &lt;1%).</p>

<p>This makes the <a href="https://pixel.curious.supplies/" target="_blank">Founder’s Edition</a> extra special, as it is highly likely our last project that will have this insanely tight printing margin!
<img src="https://pixel.curious.supplies/images/pixel_badge_back.png" alt="Full colour art on the Pixel Badge"></p>

<p>For future projects, we will probably use a ~1mm margin around pins to make our life easier. For making this margin less apparent, we’ll likely incorporate the underlying mask or silk colour in the design. That way you’re not looking at chunks of white across the board :)</p>

<h2 id="so-what-now">So what now?</h2>

<p>By sharing what we did, we hope to make you all excited about getting full-colour art on your designs. We’d be super psyched especially to see the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=badgelife" target="_blank">#badgelife</a> community pick up this neat trick for other event badges.</p>

<p>This year, American Bank Systems (ABS) was hit with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://securityreport.com/american-bank-systems-hit-by-ransomware-attack-full-53-gb-data-dump-leaked/" target="_blank">ransomware attack </a>as reported by <em>Security Report, </em>which the company failed to disclose to its customers in time.</p>



<p>As a part of this data breach, a full <strong>53 GB dump</strong> of the data pertaining to ABS and its clients —which include multiple banking names and mortgage companies, such as&nbsp;<em>First Federal Community Bank</em>,<em>&nbsp;Rio Bank</em>,&nbsp;<em>Citizens Bank of Swainsboro,</em>&nbsp;<em>First Bank &amp; Trust</em>, and so on, <strong>was leaked by the threat actors </strong>after several attempts to extort a ransom payment.</p>



<p>This data included the banking customers’ personally identifiable information (PII) such as loan records, SSNs, documents, emails, contracts, network shares, and passwords to sensitive drives.</p>



<p>A <em>Law360</em> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.law360.com/fintech/articles/1338684/american-bank-systems-sued-over-ransomware-data-breach-" target="_blank">news report</a> published yesterday states ABS has now been slapped with a class-action lawsuit due to its failure to protect their customers’ information, and for keeping them in the dark for weeks after the initial ransomware attack.</p>



<p>“As a result of ABS’s failure to implement and follow basic security procedures, plaintiff’s and class members’ PII is now in the hands of criminals,” read the complaint, filed Wednesday in a <strong>Pennsylvania federal court.</strong></p>



<p>“Plaintiff and class members face a substantial increased risk of identity theft, both currently and for the indefinite future. Consequently, plaintiff and class members have had to spend, and will continue to spend, significant time and money in the future to protect themselves due to ABS’s failures.”</p>



<p>As far as the timeline is concerned, <em>Security Report </em>analyzed the timestamps on the leaked files and deduced the cyber attack had struck American Bank Systems sometime <strong>in or before early October</strong>.</p>



<p>It wasn’t until November 18th, however, nearly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://securityreport.com/american-bank-systems-hit-by-ransomware-attack-full-53-gb-data-dump-leaked/" target="_blank">4 days after our report</a>, that the company began disclosing to its customers the details of the data breach. ABS had also not responded to our request for comment.</p>



<p>“According to NexTier Bank, it was not notified by ABS of the data breach until November 18, 2020, which was at least several weeks after the incident began, and more than two weeks after the data breach was first publicly reported,” the complaint further reads.</p>



<p>The class-action lawsuit is brought forward by plaintiff Mitchell Lautman, a citizen and resident of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and a customer of NexTier whose PII was exposed as a result of this data breach.</p>



<p>By not sufficiently protecting sensitive data the lawsuit alleges ABS was in breach of Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rules and put customers at the risk of identity theft for years to come.</p>



<p>“ABS, a company that promotes its trustworthiness, has a responsibility to securely maintain the customer PII that it receives and keep it safe from harm. ABS was on notice that PII, specifically when it includes financial information, is a prime target for data breaches,” states the 26-page court filing.</p>



<p>While more details pertaining to this case are yet to come, this is a reminder to companies and financial institutions to prioritize data security, and to not delay in disclosing crucial matters to their customers, such as a data breach.</p>



<p>A copy of the complaint is provided below for reference:</p>

<p><em>Warning: memes ahead</em></p>



<p>So on Monday Google services went down, and <s>the world burned</s> much productivity was disrupted.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As well as YouTube, Google search, Ads, Stadia, and Docs, GMail (the world’s <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-6-popular-free-email-providers-online-gmail-yahoo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">most popular</a> email host) went down too. Unlike the other services, however, Gmail remained disrupted days later, with millions of sent messages having been permanently lost. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25435916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hacker News</a> took note.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Email is resilient by design, with baked-in capabilities for handling networks and mailservers which are overloaded or unavailable. As the world’s largest peer-to-peer network, mail servers have to be fault-tolerant, and Gmail’s problems would normally have resulted in temporary delays to mail delivery, lasting only until Gmail came back online.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Instead however Gmail has gone haywire, sending out false signals, instead of sending nothing at all.</p>



<p>If you messaged your own Gmail account every five minutes from a non-Gmail address like Protonmail, you would have seen confusing results. Google has been alternating between successful deliveries, then permanently refusing mail sent to Gmail with hard bounce messages like: </p>



<p><code>550-5.1.1 The email account that you tried to reach does not exist</code></p>



<p>These hard bounce messages tell other mailservers that messages sent to this address can never arrive, and therefore the message should be dropped as all future delivery attempts will be futile. These bounces tell bulk mailing systems like app registration notifications and newsletter mailing systems that the recipient address is invalid and should be permanently removed from mailing lists.</p>



<p>The effect is chaotic and long lasting: </p>



<ul><li>All mail sent to affected Gmail accounts has been unnecessarily lost, and Gmail has generated millions of false and unnecessary bounce messages</li><li>All automatically blocked email addresses on mail automation platforms like SendGrid and <a href="https://www.phplist.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">phpList</a> will, by default, never receive messages from those senders again</li></ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>The curious thing about this major but no doubt unintentional SNAFU on Google’s part is that it stands out in the context of a decade of deliberately false messages of a very similar type. </p>



<p><a href="https://federicoleva.eu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Federico Leva</a> was the first of several Lightmeter users who messaged us on Monday and Tuesday to report that Google were up to their old tricks on a grand scale. <strong>The difference this week was that the behaviour was unintentional</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;v=issue&amp;sid=1&amp;iid=a8b67908fadee664c68c240ff9f529ab"><img loading="lazy" width="845" height="372" src="https://lightmeter.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-20201217214828-845x372-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://lightmeter.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-20201217214828-845x372-1.png 845w, https://lightmeter.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-20201217214828-845x372-1-300x132.png 300w, https://lightmeter.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot-20201217214828-845x372-1-768x338.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px"></a><figcaption>Google later acknowledged the issue and reported it had been resolved</figcaption></figure>



<p>Gmail is known to habitually misuse technical messages between mail servers, inaccurately reporting the fate of messages which Gmail receives. </p>



<p>SMTPs most famous status response code “250 OK” is designed to communicate successful delivery; no worries, message received successfully. Not with Google. Gmail can report success but actually delete it before it reaches the user, or hide it from view in Junk. This status is sometimes called “dead air”.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">emails are back! amazing though, in the last twenty minutes I cleaned my room, finished a book, filed two pieces, learnt to play guitar, mastered spanish, humbly accepted an honorary doctorate and gave birth to beautiful twins</p>— Imogen West-Knights (@ImogenWK) <a href="https://twitter.com/ImogenWK/status/1338462872888897539?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Other times Gmail honestly reports that a message delivery attempt failed, but confuse other mailservers with inaccurate explanations of that outcome. Much like in the case of this week’s erroneous <code>550-5.1.1</code> errors, Gmail intentionally responds with error codes claiming temporary technical faults, instead of reality: the message has been permanently rejected. </p>



<p>Such behaviour is presumed to be part of a strategy to waste the resources of third party mailservers from whom Google does not wish to receive mail. <strong>The effect is to decrease the reliability and efficiency of email</strong> as a whole, and to prioritise email from Gmail users above the millions of independent mail operators which constitute the <a href="https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Email-Statistics-Report-2017-2021-Executive-Summary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">world’s largest</a> communication network. Worse, other large operators could follow Google’s example, and indeed some like Microsoft already have. This trend risks a breakdown of said distributed network as as a whole, as it gets harder and harder for independent mail networks to interact with dominant ones who are exploiting their power. </p>



<p><strong>Lightmeter’s mission is to strengthen the foundations of digital society</strong> by making mailtech easy and convenient, and keep communications free. That’s why we have built <a href="https://gitlab.com/lightmeter/controlcenter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lightmeter Control Center</a> to detect problems like Gmail’s errors this week, and are <a href="https://lightmeter.io/roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working towards</a> automating solutions for such problems, thereby lowering barriers for indie networks, and growing the diversity and robustness of email overall. </p>

<p>With the problem resolved, Gmail users will be back in the Inboxes, happy that the disruption is over. But the mailops administrators who deal with deliberately false Gmail message reporting are back where they were before the events and the memes of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/googledown?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">#GoogleDown</a>: struggling to interoperate with the largest host in the network, who’s committed to using their power to break the network’s rules.</p>

iOS UI Automation, Robotium and Selendroid.</p></div></div><article><div target="_blank"><p>Before talking seriously about tools for mobile app testing, we’d like to ask you a simple question. How many apps do you have on your smartphone? We’d bet the number exceeds 20. Among them, there are applications for business purposes only, there are those we use for entertainment, and then others that help us communicate…with others, or order different products and services. Of course, many of us also have apps that are our favourites, and others that we only use in the event of an urgent need. It’s likely that our favorites are the ones that have been tested and debugged to perfection – resulting in a now perfect and precise working application. </p><p>Mobile applications are actually not as simple to create, as they seem. All the average user normally notices is only the beautifully designed intuitive UI, but we know that there is so much <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/convirt_tr.pdf" target="_blank">hard work</a> behind it. Well-developed mobile applications should be fast, safe, and clear with very limited hardware possibilities. What is more, they ought to look equally as great on different devices and endure an extreme level of competition. There is only one thing that can help developers here – the frequent checking of an app’s usability, functionality, and consistency.</p><figure id="w-node-62ef5ce16f31-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d43e7cdb2da3557e0cc0d18_catching-bugs.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Mobile app quality assurance can be a challenging process, as it involves numerous possible pitfalls. For that reason, we require really useful mobile app performance testing tools. They help run the most time-consuming processes, such as cataloging, searching, and combining necessary data. This is how developers will be able to find and correct problems in their products. It’s actually crucial that special tools for mobile application testing do not perform the job alone. It is a skilled hand that can improve the technology, but all such hands, however skillful, need help from machines. In this article, we will provide you with an insight into all the major mobile app testing tools, as well as strategies and necessary procedures involved.</p><h2>Importance of mobile application testing</h2><p>One shouldn’t underestimate the importance of the mobile application testing process, because it may save developers many hours of bug fixing later on. Any app ought to do what it’s meant to under any circumstances, and only numerous tests can prepare it for ideal performance.</p><figure id="w-node-7ad8de380525-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d43e7da0a9ce33ba2df4452_mobile-app-testing.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>One should understand that the average user will use the app like any of us would. We run our favorite apps on different networks and devices, start them offline or suddenly close them during use. Without being tested in each of these scenarios, your app may crash or slow down entirely. Thorough examining will help developers understand whether their program is fast and intuitive enough, has clear and pleasant navigation, looks good on any gadget and makes its customers happy.</p><h2>Types of mobile app testing procedures</h2><p>There are a great number of ways to have your app tested. Some of them help you understand if it is easy to use by looking at interface, usability, and performance. Others, like compatibility check, show the capacity to work on various devices. Finally, you shouldn’t forget about operational and security testing, which will mark an app’s capability to perform recoveries and protect its data in case of sudden shutdowns. It is said that, in future, all of these processes will become even more complex and challenging! Here, we will tell you more about the major types of mobile app examining procedures, which are necessary for strong performance of your app.</p><figure id="w-node-9e27bb952763-7a0a8b78"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5d43e7e9bf5dbb0895dc468f_app-testing-procedures.png" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Installation testing</h3><p>This type of evaluation is important for understanding whether the app can be installed and uninstalled seamlessly. If an installation fails, it may leave a user’s system damaged, which is definitely not the kind of first impression you’d like to produce. To avoid this, you need to test the installer thoroughly with both manual and automated procedures, on different devices with distinct configurations.</p><p>Our life hack here is to make images of the base configuration (let’s say, of each new OS) when you test it, which will save you time and effort. Moreover, you can use flow diagrams to run installation check with different test cases added. You may also try breaking the installation or uninstallation process deliberately during each step. Finally, we advise you to test the reboot option after a manual uninstall.</p><h3>Usability testing</h3><p>This is actually a rather complex procedure, which includes a check of design, ease of use, and overall level of user satisfaction. Usability level measurement should reveal whether an app is really what the user wants it to be (it’s similar to reading minds, we would say). This test shows if an app’s UI is simple to navigate and meets the needs of users. Usual methods to perform this process include:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Internal exploration.</strong> Here, one should create an app and perform random tests on it through their internal team.</li><li><strong>Real-time users.</strong> In this case, developers hire a team of unbiased users who test the app and report their problems and concerns. With them, you can also predict how certain elements will influence the behavior of different user groups.</li><li><strong>Automated tools.</strong> A development team creates special tools that provide statistics based on the overall performance of the app and user satisfaction. There are many helpful tools to perform this task. For instance, one may employ special facilitators to interact with people using the app or instruments providing you with the data based on eye and mouse movements, tracking, and heatmap methods. One can also use different types of surveys and polls.</li></ul><p>After collecting the necessary data through any of these means, the development team can explore ways to improve the app’s usability and responsiveness.</p><h3>Performance testing</h3><p>This type of testing is necessary, in order to check the performance capabilities of the app while in use. It’s highly probable that your application will have to pass through different device challenges, which may include low battery power, changing Internet connection types (2G, 3G, or WiFi), transferring massive files, shortage of memory, etc. In the focus of performance examination there are usually application’s speed, scalability, and stability.</p><p>The most common types of it are:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Capacity testing</strong> – a process, which is used to determine how many users and actions the program will support without any breaks in its work. During evaluation, such resources as processor capacity, network bandwidth, memory usage, and disk capacity are checked and corrected to meet the needs of the audience.</li><li><strong>Stress testing</strong> – a process that involves checking the app’s work under extreme conditions to see how it manages heavy traffic and data processing.</li><li><strong>Scalability testing</strong> – a procedure which helps developers estimate the software’s effectiveness and develop its capacity in such dimensions as fast location based searches and minimization of the network usage.</li></ul><p>Without conducting performance check, your app may suffer from such problems as running slow while several users use it simultaneously, or various discrepancies while using it on different OS.</p><h3>Compatibility testing</h3><p>This type of mobile app testing is inevitable these days, as people tend to run the same programs on many devices. It helps you estimate your app’s capacities on different browsers, screen sizes, and OS versions.</p><p>With the help of compatibility tests, you will see (and solve) all the possible problems that may occur when the same app is run on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. These may even come up on iPhone and iPad versions of the same program! To avoid this, one should perform compatibility check on all possible devices and OS, or on the appropriate emulators.</p><h3>Security testing</h3><p>Nowadays, even the simplest applications on your smartphone require a great deal of data storage, which helps them perform their tasks more quickly; however, most of this includes your personal information, which must be kept secure. To test the capacity of an app’s information system to protect user data, one should perform security check.</p><p>This is a process that shows you if the confidential data will stay secure, and confirms that users are only performing those actions they are authorized to. In order to understand this, a massive examination of all roles and rights ought to be run. According to Statista, security was estimated to be one of the most important areas of testing, as a massive check of all roles and rights ought to be run before launching any app. Usually, several different user accounts with multiple roles and access abilities are created for that purpose. Security check includes tests for password quality, default logins, logout functionality, security questions and answers, encryption of sensitive data, etc.</p><h3>Testing strategies</h3><p>There are a bunch of various strategies developers can use to perform the above-mentioned steps. First of all, you can run them on emulators, although some experts don’t support this kind of app testing. Sometimes, however, this is the only available means, which can save lots of efforts and time for evaluating apps on actual devices, OS, and browsers with different configurations. So, emulators may really help both while developing and assessing the app; however, it is more efficient to involve actual gadgets and perform effective testing strategies on them (for example, A/B check).</p><p>This is a rather cheap and simple strategy, the only drawback being that it may be quite time-consuming, though we know it’s worth it when you see how great your app can look in the play stores, right? Analyze the traffic, feedback, and performance of different versions of your program’s functions and you’ll see that there is always room for improvement!</p><p>In this article, we offer you a list of testing tools for mobile apps, which are the most effective, according to the criteria we have mentioned above. We …</p></div></article></div>

<p>After few month of positive signs, there seems to be a slowdown in November, with many countries re-introducing lockdowns because of COVID.</p>



<p>In November, Lime continued to hold the top spot in App Store user ratings (4.88/5), among all micromobility companies. Bird and Voi hold the second and third spot with 4.84 and 4.83 respectively. Change in overall satisfaction remained stable similar to previous months, with Dott and India based Yulu improving their ratings by 1.6% and 1.3% respectively while Bird and Wind dropped by 0.1% and 0.2%.</p>



<p>Industry average improved by 0.02, from 4.79 to 4.81 out of 5.</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>Micromobility Industry average App Store rating: 4.81/5</strong></p></blockquote>



<p>In the newly opened UK market, Voi and Lime are the top rated (4.9/5) followed by Tier (4.8/5).</p>



<p>The total number of app store reviews were down by 35% compared to September numbers. Beam saw the biggest growth in activity (42%) while SKIP dropped by 82%</p>



<p>Overall five operators, Lime, Bird, Spin, Grin, and Voi, accounted for more than 90% of all international app store reviews last month. Lime had the highest number of ratings (56.8%).</p>



<p>Lime was also the most-reviewed app in several key markets, including the US, Italy and Germany. Voi saw the highest review activity in its home country, Sweden with a massive lead of 55.6% compared to Tier’s 22.2%) and Voi also lead in the UK (72.5%). In France, Dott saw the highest activity (46.2%) followed by Lime (30.8%). </p>

<p>In November, the number of App Store reviews were a bit below January levels for most of the tracked operators due to COVID19 linked lockdowns across the globe. Total number of reviews of Beam and Tier were up 381% and 163%, compared to their January baselines. Lime’s total reviews have been steadily recovering from April bottom, closing November at 24% below its January benchmark. Grin’s app store reviews are still down by 98%, ending last in the list. Grin will continue to stay at these levels until there is significant improvement in the current COVID19 situation in South America. </p>







<p>Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a scoring system for quantifying customer loyalty. Companies generally calculate NPS by asking customers to rate their level of satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a similar manner, App Stores ask their users to rate their level of satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 5.</p>



<p>Typically, on a 0 to 10, those who respond 9 or 10 are considered “promoters,” or enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others; those who respond 7-8 are considered “passives,” customers who are satisfied but not overly enthusiastic; and those who respond 6 or less are considered “detractors,” or unhappy customers who could hurt the brand through negative reviews.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To calculate NPS for the scooter apps, I applied the following method, trying to replicate the classic scoring system.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Promoters (5)</li><li>Passives (4)</li><li>Detractors (1-3)</li></ul>

<p>In November, Lime continued to retain the top spot with a NPS score of 91.69, followed by Bird (89.98) and Voi (88.12).</p>



<p>Although Lime ranked the best globally, in some key European markets, local players scored higher in customer experience. In some of the largest markets in Europe like Germany and France and Italy, Voi had a higher NPS than Lime. On the contrary, in Sweden, both Bird and Lime scored higher than their European rivals. Lime led in the U.S (94), Spain (88), Portugal (90), New Zealand (92), South Korea (87) as well as Australia (93). Both in Australia, South Korea and New Zealand, smaller rival Beam is closing in on Lime with an NPS score of 92, 84 and 91 respectively. In UK, Lime and Voi took the top spot (92), followed by Tier (88).</p>

<p><strong>App Issue – 41%:&nbsp;</strong>Similar to the previous months, issues with the apps were the most reported, but stayed the same in percentage as October. Users reported trouble with signup, payment setup and annoying notifications among other things. Here are some of illustrative or interesting user comments:</p>



<p>Lime recently pushed out an update with a Dark UI and some users are confused! </p>



<pre>This app seems stuck on a dark screen (theme) with button options missing, phone is not on dark mode either, so is not useable at all, this started recently, is it my phone or the app???</pre>



<p>With operators adding an additional layer of Driving License verification, it adds additional points of failure in the onboarding flow. Normally, these verifications are not instant and can take anywhere from few seconds to a few minutes. Here is a comment from a SPIN user:</p>



<pre>Could not confirm my drivers license which is fine and kept having processing icon spinning for long periods of time for multiple verifications screens I had to go and use another inc scooter nearby.</pre>



<p>Voi had the most number of negative comments on Driving License verification:</p>



<pre>Have to have a drivers licence. Do you need a licence to ride a bike or a skateboard on the road? No. So why this. Response to developer reply: no i downloaded the app, added payment details, walked to a scooter, then it told me.</pre>



<pre>the camera function in the app keeps passing on 'unclear' versions of photos of my driver's license through to the voi office for verification... even though they look absolutely crystal clear on my phone (daylight photo with no reflections). such a shame as I really approve of the e-scooter method of public transport in Liverpool. I've used the Lime e-scooters in Frankfurt and had a much better/streamline experience.</pre>



<p>Tier users reported verification issues as well:</p>



<pre>They never verified my driving licence even after 3 weeks</pre>



<p>And… Wind:</p>



<pre>The team of WIND is pathetic.. for them Indian Driving Licence is not valid.. but they have provided the option of India to choose.. how moron they are.. and if they dont get what they want they will ban you and your number.. if I had chance I would have given them minus rating !.. infact the tele. Team also dont respond</pre>



<p>At this rate of move towards having only users with a valid Driving license, very soon, e-scooters won’t be available for many users, especially those who don’t have a Driving License and rely on bikes, public transit and e-scooters.</p>



<p><strong>Scooter Issue – 19%:</strong>&nbsp;The percentage of hardware problems reported by users increased from 16% in October to 19% in November.</p>



<p>Here are some comments from users:</p>



<pre>Total rip-off I went down hill scooter became unresponsive. Did not have time to push up hill to get it to work. They keept charging me would not stop They charged me $40</pre>



<p>A Neuron Mobility user reported inconsistent scooter behaviour in restricted zones:</p>



<pre>Scooter kept going into slow mode when I wasn't in the slow area, but then even in the no riding zone went fast. Then told me to turn around as I was leaving the service area, I turned around but it was still in limp mode and wouldn't go at all. Then when i checked the map.i wasnt even leaving the service area. Absolutely useless around central townsville. Don't know about elsewhere but I'll stick with lime...</pre>



<p>A Dott user reported injury after unexpected acceleration of the scooter:</p>



<pre>Technical issue at the first use : sudden acceleration that threw me into the air, now I have 1 twisted shoulder, and 2 twisted fingers. Plus it is very expensive compared to some other same scooters. Although I was very excited about using this app, I'm never coming back and would advise you to buy your own scooter instead of renting it. All in all it'll cost the same if not cheaper and you will know the machine you're riding, and its possible technical issues.</pre>



<p>A scooter user of  India based Yulu scooters reported error in battery status and stopping in a busy road:</p>



<pre>Pathetic experience. Bikes shows 100% battery but stops in between the rides suddenly saying battery low. I really felt dangerous to use this again as it stops suddenly at middle of the road and you can't even push the bike as the tyre gets locked and won't rotate. This happened not jus once but multiple times. Imagine how I would have felt when It broke down near Silkboard signal, felt very embarrassing dealing with it on busy road.</pre>



<p><strong>Overcharging – 14%:</strong>&nbsp;Overcharging by operators was the second most commonly reported issue in November.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Did Lime solve the day pass issue yet? Though the number of negative comments have come down,  the issues is not fully solved:</p>



<pre>Total ripoff! Paid for the day pass for $15 and rode around DC for about 2 hours. Then it shut down on it's own with 50% battery left. Then like charged my PayPal almost $91 for the trip. I emailed my concern 12 days ago with no response. What a con job!</pre>



<p>Disadvantages of having distance based billing. How do you make sure that the distance measurement is correctly calibrated? Here a Yulu user was charged for 32km when in reality it was only 10km:</p>



<pre>I have worst experience . I have used 10km . But in this app showed 32km run by me. Please solve this issue . I have overcharged . Worst app</pre>



<p>Bird seems to have issues with Promos:</p>



<pre>I got a promo that literally says free rides on the app and it charged me $45 talked to a representative after getting off the phone they had charged me another $21. What is going with this company???</pre>



<p><strong>Customer Support, Cost – 19%:&nbsp;</strong>More people found the service expensive in November compared to previous months. Here are some of the comments:</p>



<pre>So I can get a bike with Lime for 2.5 kroner per minute or I can get a Mercedes with Share Now for 2 kroner per minute. And the luxury car doesn't come with an extortionate 'unlocking' fee. …</pre></div></div>

<p><em>This is a preliminary analysis of the SolarWinds Orion supply-chain nation-state attack. This is an ongoing analysis and more information will be published when available.</em></p>



<p>UPDATE 2020-12-19 23:20 UTC: updated results table</p>



<blockquote><p>This post provides a list of internal names of organizations that <strong>not only </strong>had the SUNBURST backdoor installed, but were also <strong>specifically targeted </strong>by the threat actor for <strong>the second stage of the attack</strong>, where <strong>further internal compromise </strong>likely took place.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>The recent SolarWinds Orion hack is part of a cyberattack that is one of the most severe in history.</p>



<p>A supply-chain attack leveraged SolarWinds Orion updates to deliver a backdoor to potentially 18.000 SolarWinds customers. The attack was highly sophisticated.</p>



<p>The infected systems in the various compromised organizations were configured to probe the threat actor systems to request instructions.</p>



<p>Truesec Threat Intelligence analyzed the malware, as well as historical network data, to determine some of the affected organizations that the threat actor <strong>explicitly selected for further activities</strong>, where it is likely that further internal compromise took place.</p>



<p>While this is likely only a small part of the scope of the attack, it provides indications on the type of organizations that were the real targets of the attack.</p>



<p>Some names stand out, such as ggsg-us.cisco (<strong>Cisco GGSG</strong>), us.deloitte.co (<strong>Deloitte</strong>), nswhealth.net (<strong>NSW Ministry of Health in Australia</strong>), <strong>banccentral.com</strong> (service supplier of IT and security for banks), and many others.</p>



<p>Based on the decoded internal names of the victims, there are also indications that <strong>Mediatek</strong>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest semiconductors provider for mobile phones globally, was explicitly targeted by the threat actor. This is not confirmed at this point, but if confirmed it would have massive consequences globally.</p>



<p>The impact of this attack is likely to be of gigantic proportions. The full extent of this breach will most likely never be communicated to the public, and instead will be restricted to trusted parts of the intelligence community.</p>







<p>A supply-chain attack leveraged SolarWinds to deliver malicious software updates to their customers (approximately 18.000 potentially affected customers according to SolarWinds). The update installed a sophisticated backdoor giving the threat actor the ability to access selected targets and proceed with further activities inside the compromised organizations.</p>



<p>It is believed that the attack was carried out by a nation-state actor, likely APT29 a.k.a. Cozy Bear, i.e. Russian Intelligence.</p>



<p>FireEye and Microsoft initially published reports<a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[1]</a><a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[2]</a> describing some of the inner workings of the backdoor. The backdoor is remarkably sophisticated and is worth a long technical description, while only some of its functionalities and characteristics are described in this article.</p>



<p>Truesec Threat Intelligence analysed the backdoor as well as historical network data to identify patterns revealing possible victims.</p>



<p>Due to the nature of the attack, a large number of organizations around the world have been affected by the backdoor, while likely only a smaller number were specifically selected and targeted by the threat actor to conduct additional internal compromise (phase 2).</p>



<p>This report presents some of the identified targets that were <strong>specifically targeted for phase 2</strong>.<br></p>







<p>The threat actor was able to inject a backdoor in the Solarwinds Orion software by modifying the source code of an existing plugin, which was then signed by Solarwinds and published as part of an update available on the SolarWinds website. SolarWinds published an advisory<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory" target="_blank">[3]</a> specifying the versions affected.</p>



<p>The malicious update has been available for several months and there are indications of breaches as early as March 2020. One of the identified malicious updates was hosted at the following URL:</p>



<pre>hxxps://downloads.solarwinds[.]com/solarwinds/CatalogResources/Core/2019.4/2019.4.5220.20574/SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp</pre>



<p>The update package was properly digitally-signed, as shown below.</p>

<p>The backdoor code was made part of the following digitally-signed Orion component:</p>



<pre>SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll</pre>



<p>This DLL is also signed.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="465" height="660" src="https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-orion-dll-backdoor-sunburst-certificate.png" alt="SUNBURST backdoor Orion DLL signed by Solarwinds" srcset="https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-orion-dll-backdoor-sunburst-certificate.png 465w, https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-orion-dll-backdoor-sunburst-certificate-211x300.png 211w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px"><figcaption>Figure 2 – Malicious Solarwinds Orion DLL containing SUNBURST backdoor</figcaption></figure>



<p>The backdoor implements sophisticated functionality to communicate with the threat actor infrastructure and applies logic to determine what actions should be taken.</p>



<p>As a large number of Orion servers around the world have been infected with the backdoor, the threat actor had to have a way to determine which organization was contacting the attack infrastructure to be able to select the real target of this attack. This logic is explained below.</p>



<p>The hacked servers that received the Solarwinds backdoor periodically probe the threat actor infrastructure with a DNS query like the following:</p>



<pre>&lt;DGA_value&gt;.appsync-api.eu-west-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com</pre>



<p>where &lt;DGA_value&gt; is computed with a DomainName Generation Algorithm and contains an encoded version of the internal Active Directory name of the infected server. The threat actor server decodes the information in the DNS requests and uses the internal domain name of the organization to determine what instructions to send back.</p>



<p>Truesec reversed the backdoor and identified a set of IP address ranges that, when received as part of the DNS response, will determine the actions taken by the backdoor code. Part of this code is illustrated in the figure below.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="769" height="523" src="https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-sunburst-backdoor-reversed-c2-servers.png" alt="Solarwinds sunburst backdoor reversed showing IP ranges used to determine next actions" srcset="https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-sunburst-backdoor-reversed-c2-servers.png 769w, https://blog.truesec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solarwinds-sunburst-backdoor-reversed-c2-servers-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px"><figcaption>Figure 3 – Reversed SUNBURST backdoor showing IP ranges used to determine next actions</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>AddressFamily</strong> field determines the type of operation as described below.</p>



<p><strong>Atm or ImpLink</strong> : enumerates processes and services.</p>



<p><strong>Ipx</strong> : update local “Status” configuration.</p>



<p><strong>NetBios</strong>: initializes an HTTP backdoor channel used to collect additional information and deploy a second stage malware (specified by the threat actor at the time of instructions, and therefore specific to the target).</p>



<p>We can therefore assume that if the initial probe was answered with an address of type <strong>NetBios</strong>, the threat actor explicitly took action to deploy a second stage to the affected organization, and most likely performed additional internal compromise.</p>







<p>The DomainName Generation Algorithm described earlier, used to create a DNS query containing an encoded value of the internal domain name of the compromised organization, can be reversed.</p>



<p>RedDrip Team published a report<a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/v-ekPFtVNZG1W7vWjcuVug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[4]</a> and a script<a href="https://github.com/RedDrip7/SunBurst_DGA_Decode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[5]</a> to decode the DGA part of the DNS requests, therefore allowing to retrieve the cleartext value of the internal domain name of the hacked server that made the request.</p>



<p>For example, if a compromised server makes the following request to the threat actor server:</p>



<pre>ciepcqqog816s6urtt6t0kf60ceo6e20.appsync-api.us-east-2.avsvmcloud[.]com</pre>



<p>This can be decoded to obtain the following internal name of the victim:</p>



<pre>ggsg-us.cisco</pre>



<p>This means that having records of performed DNS requests to avsvmcloud[.]com will reveal the internal names of the compromised organizations.</p>







<p>The next step was to obtain historical records of DNS requests, <strong>including the response</strong>. We obtained some of the available historical data<a href="https://github.com/bambenek/research/tree/main/sunburst" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">[6]</a> (as we find more data we will publish updates).</p>



<p>The sample data contains 1528 DNS requests to avsvmcloud[.]com and their responses.</p>



<p>When filtered for requests matching the DGA algorithm syntax, we have requests with dates ranging from early April to December 2020.</p>



<p>This is an example of such request and response:</p>



<pre>date : 2020-04-19 08:24:26
last_seen : 2020-04-19 08:24:27
qtype : 1
domain : avsvmcloud.com
qname : q8bps26mocuq6re4dutru70ct2w.appsync-api.us-east-1.avsvmcloud.com
value_ip : 8.18.144.138
type : ip
_key : 0e8ab64d5f5aff04fea862f4f72fcf1d04c3d377
value : 8.18.144.138</pre>



<p>From this data we can determine that on April 19<sup>th</sup>, a request was made that decodes to the internal name <strong>pageaz.gov</strong>, and received as response 8.18.144.138, which according to the backdoor logic explained earlier maps to address type <strong>NetBios</strong>, meaning that the threat actor attempted to deploy an HTTP backdoor in this environment.</p>







<p>By analysing the IP addresses returned when instructing infected servers to establish an HTTP backdoor, we can identify where the threat actor directed their victims.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>IP block</strong></td><td><strong>Registered Organization (WHOIS information)</strong><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td>184.72.0.0 / 255.254.0.0</td><td>Amazon.com, Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>71.152.53.0 / 255.255.255.0</td><td>Amazon.com, Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>8.18.144.0 / 255.255.254.0</td><td>Amazon Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>87.238.80.0 / 255.255.248.0</td><td>Amazon Data Services Ireland DUB3 Datacentre</td></tr><tr><td>18.130.0.0 / 255.255.0.0</td><td>Amazon Technologies Inc.</td></tr><tr><td>99.79.0.0 / 255.255.0.0</td><td>Amazon Data Services Canada</td></tr><tr><td>199.201.117.0 / 255.255.255.0</td><td>Traiana, Inc</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>Table 1 – List of IP blocks used when instructing systems to establish an HTTP backdoor, mapped to WHOIS information</figcaption></figure>



<p>Almost all IP blocks are part of Amazon infrastructure. This makes sense as threat actors often use cloud providers to host their attack infrastructure.</p>



<p>However there is one block that sticks out, as it is registered to <strong>Traiana, Inc</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Founded in 2000, Traiana operates the industry-standard platform for electronically processing over-the-counter foreign exchange, equities, equity derivative, and futures trades.

<p>Truesec Threat Intelligence observed a large number of DNS responses from the threat actor server providing different IP addresses in the range 199.201.117.0/24 for the next stage.</p>



<p>At this point in time, it is unclear whether Traiana was compromised and used as part of the attack infrastructure, or whether they provide hosting …</p></div></div></div>

<p><em>This is a preliminary analysis of the SolarWinds Orion supply-chain nation-state attack. This is an ongoing analysis and more information will be published when available.</em></p>



<p>UPDATE 2020-12-19 23:20 UTC: updated results table</p>



<blockquote><p>This post provides a list of internal names of organizations that <strong>not only </strong>had the SUNBURST backdoor installed, but were also <strong>specifically targeted </strong>by the threat actor for <strong>the second stage of the attack</strong>, where <strong>further internal compromise </strong>likely took place.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>The recent SolarWinds Orion hack is part of a cyberattack that is one of the most severe in history.</p>



<p>A supply-chain attack leveraged SolarWinds Orion updates to deliver a backdoor to potentially 18.000 SolarWinds customers. The attack was highly sophisticated.</p>



<p>The infected systems in the various compromised organizations were configured to probe the threat actor systems to request instructions.</p>



<p>Truesec Threat Intelligence analyzed the malware, as well as historical network data, to determine some of the affected organizations that the threat actor <strong>explicitly selected for further activities</strong>, where it is likely that further internal compromise took place.</p>



<p>While this is likely only a small part of the scope of the attack, it provides indications on the type of organizations that were the real targets of the attack.</p>



<p>Some names stand out, such as ggsg-us.cisco (<strong>Cisco GGSG</strong>), us.deloitte.co (<strong>Deloitte</strong>), nswhealth.net (<strong>NSW Ministry of Health in Australia</strong>), <strong>banccentral.com</strong> (service supplier of IT and security for banks), and many others.</p>



<p>Based on the decoded internal names of the victims, there are also indications that <strong>Mediatek</strong>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> largest semiconductors provider for mobile phones globally, was explicitly targeted by the threat actor. This is not confirmed at this point, but if confirmed it would have massive consequences globally.</p>



<p>The impact of this attack is likely to be of gigantic proportions. The full extent of this breach will most likely never be communicated to the public, and instead will be restricted to trusted parts of the intelligence community.</p>

They are experiments. They do work, and are being used in practice in the organizations that originated the forks. But they are not architecturally suitable for a large-scale mutual coordination economy. Architecturally, they are platforms: that is, all of the participants use the same code, the same server, and the same database.</span></p><h3 id="h.eap2q8rloned"><span>Next stage</span></h3><p><span>The next stage of experiments from the same people who have been developing the proofs of concept involves refactoring those systems into smaller components which can be deployed on decentralized infrastructures. While the components could be used on blockchains, we do not consider those to be either decentralized or flexible enough for the coming requirements, which we think will involve many agents of many kinds, both individuals and organizations, all over the world, in many domains, and need creative contributions from many people who need to be able to act independently and still be able to interoperate. </span><span>Blockchains are like platforms to the extent that </span><span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/357/does-every-node-execute-the-contract-code-for-each-transaction&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1566247136826000">all of the participants use the same code and the same logical blockchain</a></span><span>, although the chain may have many replicants.</span></p><p><span>So we think that future needs to be built on vocabularies and protocols instead of platforms, even cooperative platforms.

December 18, 2020 | https://security.christmas/2020/18 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://security.christmas/2020/18">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><section><h2>How it all began</h2>
<p>I'm a huge proponent of Capture The Flag competitions, and I've been involved in the CTF scene since my university days. Lucky for me, there was a CTF club at the University of Oslo. I've always been curious about hacking and the club quickly caught my attention. The club formerly known as UiO CTF (now Oslo CTF) organized workshops and competitions. Soon enough I was a dedicated member of the group and was heavily involved in organizing both competitions and workshops. One of my fondest memories is when we hosted an on-campus CTF with over 80 attendees, and we called a large Norwegian pizza restaurant chain requesting pizza for 80 people. The pizza place wasn't too happy, but they delivered while the head of the security department's jaw dropped when figured out that the department had to pay for 80 peoples worth of pizza. We had an absolute blast.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p> of the CTF Club
Hosting a CTF is a challenge in itself, infrastructure is hard. Especially while being an inexperienced student. The hosting infrastructure has gone through a few revisions during my time with the club. It started out very manual. Spinning up a virtual machine and deploying every task individually, configuring certificates manually with nginx. Everything hosted using the free credits you get, when signing up for a Google Cloud Platform account. It worked, but it was a pain. The next evolution of the platform was the use of containers. Every task had its own container, and it made starting the challenges easier. My friend ended up writing a bash script for starting everything. We finally had some degree of automation, and we kept working on the platform. More and more scripts were written. We had a script for pulling the challenges from GitHub, one for starting everything, and another for modifying nginx configurations files to set up TLS certificates and subdomains, and another for setting up <a href="https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd">CTFd</a>. In the end, we ended up with a hack job of epic proportions which consisted of several python and bash scripts. It was getting out of hand, and it became excruciatingly unmaintainable, but it did the job.</p>
<h2>Still in the game</h2>
<p>I graduated with a master’s degree in Computer Science with a heavy focus on Information Security and remained involved with the CTF club post-graduation. Real life awaited me and joined Bekk as a consultant in 2019. Soon enough I became involved with the security group at Bekk. The new direction of the security group was to improve security skills and knowledge through the use of CTF-challenges and wargames. The timing could not have been better, and I felt that I could bring something valuable to the group as a whole given my CTF experience. The security group also provides internal and external services. Security consulting, workshops, and so on.</p>
<h2>The Pandemic</h2>
<p>Covid19 hit like a brick, chaos emerged, the S&amp;P 500 tanked, and the Bekk recruitment apparatus had to pivot quickly in order. Company presentations at universities and colleges were no longer possible, thus emerged project Pangea. The goal was an online platform consisting of multiple presentations, articles, activities, and competitions. Every part of Bekk was encouraged to contribute, and I got a request for organizing a CTF. I was excited, and I grossly underestimated the time and effort needed to pull it all together. I could have just reused the stuff we had made during the time at Oslo-CTF, but it didn't feel right, since I didn't technically own it, so I started working on my own infrastructure. Oh boy, how I grossly underestimated the time and effort needed to pull this thing off.</p>
<h2>Chasing clouds</h2>
<p>I dug out a few tasks I had made in the past and started working on quite a few new ones. This was the "easy" part, the challenge was the infrastructure. As I was comfortable with Google Cloud Platform, I picked GCP as my cloud provider. The first thing I looked at was Google Cloud Run, a really neat serverless service. Dockerize the challenge, deploy, and only pay when the container is processing incoming and outgoing traffic. It seemed too good to be true, and unfortunately, it was. I had this odd edge case, where quite a few challenges required interaction over raw TCP. The problem was that Cloud Run requires apps that communicate over HTTP, so back to the drawing board I went. The next obvious choice was Google Compute Engine, a virtual machine.</p>
<h2>Automation Nation</h2>
<p>Since every challenge was a docker container, in addition to there being a docker image for CTFd I ended up putting it all into a docker-compose file. Now I could easily start every challenge rapidly, but I still had the issue of setting up subdomains and TLS certificates. I had used nginx in the past, but as I started configuring, I soon realized that it would be far too tedious to do manually. There had to be a better way, and there was.
After some intense research, I discovered Traefik. Traefik was a total game-changer, if only we had known about this back in my university days. It could do subdomains, service discovery, certificates, and routing. Again, it seemed almost too good to be true, but luckily for me, this time it turned out to be to be the missing piece to the puzzle.</p>
<h2>The Missing Piece</h2>
<p>Traefik was a little finicky to begin with, with their documentation was somewhat lacking in examples. Especially when it came to the business of issuing certificates. I wanted to issue a wild card certificate, but there weren't good any examples in the documentation on how to do this. Secondly, my domain provider didn't even support wild card certs in with their DNS service. Cloudflare came to the rescue. It was free, and very straight forward to set up. Quite a few StackOverflow threads later, I finally figured out how to accomplish what I wanted to achieve. This was the final piece of my infrastructure puzzle. Traefik, CTFd, and the challenges all bundled together in a docker-compose file. One <code>docker-compose up -d</code> later, and I was good to go. All though I did mess things up by repeatedly deleting a folder containing certificates causing my infrastructure to request way too many certs from Let's Encrypt and having to change the subdomains of multiple challenges, it was overall a great success. I managed to pull it all together before the deadline. Hours of hard work and research finally paid off. The CTF was a success and ran without any major hiccups.</p>
<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<p>My new platform is by no means perfect, and there are some things I wish were different. Like having a proper CI/CD pipeline for deploying the challenges. I don't think my setup will scale very well, and I wish to introduce proper container orchestration with Kubernetes in the future. At least it fits my current needs and is way more modular and reusable than it has ever been. I've put down hours and hours of work, and I have learned so much about so many new things throughout the whole process. It has ultimately been a rewarding experience. This may not be the best way to host a CTF. I don't even know if it a good way to host CTF, but this has been how I host a CTF.</p>
<h2>Onwards and upwards!</h2>
<p>I started out with a total mess and ended up with something I can live with, and it suits my current needs. It's easy to set up, and it does the job. Hopefully, this may be of some use if you ever plan on host a CTF for your friends, colleagues, or CTF club. There are several improvements to be made, and I'll keep hacking at it when I find the time. The dream is to build a platform that can be set up with a click in a matter of seconds at the click of a button, but there's a long way to go, and a bumpy road ahead. The current rig probably won't survive over 9000 hackers, but it has survived 30 hackers with great ease. </p></section></article></div>]]>

<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3746231">Pancs (2020)</a> proposes an auction for vaccines in which people can bid on others’ behalf.
This format allows people to internalize the externalities they enjoy from their peers being vaccinated.</p>
<p>For example, suppose there are two vaccines to be allocated among agents A–H, who are connected socially via the network shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://bldavies.com/blog/auctioning-vaccines/figures/network-1.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>Everyone submits bids totaling $60, spread evenly among themselves and their peers.
For example, agent A bids $30 towards vaccinating themself and agent B, while agent B bids $15 towards vaccinating themself and agents A, C, and D.
Intuitively, agent A values vaccinating B highly because it protects A fully from viruses transmitted among agents C–H.
In contrast, B has more peers and so values vaccinating any one of those peers less because it doesn’t protect B fully from the rest of the network.</p>
<p>The “aggregate bid” for each agent equals the sum of bids submitted towards that agent’s vaccination.
The agents with the highest aggregate bids receive the vaccines.
In this example, agents B and F receive the vaccine, with aggregate bids equal to $94 and $87.</p>
<p>Each agent receives surplus equal to their subjective valuation of the vaccine allocation minus their payment towards that allocation’s provision.
This payment equals the increase in aggregate surplus that other agents would receive if the agent’s bids were ignored.
Thus, the vaccine auction is a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_auction">Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction</a> in which each agent pays the harm they inflict on other agents.
Consequently, the vaccine auction inherits the properties of VCG auctions; in particular, bids equal subjective valuations.
This property makes it easy to compute pre-payment surpluses: simply sum each agent’s bids towards vaccinated agents.</p>
<p>The table below presents the aggregate bid for, payment made by, and surplus delivered to each agent under the optimal vaccine allocation.
Agents B and F don’t have to pay for the vaccines they receive because others are willing to pay on their behalf.
Agent A pays $15 because their bid towards vaccinating B shifts the optimal allocation away from E, which lowers F’s surplus by $15.
Likewise, agents G and H pay because their preference to vaccinate F, rather than E, makes B–D worse off.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Agent</th>
<th>Aggregate bid ($)</th>
<th>Payment ($)</th>
<th>Surplus ($)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>42</td>
<td>15</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
<td>94</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>12</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
<td>44</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
<td>44</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E</td>
<td>79</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>24</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>F</td>
<td>87</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>G</td>
<td>45</td>
<td>22</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>H</td>
<td>45</td>
<td>22</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This example departs from reality in two important ways.
First, I assume each agent’s bids sum to a constant ($60).
This assumption is obviously unrealistic: wealth inequality means some people can afford to submit higher bids than others, which may lead to inequitible vaccine allocations.
Moreover, people may vary in their willingness to pay for vaccines independently of the variation in their wealths.</p>
<p>Second, I assume every agent wants to be vaccinated.
This common desire may not hold in reality: some people may prefer not to be vaccinated because they fear potential side-effects.
Such people may refuse to participate in the auction, reducing social welfare by preventing some externalities from being internalized.</p>

    </span></p><p>Over time, you get a clear picture of your personal keyboard usage. Are there any far-away keys that are red (i.e, get used a lot)? Are there any easily-accessible keys that are being wasted?</p>
<p>For my own use, shown above, we can see that I could be putting the thumb cluster for my left hand to much better use. On the main cluster, we can see the Colemak keyboard layout at work, with the home row being used heavily (as it should be).</p>
<h3>How long should a session be?</h3>
<p>To get a clear picture of your typing habits, you could do one of two things:</p>
<p><strong>Wait for Oryx to go “ding”.</strong> When Oryx feels like there’s enough data on your typing habits, it will sound an audible ding, inviting you to check out the tab and see how you’re doing.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also…</p>
<p><strong>Go by activity.</strong> This is actually my preferred way of doing it. My typing pattern tends to change according to whatever I’m currently doing: Editing images isn’t like replying to email, and my keyboard usage patterns reflect this.</p>
<p>So what I like to do is turn on the heat map, and sink into <em>one</em> kind of deep work for a while. Maybe writing, or email, or coding — whatever. Then, when I’m done with that particular activity, I go and check on my heat map. I also take a moment to pay attention to my body: How do my hands, arms, and shoulders feel right now?</p>
<p>This particular context — the physical state and heat map that result from <em>this</em> work — can be a powerful source of information for further optimizing my layout.</p>
<p>Questions I like to ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any wasted keys I should reassign? Specifically, are there any keys I didn’t use at all?</li>
<li>Does the heat map show one hand working much harder than the other? Does it feel that way in my body, too?</li>
<li>Are any far-away keys red?</li>
<li>Should I create a dedicated layer just for this one application or use case? I.e, when I do this activity, am I mainly using keys on the outside edges of the keyboard, or “reaching” a lot?</li>
</ul>
<p>Just a few sessions with the heat map feature, followed by iterating on your layout, can result in powerful (and highly personalized) ergonomic gains. Try it out!</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

<li><p><strong>It is easier to say what not to do, than to do what is needed.</strong>
So do not be discouraged by this list; you, too, have something to contribute.</p></li>
<li><p><strong id="tradeoffs">Every decision that matters is a tradeoff.</strong>
There never was, and never will be, a perfect language.
As humans have many purposes, so must programming languages.</p></li>
<li><p>The measure of a language is not what is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">possible</a> in it, but <strong>what it makes easy.</strong>
<!-- 1. What is *possible* in a language matters less than what is *easy*. -->
<!-- 1. Languages are defined more by what they make easy than by what they make possible. --></p></li>
<li><p>Thus, a language's strongest characteristic is what it makes <em>automatic</em>:
What <em>don't</em> you have to think about when using this language?
<!-- 1. *Corollary:* What is possible in a language matters less than what it makes *automatic*. -->
<!-- 1. ? What your language makes easy is less important than what it makes automatic.
!--
!-- 1. What your language makes automatic is just the opposite of what it makes impossible. --></p></li>
<li><p>There is power in restraint. The less a language does, the more can be done
<em>to</em> it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/rg9119/status/774383048183783424">Types are a tool of thought.</a></strong>
They exist in the mind first, and in the machine second.</p>

<p>A statically typed language, therefore, guides your thinking. This is useful.
<br>A dynamically typed language lets you think freely. This too is useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Shorten the edit-compile-run cycle. Then shorten it some more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong id="readability">Readability beats writeability.</strong> Or,
<em>predictability beats convenience</em>.</p>

<p>It is better that code be transparent to read than convenient to write. This
is less important for one-shot scripts, and more important for large
codebases tended by many people.</p>

<!-- Explorations of this idea: regularity in language design. many operations on one data structure vs few operations on many data structures? --></li>
<li><p><strong>Brevity is good, until it's bad.</strong></p>

<p>Brevity both helps and harms readability. You can only fit so much in your
head at one time. Terse notation helps more fit in; it aids in reading and
recognizing patterns. But it also steepens the learning curve and increases
memory load.</p>

<p>Notations must be <em>justified</em> by frequency of use and
<a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/tot.htm">power of thought gained</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em id="low-level">A programming language is low level when its programs require attention to the irrelevant.</em> <br><small><cite>— <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html">Alan Perlis</a></cite></small>
<!-- 1. *A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming, is not worth knowing.* <br><small><cite>&mdash; <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html">Alan Perlis</a></cite></small> --></p>

<p>This is, of course, a relative condition: Irrelevant to what? Irrelevant to whom?
We often think of languages as being lower- or higher-level than other languages. Actually, they're <em>below</em> or <em>above</em> certain <em>concerns</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explicitness is good, until it's bad.</strong></p>

<p>Explicitness is good when it <em><a href="#readability">prioritizes readability over writeability</a></em>.
<br>
Explicitness is bad when it <em><a href="#low-level">requires attention to the irrelevant</a></em>.</p>

<p>Can't it do both? <a href="#tradeoffs">Of course it can!</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Not everything is an object.</strong> Nor is everything a function, a string, a
process, an actor, a value, a thunk, a message, a list, a file, or
<a href="http://www.rntz.net/post/2016-06-06-not-everything-is-an-expression.html">an expression</a>. Not everything is data, nor is everything code. Not
everything is lazy, immutable, pure, copyable, serializable, sortable, or
transmissible over the network. <code>goto</code> is not the only control operator, and
<a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/continuations/against-callcc.html">neither is <code>call/cc</code></a>.</p>

!--   The world is a messy place, and programming is messy too. Cramming all of programming into one concept never works. ([Except][lambda-calc] [in][pi-calc] [theory][sk-calc].) --></li>

<strong><a href="http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/11/extremist-programming/">taking things to extremes</a></strong>
do we truly learn their limits.
<!-- Everything is clearest in the extreme. --></p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/193447.html">Always bet on text.</a></strong></p></li>
<li><p>Yet long shots are worth taking.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The medium matters.</strong> Consider how the programmer will interact with your
language or system. Will they use text files? a REPL? a shell? an IDE? a GUI?
a spreadsheet? a structure editor? a browser? The language design should
harmonize with the available methods of interaction. Indentation-sensitivity
is a terrible fit for a line-oriented interactive shell, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>Syntax matters less than you think.</p></li>
<li><p>Syntax matters <a href="https://thefeedbackloop.xyz/stroustrups-rule-and-layering-over-time/">more than you think</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Syntax is a pain in the ass.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance is a lot like syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>"<em>Declarative</em>" means you can use it without knowing what it's doing.</p>

<p>All too often, it means you can't <em>tell</em> what it's doing, either.</p></li>
<li><p>What applies to languages, applies to libraries. Consider, for example, how
<em>predictability beats convenience</em> might apply to the design of a numerical
library. <!-- Or how *the medium matters* applies to --></p></li>
<li><p>Performance matters. Syntax matters. Documentation matters. Libraries matter. Culture matters. First-mover advantage matters. Compatibility matters. Corporate support matters. Error messages matter.</p>

<p>But in the end, <strong>only two things are sure when it comes to language popularity:</strong></p>

<li><p>To succeed, be the only available option on a popular platform.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/samth/status/809764608802258944">Nobody likes parentheses</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Languages teach ways of approaching problems. Once you know the way, you
don't always need the language.</p>

<p>... but your friend might!</p></li>

    <h3>How Changing One Sentence led to 2.5x more Reviews</h3>
    
        <h6>December 17, 2020</h6>
    
    </p>
  </div><div>
    <div>
		<p><strong><u>June 2019</u></strong><br>
Fifteen years in business and we had a measly three reviews on Google.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>
<p>I reminded myself that this is <em>exactly</em> why I moved back from the Bay area to work on the family business – to use technology to expand. Let’s fix this!</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.wints.org/img/articles/2020.12.17/2.stoneland-reviews-dec-2019.jpg" alt="Stoneland Reviews December 2020" width="60%"> 
</figure>

<p>I’d read somewhere that people are most willing to review right after their experience – good or bad.
I’d been itching to use Twilio, and this was the perfect use case!
Our inside sales person saves a visitor’s contact information right after a visitor leaves. Their phone number is included in this.</p>
<p>So, June 2019 I wrote a python script that sent an SMS to the visitor an 1 hour after they left. The SMS said:</p>
<div>
	<div>
<blockquote><small><i>If you enjoyed your visit (or didn't), please let us know how we did!<br>http://bit.ly/stoneland-google-stl <br>-Stoneland Team</i></small></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>I thought it was pretty slick, getting the URL, a cohesive message and proper formatting into one SMS.</p>
<p>At the same time, our sales team made a push to get reviews by emailing old customers.</p>
<p><strong><u>December 2019</u></strong><br>
We have 18 reviews now! While a big improvement over the last 15 years, it was still far below our competition.
And most of the reviews were in September when our sales team made the push. Now the trickle had dried up.</p>
<p>I’d been reading and listening to a lot of <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/">Indiehackers</a>, especially interviews with founders who were marketing specialists. After ingesting Indiehacker nuggets, I settled on changing one factor at a time to understand what drove reviews.</p>
<p>In January 2020, I tweaked the copy of the SMS to read:</p>
<div>
	<div>
<blockquote><small><i>If you enjoyed your visit, leave us a 5 second rating!<br>http://bit.ly/stoneland-google-stl<br>-Stoneland Team</i></small></blockquote></div></div>
<p><strong><u>December 2020</u></strong><br>
That tiny change made all the difference! As of December 15, 2020, we have <strong>93 reviews</strong> with a 4.9 rating!
We’ve outstripped all our competitors in the area, as well as several of our customers.</p>
<p>Bottom line? Copywriting matters.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>P.S. For anyone wondering about the math around ‘2.5x’, here’s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>June 2019 - December 2020 (~6 months): 15 reviews</li>
<li>Extrapolated over 12 months: 30 reviews</li>
<li>January 2020 - December 2020 (~12 months): 75 reviews</li>
</ul>
<p><span>75/30 = <strong>2.5</strong></span></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I didn’t learn about history very well prior to my thirties somehow, but lately I’ve been variously trying to rectify this. Lately I’ve been reading Howard Zinn’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O2YH8EQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">People’s History of the United States</a>, listening to Steven Pinker’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence/dp/0670022950/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">the Better Angels of Our Nature</a>, watching Ken Burns and Lynn Novick’s <a href="http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/the-vietnam-war/home/">documentary about the Vietnam War</a> and watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Webzwithaz">Oversimplified</a> history videos on YouTube (which I find too lighthearted for the subject matter, but if you want to squeeze extra history learning in your leisure and dessert time, compromises can be worth it.)</p>

<p>There is a basic feature of all this that I’m perpetually confused about: how has there been so much energy for going to war?</p>

<p>It’s hard to explain my confusion, because in each particular case, there might be plenty of plausible motives given–someone wants ‘power’, or to ‘reunite their country’, or there is some customary enemy, or that enemy might attack them otherwise–but overall, it seems like the kind of thing people should be extremely averse to, such that even if there were plausibly good justifications, they wouldn’t just win out constantly, other justifications for not doing the thing would usually be found. Like, there are great reasons for writing epic treatises on abstract topics, but somehow, most people find that they don’t get around to it. I expect going to some huge effort to travel overseas and die in the mud to be more like that, intuitively.</p>

<p>To be clear, I’m not confused here about people fighting in defense of things they care a lot about—joining the army when their country is under attack, or joining the Allies in WWII. And I’m not confused by people who are forced to fight, by conscription or desperate need of money. It’s just that across these various sources on history, I haven’t seen much comprehensible-to-me explanation of what’s going on in the minds of the people who volunteer to go to war (or take part in smaller dangerous violence) when the stakes aren’t already at the life or death level for them.</p>

<p>I am also not criticizing the people whose motives I am confused by–I’m confident that I’m missing things.</p>

<p>It’s like if I woke up tomorrow to find that half the country was volunteering to cut off their little finger for charity, I’d be pretty surprised. And if upon inquiring, each person had something to say—about how it was a good charity, or how suffering is brave and valiant, or how their Dad did it already, or how they were being emotionally manipulated by someone else who wanted it to happen, or they how wanted to be part of something—each one might not be that unlikely, but I’d still feel overall super confused, at a high level, at there being enough total energy behind this, given that it’s a pretty costly thing to do.</p>

<p>At first glance, the historical people heading off to war don’t feel surprising. But I feel like this is because it is taken for granted as what historical people do. Just as in stories about Christmas, it is taken for granted that Santa Clause will make and distribute billions of toys, because that’s what he does, even though his motives are actually fairly opaque. But historical people presumably had internal lives that would be recognizable to me. What did it look like from the inside, to hear that WWI was starting, and hurry to sign up? Or to volunteer for the French military in time to fight to maintain French control in Vietnam, in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Indochina_War">First Indochina War</a>, that preceded the Vietnam War?</p>

<p>I’d feel less surprised in a world where deadly conflict was more like cannibalism is in our world. Where yes, technically humans are edible, so if you are hungry enough you can eat them, but it is extremely rare for it to get to that, because nobody wants to be on any side of it, and they have very strong and consistent feelings about that, and if anyone really wanted to eat thousands or millions of people, say to bolster their personal or group power, it would be prohibitively expensive in terms of money or social capital to overcome the universal distaste for this idea.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Since I’ve been reading <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/i-am-error"><em>I Am Error</em></a>, I’ve been getting more and more interested in the technical aspects of the Famicom. Turns out all you really need to get me interested in your console is prose explanations of how a pattern table works. Also, I get to drip some molten lead into it so I can use a modern TV! Everyone wins.</p>

<p>When I was growing up, a lot of my friends had an NES, but I first had the ColecoVision and then a “Model 2” Sega Genesis when that came out. As a result, I’ve gone the last few decades thinking the NES was full of branded shovelware, because it turns out that’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzJ0M-erXAM">the exact kind of game that eight year old boys bought a lot of and then subjected their friends to</a>.</p>

<p>Later, when I was getting interested in collecting old videogames, the NES had already started its stratospheric price rise for many games, and with it the skeeziest members of the game-price-speculator community. None of the cool modern “community” stuff existed then (NESRGB, Everdrives, FDSStick) so I gave the entire system a wide berth and decided to wait until this whole fad was over and prices returned to normal. That hasn’t happened yet… however, in Japan, stuff is still really cheap due to the massive popularity of the Famicom, and the Famicom is different enough from the NES that I’m coming at it without the same preconceptions that I had of those childhood NESes.</p>

<p>Out of the box, the original Famicom only has RF output. If you’re not familiar, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sQF_K9MqpA">this video by Gravis is the best I’ve seen on how RF output works</a>, and a Nintendo is even used to make it relevant to this post.</p>

<p>Not only does the Famicom only have RF output, the Japanese channel frequencies are such that that RF output only appears on channel 95 and 96 on a Western TV, which a lot of TVs simply can’t reach. On some models, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVyFEMg0Kpg">tweak the pots on the RF can to bring that down to US channel 6</a> to get around this. However, I wanted to play my games on a Commodore 1702 or a PVM, neither of which have an antenna tuner of any kind. Doing a composite mod seemed like the easiest way forward.</p>

<h2 id="giving-it-a-good-squint">Giving It A Good Squint</h2>
<p>The first thing I noticed is that a Famicom is a <em>lot</em> smaller than an NES. They added a bunch of empty space for the American model in order to accommodate the “toaster” mechanism, I guess.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-vs-nes.jpg" alt="A Famicom is sitting on top of an American front-loading NES, which is a spoiled Western brat and doesn't like loading cartridges."></p>

<p>I thought I would hate the hard-wired controllers, but they’re actually really nice. You’re guaranteed to always get first-party controllers when you buy a used system, which is more than I can say for basically any other machine, that NES included. It would be nice if they were in better condition, but if they work I’ll be happy.</p>

<p>There’s a “Famicom Family” logo on the front sticker that I haven’t seen on most other Famicoms; from what I can tell, this is a good way to tell what machines are later models as it ties into <a href="https://maru-chang.com/hard/hvc/english.htm">some kind of later branding</a>.</p>

<h2 id="opening-it-up">Opening It Up</h2>
<p>When mine arrived from Japan, it looked dirty and pretty beaten up, but that’s okay for a test machine. I can always get a nicer one later; another thing to hoard.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-case-damage.jpg" alt="The missing chunk of plastic near the player 1 controller slot."></p>

<p>A corner of the plastic near the player-1 controller mount was missing, and there was grit in the textured plastic. I took a few trips to the sink with the plastic and scrubbed, but the yellowing is obviously not going to come out with soap and water.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-opened.jpg" alt="The Famicom's bottom cover is opened, revealing the underside of the motherboard."></p>

<p>I opened it up - screws were tight, a good sign - and then took a look at the board. It’s a late model, as evidenced by the big power/RF module soldered to the board instead of attached by a ribbon cable.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-gross-pot.jpg" alt="There is a green potentiometer with some gunk and tree debris (seeds?) on it."></p>

<p>This console has spent some time in an old shed or something, based on how much of Mother Nature had crept inside of it, but at least I didn’t find any stray cigarettes inside it unlike the above NES. The motherboard cleaned up quickly with some spray alcohol and cotton swabs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-1989-copyright.jpg" alt="The copyright reads © 1989 Nintendo"></p>

<p>The board is a 1989, which was a pretty good year for Nintendo. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/07/time-to-feel-old-inside-the-nes-on-its-30th-birthday/3/">The Famicom apparently kept getting made until <em>2003</em></a>. It would be cool to track one of those down.</p>

<p>I wanted to deep-clean the dirty, scratched-up controllers as well - the controllers still had their protective plastic wrap on them, but they were scratched anyway! - and make sure that the silicone on the D-pads were in good shape, but I stripped one of the screws on controller 1 pretty severely in a moment of clumsiness. I’ll drill that out later and service it, but in the meantime let’s get back to the composite mod.</p>

<h2 id="motherboard-work">Motherboard Work</h2>
<p>I got sort of lucky in having a late-model board. On the later boards there’s a dedicated “video” pin that is broken out near the RF jack that I could just solder to, rather than lifting pin 21 (<a href="http://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/PPU_pin_out_and_signal_description"><code>VOUT</code></a>) of the PPU. This way, you can keep both the RF and composite. Reportedly, this creates a bunch of ‘jailbar’ interference, so I’ve done what others have and lifted pin 21 of the PPU. Sometimes the hard way is the best way.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-pin21-lifted.jpg" alt="Pin 21 lifted out of the PPU. Ignore the Sharpie mark telling me which pin is 21, as if I could have forgotten"></p>

<p>This wasn’t too hard to desolder and lift, but the pin would have looked a lot less mangled if I had also desoldered R6 first to get it out of the way. I had to use a little bit too much force on my “prying tweezers” to lift it out, which could have easily broken the leg on a newer chip where the legs are much more fragile. Thanks, 80s technology!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-decoupling-caps.jpg" alt="The axial decoupling caps are added."></p>

<p>I also added decoupling caps between 5V and GND on the CPU and PPU chips. It’s just good practice! These 0.1µF axial ceramic cuties were lying in my cap pile ever since I used a handful of them for <a href="https://www.leadedsolder.com/tag/tandy1000sx">the cursed Tandy 1000SX</a>, so I was happy to slam two more of them in. The recipe I was following used <code>/RESET</code> as the 5V source, which feels a little sketchy, but it means you don’t have to run long wires all the way to the other end of the chip. Then again, the copper pour on the back of the board <em>is</em> 5V…</p>

<p>I thought 0.1µF might be a little small, but it’s easy to change these out for a 1µF or larger cap if it doesn’t have much effect. You probably shouldn’t pick decoupling caps based on aesthetics.</p>

<h2 id="video-amplification">Video Amplification</h2>
<p>The whole idea behind the composite mod is that you’re building a simple signal amplifier to replace the one that was originally inside the RF can.</p>

<p>As the baseband video signal comes out of PPU pin 21, you need to step it up to a level that the TV can easily understand. The video chip’s output transistors are simply not designed to directly drive a television, and after the weak signal goes all the way through the AV cable into the back of the TV, there’s probably not much left to pick up anyway.</p>

<p>There are a lot of homebrew mods for this, ranging from cutting out and reusing the stock transistors on the motherboard to building a whole protoboard circuit with some new parts.</p>

<p>After doing some more research, I decided I would try a part that I’ve been meaning to try for a while, <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/THS7314">the TI THS7314 video amplifier IC</a>. It’s used a lot for <a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/thsamps.html">the amplification of analogue RGB signals</a>, and it should work really well for my one-channel signal. The part is designed specifically for this application, and should both install cleanly and produce nice-looking video.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-av-mod-ths7314-board.png" alt="The prototype board as seen from KiCad. It's very simple, with only a 'video in,' 'audio in,' and 'power in' pinout which then goes to the THS7314 chip."></p>

<p>I made a quick, super-simple little board that basically just broke out the pins of the video amp chip, and sent it to fab at OSH Park. They’ve recently added free (if slow - over a month) shipping to Canada, which makes them a really desirable option for running off onesy-twosie little mod boards like this during the current shipping nightmare we find ourselves in.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-av-mod-boards-osh.jpg" alt="The two variants of the board - one with the traditional &quot;homebrew amp&quot; design, and the other with the TI THS7314 video amplifier chip."></p>

<p>I made boards to do two variants, one with the original “homebrew” amplifier circuit and one with the THS7314. If the THS7314 doesn’t work out for whatever reason, I can just put in the usual circuit that the community prefers. However - spoilers - the THS7314 worked fine, so I never actually constructed the traditional design.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-av-mod-v0.2-assembled.jpg" alt="The v0.2 board, assembled. A cap leg comes out of the &quot;R&quot; audio hole, and then directly around in a 180 to the &quot;L&quot; audio hole."></p>

<p>I should have added a jumper to the board to solder left and right audio together (the Famicom is monoaural.) This ugly cap leg trick should be fine for awhile. I decided on a 220µF capacitor for audio, because that’s what was on the top of the cap bin when I opened it.</p>

<h2 id="sound">Sound</h2>
<p>The Famicom supports audio coming from the cartridge, which is why Castlevania III on the Famicom has such better music than that on the NES. I definitely want to be able to hear the cartridge audio, so it’s worth pulling the audio from somewhere other than directly out of the CPU (which also contains the sound hardware – lower chip counts = more profit for Nintendo.) The “<a href="https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Cartridge_connector">audio output</a>” pin on the cartridge contains the Famicom’s sound after it has been mixed between the expansion audio and the system audio, where it normally then travels immediately to the RF can for output. Since we’re no longer putting that audio into the RF output stream, it needs to get broken out and fed into the TV using the usual RCA jacks as well.</p>

<p>Reportedly, the GPM-02 motherboard has <a href="https://nerdlypleasures.blogspot.com/2018/01/famicom-nes-simple-tweaks-to-restore.html">a different ‘mix’ between the expansion audio and the system audio compared to the original Famicom motherboard</a>. You can revert back to the original model’s amplifier behaviour by removing the 43kΩ resistor at R7 and replacing it with a 100kΩ part.</p>

<p>I also removed the choke at FC1 on the motherboard, so that the sound didn’t go into the RF can where it might pick up other noise. To source audio, I just went from the “expansion audio” pin (#46) on the cartridge port and added a 220µF capacitor.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.leadedsolder.com/assets/famicom-gpm02-audio-mods.jpg" alt="The two audio mods done. R7 is replaced with a 100kΩ resistor that I had on hand (sorry it's so big... and backward) and FC1 is removed entirely."></p>

<p>I only had a giant 100kΩ resistor on hand, so that’s the one that went in. This bugs me more than I thought it would.</p>

<p>These changes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD22orMjz48">seem to make a pretty significant impact</a>. I generally don’t have an ear for little tweaks, but this is big enough that even I can pick it out. There’s whole instruments that seem to be missing from the unmodified mix.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-signal-out">Getting The Signal Out</h2>
<p>There’s a lot of different ways I’ve seen of actually getting the composite signal out of the Famicom and into a way that you can plug it into a TV:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cut out the RF box’s antenna jack, and <a href="http://8bitplus.co.uk/projects/famicom-av-mod-nintendo/">replace it with a TRRS jack</a>, which carries all four signals for RCA on one jack;</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2056561579">Drill holes in the side</a> and put in some panel-mount RCA connectors;</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky8rFPbzGMU">Run a female or male RCA cable squid out of the case</a> (usually …</li></ul></article></div>

<p>“In crypto, the price is the news” said a smart person on Twitter.  Today, it most definitely is. With Bitcoin blowing past 20K USD and folks in technology and finance struggling to fit narratives to price changes, it is important that in the midst of all the noise around price we don’t lose sight of a very significant and impactful paradigm shift that Bitcoin is an instance of: Decentralization.</p>



<p>The ‘Digital Gold’ narrative has given a very effective model for most of us to understand Bitcoin. But the simplicity of this model is also its curse – it mostly hides the actual promise that Bitcoin represents – that trust can indeed be decentralized, and a ‘hubless’ world is very much possible. In fact, in a digital world where we all increasingly understand that “we are the product” – a move towards such a hubless economy might be inevitable.</p>



<p>It will help to remember that Decentralization is not a discrete point in the space of how economies work, but a continuous spectrum. The most recent changes in economic models that we have witnessed (Hotel chains to AirBnB, Taxi companies to Uber) tell us that directionally, we are definitely moving towards a peer-to-peer (P2P) model for many economic functions – and while there might be attempts to decentralize most functions (very comparable to the Internet), the ones where a P2P model would be the best fit, the model will stick. Crypto (and the token model representing ownership/utility/governance) just happens to be the current transactional framework that enables such economies to function. There will be more. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, Bitcoin – the first instance of this shift – happens to address a very tricky concept: Money. The fact that many of the early cryptocurrencies that came after Bitcoin chose to just refine the concept – improving what Bitcoin did, on parameters like scalability, privacy and programmability, but still focusing on the concept of Money – brought a lot of skepticism and negative commentary to the space. Obviously, if you put anonymity and Money in the same sentence, the interpretations cannot be very positive. The 2017 ICO boom, where many players chose to ignore the regulations set by governments and organizations that oversee fundraising, added strength to the perception that decentralizing trust is not a good idea – and made many smart people both in technology and finance just stay away from Crypto.</p>



<p>So here is the one good thing that the price of Bitcoin does to the space: it brings the attention back. And while we have the attention, it is important for us to ask: If the Internet – with its promise of disintermediation – deserved a chance, if the sharing economy – with its promise of providing more economic opportunities to individuals – deserved a chance, then, with its promise of a P2P world with no hubs that might misuse our trust for profit – Decentralization Deserves a Chance?   </p>

I’m not aware of Apple publishing postmortems after outages or providing details about known issues. So it’s up to the developer and admin communities at large to help each other learn about outages and potential causes. With the release of macOS 11.1 this week I’ve been debugging a new issue with the Mac software update process, one which will affect most enterprise users. I decided I should write about it and let everyone know what the issue is, workarounds, and how to avoid it. I’ve also been paying close attention to some recent changes to the software update mechanism, so I’ll try to mention them below as well.</p><h2 id="a-macos-11-bug-prevents-upgrades-to-the-next-version">A macOS 11 bug prevents upgrades to the next version</h2><p>After macOS 11.1 was released earlier this week, many users <a href="https://twitter.com/Contains_ENG/status/1339399335298166785">started reporting</a> that they were not able to see the software update. Others reported that they saw it, but were not able to download it. I personally experienced this issue when 11.1 was in beta and filed a case with Apple about it, but then moved on to other problems. When the final release came out this week, there were widespread reports of it on the MacAdmins Slack. Reading through system logs, I as well as other admins were able to find what appears to be the root cause. <strong>Under certain conditions, macOS 11.0.1 and macOS 11.1 hosts are requesting the update server send the 11.0.1 update, instead of requesting the next available one. The server rejects this update as it’s already either installed or older.</strong> This somehow corrupts the state of the software update process, and the update is no longer visible as an option in System Preferences.</p><figure><img src="https://micromdm.io/big_sur_softwareupdate/log.jpg"></figure><h3 id="workarounds">Workarounds</h3><ul><li>The update is visible again immediately after the restart. But it’s unclear if the update can always be installed after it’s visible since the condition that made it fail to download the first time can be triggered again.</li><li>Removing the MDM enrollment profile causes the update to be seen again. I and several others tested this extensively, and it’s definitely the enrollment profile, not some other policy managed by MDM. This is obviously a terrible workaround and I’d hesitate to mention it to users as it could cause security agents to stop working, and countless approval dialogs we’re so familiar with. Not to mention some of you have the MDM enrollment profile as non-removable or users who are not administrators, so they don’t have permission to unenroll. Getting them back enrolled in the MDM might prove to be a challenge too.</li><li>Distributing the full 11.1, and eventually the 11.2 installers.</li></ul><h3 id="can-apple-fix-this-bug-without-manual-intervention">Can Apple fix this bug without manual intervention?</h3><p>Apple is well aware this is a problem now, so I am confident the issue will be addressed in 11.2. Unfortunately, it is a client-side issue affecting both 11.0.1 and 11.1 clients. So there’s not much Apple <em>can</em> do to provide a fix. One potential solution I see is for Apple to detect the wrong request and instead of rejecting the download, offer the right file archive instead. But this is a complex system and it’s unclear if the server-side changes alone are enough.</p><p>Something else Apple could try is to side load a patch through another software update. There’s background configuration and malware removal tools that are likely capable of fixing the issue on the system. But it’s an ugly hack and one I’d personally stay clear of even if the option was available.</p><p>In my opinion, the most likely outcome is that the bug will be fixed in 11.2, but clients that have already upgraded to Big Sur (or any M1 macs you might’ve bought) will have to work around the problem themselves. If we’re lucky Apple will publish a support article and that will be that.</p><h2 id="what-else-you-need-to-know">What else you need to know</h2><p>Big Sur has changed the software update mechanism entirely, especially on Apple Silicon macs. It’s a long time coming and Apple spoke about some of this at WWDC in the MDM and IT sessions, so it shouldn’t be entirely surprising. But a lot was left unsaid for us to discover on our own.</p><ul><li>Combo update packages are <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2020/12/17/apple-has-stopped-providing-standalone-installers-for-macos-updates/">no longer published</a> on the Apple website. This might surprise many of you who rely on distributing them. The main reason is that the entire format of the updates has changed, and it’s also no longer possible to install updates without the Mac having access to the internet. The updates must come from Apple, and they must be managed by <code>softwareupdate</code> and related processes on the system.</li><li>On Apple Silicon, third party processes are no longer able to script the <code>softwareupdate</code> command. Running the software update command as a root process now prompts for the administrator password, who also needs to be a secure token user. There are only two possible options for OS updates to be applied; either the human user of the device itself or the MDM process <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment-reference-macos/using-secure-and-bootstrap-tokens-apdff2cf769b/1/web/1.0">which has special permission</a>. It might also be possible for the Mac to update itself with the auto-update mechanism, but there are too many bugs right now to observe how well that works. My personal experience is that it doesn’t and I’m greeted with a password prompt to enter the next day…</li><li>Specifying a custom URL for the <code>softwareupdate</code> process to pull updates from is no longer possible. Apple advertised this deprecation for all of last year, so it should surprise no one but it hurts. <a href="https://github.com/wdas/reposado">Reposado</a> was one of several great tools that made it possible to have unstable/beta/stable tracks within an organization.</li><li>—ignore is gone as a flag. It <a href="https://mrmacintosh.com/10-15-5-2020-003-updates-changes-to-softwareupdate-ignore/">was gone</a> in 10.15.5 briefly too, so you likely know about this one. This time it’s gone for good and never coming back. An MDM server can delay the client from seeing OS updates for up to 90 days only, but that is the absolute maximum going forward. Even for a future major release like macOS 12. If this is important to you, file feedback for Apple to provide a second deferral option, specific to major version numbers.</li></ul><p>I work with the MDM protocol a lot day-to-day and have been <a href="https://micromdm.io/blog/os_update/">testing</a> software updates for a while. I was even <a href="https://micromdm.io/blog/wwdc20-what-s-new-in-managing/">optimistic</a> about what it would look like in Big Sur back in June. Apple had promised it’s an entirely new implementation, closer to what is available on iOS and that everything would work better than before. But we’re not off to a good start, and all the concerns I had for several years now are back. The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/commands_and_queries">design</a> of OS updates in MDM is brittle, requiring multiple remote procedure calls to accomplish something that was previously done by a few lines of shell scripting. And that would be bad on its own, but the bad design is coupled with a buggy implementation; there are many known issues, besides the one I described above. Unless something drastically changes, we’re likely to see many months, if not years of software update bugs that are entirely out of our control.</p><p>Apple was never particularly great at building systems for the enterprise. But, until recently, the Unix components were available for software developers and system administrators to work with. The end result ended up being that if you made an investment within your organization, macOS was a great experience for end-users. It took a lot of work, but it was all achievable. Today, Apple is no better at developing systems that are required in the enterprise. But the ball is entirely in their court. Apple still makes great tools for consumers, and there will be a demand from employees to provide them with Apple gear. But, if Apple can’t start acting on our collective feedback, the experience of using a Mac in the workplace will quickly become unbearable to most.</p></div></div></div>]]>

      <blockquote>
<p>A year ago YesLogic open-sourced the Allsorts font parser, shaping engine,
and subsetter. In this post we cover how Allsorts has worked out in <a href="https://www.princexml.com/">Prince</a>,
what's improved over the past year, and what we're working on next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/yeslogic/allsorts">Allsorts</a> is a Rust crate (library) that can parse OpenType, WOFF, and WOFF2
fonts, shape text, and subset fonts<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>At YesLogic we've been using Allsorts to power all font parsing, shaping of
supported scripts, and subsetting in Prince since version 13 was released in November
2019. Aside from the odd small bug revealed by real-world usage and exposure to
new fonts it has proven to be capable and reliable.</p>
<p>Over the past year we've continued to work on Allsorts, adding support for
additional scripts, bitmap and SVG fonts, and refined the
API to make it easier to use.</p>
<h2 id="new-scripts">New Scripts</h2>
<p>Allsorts can now shape the Arabic and Syriac scripts giving us even more coverage of the
world's scripts.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="bitmap-and-svg-fonts">Bitmap and SVG Fonts</h2>
<p>We can now parse OpenType font tables containing bitmaps and SVGs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/cblc"><code>CBDT</code>/<code>CBLC</code></a> and <code>EBDT</code>/<code>EBLC</code>, as used by <a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/emoji/">Noto Color Emoji</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/sbix"><code>sbix</code></a>, as used by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Color_Emoji">Apple Color Emoji</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/svg"><code>SVG</code></a>, as used by <a href="https://github.com/eosrei/twemoji-color-font">Twitter Color Emoji</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We implemented a unified API that supports retrieving the image for a glyph
independent of the tables it originates from.</p>
<p>The bitmap and SVG support has allowed us to bring emoji and colour SVG font
support to Prince 14:</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="improved-api">Improved API</h2>
<p>Prior to Allsorts 0.5 it was a fairly involved affair to shape some text. You
had to read the font, do glyph mapping, apply glyph substitution (GSUB), and
apply glyph positioning (GPOS) in individual steps which amounted to quite a
bit of code.</p>
<p>Now it's only a few lines. You read the font and construct an instance of the
<code>Font</code> type, turn text into glyphs with a call to <code>map_glyphs</code>, then shape the
text with a call to <code>shape</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Read and parse font
</span><span>let</span><span> buffer = std::fs::read(&amp;opts.font)?;
</span><span>let</span><span> scope = ReadScope::new(&amp;buffer);
</span><span>let</span><span> font_file = scope.read::&lt;FontData&lt;'_&gt;&gt;()?;

</span><span>// Construct Font instance
</span><span>let</span><span> provider = font_file.</span><span>table_provider</span><span>(opts.index)?;
</span><span>let mut</span><span> font = </span><span>match </span><span>Font::new(provider)?
    .</span><span>expect</span><span>("</span><span>unable to find suitable cmap subtable</span><span>");
};

</span><span>// Map glyphs
</span><span>let</span><span> glyphs = font.</span><span>map_glyphs</span><span>("</span><span>some text</span><span>", MatchingPresentation::NotRequired);

</span><span>// Shape glyphs
</span><span>let</span><span> script = tag::</span><span>LATN</span><span>;
</span><span>let</span><span> lang = tag::from_string("</span><span>ENG </span><span>")?;
</span><span>let</span><span> shaped_glyphs = font.</span><span>shape</span><span>(
    glyphs,
    script,
    Some(lang),
    &amp;Features::Mask(GsubFeatureMask::default()),
    </span><span>true</span><span>,
)?;
</span></code></pre>
<p>We also renamed a number of types and methods to make their function more
obvious and accurate.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous-improvements-and-fixes">Miscellaneous Improvements and Fixes</h2>
<p>Throughout the year we made several other improvements and fixes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extended our glyph substitution support, implementing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/gpos#lookuptype-8-chained-contexts-positioning-subtable">GSUB Lookup Type
8</a> (Reverse Chaining Contextual Single Substitution), which gains us
support for <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/commas-in-big-numbers-everywhere/">Tristan Hume's Numderline font</a>:</p>

  <figcaption>Text set in the <a href="https://thume.ca/numderline/">Numderline font</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed a few bugs and handled some quirks revealed by exposing the code to
a variety of real world fonts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved performance through:</p>
<ul>
<li>GSUB caching in Arabic, Syriac, and Indic.</li>
<li>Restructuring to avoid unnecessary bounds checks and allocations.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/tinyvec">tinyvec</a> to store codepoints on glyphs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added support for more OpenType features in GSUB:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard ligatures (<code>liga</code>).</li>
<li>Discretionary ligatures (<code>dlig</code>).</li>
<li>Historical ligatures (<code>hlig</code>).</li>
<li>Contextual ligatures (<code>clig</code>).</li>
<li>Small caps (<code>smcp</code>).</li>
<li>Small capitals from capitals (<code>c2sc</code>).</li>
<li>Lining figures (<code>lnum</code>).</li>
<li>Oldstyle figures (<code>onum</code>).</li>
<li>Proportional figures (<code>pnum</code>).</li>
<li>Tabular figures (<code>tnum</code>).</li>
<li>Diagonal fractions (<code>frac</code>).</li>
<li>Stacked fractions (<code>afrc</code>).</li>
<li>Ordinals (<code>ordn</code>).</li>
<li>Slashed zero (<code>zero</code>).</li>
<li>Language-specific OpenType shaping (<code>locl</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support fonts with Big5 encoded cmap subtables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>
<p>We're currently implementing the following features to make Allsorts
better suited for use cases outside our own:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expose glyph positioning information in shaping output so you don't have to
calculate it yourself.</li>
<li>Retrieve glyph contours as a series of basic drawing operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>After those we hope to look into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text segmentation by script to allow a chunk of text to be supplied to
Allsorts without having to detect and segment it by script first.</li>
<li>Glyph caching.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other items on our radar are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance measurement and optimisation to make it competitive with other
shaping libraries.</li>
<li>Support additional scripts such as Sinhala, and <a href="https://github.com/n8willis/opentype-shaping-documents/blob/master/opentype-shaping-use.md">Indic 3/Universal Shaping
Engine</a>.</li>
<li>Unicode normalisation.</li>
<li>Being able to map shaping output back to the source text.</li>
</ul>

Who are you and what do you do for a living?</h3><p>Hi my name is Anja I'm 27 years old and I'm a female Dockworker/ longshore women from Denmark 😁 sadly at the moment I'm out of work due to the Covid-19</p><h3 id="what-s-your-backstory-and-why-did-you-start-living-a-healthy-lifestyle">What's your backstory and why did you start living a healthy lifestyle?<br></h3><p>I grew up in a relatively normal family, with a big love/ fondness for food. As a teen, I often ate my feelings away, when I was bored or just generally snacking in front of the TV very late in the evening and ate way too big portions of food.</p><p>The reason why I started my weight loss journey was that I no longer felt happy for the reflection in the mirror and overall the way I looked. My weight started to have a negative effect on my life and my physique, I was tired of hating myself and my body and wanted to be able to love myself. I remembered I got tagged in a video on Instagram and I was surprised to see myself and I thought to myself " is that really how I look, is that the way people see me" and it made me sad.</p><p>Due to covid-19 I got fired from my job and at that time I thought to myself now is my chance to change the way I see myself and the way I look, so I contacted a personal trainer one of my friends had recommended and I started my Weight Loss Journey.<br></p><h3 id="how-was-it-in-the-beginning-and-what-were-the-biggest-obstacles-you-overcame">How was it in the beginning and what were the biggest obstacles you overcame?</h3><p>The first 2 weeks was the hardest, I had to get used to not eating as much as I used to and focusing on getting the right nutritions protein, and veggies, it's hard to break old habits and make new ones but as soon as I got over the two weeks mark, then for me, it started to feel natural and it was easier to incorporate in my daily life/ routine</p><h3 id="what-were-your-worst-mistakes">What were your worst mistakes?</h3><p>My worst mistake was thinking that I didn't do enough, that I didn't eat healthy enough, and that I didn't exercise enough at the beginning of my weight-loss journey. I pushed myself really hard and didn't get fast enough results in my opinion! because of that mentality and because of those thoughts I almost didn't go through with my weight-loss program, I lost my motivation real quick and quickly found out I had to change my mentality to be able to keep moving forward.</p><p>The biggest milestone for me was when my clothing started to feel loose around my body and when I could see the physical change. A good motivation boost was also when I could do more with the weights at my gym and when I could perform more and I didn't get out of breath within 5-minutes. It is often small things that motivate me the most, for example being able to squat a bit more than last time or being able to run a bit longer.</p><h3 id="what-area-of-life-has-changed-after-becoming-more-healthy">What area of life has changed after becoming more healthy?</h3><p>Because I'm being more active and healthy I feel like I have gotten more opportunities in life. I am no longer bound by my physique and I'm happier for my body, I like where I am and it has an effect on the people surrounding me. They can feel that I have gotten a lot more energy and it makes them happy on my behalf.<br></p><h3 id="what-is-your-weekly-training-protocol-how-many-days-per-week-do-you-train-how-are-your-workouts-structured">What is your weekly training protocol? How many days per week do you train, how are your workouts structured?</h3><p>I work with a personal trainer 2 times a week, one day with strength training and one day with cardio training, and an everyday goal of 10.000 steps sometimes I workout more depending on my motivation and the time I have available. (by myself)</p><h3 id="what-is-your-nutrition-and-diet-approach-do-you-follow-a-specific-meal-plan-or-eating-structure">What is your nutrition and diet approach? Do you follow a specific meal plan or eating structure?</h3><p>I do follow a semi-strict meal plan, I eat 1300 calories a day, 6 small meals spread out throughout the day. I drink a lot of water before my meal and in between my meals.

			<div>
				<p>Functional unit and integration tests are a standard tool of any software development organization,
helping not only to ensure correctness of newly implemented code,
but also to identify regressions — bugs in existing functionality introduced by a code change.
The situation looks different though when it comes to regressions related to non-functional requirements, in particular performance-related ones:
How to detect increased response times in a web application?
How to identify decreased throughput?</p>
<p>These aspects are typically hard to test in an automated and reliable way in the development workflow,
as they are dependent on the underlying hardware and the workload of an application.
For instance assertions on the duration of specific requests of a web application typically cannot be run in a meaningful way on a developer laptop,
which differs from the actual production hardware
(ironically, nowadays both is an option, the developer laptop being less or more powerful than the actual production environment).
When run in a virtualized or containerized CI environment, such tests are prone to severe measurement distortions due to concurrent load of other applications and jobs.</p>
<p>This post introduces the <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/jfrunit">JfrUnit</a> open-source project, which offers a fresh angle to this topic by supporting assertions not on metrics like latency/throughput themselves, but on <em>indirect metrics</em> which may impact those.
JfrUnit allows you define expected values for metrics such as memory allocation, database I/O, or number of executed SQL statements, for a given workload and asserts the actual metrics values — which are obtained from <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328">JDK Flight Recorder</a> events — against these expected values.
Starting off from a defined base line, future failures of such assertions are an indicator for potential performance regressions in an application, as a code change may have introduced higher GC pressure,
the retrieval of unneccessary data from the database, or SQL problems commonly induced by ORM tools, like N+1 SELECT statements.</p>
<p>JfrUnit provides means of identifying and analyzing such anomalies in a reliable, environment independent way in standard JUnit tests,
before they manifest as actual performance regressions in production.
Test results are independent from wall clock time and thus provide actionable information, also when not testing with production-like hardware and data volumes.</p>
<p>This post is a bit longer than usual (I didn’t have the time to write shorter ;), but it’s broken down into several sections,
so you can pause and continue later on with fresh energy:</p>

<div>
<h2 id="_getting_started_with_jfrunit">Getting Started With JfrUnit</h2>
<div>
<p>JfrUnit is an extension for <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/">JUnit 5</a> which integrates Flight Recorder into unit tests;
it makes it straight forward to initiate a JFR recording for a given set of event types,
execute some test routine, and then assert the JFR events which should have been produced.</p>
<p>Here is a basic example of a JfrUnit test:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java"><span>@JfrEventTest</span> <i data-value="1"></i><b>(1)</b>
<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>JfrUnitTest</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>System</span><span>.</span><span>gc</span><span>();</span>
    <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>sleep</span><span>(</span><span>1000</span><span>);</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><i data-value="5"></i><b>5</b></td>
<td><code>JfrEvents#ofType()</code> allows to filter on specific event types, enabling arbitrary assertions against the returned stream of <code>RecordedEvent</code>s</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>By means of a custom <code>assertThat()</code> matcher method for <a href="https://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/">AssertJ</a>,
JfrUnit allows to validate that specific JFR events are raised during at test.
Events to be matched are described via their event type name, and optionally one more event attribute vaues.
As we’ll see in a bit, JfrUnit also integrates nicely with the Java Stream API,
allowing you to filter and aggregate recorded event atribute values and match them against expected values.</p>
<p>JfrUnit persists a JFR recording file for each test method,
which you can examine after a test failure,
for instance using <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jmc/">JDK Mission Control</a>.
To learn more about JfrUnit and its capabilities, take a look at the project’s <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/jfrunit">README</a>.
The project is in an early proof-of-concept stage at the moment,
so changes to its APIs and semantics are likely.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve taken the JfrUnit quick tour, let’s put that knowledge into practice.
Our example project will be the <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/jfr-custom-events">Todo Manager</a> Quarkus application you may already be familiar with from my <a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/rest-api-monitoring-with-custom-jdk-flight-recorder-events/">earlier post</a> about custom JFR events.
We’re going to discuss two examples for using JfrUnit to identify potential performance regressions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_case_study_1_spotting_increased_memory_allocation">Case Study 1: Spotting Increased Memory Allocation</h2>
<div>
<p>At first, let’s explore how to identify increased memory allocation rates.
Typically, it’s mostly library and middleware authors who are interested in this.
For a library such as Hibernate ORM it can make a huge difference whether a method that is invoked many times on a hot code path allocates a few objects more or less.
Less object allocations mean less work for the garbage collector,
which in turn means those precious CPU cores of your machine can spend more cycles processing your actual business logic.</p>
<p>But also for application developers it can be beneficial to keep an eye on — and systematically track — object allocations,
as regressions there lead to increased GC pressure,
and in turn eventually to higher latencies and reduced throughput.</p>
<p>The key for tracking object allocations with JFR are the <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB</code> and <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationOutsideTLAB</code> events,
which are emitted when</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an object allocation triggered the creation of a new thread-local allocation buffer (TLAB)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an object got allocated outside of the thread’s TLAB</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td>
<p>Thread-local allocation buffers (TLAB)</p>
<p>When creating new object instances on the heap,
this primarily happens via <em>thread-local allocation buffers</em>.
A TLAB is a pre-allocated memory block that’s exclusively used by a single thread.
Since this space is exclusively owned by the thread, creating new objects within a TLAB can happen without costly synchronization with other threads.
Once a thread’s current TLAB capacity is about to be exceeded by a new object allocation,
a new TLAB will be allocated for that thread.
In addition, large objects will typically need to be directly allocated outside of the more efficient TLAB space.</p>
<p>To learn more about TLAB allocation, refer to  <a href="https://shipilev.net/jvm/anatomy-quarks/4-tlab-allocation/">part #4</a> of Aleksey Shipilёv’s "JVM Anatomy Quark" blog series.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Note these events don’t allow for tracking of each individual object allocation,
as multiple objects will be allocated within a TLAB before a new one is required, and thus the <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB</code> event will be emitted.
But as that event exposes the size of the new TLAB, we can keep track of the overall amount of memory that’s allocated while the application is running.</p>
<p>In that sense, <code>jdk.ObjectAllocationInNewTLAB</code> represents a sampling of object allocations,
which means we need to collect a reasonable number of events to identify those locations in the program which are the sources of high object allocation and thus frequently trigger new TLAB creations.</p>
<p>So let’s start and work on a test for spotting regressions in terms of object allocations of one of the Todo Manager app’s API methods, <code>GET /todo/{id}</code>.
To identify a baseline of the allocation to be expected,
we first invoke that method in a loop and print out the actual allocation values.
This should happen in intervals, e.g. every 10,000 invocations,
so to average out numbers from individual API calls.</p>

<p>Not everyone understands how open source is made. I received the following email from NASA a while ago.</p>



<h2>Subject: Curl Country of Origin and NDAA Compliance</h2>



<blockquote><p>Hello, my name is [deleted] and I am a Supply Chain Risk Management Analyst at NASA. As such, I ensure that all NASA acquisitions of Covered Articles comply with Section 208 of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, Public Law 116-94, enacted December 20, 2019. To do so, the Country of Origin (CoO) information must be obtained from the company that develops, produces, manufactures, or assembles the product(s). To do so, please provide an email response or a formal document (a PDF on company letterhead is preferred, but a simple statement is sufficient) specifically identifying the country, or countries, in which Curl <strong>is developed and maintained</strong></p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>If the country of origin is outside the United States, please provide any information you may have stating that testing is performed in the United States prior to supplying products to customers. Additionally, if available, please identify all authorized resellers of the product in question.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Lastly, please confirm that Curl <strong>is not developed by, contain components developed by</strong>, or receive substantial influence from entities prohibited by Section 889 of the 2019 NDAA. These entities include the following companies and any of their subsidiaries or affiliates:</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Hytera Communications Corporation<br>Huawei Technologies Company<br>ZTE Corporation<br>Dahua Technology Company<br>Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Company</p><p>Finally, we have a time frame of 5 days for a response.<br>Thank you,</p></blockquote>



<h2>My answer</h2>



<p>Okay, I first considered going with strong sarcasm in my reply due to the complete lack of understanding, and the implied threat in that last line. What would happen if I wouldn’t respond in time?</p>



<p>Then it struck me that this could be my chance to once and for all get a confirmation if curl is already actually used in space or not. So I went with informative and a friendly tone.</p>



<blockquote><p>Hi [name],</p><p>I will answer to these questions below to the best of my ability, and maybe you can answer something for me?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>curl (https://curl.se) is an open source project that creates two products, curl the command line tool and libcurl the library. I am the founder, lead developer and core maintainer of the project. To this date, I have done about 57% of the 26,000 changes in the source code repository. The remaining 43% have been done by 841 different volunteers and contributors from all over the world. Their names can be extracted from our git repository: https://github.com/curl/curl</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>You can also see that I own most, but not all, copyrights in the project.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>I am a citizen of Sweden and I’ve been a citizen of Sweden during the entire time I’ve done all and any work on curl. The remaining 841 co-authors are from all over the world, but primarily from western European countries and the US. You could probably say that we live primarily “on the Internet” and not in any particular country.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>We don’t have resellers. I work for an American company (wolfSSL) where we do curl support for customers world-wide.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Our testing is done universally and is not bound to any specific country or region. We test our code substantially before release.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Me knowingly, we do not have any components or code authored by people at any of the mentioned companies.</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>So finally my question: can you tell me anything about where or for what you use curl? Is it used in anything in space?</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Regards,<br>Daniel</p></blockquote>



<h2>Used in space?</h2>



<p>Of course my attempt was completely in vain and the answer back was very brief and it just said…</p>

All applications have been tested on FreeBSD but should run on other Unix-like
operating systems as well.</p>

<h2 id="3dpong">3D Pong</h2>
<p><img src="https://cyber.dabamos.de/unix/x11/3dpong.gif" alt="3dpong" height="610" width="590"></p><p><a href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/3dpong/index2.php3">3D Pong</a>
is three-dimensional version of the first arcade game, “Pong”, for the X Window
System.</p>
<pre><code># pkg install games/3dpong</code></pre>
<p>To play against the computer, run:</p>
<pre><code>$ 3dpong :0 --computer --sound</code></pre>

<h2 id="angband">Angband</h2>
<p><img src="https://cyber.dabamos.de/unix/x11/angband.gif" alt="angband" height="368" width="652"></p><p>A roguelike game derived from Moria, based loosely on the books of
J.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;R.  Tolkien. The ultimate aim of the game is to advance in
skill and strength, collecting better and more powerful magical items until you
are ready to face the Master of the dungeon: Morgoth himself! Start the
X11 mode with <code>angband -mx11</code>.</p>
<pre><code># pkg install games/angband</code></pre>

<h2 id="battalion">Battalion</h2>
<p><img src="https://cyber.dabamos.de/unix/x11/battalion.gif" alt="battalion" height="530" width="650"></p><p>Battalion is a 3D game from 1994, originally written for the Silicon Graphics
Indy UNIX workstation. The player controls a monster to blow up a city. The
author dedicated a
<a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/aej/AndyBattalion.html">website</a> to the
game.</p>

<p>Depending on the perspective, the controls are a little awkward. You may
want to change the camera with key <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>,
<code>3</code>, or <code>4</code>. Use the mouse to rotate and to move
forward/backward. The arrow keys only work if the mouse cursor is placed in the
center of the screen. Shoot with the left control key or the left mouse button,
and tilt the head with <code>A</code> and <code>Z</code> to target helicopters
and jets. The camera can be rotated with <code>I</code>, <code>J</code>,
<code>K</code>, and <code>L</code>. Alter the rendering details with
<code>D</code>. Press <code>G</code> to grab the mouse cursor and
<code>P</code> to pause the game.</p>

<p>I made a quick &amp; dirty
<a href="https://cyber.dabamos.de/unix/x11/battalion1.4b-freebsd.tar.gz">FreeBSD port</a> based on the Linux

Its unsustainable growth strategy destroyed billions in shareholder value. Has WeWork finally hit rock bottom, or is it a falling knife?&nbsp;</p><p>We don’t have a crystal ball, but based on the work we have done, we believe WeWork has most of the pieces in place for a powerful turnaround.</p><p>In January 2019, WeWork was valued at $47B, making it the second-largest private company at the time, 15x the price of its closest competitor. After its failed IPO at the end of 2019, it nosedived to $7.3B. In March 2020, just as offices around the world were closing amid the coronavirus outbreak, SoftBank refused to participate in a $3B tender offer of early employee shares. The valuation of WeWork fell all the way to $2.9B, down 94% from its peak.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><em>WeWork’s rise from startup to $47B company took 9 years—its fall back down to $2.9B took just over 1.</em></p><p>The private markets have gone from euphoria to disillusion with WeWork. The company was downgraded again by credit rating agency Fitch in October 2020, and its cash burn through the year so far is estimated to be above $1.6B.</p><p>Our research shows that after all the recent changes, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We aggregated public data, analyzed financial data, talked to real estate brokers, developers, industry experts and built a model.&nbsp;</p><p>We can scoff at WeWork’s one-page long community adjusted EBITDA, but the company has been undergoing a reorganization towards profitability.&nbsp;</p><p>Key decisions include rightsizing their real estate portfolio, exiting 66 unprofitable leases, effecting a favorable shift in customer mix shift with 60% revenue now coming from enterprises, reducing the size of the workforce from 14,000 to 5,000 and hiring a new management team.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to WeWork’s internal efforts, the most unexpected tailwind is that the global experiment of remote working that we’ve seen during COVID may give rise to a structurally more flexible and distributed workforce in the near future. Ironically, the economic downturn many thought would sink WeWork may become the very cause of its survival.&nbsp;</p><p>A capital-light strategy is also on the horizon (a genuine one this time). Once the dust settles, WeWork could leverage its existing business and office management services and transform itself into a franchise provider.</p><div>

    <h2 id="wework-s-road-to-redemption--">WeWork’s road to redemption&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><strong>Our DCF model gives WeWork a valuation of $3.5B.</strong> At this price, WeWork equity resembles a call option, with limited downside but asymmetric upside.</li><li><strong>The site economics behind WeWork's core business are surprisingly positive. </strong>24 months after opening, the average WeWork location can generate a 20% contribution margin, compared with economics from more stable peers. A big reason for WeWork’s cash burn was its lack of mature locations. In 2019, WeWork had the biggest flexible workspace footprint, but the lowest % of mature sites, comparing with its profit-making peers.</li><li><strong>WeWork has become much more prudent in new location openings.</strong> Mature locations are expected to grow to 50% by the end of 2020 and reach 100% in 2022.</li><li><strong>WeWork has spent 2020 stabilizing its core operations</strong> with 4 key measures.</li><li><strong>60% of WeWork's customers are now enterprises.</strong> During the pandemic, WeWork leased 3.5 million square feet to enterprise clients, including TikTok, Mastercard, Microsoft, Citigroup and Deloitte.</li><li><strong>WeWork's new CEO is a real estate veteran.</strong> The current CEO is a disciplined operator with successful turnaround experience.</li><li><strong>WeWork has rightsized its real estate portfolio.</strong> We estimate WeWork has exited 66 locations and amended about 150 leases, driving higher average occupancy and margins across their portfolio.</li><li><strong>WeWork has cut costs.</strong> WeWork has shrunk its workforce by 60% and cut many experimental growth projects, such as WeLive, WeGrow and self-driving chairs. Operating expenses are trending down significantly, from 86% of revenue in 2018 to an estimated 50% in 2019.</li><li><strong>Market dynamics are changing.</strong> Post-COVID, 80% of people want to return to the office a few days a week but keep the benefit of flexibility. Ironically, the downturn many thought would sink WeWork may become the very cause of its survival.</li><li><strong>WeWork is quietly transitioning to an integrated, tech-enabled ecosystem coordinator.</strong> Despite the large cost-cutting, WeWork continues to invest in community services, aka, the "killer app". For example, WeWork Labs is a community digital platform. It provides cross-sector incubator services to support companies to acquire skills, meet peers and experts.</li><li><strong>WeWork could reshape the real estate stack. </strong>It could leverage its physical locations and build a tech-enabled layer on top, thereby, transform into a middleware to connect people and optimize spaces.</li></ul><h2 id="valuation--wework-is-worth--3-5b">Valuation: WeWork is worth $3.5B</h2><p>Our base case discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model implies a 2021 forward equity value of $3.5B for WeWork.&nbsp;</p><p>WeWork still has the shape of a distressed company. The capital structure is heavily indebted and equity is at the bottom of the pecking order. Nevertheless, the equity resembles the asymmetric risk/reward profile of an out of the money call option.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, given the current financial and operating dynamics of the company, for every one unit of enterprise value increase, the upside is amplified for the equity holders.&nbsp;</p><p>For anyone to stand behind WeWork now, however, they must be comfortable with a lot of macro uncertainties related to GDP, unemployment, speed of returning to the office and the opportunities around what the future of workspace would look like.&nbsp;</p><p>If WeWork can stabilize their operations in the near term through delayed capital spending, improved occupancy and regained focus, there could be a meaningful upside.</p><p>We highlight the structure of our model below.&nbsp;</p><p>Our aim with our model is to capture WeWork’s key growth and cost drivers to have a sense of the company’s profit-making potential. We used company disclosures from 2019 and turnaround guidance to form the base case assumptions. Our model calculates enterprise value by subtracting net debt and capitalized operating leases to derive equity value.&nbsp;</p><p>We can summarize our DCF into three distinct phases:</p><ul><li>Phase 1: 2020 - 2024 turnaround and stabilization.&nbsp;</li><li>Phase 2: 2025 - 2030 disciplined growth in the core business, expansion in franchise model and other business services.&nbsp;</li><li>Phase 3: 2031+ steady-state growth at 2%, with the overall occupancy to remain at 90%.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We disaggregate revenue into total workstations, total memberships and average revenue per member (“ARPM”) to derive occupancy rates. We also build a CapEx profile based on cost per workstation to calculate location level contribution margin (WeWork defines contribution margin as membership revenue minus location operating expenses before headquarter administrative costs, growth expenses, marketing and stock-based compensation).&nbsp;</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/sacra/40c25e89-a189-4840-9598-e31e51bb39f4_Screen+Shot+2020-12-17+at+16.39.31.png?auto=compress,format"><p><em>WeWork's revenue drivers. </em></p><p>WeWork doubled its total workstations between 2016 and 2019. As a result, mature locations accounted for only c.30% of the overall portfolio. To preserve cash and streamline operations, the pace of expansion has slowed significantly. The base case assumes total workstations to grow at 5% p.a. to reach 1.2M by 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>We illustrate our key revenue and cost assumptions below.&nbsp;</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born in Austria on July 30, 1947. Famously, he reached stratospheric levels of notoriety and success in three wholly distinct professional fields: bodybuilding, acting, and politics, culminating in his eight years as the Governor of California.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For the past 73 years, Schwarzenegger has gone by Arnold, Ahnuld, Governator, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger">Austrian Oak</a>, Terminator, Running Man, and dozens of other nicknames. In part because he’s charismatic and there’s nicknames aplomb to describe him, sure.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>But also because his last name is hard to spell. Like, really hard.</strong> We would know, because Water Cooler Trivia participants have spelled Schwarzenegger 255 different ways. And we’ve dug deep to explore that data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>255 different spellings. <a href="https://www.watercoolertrivia.com/blog/feature-emojis"><strong>We don’t grade responses based on spellings</strong></a>, so these are the spellings we’ve accepted as correct. We’ve got the full list of them at the end of this article, but we wanted to dig deeper into the data<br></p><h2>First things first: here’s the trivia question<br></h2><blockquote><strong>“What is the name of the Austrian bodybuilder who has been Mr. Universe three times and Mr. Olympia seven times?”</strong><br></blockquote><p>The answer, as you’ve surely guessed by now, is Arnold Schwarzenegger. We first wrote this question in April 2019, and since then…</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>3,019 different participants</strong> across 306 different groups have submitted a response</li><li><strong>2,681</strong> (89%) of folks got the question correct</li><li><strong>1,616</strong> (60%) of correct responses were spelled correctly [editor’s note: we suspect phone and browser autocorrect software lent a helping hand here]</li><li><strong>255</strong> different spellings of Schwarzenegger during that time<br></li></ul><p>And now, let’s look at the different ways in which Schwarzenegger has been spelled by Water Cooler Trivia participants.&nbsp;</p><h2>1. What are the most common misspellings?</h2><p>When you remove the correct spelling, you are left with 1,060 participants who spelled Schwarzenegger in 254 different ways.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The most common misspelling is to simply add a <strong>T </strong>after the <strong>R</strong>, a.k.a <strong>Schwartzenegger</strong>. This makes sense, as Schwartz itself is a fairly common German surname. 116 different respondents, 4% of all correct responses, spelled Arnold’s surname with that bonus <strong>T.</strong><br></p><p>Next up was <strong>Schwarzeneger</strong>, which removes a letter rather than adding one, this time removing one of the two <strong>G</strong>s. Again, this matches intuition.

Wait, how many letters is it?</h2><p>It’s 14 letters. S-c-h-w-a-r-z-e-n-e-g-g-e-r.

So it starts with an S... then a C… then...</h2><p>Schwarzenegger starts with the letter S. That’s fairly obvious. In fact, of the 255 distinct spellings that accepted as correct, 100% of them started with the letter <strong>S</strong>. However, once you move on to the second letter, <strong>only 58% of the spellings had C as the second letter.</strong><br></p><p>Unsurprisingly, the share of “correct” letters in terms of positions descends as you get further in the word, with a few noticeable deviations: interestingly, misspellings tend to correctly guess that the 11th letter is a <strong>G</strong> and the 14th letter is an <strong>R</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><figure id="w-node-3153958d4ef7-e7177fda"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5fdbffcf6ef4066cb3b8bc5a_SVo29XaQjA6jKuUkHuTPk1t2s967m2NoVPJrmpRPCGKe3Hrzg40C8kdhQvOqWkjw_BH_8noZ2ds0YGXkppq-B22DsD0PZ6auFQTHvSlEjpjzYw7r1Htdz5sFgWl7oAdN6pVAGp-6.png" alt=""></p></figure><h4>Double Letters</h4><p>On that topic, Schwarzenegger has a double letter in it: two G’s as the 11th and 12th letter. This was a common source of misspellings, as 1<strong>47 of the distinct spellings (58%) guessed that there was only one G</strong> in the politician’s surname.<br></p><h4>Edit Distance</h4><p>Known as edit distance or Levenshtein distance, this is a measure of how many changes you need to make to a word or phrase in order to translate it into another word or phrase. <strong>So “bake” has a distance of one from “cake” or “ake” or “baked”.</strong><br></p><p>When you search the internet for <strong>Girrafe</strong> and the search engine asks <strong><em>“Did you mean Giraffe?”</em></strong><em> </em>they are making that guess because your search query only had an edit distance of two from the more common query term <strong>Giraffe</strong>. One deletion (the first <strong>R</strong>) and one insertion (the second <strong>F</strong>) turns your query into the correct word.&nbsp;<br></p><p>So, basically, this is a way to see <strong><em>how bad </em></strong>certain spellings were. Or, more optimistically, how generous we at Water Cooler Trivia are as graders.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Okay, with all that prologue finished, here’s the edit distance stats for the 255 distinct spellings of Schwarzenegger. Note that we are only surfacing the 1,060 responses that were incorrectly spelled.&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>34% had an edit distance of only one</strong>!</li><li>And another 28% were only off by two characters!</li><li>18% of misspellings had an edit distance of at least four</li></ul><figure id="w-node-00b9f866edfc-e7177fda"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5eb9c1e4771ba53de5f5dbee/5fdbffcfee56eb8449ae2563_Qw6LyfdHxuw1-KuhsN3NFHyHzwr-1PnjCWoBqcc6pBTMNmr1DKqO-LmCkjcwMx-wn3K4inzJcTAnSOQCLQokxfe_psFkS6F8YkA4ohbuvw5kcvg7D9ApQtGulyfaG4kXCjRYgV-r.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>4. What does Schwarzenegger even mean?</h2><p>I was wondering that too. It turns out the name has Germanic roots, divided neatly into two terms.</p><ul role="list"><li>"schwarzen" means "black"</li><li>&nbsp;"egg" refers to a ridge<br></li></ul><p>So the Governator’s surname <strong>translates most literally into English as Black Ridge</strong>, which happens to be the name of a U.S. <a href="https://www.blackridge.us/"><strong>technology services company</strong></a>.</p><h2>Closing thoughts...</h2><p>Looking to learn about more commonly-misspelled names or commonly-mistaken knowledge?

<p><i></i> <b>Note:</b> This post is about <a href="https://pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a> who is now my employer. If you don’t want to hear about that, look away now.</p>
<p><i></i> <b>Note:</b> Some images have been redacted to protect the innocent</p>
<p>I can remember the exact moment I first realized I <em>didn’t</em> want to be a software developer. It was May 2009, and I was desperately trying to finish my final University project for the module “object-orientated Programming.”</p>
<p>My module tutor had tasked us with creating an application of our choosing in VB.NET. I can unapologetically say I didn’t enjoy the process. I preferred focusing on systems, understanding how things fit together. I was spending my days getting stuck in the minutiae of fixing bugs in my code.</p>
<p>My career progression from there followed a fairly traditional “System Administrator” path. I managed some Linux servers, the number grew, and I went headfirst into configuration management. As the DevOps movement came around, I embraced Kubernetes early and spent several years using cutting edge technologies in exciting ways. Despite telling myself in 2009 I didn’t want to be a software engineer, in 2020 I got my first “software engineer” title here at Pulumi, and now I’m lucky enough to spend my time writing code to program the cloud.</p>

<p><a href="https://pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a> is an exciting product, but what’s incredible to see working here is how the platform scales. All of the <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/cloud-providers/">Pulumi provider</a> SDKs get programmatically generated, which means that once support for a language gets added, all of the available providers will get that SDK generated. Adding a new language has significant engineering work up front, of course, but ongoing maintenance burden drops over time rather than increases.</p>
<p>In November 2019, Pulumi added support for the <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/blog/pulumi-dotnet-core/">.NET core languages</a>. We’ve seen significant adoption from the .NET community, and if you take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples">examples repo</a>, you’ll see dozens of examples of creating cloud infrastructure with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)">C#</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_Sharp_(programming_language)">F#</a>, the flagship languages of the .NET framework.</p>
<p>Of course, .NET core languages also include my trusty old friend VB.NET. I haven’t written a single line of VB.Net since I handed in my university project in 2009, and I have a vague recollection that I told myself that I never would again.</p>
<p>However, this is 2020. So I asked myself, what is the very last thing I would want to create with Pulumi in VB.NET. The answer is obvious, of course - Kubernetes resources.</p>

<p>In many ways, VB.NET and Kubernetes couldn’t be further apart. VB.NET, of old Microsoft - a language of “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/code-behind">code-behind</a>”, written for the era of monolithic desktop apps and windows forms and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, a complex distributed system written to be <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">cloud-native</a>.</p>
<p>With nostalgia in mind, I asked in our internal slack just how good our VB.NET support was. I quickly got a helpful answer from one of our <a href="https://twitter.com/mikhailshilkov">resident .NET experts</a> which can when summarized is along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It should work, but…why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer to that question in my mind was of course, because it’s 2020.
Our <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/templates/">Pulumi templates</a> (used to bootstrap new Pulumi projects) helpfully already had <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/templates/tree/master/aws-visualbasic">VisualBasic examples</a>. I imagine they’re lonely, because I couldn’t find a single record of them ever getting used.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping my new cloud VB.NET project, I could feel the old familiarity of hating being a software developer return to me. Shaking off the innate feeling, I set about doing the Pulumi equivalent of “Hello, world” - creating an S3 bucket in AWS.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>Imports</span> <span>Pulumi</span>
<span>Imports</span> <span>Pulumi.Aws.S3</span>

<span>Class</span> <span>MyStack</span>
    <span>Inherits</span> <span>Stack</span>

    <span>Public</span> <span>Sub</span> <span>New</span><span>()</span>
        <span>' Create an AWS resource (S3 Bucket)</span>
        <span>Dim</span> <span>bucket</span> <span>=</span> <span>New</span> <span>Bucket</span><span>(</span><span>"my-bucket"</span><span>)</span>

        <span>' Export the name of the bucket</span>
        <span>Me</span><span>.</span><span>BucketName</span> <span>=</span> <span>bucket</span><span>.</span><span>Id</span>
    <span>End</span> <span>Sub</span>

    <span>&lt;</span><span>Output</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>Public</span> <span>Property</span> <span>BucketName</span> <span>As</span> <span>Output</span><span>(</span><span>Of</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span>
<span>End</span> <span>Class</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I sort of hoped it would fail. VB.Net is 19 years old. Surely it has no place provisioning AWS resources?</p>
<p>I had some difficulty familiarizing myself with the syntax, but after yelling at my IDE a couple times, I finally managed to get my S3 bucket created.</p>
<p>At this point, I decided to antagonize the internet and rehash a meme from earlier in the year:</p>
<p><img src="http://leebriggs.co.uk/img/vb-net-tweet-1.png" alt="Meme"></p>
<p>The responses I received weren’t surprising:</p>
<p><img src="http://leebriggs.co.uk/img/vb-net-tweet-2.png" alt="Twitter"></p>
<p>Undeterred, I went for broke. Adding the Kubernetes provider and building out the required resources to deploy to an already provisioned EKS cluster was easier than I expected. I actually started to feel like the syntax of VB.net felt oddly suited to the task. It looks…. good?</p>

<p>I shared what I’d done with some of the Slack communities I frequent:</p>
<p><img src="http://leebriggs.co.uk/img/vb-net-slack-1.png" alt="Slack"></p>
<p>I knew what I was doing was a little controversial, but I wasn’t ready for this:</p>
<p><img src="http://leebriggs.co.uk/img/vb-net-slack-2.png" alt="Slack"></p>
<p>I felt defensive all of a sudden. Was I starting to feel defensive of VB.NET?</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href="https://twitter.com/funcOfJoe/">the CEO of Pulumi</a>, a man who knows a thing or two about programming languages saw my example code and saw the beauty of what I’d done:</p>
<p><img src="http://leebriggs.co.uk/img/vb-net-twitter-3.png" alt="Joe"></p>
<p>Not everyone saw the inner-beauty:</p>
<p><img src="http://leebriggs.co.uk/img/vb-net-email-1.png" alt="Email"></p>
<p>You can see this incredible collaboration of old and new here:</p>
<p><a href="https://asciinema.org/a/Uq17k64ym5x4tl2aLmTFRg3i0"><img src="https://asciinema.org/a/Uq17k64ym5x4tl2aLmTFRg3i0.svg" alt="asciicast"></a></p>
<p>The full code, if you’d like to see it, is <a href="https://github.com/jaxxstorm/eks-vb-net">here</a></p>
<p>If you’d ask me what I learned from this experience, I’d be honest and say - nothing. Do I really believe VB.NET is the future of cloud engineering? No. It’s not. I’m unlikely to recommend to Pulumi customers that they break out Visual Studio and write some VB.NET, but we know the options is there if they ever want to use it.</p>
<p>I’ve gone on record before to talk about how much I <a href="http://leebriggs.co.uk/blog/2020/12/16/2019-02-07-why-are-we-templating-yaml.md">loathe templating YAML</a> and I love the expressibility Pulumi gives me with familiar programming languages. Even though I hated VB.NET in university, I would still prefer to express my cloud resources with a 19-year-old programming language over a configuration language with template replacement.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p><time datetime="2020-11-15">November 15, 2020</time></p><p>Do you ever come across a technology or concept and say to yourself, "This is insane, how can anyone understand this?". If so, this essay may help you to answer that question; how do people understand extremely complex concepts?</p><p>Central Processing Units (CPUs) are a particularly bewildering piece of technology. These 2 inch squares of silicon are the brains behind a computer, a machine capable of solving all solvable problems given enough time and resources.</p><p><img src="https://www.apple.com/v/mac/m1/a/images/overview/chip__fffqz3ljssi2_large.jpg" alt="https://www.apple.com/v/mac/m1/a/images/overview/chip__fffqz3ljssi2_large.jpg"></p><p>Apple's new M1 chip</p><p>"The people who make CPUs must have superhuman intellect" I think to myself. This may be true to an extent, chip makers and CPU designers are very bright, however their domain expertise is likely isolated to an extremely specific component of the CPU. It is important when analyzing any complex concept to acknowledge all of its components. In the case of a CPU, there are thousands of components built on top of each-other.</p><p>Don't be disheartened if a concept appears incomprehensible at first glance, it may very well be incomprehensible to those who created it, particularly when that concept is at the bleeding edge of technology. How can a CPU designer design a CPU without understanding all of its inner workings? The same way an architect designs a house without understanding the details of construction, and the same way a software developer uses an API without understanding its implementation details. Complex technologies and concepts are not the result of omniscient individuals, but rather layers of knowledge, built upon, and composed of one-another. The authors of these layers of knowledge are the specialists, who have spent years mastering the knowledge associated with their layer. The mental model for understanding these layers, and the central topic of this essay, is&nbsp;<strong>Knowledge APIs</strong></p><blockquote><p>Knowledge API: A mental model for thinking about the understanding of a specific domain as an Application Programming Interface (API). Knowledge APIs depend on, and can be used by one-another. A knowledge API is like a module in a programming language, it depends on (imports) other knowledge APIs, and can be used by (exported) other knowledge APIs. - Chris Behan</p></blockquote><p>To illustrate the idea of a knowledge API, let's use CPUs as an example. Suppose one of the knowledge APIs used in CPU production is dedicated to the etching of microscopic lines into silicon. An example function from this API would be:</p><pre><code><span>//MicroscopicLaserEtchingAPI</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>EtchMicroscopicLineIntoSilicon</span><span>(</span><span>startPos</span><span>,</span><span> endPos</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>// Code instructing laser to etch microscopic line from startPos to endPos</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>The group of people responsible for the implementation of&nbsp;<code>EtchMicroscopicLineIntoSilicon</code>&nbsp;understand how it works. They know all about the optics of the laser, and how to manipulate its exact position. They know the physical properties of the silicon chip, and how it reacts when it comes in contact with the laser. But they do <strong>not</strong> know how others will use this function. They have no insight into how the lines they produce may be composed to represent logic gates. That is where the next layer of the Knowledge API comes into play; the group responsible for composing the lines into logical structures. This layer of the knowledge API (Let's call them the Logical Structures API) has functions like:</p><pre><code><span>//LogicalStructuresAPI</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>EtchMicroscopicLineIntoSilicon</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"MicroscopicLaserEtchingAPI"</span><span>;</span><span>
</span>
<span></span><span>function</span><span> </span><span>CreateANDGate</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> xPos </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>CalculateANDGateXPos</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// function within this knowledge API</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> yPos </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>CalculateANDGateYPos</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// function within this knowledge API</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>EtchMicroscopicLineIntoSilicon</span><span>(</span><span>xPos</span><span>,</span><span> yPos</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>The people in this layer are dedicated to composing the logical structures that make up the CPU. They do not understand the implementation details of the layer below them, such as how a microscopic laser is able to precisely engrave nano-meter thick lines into silicon. They must trust and use functions from the&nbsp;<code>MicroscopicLaserEthcingAPI</code>. The authors of the&nbsp;<code>LogicalStructuresAPI</code>&nbsp;depend on the correctness of the&nbsp;<code>MicroscopicLaserEtchingAPI</code>, in this case, that&nbsp;<code>EtchMicroscopicLineIntoSillicon</code>&nbsp;really does etch a line into the silicon chip, at precisely the location specified. Trust between layers is a requirement of knowledge APIs. If a knowledge API does not do exactly what it says, and that knowledge API is used by another knowledge API, incorrect behaviour will be introduced to the system.</p><p>The process of knowledge APIs built on-top of one-another continues for hundreds (sometimes thousands) of layers, producing results that to the untrained eye appear magical. But there is no magic, just layers of abstractions masterfully crafted by experts of that knowledge API. Sometimes individuals, through years of hard work and deliberate practice, are able to understand and master multiple knowledge APIs, but no one understands all of them. Similar to how no-one alive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/2vy8g1/who_was_the_last_person_to_know_all_of_mathematics/">knows all of mathematics</a>, no-one alive understands all the knowledge APIs that compose CPU production, or almost any other moderately complex field.</p><p>Every domain can be thought of in terms of the composition of knowledge APIs. An example that deviates from the more analytical examples given thus far would be the knowledge APIs of Basketball. Basketball players must learn the knowledge APIs of shooting, ball-handling and defending, each of which is composed of lower-level APIs, like free-throws, cross-over, and steal, to name a few. At an even lower level, basketball can be thought of as depending on the knowledge APIs of nutrition, and neuroplasticity that your brain undergoes through practice. Breaking down your current domain of interest into layers of knowledge APIs is a useful tool for introspection and evaluating what you need to improve on. Setting goals like "I need to get better at basketball" is shallow and hard to work with. But breaking down basketball into its various knowledge APIs and evaluating which of those you need to improve upon can yield much more tangible goals: "I need to increase the speed of my cross-over and improve my help-defense".</p><p>Experiment with different knowledge APIs, invest time into finding one that interests you, then start working towards mastery with that knowledge API. Don't be disheartened by the fact that you don't understand the implementation details of your knowledge API's dependencies, no-one does.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Keller_(engineer)">Jim Keller</a>&nbsp;co-authored the design of the x86-64 CPU architecture without understanding the implementation details of how the CPU is actually manufactured. The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo_brothers">Russo brothers</a>&nbsp;directed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marvel.com/movies/avengers-infinity-war">Infinity War</a>&nbsp;without understanding the implementation details of VFX, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khabib_Nurmagomedov">Khabib Nurmagomedov</a>&nbsp;had one of the most dominant careers in mma history without understanding the implementation details of nutrition or the neuroplasticity of training.</p><p>Knowledge APIs exist in every domain. Thinking about knowledge as an API, and accepting that APIs can be useful without understanding their implementation details, or the implementation details of their dependencies, can be a reassuring call to action.</p><p>I hope this essay has added a useful mental model to your intellectual toolbox. 🧠 🧰</p></article></div></div>]]>
